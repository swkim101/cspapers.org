The Differential privacy overview of Apple states, “Apple retains the collected data for a maximum of three months.” Analysis on recent data is formalized by the sliding window model. This begs the question: what is the price of privacy in the sliding window model. In this paper, we study heavy hitters in the sliding window model with window size w. Previous works of Chan et al. (2012) estimates heavy hitters incur an error of order ✓w for a constant ✓ > 0. In this paper, we give an efficient differentially private algorithm to estimate heavy hitters in the sliding window model with e O(w3/4) additive error and using e O( p w) space.
