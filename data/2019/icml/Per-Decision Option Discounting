Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among males in the United States, and there is lack of consensus as to whether active surveillance or radical prostatectomy is the best course of treatment. In this study, we examined the role of numeracy, time discounting, and risk taking on decision-making about prostate cancer treatment—in 279 men over age 50 without a prior prostate cancer diagnosis. Results showed that active surveillance was the most chosen option and its preference was predicted by numeracy and time discounting. However, radical prostatectomy was significantly predicted by participants’ propensity to take risks.
