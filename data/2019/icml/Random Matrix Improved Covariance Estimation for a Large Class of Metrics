Relying on recent advances in statistical estimation of covariance distances based on random matrix theory, this article proposes an improved covariance and precision matrix estimation method for a wide family of metrics. This method is shown to largely outperform the sample covariance matrix estimate and to compete with state-of-the-art methods, while at the same time being computationally simpler and faster. Applications to linear and quadratic discriminant analyses also show significant gains, therefore suggesting a practical relevance for statistical machine learning.
