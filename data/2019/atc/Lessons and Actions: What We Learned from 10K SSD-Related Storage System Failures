Modern datacenters increasingly use flash-based solid state
        drives (SSDs) for high performance and low energy cost.
        However, SSD introduces more complex failure modes compared to
        traditional hard disk. While great efforts have been made to
        understand the reliability of SSD itself, it remains unclear
        what types of system level failures are related to SSD, what
        are the root causes, and how the rest of the system interacts
        with SSD and contributes to failures. Answering these
        questions can help practitioners build and maintain
        highly reliable SSD-based storage systems.        In this paper, we study the reliability of SSD-based storage
        systems deployed in Alibaba Cloud, which cover near half
        a million SSDs and span over three years of usage under
        representative cloud services. We take a holistic view to
        analyze both device errors and system failures to better
        understand the potential casual relations. Particularly, we
        focus on failures that are Reported As
        "SSD-Related" (RASR) by system
        status monitoring daemons.
        Through log analysis, field studies, and validation
        experiments, we identify the characteristics of RASR failures
        in terms of their distribution, symptoms, and correlations.
        Moreover, we derive a number of major lessons and a set of
        effective methods to address the issues observed. We believe
        that our study and experience would be beneficial to the
        community and could facilitate building highly-reliable
        SSD-based storage systems.
