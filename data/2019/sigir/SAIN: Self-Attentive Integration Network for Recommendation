With the growing importance of personalized recommendation, numerous recommendation models have been proposed recently. Among them, Matrix Factorization (MF) based models are the most widely used in the recommendation field due to their high performance. However, MF based models suffer from cold start problems where user-item interactions are sparse. To deal with this problem, content based recommendation models which use the auxiliary attributes of users and items have been proposed. Since these models use auxiliary attributes, they are effective in cold start settings. However, most of the proposed models are either unable to capture complex feature interactions or not properly designed to combine user-item feedback information with content information. In this paper, we propose Self-Attentive Integration Network (SAIN) which is a model that effectively combines user-item feedback information and auxiliary information for recommendation task. In SAIN, a self-attention mechanism is used in the feature-level interaction layer to effectively consider interactions between multiple features, while the information integration layer adaptively combines content and feedback information. The experimental results on two public datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models by 2.13%
