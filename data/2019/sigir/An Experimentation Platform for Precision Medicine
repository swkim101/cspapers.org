Precision medicine - where data from patients, their genes, their lifestyles and the available treatments and their combination are taken into account for finding a suitable treatment - requires searching the biomedical literature and other resources such as clinical trials with the patients' information. The retrieved information could then be used in curating data for clinicians for decision-making. We present information retrieval researchers with an on-line system which enables experimentation in search for precision medicine within the framework provided by the TREC Precision Medicine (PM) track. A number of query and document processing and ranking approaches are provided. These include some ofthe most promising gene mention expansion methods, as well as learning-to-rank using neural networks.
