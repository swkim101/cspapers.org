The spread of misinformation online is a challenge that may have an impact on society by misleading and undermining the trust of people in domains such as politics or public health. While fact-checking is one way to identify misinformation, it is a slow process and requires significant effort. Improving the efficiency of fact-checking by automating parts of the process or defining new processes to validate claims is a challenging task with a need for expertise from multiple disciplines. The aim of ROME 2019 is to bring together researchers from various fields such as Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Semantic Web and Complex Networks to discuss these problems and define new directions in the area of automated fact-checking.
