The tutorial is based on our long-term research on open domain conversation, rich hands-on experience on development of Microsoft XiaoIce, and our previous tutorials on EMNLP 2018 and the Web Conference 2019. It starts from a summary of recent achievement made by both academia and industry on chatbots, and then performs a thorough and systematic introduction to state-of-the-art methods for open domain conversation modeling including both retrieval-based methods and generation-based methods. In addition to these, the tutorial also covers some new progress on both groups of methods, such as transition from model design to model learning, transition from knowledge agnostic conversation to knowledge aware conversation, and transition from single-modal conversation to multi-modal conversation. The tutorial is ended by some promising future directions such as how to combine non-task-oriented dialogue systems with task-oriented dialogue systems and how to enhance language learning with chatbots.
