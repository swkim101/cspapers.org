RDF datasets are becoming increasingly useful with the development of knowledge-based web applications. SPARQL is the official structured query language to search and access RDF datasets. Despite its effectiveness, the language is often difficult to use for non-experts because of its syntax and the necessity to know the underlying data structure of the database queries. In this regard, keyword search enables non-expert users to access the data contained in RDF datasets intuitively. This work describes the TSA+VDP keyword search system for effective and efficient keyword search over large RDF datasets. The system is compared with other state-of-the-art methods on different datasets, both real-world and synthetic, using a new evaluation framework that is easily reproducible and sharable.
