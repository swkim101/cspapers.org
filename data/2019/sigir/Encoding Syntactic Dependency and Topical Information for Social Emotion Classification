Social emotion classification is to estimate the distribution of readers' emotion evoked by an article. In this paper, we design a new neural network model by encoding sentence syntactic dependency and document topical information into the document representation. We first use a dependency embedded recursive neural network to learn syntactic features for each sentence, and then use a gated recurrent unit to transform the sentences' vectors into a document vector. We also use a multi-layer perceptron to encode the topical information of a document into a topic vector. Finally, a gate layer is used to compose the document representation from the gated summation of the document vector and the topic vector. Experiment results on two public datasets indicate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of better average Pearson correlation coefficient and MicroF1 performance.
