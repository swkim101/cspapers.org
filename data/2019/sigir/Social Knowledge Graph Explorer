We present SKG Explorer, an application for querying and browsing a social knowledge graph derived from Twitter that contains relationships between entities, links, and topics. A temporal dimension is also added for generating timelines for well-known events that allows the construction of stories in a wiki-like style. In this paper we describe the main components of the system and showcase some examples.
