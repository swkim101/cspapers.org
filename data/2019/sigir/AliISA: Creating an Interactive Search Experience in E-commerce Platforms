Online shopping has been a habit of more and more people, while most users are unable to craft an informative query, and thus it often takes a long search session to satisfy their purchase intents. We present AliISA - a shopping assistant which offers users some tips to further specify their queries during a search session. With such an interactive search, users tend to find targeted items with fewer page requests, which often means a better user experience. Currently, AliISA assists tens of millions of users per day, earns more usage than existing systems, and consequently brings in a 5% improvement in CVR. In this paper, we present our system, describe the underlying techniques, and discuss our experience in stabilizing reinforcement learning under an E-commerce environment.
