Several recent task-based search studies aim at splitting query logs into sets of queries for the same task or information need. We address the natural next step: mapping a currently submitted query to an appropriate task in an already task-split log. This query-task mapping can, for instance, enhance query suggestions---rendering efficiency of the mapping, besides accuracy, a key objective. Our main contributions are three large benchmark datasets and preliminary experiments with four query-task mapping approaches: (1) a Trie-based approach, (2) MinHash~LSH, (3) word movers distance in a Word2Vec setup, and (4) an inverted index-based approach. The experiments show that the fast and accurate inverted index-based method forms a strong baseline.
