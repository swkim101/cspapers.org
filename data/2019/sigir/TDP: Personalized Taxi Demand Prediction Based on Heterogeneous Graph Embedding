Predicting users' irregular trips in a short term period is one of the crucial tasks in the intelligent transportation system. With the prediction, the taxi requesting services, such as Didi Chuxing in China, can manage the transportation resources to offer better services. There are several different transportation scenes, such as commuting scene and entertainment scene. The origin and the destination of entertainment scene are more unsure than that of commuting scene, so both origin and destination should be predicted. Moreover, users' trips on Didi platform is only a part of their real life, so these transportation data are only few weak samples. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Taxi Demand Prediction (TDP) model in challenging entertainment scene based on heterogeneous graph embedding and deep neural predicting network. TDP aims to predict next possible trip edges that have not appeared in historical data for each user in entertainment scene. Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that TDP achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.
