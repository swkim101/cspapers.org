Given the growing significance of network performance, it is crucial to examine how to make the most of available network options and protocols. We propose ECON, a model that predicts performance of applications under different protocols and network conditions to scalably make better network choices. ECON is built on an analytical framework to predict TCP performance, and uses the TCP model as a building block for predicting application performance. ECON infers a relationship between loss and congestion using empirical data that drives an online model to predict TCP performance. ECON then builds on the TCP model to predict latency and HTTP performance. Across four wired and one wireless network, our model outperforms seven alternative TCP models. We demonstrate how ECON (i) can be used by a Web server application to choose between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 for a given Web page and network condition, and (ii) can be used by a video application to choose the optimal bitrate that maximizes video quality without rebuffering.
