This work describes the development of a robotic system that acquires knowledge incrementally through human interaction where new objects and motions are taught on the fly. The robotic system developed was one of the five finalists in the KUKA Innovation Award competition and demonstrated during the Hanover Messe 2018 in Germany. The main contributions of the system are i) a novel incremental object learning module - a deep learning based localization and recognition system - that allows a human to teach new objects to the robot, ii) an intuitive user interface for specifying 3D motion task associated with the new object, and iii) a hybrid force-vision control module for performing compliant motion on an unstructured surface. This paper describes the implementation and integration of the main modules of the system and summarizes the lessons learned from the competition.
