Standardized evaluation measures have aided in the progress of machine learning approaches in disciplines such as computer vision and machine translation. In this paper, we make the case that robotic learning would also benefit from benchmarking, and present a template for a vision-based manipulation benchmark. Our benchmark is built on “REPLAB,” a reproducible and self-contained hardware stack (robot arm, camera, and workspace) that costs about 2000 USD and occupies a cuboid of size 70x40x60 cm. Each REPLAB cell may be assembled within a few hours. Through this low-cost, compact design, REPLAB aims to drive wide participation by lowering the barrier to entry into robotics and to enable easy scaling to many robots. We envision REPLAB as a framework for reproducible research across manipulation tasks, and as a step in this direction, we define a grasping benchmark consisting of a task definition, evaluation protocol, performance measures, and a dataset of over 50,000 grasp attempts. We implement, evaluate, and analyze several previously proposed grasping approaches to establish baselines for this benchmark.
