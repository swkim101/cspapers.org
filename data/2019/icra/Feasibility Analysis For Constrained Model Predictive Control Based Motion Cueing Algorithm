This paper deals with motion control for an 8degree-of-freedom (DOF) high performance driving simulator. We formulate a constrained optimal control that defines the dynamical behavior of the system. Furthermore, the paper brings together various methodologies for addressing feasibility issues arising in implicit model predictive control-based motion cueing algorithms. The implementation of different techniques is described and discussed subsequently. Several simulations are carried out in the simulator platform. It is observed that the only technique that can provide ensured closed-loop stability by assuring feasibility over all prediction horizons is a braking law that basically saturates the control inputs in the constrained form.
