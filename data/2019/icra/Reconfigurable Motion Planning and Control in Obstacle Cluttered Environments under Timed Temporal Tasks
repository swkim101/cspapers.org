This work addresses the problem of robot navigation under timed temporal specifications in workspaces cluttered with obstacles. We propose a hybrid control strategy that guarantees the accomplishment of a high-level specification expressed as a timed temporal logic formula, while preserving safety (i.e., obstacle avoidance) of the system. In particular, we utilize a motion controller that achieves safe navigation inside the workspace in predetermined time, thus allowing us to abstract the motion of the agent as a finite timed transition system among certain regions of interest. Next, we employ standard formal verification and convex optimization techniques to derive high-level timed plans that satisfy the agentâ€™s specifications. A simulation study illustrates and clarifies the proposed scheme.
