In this paper the problem of contact-based navigation path planning for aerial robots is considered with the goal of enabling the autonomous in-contact operation on surfaces that can be highly anomalous. Such a capacity can prove critical in inspection through contact missions, as well as when a flying robot is tasked to operate in very narrow environments rendering safe free-flight impossible. To achieve this objective, beyond sliding in contact, a new locomotion primitive is introduced, namely that of azimuth rotations perpendicular to the surface under consideration. This new navigation mode, called flying cartwheel mode, offers navigation resourcefulness and resilience when the system is tasked to move in contact with surfaces that are otherwise non-traversable. The designed path planning method exploits both navigation modalities and a traversability metric to decide when to switch from sliding to flying cartwheel mode, and overall provides cost-optimal trajectories for in-contact navigation. The proposed approach is verified both in simulation, as well as experimentally using a surface presenting complex anomalies. It is highlighted that the proposed method does not assume any specialized contact mechanism or a control law tailored to physical interaction tasks, and hence is applicable to almost any micro aerial vehicle integrating protective shrouds around its propellers.
