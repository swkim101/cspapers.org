Humanoid robots typically display locomotion patterns that include walking with flat foot-ground contact, and knees slightly bent. However, analysis of human gait indicate that several physiological mechanisms like stretched knees, heel-strike and toe push-off increase the step length and energetic efficiency of locomotion. This paper presents an implementation of two of those mechanisms, namely stretched knees and push-off, on a quasi-static whole-body balancing controller. The influence of such mechanisms on the kinematic capabilities of the DLR humanoid robot TORO is analyzed in different experiments, and their benefits are thoroughly discussed. As a result, the energetic savings of balancing with stretched knees are shown to be of reduced magnitude with respect to the overall power consumption of the robot, and the ability of TORO for negotiating stairs is greatly enhanced.
