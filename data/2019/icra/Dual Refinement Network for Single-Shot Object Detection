Object detection methods fall into two categories, i.e., two-stage and single-stage detectors. The former is characterized by high detection accuracy while the latter usually has a considerable inference speed. Hence, it is imperative to fuse their merits for a better accuracy vs. speed trade-off. To this end, we propose a dual refinement network (DRN) to boost the performance of the single-stage detector. Inheriting from the advantages of two-stage approaches (i.e., two-step regression and accurate features for detection), anchor refinement and feature offset refinement are conducted in a novel anchor-offset detection, where the detection head is comprised of deformable convolutions. Moreover, to leverage contextual information for describing objects, we design a multi-deformable head, in which multiple detection paths with different receptive field sizes devote themselves to detecting objects. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and ImageNet VID datasets are conducted, and we achieve a state-of-the-art detection performance in terms of both accuracy and inference speed.
