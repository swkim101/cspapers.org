—In this paper we present a ﬂexible low-cost sonar sensor platform that can be used for a wide range of biomimetic sonar experiments and autonomous sonar navigation targeted at robotics applications. The navigation abilities of bats using ultrasound (sonar) in unknown cluttered environments are very effective and can be distilled into a sensor architecture and accompanying control methodology that lends itself to be implemented on cost efﬁcient hardware. The sensor architecture and processing methodology of this sensing platform mimics that of bats. In this paper we speciﬁcally focused on the common big-eared bat ( Micronycteris microtis ) although this could be transferred to other bat species or even other echolocating animals since the experimental platform was designed for ﬂexi-bility. Using this platform we were able to implement a control system using a subsumption architecture that features different behavior patterns based solely on the sonar sensor as a source of exteroceptive information. In order to validate the combination of our autonomous navigation control system and our developed sonar sensor platform, the hardware was mounted on the P3DX robotics platform that was introduced in an unknown testing environment and have it drive autonomously. These experiments were used to validate our assumption of the efﬁcacy of these relatively simple biomimetic control mechanisms and thus alleviating the need for expensive sensing platforms for certain robotics applications.
