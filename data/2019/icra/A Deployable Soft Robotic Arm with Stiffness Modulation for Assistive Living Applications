This paper presents a three-tendon actuated continuum robot with an origami backbone to assist the elderly and physically impaired individuals in performing activities of daily living. The proposed design solution is an inherently safe and cost-effective alternative to current assistive robots. The origami backbone based on a variation of the Yoshimura pattern provides controlled deployment of the robot and enables length variation (15 cm â€“ 56 cm) in order to increase the reachable workspace. A pneumatic stiffness mechanism was implemented, increasing the weight bearing capabilities of the continuum robot to 500 g. This new stiffness modulation approach was assessed with the use of several testing rigs. Additionally, the robot is joypad controlled and is easily transportable due to its high packing efficiency of 73% and light weight of 1.3 kg for the main body (including the actuation system). For demonstration of usability studies, the robot was successfully tested at a simulated kitchen terminal and also performed pick and place tasks.
