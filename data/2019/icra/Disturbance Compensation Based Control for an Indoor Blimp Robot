This paper presents design of a robust controller with disturbance compensation for an indoor blimp robot and its realization. The movement of blimp in horizontal plane is modeled as a slider-like nonlinear system complemented with uncertain bounded disturbances. To design the output feedback controller, a homogeneous differentiator is used as an observer. Then the method for disturbance evaluation is designed, the perturbation estimate is next used in the controller for cancellation of the influence of exogenous disturbances. Control scheme is implemented on a concrete blimp, finally, the performance of blimp disturbance compensation based controller is verified in experiments.
