Extensive testing of IoT SW is very important to prevent errors and security vulnerabilities. In the SW domain the automated concolic testing technique has been shown very effective.In this paper we propose an approach for concolic testing of binaries targeting RISC-V systems with peripherals. Our approach works by integrating the Concolic Testing Engine (CTE) with the architecture specific Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) inside of a Virtual Prototype (VP). We provide a designated CTE-interface to integrate (SystemCbased) peripherals into the concolic testing by means of SW models. This combination enables a high simulation performance at binary level with comparatively little effort to integrate peripherals with concolic execution capabilities. Our approach has been effective in finding several buffer overflow related security vulnerabilities in the FreeRTOS TCP/IP stack.
