The emergence of hardware accelerators has brought about several orders of magnitude improvement in the speed of the deep neural-network (DNN) inference. Among such DNN accelerators, Google Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) has transpired to be the best-in-class, offering more than $15 \times$ speedup over the contemporary GPUs. However, the rapid growth in several DNN workloads conspires to escalate the energy consumptions of the TPU-based data-centers. In order to restrict the energy consumption of TPUs, we propose GreenTPU--- a low-power near-threshold (NTC) TPU design paradigm. To ensure a high inference accuracy at a low-voltage operation, GreenTPU identifies the patterns in the error-causing activation sequences in the systolic array, and prevents further timing errors from the same sequence by intermittently boosting the operating voltage of the specific multiplier-andaccumulator units in the TPU. Compared to a cutting-edge timing error mitigation technique for TPUs, GreenTPU enables 2X -3X higher performance in an NTC TPU, with a minimal loss in the prediction accuracy.
