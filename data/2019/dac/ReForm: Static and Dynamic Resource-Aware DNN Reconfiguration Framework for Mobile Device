Although the Deep Neural Network (DNN) technique has been widely applied in various applications, the DNN-based applications are still too computationally intensive for the resource-constrained mobile devices. Many works have been proposed to optimize the DNN computation performance, but most of them are limited in an algorithmic perspective, ignoring certain computing issues in practical deployment. To achieve the comprehensive DNN performance enhancement in practice, the expected DNN optimization works should closely cooperate with specific hardware and system constraints (i.e. computation capacity, energy cost, memory occupancy, and inference latency). Therefore, in this work, we propose ReForm-a resource-aware DNN optimization framework. Through thorough mobile DNN computing analysis and innovative model reconfiguration schemes (i.e. ADMM based static model fine-tuning, dynamically selective computing), ReForm can efficiently and effectively recon Figure a pre-trained DNN model for practical mobile deployment with regards to various static and dynamic computation resource constraints. Experiments show that ReForm has $\sim 3.5\times$ faster optimization speed than state-of-the-art resource-aware optimization method. Also, ReForm can effective recon Figure a DNN model to different mobile devices with distinct resource constraints. Moreover, ReForm achieves satisfying computation cost reduction with ignorable accuracy drop in both static and dynamic computing scenarios (at most 18% workload, 16.23% latency, 48.63% memory, and 21.5% energy enhancement).
