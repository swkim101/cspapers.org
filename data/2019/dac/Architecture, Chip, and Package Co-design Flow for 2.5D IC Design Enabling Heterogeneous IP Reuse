A new trend in complex SoC design is chiplet-based IP reuse using 2.5D integration. In this paper we present a highly-integrated design flow that encompasses architecture, circuit, and package to build and simulate heterogeneous 2.5D designs. We chipletize each IP by adding logical protocol translators and physical interface modules. These chiplets are placed/routed on a silicon interposer next. Our package models are then used to calculate PPA and signal/power integrity of the overall system. Our design space exploration study using our tool flow shows that 2.5D integration incurs 2.1x PPA overhead compared with 2D SoC counterpart.
