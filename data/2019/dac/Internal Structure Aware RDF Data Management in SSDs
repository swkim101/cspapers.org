In this paper, we lead the first efforts towards intelligent RDF data management in SSDs. We propose to deeply fuse the RDF data in SSDs. In detail, the operations (e.g., data query) applied to RDF can be directly achieved in SSDs. To this end, we explore two RDF data organizations (e.g., triple-based) with the consideration of the internal structure of SSDs. The experiment is conducted on the Patient Disease Drug (PDD) Graph dataset [11]. The experimental results show that the proposed two strategies achieve the comprehensive, scalable in-SSD computation from different aspects (e.g., space efficiency or query efficiency).
