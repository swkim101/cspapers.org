Approximate computing has gained a lot of popularity due to its energy benefits in a variety of error-tolerant applications. In this paper we are proposing an adder which can perform n-bit single exact addition or dual approximate addition (SEDA), and is suitable for processors. The conversion from exact to approximate addition can be dynamically done at runtime. The maximum error is bounded for SEDA adders as carry is not approximated. Our proposed design consumes 48% lesser energy, has 32% lesser delay, occupies 24% lesser area as compared to exact mirror adder.
