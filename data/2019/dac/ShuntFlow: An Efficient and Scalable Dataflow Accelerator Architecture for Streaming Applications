Streaming processing is an important and growing class of applications for analyzing continuous streams of real time data. Slidingwindow aggregations (SWAGs) dominate the computation time in such applications and dictate an unprecedented computation capacity which poses a great challenge to the computing architectures. General-purpose processors cannot efficiently handle SWAGs because of the specific computation patterns. This paper proposes an efficient accelerator architecture for ubiquitous SWAGs, called ShuntFlow. ShuntFlow is a typical type of Kernel Processing Unit (KPU) where “Kernel” represent two main categories of SWAG operations widely used in streaming processing. Meanwhile, we propose a shunt rule to enable ShuntFlow to efficiently handle SWAGs with arbitrary parameters. As a case study, we implemented ShuntFlow on an Altera Arria 10 AX115N FPGA board at 150 MHz and compared it to previous approaches. The experimental results show that ShuntFlow provides a tremendous throughput and latency advantage over CPU and GPU implementations on both reduce-like and index-like SWAGs.
