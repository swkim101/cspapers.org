In the era of advancing technology, increasing circuit complexity requires faster simulators for the verification step. The piece-wise linear simulation approach provides an efficient and accurate solution. In this paper, a state-of-the-art mixed-signal simulator is explained. The approach is extended to new exponential and quadratic stimuli. This requires a comprehensive derivation of mathematical equations, which remove the need for computationally expensive evaluation. The new stimuli are simulated in several circuits and compared to a conventional simulator. The result shows significant run-time acceleration with high accuracy. Therefore, it meets the industrial requirement, which demands simulation with various input forms and non-linear components.
