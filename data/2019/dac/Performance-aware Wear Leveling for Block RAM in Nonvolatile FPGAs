Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been widely adopted in both high-performance servers and embedded systems. Since static random access memory (SRAM) has limited density and comparatively high leakage power, researchers have proposed FPGA architectures based on emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs) to satisfy the requirements of data-intensive and low-power applications. Block RAM is on-chip memory of FPGAs, when it is implemented with NVM, it will face the challenge of limited endurance. Traditional wear leveling strategy cannot be directly applied to block RAM because it may induce large performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a performance-aware wear leveling scheme for block RAM in FPGAs to improve its lifetime. The placement strategy is improved by injecting wear leveling guidance. The evaluation shows that 29.75% lifetime enhancement is achieved with 16.32% performance improvement at the same time, compared with traditional wear leveling.
