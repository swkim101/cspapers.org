A lightweight method applies a few extraction patterns to the task of distinguishing Wikipedia articles that are classes ("Walled garden", "Garden") from other articles ("High Hazels Park"). The method acquires a set of classes, based on patterns targeting phrases that likely refer to either concepts being introduced or defined ("a *walled garden* is a garden [..]"); or to concepts used to introduce or define other concepts ("a walled garden is a *garden* [..]"). Experimental results over multiple evaluation sets are better, when relying on defined phrases alone vs. defining phrases alone; and further improved, when combining complementary evidence from both.
