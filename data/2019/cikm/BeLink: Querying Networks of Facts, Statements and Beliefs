An important class of journalistic fact-checking scenarios involves verifying the claims and knowledge of different actors at different moments in time. Claims may be about facts, or about other claims, leading to chains of hearsay. We have recently proposed a data model for (time-anchored) facts, statements and beliefs. It builds upon the W3C's RDF standard for Linked Open Data to describe connections between agents and their statements, and to trace information propagation as agents communicate. We propose to demonstrate BeLink, a prototype capable of storing such interconnected corpora, and answer powerful queries over them relying on SPARQL 1.1. The demo will showcase the exploration of a rich real-data corpus built from Twitter and mainstream media, and interconnected through extraction of statements with their sources, time, and topics.
