Display advertising is a billion dollar business which is the primary income of many companies. In this scenario, real-time bidding optimization is one of the most important problems, where the bids of ads for each impression are determined by an intelligent policy such that some global key performance indicators are optimized. Due to the highly dynamic bidding environment, many recent works try to use reinforcement learning algorithms to train the bidding agents. However, as the probability of the occurrence of a particular state is typically low and the state representation in current work lacks sequential information, the convergence speed and performance of deep reinforcement algorithms are disappointing. To tackle these two challenges in the real-time bidding scenario, we propose ClusterA3C, a novel Advantage Asynchronous Actor-Critic (A3C) variant integrated with a sequential information extraction scheme and a clustering based state aggregation scheme. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the proposed scheme on a real-world commercial dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state of the art methods in terms of either performance or convergence speed.
