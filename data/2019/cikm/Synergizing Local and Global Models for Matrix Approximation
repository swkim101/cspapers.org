Ensemble matrix approximation (MA) methods have achieved promising performance in collaborative filtering, many of which perform matrix approximation on multiple submatrices of user-item ratings in parallel and then combine the predictions from the sub-models for higher efficiency. However, data partitioning could lead to suboptimal accuracy due to the lack of capturing structural information related to most or all users/items. This paper proposes a new ensemble learning framework, in which the local models and global models are synergetically updated from each other. This makes it possible to capture both local associations in user-item subgroups and global structures over all users and items. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms six state-of-the-art methods in recommendation accuracy with decent scalability.
