Graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search has attracted more and more attentions due to its online search advantages. Numbers of methods studying the enhancement of speed and recall have been put forward. However, few of them focus on the efficiency and scale of offline graph-construction. For a deployed visual search system with several billions of online images in total, building a billion-scale offline graph in hours is essential, which is almost unachievable by most existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Binary Distributed Graph to solve this problem. Specifically, we combine binary codes with graph structure to speedup both offline and online procedures, and achieve comparable performance with the ones that use real-value features, by recalling and reranking more binary candidates. Furthermore, the graph-construction is optimized to completely distributed implementation, which significantly accelerates the offline process and gets rid of the limitation of single machine, such as memory and storage. Experimental comparisons on Alibaba Commodity Data Set (more than three billion images) show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art with respect to the online/offline trade-off.
