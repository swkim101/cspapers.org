Convolution on graphs has aroused great interest in AI due to its potential applications to non-gridded data. To bypass the influence of ordering and different node degrees, the summation/average diffusion/aggregation is often imposed on local receptive field in most prior works. However, the collapsing into one node in this way tends to cause signal entanglements of nodes, which would result in a sub-optimal feature and decrease the discriminability of nodes. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a simple but effective Hashing Graph Convolution (HGC) method by using global-hashing and local-projection on node aggregation for the task of node classification. In contrast to the conventional aggregation with a full collision, the hash-projection can greatly reduce the collision probability during gathering neighbor nodes. Another incidental effect of hash-projection is that the receptive field of each node is normalized into a common-size bucket space, which not only staves off the trouble of different-size neighbors and their order but also makes a graph convolution run like the standard shape-gridded convolution. Considering the few training samples, also, we introduce a prediction-consistent regularization term into HGC to constrain the score consistency of unlabeled nodes in the graph. HGC is evaluated on both transductive and inductive experimental settings and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all datasets for node classification task. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of hash-projection.
