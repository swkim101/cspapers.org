The focused retrieval task is to rank documents' passages by their presumed relevance to a query. Inspired by work on cluster-based document retrieval, we present a novel cluster-based focused retrieval method. The method is based on ranking clusters of similar passages using a learning-to-rank approach and transforming the cluster ranking to passage ranking. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the clear merits of the method.
