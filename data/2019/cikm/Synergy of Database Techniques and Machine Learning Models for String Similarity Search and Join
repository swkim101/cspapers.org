String data is ubiquitous and string similarity search and join are critical to the applications of information retrieval, data integration, data cleaning, and also big data analytics. To support these operations, many techniques in the database and machine learning areas have been proposed independently. More precisely, in the database research area, there are techniques based on the filtering-and-verification framework that can not only achieve a high performance, but also provide guaranteed quality of results for given similarity functions. In the machine learning research area, string similarity processing is modeled as a problem of identifying similar text records; Specifically, the deep learning approaches use embedding techniques that map text to a low-dimensional continuous vector space. In this tutorial, we review a number of studies of string similarity search and join in these two research areas. We divide the studies in each area into different categories. For each category, we provide a comprehensive review of the relevant works, and present the details of these solutions. We conclude this tutorial by pinpointing promising directions for future work to combine techniques in these two areas.
