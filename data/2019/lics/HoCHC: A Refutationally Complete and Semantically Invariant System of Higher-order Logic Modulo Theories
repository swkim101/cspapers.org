We present a simple resolution proof system for higher-order constrained Horn clauses (HoCHC)-a system of higher-order logic modulo theories-and prove its soundness and refutational completeness w.r.t. both standard and Henkin semantics. As corollaries, we obtain the compactness theorem and semi-decidability of HoCHC for semi-decidable background theories, and we prove that HoCHC satisfies a canonical model property. Moreover a variant of the well-known translation from higher-order to 1st-order logic is shown to be sound and complete for HoCHC in both semantics. We illustrate how to transfer decidability results for (fragments of) 1st-order logic modulo theories to our higher-order setting, using as example the Bernays-Schonflukel-Ramsey fragment of HoCHC modulo a restricted form of Linear Integer Arithmetic.
