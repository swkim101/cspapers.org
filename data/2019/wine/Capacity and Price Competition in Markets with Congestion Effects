We study oligopolistic competition in service markets where firms offer a service to customers. The service quality of a firm - from the perspective of a customer - depends on the congestion and the charged price. A firm can set a price for the service offered and additionally decides on the service capacity in order to mitigate congestion. The total profit of a firm is derived from the gained revenue minus the capacity investment cost. Firms simultaneously set capacities and prices in order to maximize their profit and customers subsequently choose the services with lowest combined cost (congestion and price). For this basic model, Johari et al. (2010) derived the first existence and uniqueness results of pure Nash equilibria (PNE) assuming mild conditions on congestion functions. Their existence proof relies on Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and a key assumption for the theorem to work is that demand for service is elastic (modeled by a smooth and strictly decreasing inverse demand function). 
In this paper, we consider the case of perfectly inelastic demand, i.e. there is a fixed volume of customers requesting service. This scenario applies to realistic cases where customers are not willing to drop out of the market, e.g. if prices are regulated by reasonable price caps. We investigate existence, uniqueness and quality of PNE for models with inelastic demand and price caps. We show that for linear congestion cost functions, there exists a PNE. This result requires a completely new proof approach compared to previous approaches, since the best response correspondences of firms may be empty, thus standard fixed-point arguments are not directly applicable. We show that the game is C-secure (see McLennan et al. (2011)), which leads to the existence of PNE. We furthermore show that the PNE is unique, and that the efficiency compared to a social optimum is unbounded in general.
