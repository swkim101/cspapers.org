Light as a medium for sensing and communication enables new scenarios, such as controlling devices with gestures, or communication for Internet of Things~(IoT) devices. However, a limitation of existing systems is that they often sense only a narrow part of the light spectrum. We argue that the ability to sense a broad light spectrum significantly enhances ability of such systems expanding possible application scenarios. We demonstrate our work in progress to develop the concept of polymorphic light sensing~(PLS). PLS sensor morphs itself according to applications requirements, to track desired parts of the light spectrum (colours, infrared, and ultraviolet light). We couple the PLS sensor with ultra-low power backscatter mechanism, and demonstrate this enables us to sense and communicate the broad spectrum, while operating battery-free.
