We present Reeboc that combines machine learning and k-means clustering to analyze the conversation of a chat, extract different emotions or topics of the conversation, and recommend emojis that represent various contexts to the user. Instead of simply analyzing a single input sentence, we consider recent sentences exchanged in a conversation. we performed a user study with 17 participants in 8 groups in a realistic mobile chat environment. Participants spent the least amount of time in identifying and selecting the emojis of their choice with Reeboc (38% faster than without emoji recommendation).
