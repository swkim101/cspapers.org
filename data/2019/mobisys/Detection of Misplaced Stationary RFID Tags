A smart shelving system can visualize stock data in real time by leveraging item-level RFID tagging. The detection of misplaced tags on stationary shelved items is very challenging due to position ambiguity, phase wrapping, device diversity, and phase ambiguity. We propose an effective way of detecting misplaced tags, called FINDS, that requires neither antenna movement nor external disturbances.
