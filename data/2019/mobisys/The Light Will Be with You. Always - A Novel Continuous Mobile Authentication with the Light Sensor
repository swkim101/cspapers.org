Existing continuous authentication proposals tend to have two major drawbacks. First, touch-based smartphone authentication approaches typically require explicit user interactions with the smartphone to collect sufficient touch data. These approaches may provide an attacker the opportunity to steal a victim's sensitive data before the system detects the attacker's intrusion. Likewise, an attacker may disable the continuous authentication scheme itself before detection. Second, sensor-based continuous authentication approaches inherently suffer from high energy consumption due to the constant usage of multiple sensors. In this paper, we present a novel continuous authentication system that collects light sensor data from a user's smartphone and analyzes them to authenticate users using support vector machines. We focus on the possibility of collecting light sensor data from users' smartphones while they are conducting daily behaviors to develop an anomaly detection system.
