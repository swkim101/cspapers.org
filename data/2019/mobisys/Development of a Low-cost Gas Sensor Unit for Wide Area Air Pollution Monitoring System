In this paper, we discuss the development of a low cost sensor unit for the monitoring of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The developed sensor unit can operate at 267.21 mW and collect NO2 concentration, temperature, and relative humidity. The sensor unit was installed outdoors near a main road, for a 122 h experiment. The data collected from the sensor unit were stable. Further, the selected electrochemical NO2 sensor was effective, confirming that NO2 concentrations were high on weekdays (during heavy traffic) and low at night.
