With the explosive growth of large scale services, traditional mobile networks have become increasingly unable to guarantee the efficient operation of services. However in the fifth generation (5G), supported by Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network slicing technology [1] makes mobile networks more intelligent and flexible. 5G network slicing allows a set of logically independent virtual networks to be created on a common physical infrastructure and provides appropriate monitoring, management and resource allocation for a variety of different types of communication services [2].
