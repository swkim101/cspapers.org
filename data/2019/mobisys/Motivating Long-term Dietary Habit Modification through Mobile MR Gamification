In correlation with the socio-economic development, changes in people's lifestyle brought about significant impact on dietary patterns. Though public concerns over healthy eating are increasing, many are still uncertain when choosing a well balanced meal amid welter of information. In this paper, we propose "KomaFLens'', a mobile system and application built for Microsoft HoloLens, which aims to motivate long term dietary habit modification through gamification. The primary purpose of this research is to enhance the users' nutritional knowledge and to guide them to make healthier choices in their diet. Our preliminary evaluation revealed interesting points for discussion regarding the procedure for capturing food labels. Streamlining the operational method to boost tractability will improve the accuracy when recording food intakes.
