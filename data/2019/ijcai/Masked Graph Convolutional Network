Semi-supervised classification is a fundamental technology to process the structured and unstructured data in machine learning field. The traditional attribute-graph based semi-supervised classification methods propagate labels over the graph which is usually constructed from the data features, while the graph convolutional neural networks smooth the node attributes, i.e., propagate the attributes, over the real graph topology. In this paper, they are interpreted from the perspective of propagation, and accordingly categorized into symmetric and asymmetric propagation based methods. From the perspective of propagation, both the traditional and network based methods are propagating certain objects over the graph. However, different from the label propagation, the intuition ``the connected data samples tend to be similar in terms of the attributes", in attribute propagation is only partially valid. Therefore, a masked graph convolution network (Masked GCN) is proposed by only propagating a certain portion of the attributes to the neighbours according to a masking indicator, which is learned for each node by jointly considering the attribute distributions in local neighbourhoods and the impact on the classification results. Extensive experiments on transductive and inductive node classification tasks have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.
