Quantization has been an effective technology in ANN (approximate nearest neighbour) search due to its high accuracy and fast search speed. To meet the requirement of different applications, there is always a trade-off between retrieval accuracy and
speed, reflected by variable code lengths. However, to encode the dataset into different code lengths, existing methods need to train several models, where each model can only produce a specific code length. This incurs a considerable training time cost, and largely reduces the flexibility of quantization methods to be deployed in real applications. To address this issue, we propose a Deep Recurrent Quantization (DRQ) architecture which can generate sequential binary codes. To the end, when the
model is trained, a sequence of binary codes can be generated and the code length can be easily controlled by adjusting the number of recurrent iterations. A shared codebook and a scalar factor is designed to be the learnable weights in the deep recurrent quantization block, and the whole framework can be trained in an end-to-end manner. As far as we know, this is the first quantization method that can be trained once and generate sequential binary codes. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets show that our model achieves comparable or even better performance compared with the state-of-the-art for image retrieval. But it requires significantly less number of parameters and training times. Our code is published online: https://github.com/cfm-uestc/DRQ.
