Planning is the task of finding a sequence of actions that achieves the goal(s) of an agent. It is solved based on a model describing the environment and how to change it. There are several approaches to solve planning tasks, two of the most popular are classical planning and hierarchical planning. Solvers are often based on heuristic search, but especially regarding domain-independent heuristics, techniques in classical planning are more sophisticated. However, due to the different problem classes, it is difficult to use them in hierarchical planning. In this paper we describe how to use arbitrary classical heuristics in hierarchical planning and show that the resulting system outperforms the state of the art in hierarchical planning.
