Deep neural networks trained in an end-to-end fashion have brought about exceptional advances in computer vision, especially in computational perception. We go beyond perception and seek to enable vision modules to reason about perceived visual entities such as scenes, objects and actions. We introduce a challenging visual reasoning task, Image-Based Event Sequencing (IES) and compile the first IES dataset, Blocksworld Image Reasoning Dataset (BIRD). Motivated by the blocksworld concept, we propose a modular approach supported by literature in cognitive psychology and children's development. We decompose the problem into two stages - visual perception and event sequencing, and show that our approach can be extended to natural images without re-training.
