Hintikka's World is a graphical and pedagogical tool that shows how artificial agents can reason about higher-order knowledge. In this demonstration paper, we present the implementation of symbolic models in Hintikka's World. They enable the tool to scale, by helping it to face the state explosion, which makes it possible to provide examples featuring real card games, such as Hanabi.
