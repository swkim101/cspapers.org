A variety of machine learning applications expect to achieve rapid learning from a limited number of labeled data. However, the success of most current models is the result of heavy training on big data. Meta-learning addresses this problem by extracting common knowledge across different tasks that can be quickly adapted to new tasks. However, they do not fully explore weakly-supervised information, which is usually free or cheap to collect. In this paper, we show that weakly-labeled data can significantly improve the performance of meta-learning on few-shot classification. We propose prototype propagation network (PPN) trained on few-shot tasks together with data annotated by coarse-label. Given a category graph of the targeted fine-classes and some weakly-labeled coarse-classes, PPN learns an attention mechanism which propagates the prototype of one class to another on the graph, so that the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier defined on the propagated prototypes results in high accuracy across different few-shot tasks. The training tasks are generated by subgraph sampling, and the training objective is obtained by accumulating the level-wise classification loss on the subgraph. On two benchmarks, PPN significantly outperforms most recent few-shot learning methods in different settings, even when they are also allowed to train on weakly-labeled data.
