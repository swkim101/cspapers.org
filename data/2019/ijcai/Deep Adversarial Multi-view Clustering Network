Multi-view clustering has attracted increasing attention in recent years by exploiting common clustering structure across multiple views. Most existing multi-view clustering algorithms use shallow and linear embedding functions to learn the common structure of multi-view data. However, these methods cannot fully utilize the non-linear property of multi-view data, which is important to reveal complex cluster structure underlying multi-view data. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view clustering method, named Deep Adversarial Multi-view Clustering (DAMC) network, to learn the intrinsic structure embedded in multi-view data. Specifically, our model adopts deep auto-encoders to learn latent representations shared by multiple views, and meanwhile leverages adversarial training to further capture the data distribution and disentangle the latent space. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of art methods.
