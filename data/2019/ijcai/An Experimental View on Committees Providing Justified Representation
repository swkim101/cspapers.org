We provide an experimental study of committees that achieve (proportional/extended) justified representation (JR/PJR/EJR). In particular, we ask how many such committees exist and how varied they are in terms of voter satisfaction and coverage.  We find that under many natural distributions of preferences a large fraction of randomly selected JR committees also provide PJR and EJR.  Further, we find that the sets of JR committees for our elections are very varied and include both high-quality ones and not-so-appealing ones.
