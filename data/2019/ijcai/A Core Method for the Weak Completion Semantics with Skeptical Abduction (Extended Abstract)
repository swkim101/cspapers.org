The Weak Completion Semantics is a novel cognitive theory which has
 been successfully applied -- among others -- to the suppression
 task, the selection task and syllogistic reasoning. It is based on
 logic programming with skeptical abduction. Each weakly completed
 program admits a least model under the three-valued Lukasiewicz
 logic which can be computed as the least fixed point of an
 appropriate semantic operator. The operator can be represented by a
 three-layer feed-forward network using the Core method. Its least
 fixed point is the unique stable state of a recursive network which
 is obtained from the three-layer feed-forward core by mapping the
 activation of the output layer back to the input layer. The
 recursive network is embedded into a novel network to compute
 skeptical abduction. This extended abstract outlines a fully
 connectionist realization of the Weak Completion
 Semantics.
