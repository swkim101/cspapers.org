We study the approximation of a description logic (DL) ontology in a
less expressive DL, focusing on the case of Horn DLs. It is common
to construct such approximations in an ad hoc way in practice and
the resulting incompleteness is typically neither analyzed nor 
understood. In this paper, we show how to construct complete
approximations. These are typically infinite or of excessive size
and thus cannot be used directly in applications, but our results
provide an important theoretical foundation that enables informed
decisions when constructing incomplete approximations in practice.
