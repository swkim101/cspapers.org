This paper proposes an Online Intelligent Visual Interactive System (OIVIS), which can be applied to various live video broadcast and short video scenes to provide an interactive user experience. In the live video broadcast, the anchor can issue various commands by using pre-defined gestures, and can trigger real-time background replacement to create an immersive atmosphere. To support such dynamic interactivity, we implemented algorithms including real-time gesture recognition and real-time video portrait segmentation, developed a deep network inference framework, and a real-time rendering framework AI Gender at the front end to create a complete set of visual interaction solutions for use in resource constrained mobile.
