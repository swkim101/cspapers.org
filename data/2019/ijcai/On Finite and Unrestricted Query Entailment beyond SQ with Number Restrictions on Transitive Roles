We study the description logic SQ with number restrictions applicable to transitive roles, extended with either nominals or inverse roles. We show tight 2EXPTIME upper bounds for unrestricted entailment of regular path queries for both extensions and finite entailment of positive existential queries for nominals. For inverses, we establish 2EXPTIME-completeness for unrestricted and finite entailment of instance queries (the latter under restriction to a single, transitive role).
