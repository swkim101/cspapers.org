Increasing amounts of available data have led to a
heightened need for representing large-scale probabilistic knowledge bases. One approach is to
use a probabilistic database, a model with strong
assumptions that allow for efficiently answering
many interesting queries. Recent work on open-world probabilistic databases strengthens the semantics of these probabilistic databases by discarding the assumption that any information not present
in the data must be false. While intuitive, these
semantics are not sufficiently precise to give reasonable answers to queries. We propose overcoming these issues by using constraints to restrict this
open world. We provide an algorithm for one class
of queries, and establish a basic hardness result for
another. Finally, we propose an efficient and tight
approximation for a large class of queries.Â
