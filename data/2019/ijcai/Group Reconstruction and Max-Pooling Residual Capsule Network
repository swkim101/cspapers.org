In capsule networks, the mapping of low-level capsules to high-level capsules is achieved by a routing-by-agreement algorithm. Since the capsule is made up of collections of neurons and the routing mechanism involves all the capsules instead of simply discarding some of the neurons like Max-Pooling, the capsule network has stronger representation ability than the traditional neural network. However, considering too much low-level capsules' information will cause its corresponding upper layer capsules to be interfered by other irrelevant information or noise capsules. Therefore, the original capsule network does not perform well on complex data structure. What's worse, computational complexity becomes a bottleneck in dealing with large data networks. In order to solve these shortcomings, this paper proposes a group reconstruction and max-pooling residual capsule network (GRMR-CapsNet). We build a block in which all capsules are divided into different groups and perform group reconstruction routing algorithm to obtain the corresponding high-level capsules. Between the lower and higher layers, Capsule Max-Pooling is adopted to prevent overfitting. We conduct experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN datasets and the results show that our method can perform better against state-of-the-arts.
