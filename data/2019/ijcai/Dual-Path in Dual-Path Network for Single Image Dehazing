Recently, deep learning-based single image dehazing method has been a popular approach to tackle dehazing. However, the existing dehazing approaches are performed directly on the original hazy image, which easily results in image blurring and noise amplifying. To address this issue, the paper proposes a DPDP-Net (Dual-Path in Dual-Path network) framework by employing a hierarchical dual path network. Specifically, the first-level dual-path network consists of a Dehazing Network and a Denoising Network, where the Dehazing Network is responsible for haze removal in the structural layer, and the Denoising Network deals with noise in the textural layer, respectively. And the second-level dual-path network lies in the Dehazing Network, which has an AL-Net (Atmospheric Light Network) and a TM-Net (Transmission Map Network), respectively. Concretely, the AL-Net aims to train the non-uniform atmospheric light, while the TM-Net aims to train the transmission map that reflects the visibility of the image. The final dehazing image is obtained by nonlinearly fusing the output of the Denoising Network and the Dehazing Network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DPDP-Net achieves competitive performance against the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world images.
