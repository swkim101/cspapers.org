We present ISymb an incremental symbolic inference framework for probabilistic programs in situations when some loop-manipulated array data, upon which their probabilistic models are conditioned, undergoes small changes. To tackle the path explosion challenge, ISymb is intra-procedurally path-sensitive except that it conducts a “meet-over-all-paths” analysis within an iteration of a loop (conditioned on some observed array data). By recomputing only the probability distributions for the paths affected, ISymb avoids expensive symbolic inference from scratch while also being precision-preserving. Our evaluation with a set of existing benchmarks shows that ISymb can lead to orders of magnitude performance improvements compared to its non-incremental counterpart (under small changes in observed array data).
