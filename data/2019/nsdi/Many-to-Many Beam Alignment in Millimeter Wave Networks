— Millimeter Wave networks can deliver multi-Gbps wireless links that use extremely narrow directional beams. This provides us with a new opportunity to exploit spatial reuse where we can enable many wireless links to communicate in parallel in conﬁned spaces, without interfering with each other. Exploiting such spatial reuse, however, requires aligning the beams of all nodes in the network. Aligning the beams is a difﬁcult process which is complicated by indoor multipath, which can create interference, as well as by the inefﬁciency of interference detection schemes like carrier sense in directional networks. This paper presents BounceNet, the ﬁrst many-to-many millimeter wave beam alignment protocol that can exploit dense spatial reuse and can scale the wireless network throughput with the number of clients. Results from three millimeter wave testbeds show that BounceNet can scale the throughput with the number of clients to deliver a total network data rate of more than 39 Gbps for 10 clients, which is up to 6.6 × higher than current 802.11 mmWave standards.
