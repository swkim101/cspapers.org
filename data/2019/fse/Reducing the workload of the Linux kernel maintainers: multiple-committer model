With the increasing scale and complexity of software, the traditional development workflow may be inapplicable, which is harmful to the sustainable development of projects. In this study, we explored a new workflow â€” multiple-committer model that was applied by a subsystem of the Linux kernel to confront the heavy workload of the maintainers. We designed four dimensions of metrics toevaluate the model effect and found that this model conspicuouslyreduces the workload of the maintainers. We also obtained thecrucial factors for implementing this model.
