The way software is produced is very similar to an artistic and creative process. This fact is well known and has been acknowledged from the very early era of computers. Moreover, there are even further similarities between the software development process and painting. This similarity can consequently lead to the assumption that software engineers can utilise the knowledge the artists employ, since the people have created artistic works for centuries. This paper focuses on the following questions: what similarities exist between the software development process and painting, what artistic practices could be profitably transferred to software development, and, in particular, with reference to pair programming, how do artists paint together and is there something that could be learned by software developers and engineers. The uniqueness of the proposed approach lies in the exploration of the novel idea with the use of a complex way to examine the topic, and considering developers primarily as creative people, not ordinary industrial workers.
