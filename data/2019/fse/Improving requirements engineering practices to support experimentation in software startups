The importance of startups to economic development is indisputable. Software startups are startups that develop an innovative software-intensive product or service. In spite of the rising of several methodologies to improve their efficiency, most of software startups still fail. There are several possible reasons to failure including under or over-engineering the product because of not-suitable engineering practices, wasted resources, and missed market opportunities. The literature argues that experimentation is essential to innovation and entrepreneurship. Even though well-known startup development methodologies employ it, studies revealed that practitioners still do not use it. Given that requirements engineering is in between software engineering and business, in this study, I aim to improve these practices to foster experimentation in software startups. To achieve that, first I investigated how requirements engineering activities are performed in software startups. Then, my goal is to propose new requirements engineering practices to foster experimentation in this context.
