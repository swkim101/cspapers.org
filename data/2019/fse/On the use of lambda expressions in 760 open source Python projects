Lambdas as anonymous functions have gained significant prominence in programming languages such as Java, C++, Python and so on as developers tend to use them. With the dominant use of Python as backend language in many projects and large number of open source projects available, we set out to investigate the use of lambdas in Python projects and obtained 19 categories to classify lambda usages as preliminary results. Our study could help language designers to improve the state of the art libraries for lambda expressions and developers to use lambda expressions effectively.
