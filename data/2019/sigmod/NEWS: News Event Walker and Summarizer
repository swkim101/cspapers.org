Most news summarization techniques are static, and thus do not satisfy user needs in having summaries with specific structures or details. Meanwhile, existing dynamic techniques such as query-based summarization fail to handle content-independent queries that target the type of summary information such as time, location, reasons, and consequences of reported events. The NEWS system supports multi-granular summarization along two dimensions: the level of detail and type of information. The system employs fine-grained information extraction to extract facts and their facets with type tagging. The extracted information is then modeled as a graph used to create summaries. The system incrementally expands summaries based on the nodes visited by users, folding related events into the search space.
