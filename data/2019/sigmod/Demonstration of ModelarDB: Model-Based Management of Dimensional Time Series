Due to the big amounts of sensor data produced, it is infeasible to store all of the data points collected and practitioners currently hide outliers by storing simple aggregates instead. As a remedy, we demonstrate ModelarDB, a model-based Time Series Management System (TSMS) for time series with dimensions and possibly gaps. In this demonstration, participants can ingest data sets from multiple domains and experience how ModelarDB provides fast ingestion and a high compression ratio by adaptively compressing time series using a set of models to accommodate changes in the structure of each time series over time. Models approximate time series within a user-defined error bound (possibly zero). Participants can also experience how the compression ratio can be improved by ingesting correlated time series in groups created by ModelarDB from user-hints. Participants provide these using primitives for describing correlation. Last, participants can execute SQL queries on the ingested data sets and see how the system optimizes queries directly on models.
