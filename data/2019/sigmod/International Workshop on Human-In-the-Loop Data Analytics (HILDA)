The Human In the Loop Data Analytics (HILDA) workshop aims to foster interdisciplinary efforts that tackle important challenges in better supporting humans in the loop in the context of data-intensive computations, such as interactive data exploration, integration, analytics, and machine learning. Over the past several years, HILDA has brought together DB researchers interested in the distinctive ways that people impact data management tasks, as well as like-minded researchers in other communities, such as Information Visualization, Data Mining/Machine Learning, and HCI. The work presented at HILDA covers a broad range of topics, from algorithmic, interface, and system design to the user's cognitive, physical, and goal-seeking perspectives when managing and exploring data as well as notions of approximation/prediction. This year, we continued to encourage submissions for initial ideas and visions, early reports of work in progress, as well as reflections on completed projects.
