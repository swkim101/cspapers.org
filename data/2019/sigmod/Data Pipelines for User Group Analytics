User data is becoming increasingly available in various domains ranging from the social Web to electronic patient health records (EHRs). User data is characterized by a combination of demographics (e.g., age, gender, life status) and user actions (e.g., posting a tweet, following a diet). Domain experts rely on user data to conduct large-scale population studies. Information consumers, on the other hand, rely on user data for routine tasks such as finding a book club and getting advice from look-alike patients. User data analytics is usually based on identifying group-level behaviors such as "teenage females who watch Titanic" and "old male patients in Paris who suffer from Bronchitis." In this tutorial, we review data pipelines for User Group Analytics (UGA). These pipelines admit raw user data as input and return insights in the form of user groups. We review research on UGA pipelines and discuss approaches and open challenges for discovering, exploring, and visualizing user groups. Throughout the tutorial, we will illustrate examples in two key domains: "the social Web" and "health-care".
