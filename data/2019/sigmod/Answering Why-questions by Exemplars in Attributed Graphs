This paper studies the problem of \em answering Why-questions for graph pattern queries. Given a query Q, its answers $Q(G)$ in a graph G, and an exemplar $\E$ that describes desired answers, it aims to compute a query rewrite $Q'$, such that $Q'(G)$ incorporates relevant entities and excludes irrelevant ones wrt $\E$ under a closeness measure. (1) We characterize the problem by \em Q-Chase. It rewrites Q by applying a sequence of applicable operators guided by $\E$, and backtracks to derive optimal query rewrite. (2) We develop feasible Q-Chase-based algorithms, from anytime solutions to fixed-parameter approximations to compute query rewrites. These algorithms implement Q-Chase by detecting picky operators at run time, which discriminately enforce $\E$ to retain answers that are closer to exemplars, and effectively prune both operators and irrelevant matches, by consulting a cache of star patterns (called \em star views ). Using real-world graphs, we experimentally verify the efficiency and effectiveness of \qchase techniques and their applications.
