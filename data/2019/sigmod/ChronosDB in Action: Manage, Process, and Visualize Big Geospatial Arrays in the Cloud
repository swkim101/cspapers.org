Immense volumes of geospatial arrays are generated daily. Examples of such include satellite imagery, numerical simulation, and derivative data avalanche. Array DBMS are one of the prominent tools for working with large geospatial arrays. Usually the arrays natively come as raster files. ChronosDB is a novel distributed, file based, geospatial array DBMS: http://chronosdb.gis.land/ ChronosDB operates directly on raster files, delegates array processing to existing elaborate command line tools, and outperforms SciDB by up to 75x on average. This demonstration will showcase three new components of ChronosDB enabling users to interact with the system and appreciate its benefits: (i) a Web GUI (edit, submit queries and get the output), (ii) an execution plan explainer (investigate the generated DAG), and (iii) a dataset visualizer (display ChronosDB arrays on an interactive web map).
