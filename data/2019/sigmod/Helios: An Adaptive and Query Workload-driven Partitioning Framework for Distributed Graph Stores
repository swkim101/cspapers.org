In this paper, we present a novel adaptive and workload-driven partitioning framework, named Helios, aiming to achieve low-latency and high-throughput online queries in distributed graph stores. As each workload typically contains popular or similar queries, our partitioning method uses the existing workload to capture active vertices and edges which are frequently visited and traversed respectively. This information is used to heuristically improve the quality of partitions either by avoiding the concentration of active vertices in a few partitions proportional to their visit frequencies or by reducing the probability of the cut of active edges proportional to their traversal frequencies. In order to assess the impact of Helios on a graph store, and to show how easily the approach can be plugged on top of the system, we exploit it in a distributed, graph-based RDF store. The query engine of the store exploits Helios to reduce or eliminate data communication for future queries and balance the load among nodes. We evaluate the store by using realistic query workloads over an RDF dataset. Our results demonstrate the ability of Helios to handle varying query workloads with minimum overhead while maintaining the quality of partitions over time, along with being scalable by increasing either the data size or the number of computing nodes.
