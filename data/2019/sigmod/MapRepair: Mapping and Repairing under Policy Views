Mapping design is overwhelming for end users, who have to check at par the correctness of the mappings and the possible information disclosure over the exported source instance. In this demonstration, we focus on the latter problem by proposing a novel practical solution to ensure that a mapping faithfully complies with a set of privacy restrictions specified as source policy views. We showcase MapRepair, that guides the user through the tasks of visualizing the results of the data exchange process with and without the privacy restrictions. MapRepair leverages formal privacy guarantees and is inherently data-independent, i.e. if a set of criteria are satisfied by the mapping statement, then it guarantees that both the mapping and the underlying instances do not leak sensitive information. Furthermore, MapRepair also allows to automatically repair an input mapping w.r.t. a set of policy views in case of information leakage. We build on various demonstration scenarios, including synthetic and real-world instances and mappings.
