Recently, crowdsourcing has emerged as a new computing paradigm to solve problems that need human intrinsic, such as image annotation. However, there are two limitations in existing crowdsourcing platforms, i.e. non-transparent incentive mechanism and isolated profiles of workers, which harms the interests of both requesters and workers. Meanwhile, Blockchain technology introduces a solution to build a transparent, immutable data model in the Byzantine environment. Moreover, Blockchain systems (e.g. Ethereum) can also support the Tuning-complete script called smart contracts. Thus, we are motivated to use the feature of the transparent data model and smart contract in Blockchain to address the two limitations. Based on the proposed solutions, we have designed a Blockchain based framework which supports foundations of general crowdsourcing platforms. In addition, our framework also has following novel features: (1) it provides the transparent incentive mechanisms; (2) it supports a trusted worker's profile sharing in a cross-platform mode.
