Knowledge discovery is critical to successful data analytics. We propose a new type of meta-knowledge, namely pattern functional dependencies (PFDs), that combine patterns (or regex-like rules) and integrity constraints (ICs) to model the dependencies (or meta-knowledge) between partial values (or patterns) across different attributes in a table. PFDs go beyond the classical functional dependencies and their extensions. For instance, in an employee table, ID "F-9-107'', "F'' determines the finance department. Moreover, a key application of PFDs is to use them to identify erroneous data; tuples that violate some PFDs. In this demonstration, attendees will experience the following features: (i) PFD discovery -- automatically discover PFDs from (dirty) data in different domains; and (ii) Error detection with PFDs -- we will show errors that are detected by PFDs but cannot be captured by existing approaches.
