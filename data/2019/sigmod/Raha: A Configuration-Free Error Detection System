Detecting erroneous values is a key step in data cleaning. Error detection algorithms usually require a user to provide input configurations in the form of rules or statistical parameters. However, providing a complete, yet correct, set of configurations for each new dataset is not trivial, as the user has to know about both the dataset and the error detection algorithms upfront. In this paper, we present Raha, a new configuration-free error detection system. By generating a limited number of configurations for error detection algorithms that cover various types of data errors, we can generate an expressive feature vector for each tuple value. Leveraging these feature vectors, we propose a novel sampling and classification scheme that effectively chooses the most representative values for training. Furthermore, our system can exploit historical data to filter out irrelevant error detection algorithms and configurations. In our experiments, Raha outperforms the state-of-the-art error detection techniques with no more than 20 labeled tuples on each dataset.
