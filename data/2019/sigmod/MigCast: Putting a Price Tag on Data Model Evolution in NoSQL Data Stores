We demonstrate MigCast, a tool-based advisor for exploring data migration strategies in the context of developing NoSQL-backed applications. Users of MigCast can consider their options for evolving their data model along with legacy data already persisted in the cloud-hosted production database. They can explore alternative actions as the financial costs are predicted respective to the cloud provider chosen. Thereby they are better equipped to assess potential consequences of imminent data migration decisions. To this end, MigCast maintains an internal cost model, taking into account characteristics of the data instance, expected workload, data model changes, and cloud provider pricing models. Hence, MigCast enables software project stakeholders to remain in control of the operative costs and to make informed decisions evolving their applications.
