Automatic question generation is an important problem in natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive copying recurrent neural network model to tackle the problem of question generation from sentences and paragraphs. The proposed model adds a copying mechanism component onto a bidirectional LSTM architecture to generate more suitable questions adaptively from the input data. Our experimental results show the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art question generation methods in terms of BLEU and ROUGE evaluation scores.
