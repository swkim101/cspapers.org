GRADES-NDA 2019 is the second joint meeting of the GRADES and NDA workshops, which were each independently organized at previous SIGMOD-PODS meetings, GRADES since 2013 and NDA since 2016. The focus of GRADES-NDA is the application areas, usage scenarios, and open challenges in managing large-scale graph-shaped data. To summarize, GRADES-NDA aims to present technical contributions inside graph, RDF, and other data management systems on massive graphs.
