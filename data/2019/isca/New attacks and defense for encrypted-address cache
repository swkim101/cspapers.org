This ISCA-2019 paper was a follow-up to our prior MICRO-2018 paper (CEASER), which proposed a low-cost randomized cache design using encrypted-address. This paper proposed faster eviction-set algorithms, which broke prior secure caches, and a robust randomized cache (CEASER-S). This paper represented a significant jump in both attacks and defense for randomized caches. Personally, this was truly a fun paper, where for several months, I had posed the problem of eviction-set generation as a ”spy” problem to dozens of people, to see if they could come up with an even better solution. The second attack that exploits the replacement policy was discovered accidentally while making the conference slides for MICRO-2018. Finally, the solution was a simple combination of CEASER with Seznec’s brilliant idea of skewing. We hope to share the backstory, the context, and the impact of the paper.
