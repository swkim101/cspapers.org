Wireless protocol design for IoT networks is an active area of research. We demonstrate tinySDR which is a low-power software-defined radio platform tailored to the needs of IoT endpoints. TinySDR is a standalone, fully programmable software-defined radio platform which has the requirements of IoT protocols. We present the physical layer implementations of BLE beacon and LoRa protocols to demonstrate the capabilities of tinySDR.
