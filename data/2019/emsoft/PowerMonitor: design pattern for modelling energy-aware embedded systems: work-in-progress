This paper introduces a new software design pattern that can be applied to embedded systems. The pattern enables the application to access the peripheral devices under defined power conditions and allows to implement a fine-grained and energy-efficient strategy on using functional units of the microcontroller. The approach considers power consumption properties of the CPU itself as well as properties of external peripheral devices like connected sensors and actuators.
