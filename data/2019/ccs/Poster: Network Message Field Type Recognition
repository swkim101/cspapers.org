Existing approaches to reverse engineer network protocols based on traffic traces lack comprehensive methods to determine the data type, e. g. float, timestamp, or addresses, of segments in messages of binary protocols. We propose a novel method for the analysis of unknown protocol messages to reveal the data types contained in these messages. Therefore, we split messages into segments of bytes and interpret these as vectors of byte values. Based on the vector interpretation, we can determine similarities and characteristics of specific data types. These can be used to classify segments into clusters of the same type and to identify their data type for previously trained data types. We performed first evaluations of different applications of our method that show promising results up the a data-type-recognition precision of 100,%.
