Software Protection techniques aim to defend the confidentiality and integrity of software applications that are exposed to an adversary that shares the execution host and access privileges of the application. This scenario is often denoted as protection against MATE (Man-At-The-End) attacks. This is an area of growing importance for industry: in many cases the deployment of such techniques is crucial to ensure business continuity. Following the second SPRO workshop co-located with CCS-2016 in Vienna, Austria, this third edition aims to establish a tradition where academics and industrial experts in software protection can meet to confront the challenges in designing stronger protections and in developing better integration with industrial software development life cycle requirements.
