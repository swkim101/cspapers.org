4/4 1...2...1234 Intro: (4 beats each) You were the sunshine, baby, whenever you smiled, but I call you Stormy to-day All of a sudden that old rain’s comin’ down, and my world is cloudy and gray You went away Stor my, oh, Stor my, bring back that sun ny day. Yesterday’s love was like a warm, summer breeze But, like the weather, it changed Now things are dreary, baby, and it’s windy and cold And I stand a-lone in the rain....calling your name Stor my, oh, Stor my, bring back that sun ny day. Instrumental (2nd and 3rd lines of 1st verse)
