We propose MetaCP, a Meta Cryptography Protocol verification tool, as an automated tool simplifying the design of security protocols through a graphical interface. The graphical interface can be seen as a modern editor of a non-relational database whose data are protocols. The information of protocols are stored in XML, enjoying a fixed format and syntax aiming to contain all required information to specify any kind of protocol. This XML can be seen as an almost semanticless language, where different plugins confer strict semantics modelling the protocol into a variety of back-end verification languages. In this paper, we showcase the effectiveness of this novel approach by demonstrating how easy MetaCP makes it to design and verify a protocol going from the graphical design to formally verified protocol using a Tamarin prover plugin. Whilst similar approaches have been proposed in the past, most famously the AVISPA Tool, no previous approach provides such as small learning curve and ease of use even for non security professionals, combined with the flexibility to integrate with the state of the art verification tools.
