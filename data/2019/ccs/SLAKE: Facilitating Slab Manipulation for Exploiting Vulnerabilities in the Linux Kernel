To determine the exploitability for a kernel vulnerability, a secu- rity analyst usually has to manipulate slab and thus demonstrate the capability of obtaining the control over a program counter or performing privilege escalation. However, this is a lengthy process because (1) an analyst typically has no clue about what objects and system calls are useful for kernel exploitation and (2) he lacks the knowledge of manipulating a slab and obtaining the desired layout. In the past, researchers have proposed various techniques to facilitate exploit development. Unfortunately, none of them can be easily applied to address these challenges. On the one hand, this is because of the complexity of the Linux kernel. On the other hand, this is due to the dynamics and non-deterministic of slab variations. In this work, we tackle the challenges above from two perspectives. First, we use static and dynamic analysis techniques to explore the kernel objects, and the corresponding system calls useful for exploitation. Second, we model commonly-adopted exploitation methods and develop a technical approach to facilitate the slab layout adjustment. By extending LLVM as well as Syzkaller, we implement our techniques and name their combination after SLAKE. We evaluate SLAKE by using 27 real-world kernel vulnerabilities, demonstrating that it could not only diversify the ways to perform kernel exploitation but also sometimes escalate the exploitability of kernel vulnerabilities.
