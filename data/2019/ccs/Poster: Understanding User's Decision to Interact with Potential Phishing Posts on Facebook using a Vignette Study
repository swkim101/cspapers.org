Facebook remains the largest social media platform on the Internet with over one billion active monthly users. A variety of personal and sensitive data is shared on the platform, which makes it a prime target for attackers. Increasingly, we see phishing attacks that take advantage of users' lack of security knowledge, deceiving victims by using fake or compromised accounts to share malicious posts. These attacks may slip undetected by the Facebook defense system, exposing users to potentially be phished or have their devices infected with drive-by downloads and malware. Only a few studies have been conducted to date to understand how users interact with attacks like this in Facebook. In our prior work, we conducted a study to address this challenge using a simulated interface and think-aloud protocol. In this study, we aim to make further progress in understanding the impact of different factors on users' clicking decision in social media through a vignette study that encourages participants to think about realistic scenarios that they might face.
