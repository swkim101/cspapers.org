Organizations, such as companies and governments, created Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to defend against computer security attacks. SOCs are central defense groups that focus on security incident management with capabilities such as monitoring, preventing, responding, and reporting. They are one of the most critical defense components of a modern organization's defense. Despite their critical importance to organizations, and the high frequency of reported security incidents, only a few research studies focus on problems specific to SOCs. In this study, to understand and identify the issues of SOCs, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with SOC analysts and managers who work for organizations from different industry sectors. Through our analysis of the interview data, we identified technical and non-technical issues that exist in SOC. Moreover, we found inherent disagreements between SOC managers and their analysts that, if not addressed, could entail a risk to SOC efficiency and effectiveness. We distill these issues into takeaways that apply both to future academic research and to SOC management. We believe that research should focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of SOCs.
