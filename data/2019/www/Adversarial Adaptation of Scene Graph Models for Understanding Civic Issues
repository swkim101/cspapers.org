Citizen engagement and technology usage are two emerging trends driven by smart city initiatives. Typically, citizens report issues, such as broken roads, garbage dumps, etc. through web portals and mobile apps, in order for the government authorities to take appropriate actions. Several mediums - text, image, audio, video - are used to report these issues. Through a user study with 13 citizens and 3 authorities, we found that image is the most preferred medium to report civic issues. However, analyzing civic issue related images is challenging for the authorities as it requires manual effort. In this work, given an image, we propose to generate a Civic Issue Graph consisting of a set of objects and the semantic relations between them, which are representative of the underlying civic issue. We also release two multi-modal (text and images) datasets, that can help in further analysis of civic issues from images. We present an approach for adversarial adaptation of existing scene graph models that enables the use of scene graphs for new applications in the absence of any labelled training data. We conduct several experiments to analyze the efficacy of our approach, and using human evaluation, we establish the appropriateness of our model at representing different civic issues.
