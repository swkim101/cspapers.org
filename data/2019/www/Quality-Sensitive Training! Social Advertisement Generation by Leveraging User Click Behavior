Social advertisement has emerged as a viable means to improve purchase sharing in the context of e-commerce. However, humanly generating lots of advertising scripts can be prohibitive to both e-platforms and online sellers, and moreover, developing the desired auto-generator will need substantial gold-standard training samples. In this paper, we put forward a novel seq2seq model to generate social advertisements automatically, in which a quality-sensitive loss function is proposed based on user click behavior to differentiate training samples of varied qualities. Our motivation is to leverage the clickthrough data as a kind of quality indicator to measure the textual fitness of each training sample quantitatively, and only those ground truths that satisfy social media users will be considered the eligible and able to optimize the social advertisement generation. Specifically, under the qualified case, the ground truth should be utilized to supervise the whole training phase as much as possible, whereas in the opposite situation, the generated result ought to preserve the semantics of original input to the greatest extent. Simulation experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant superiority over two existing methods of distant supervision and three state-of-the-art NLG solutions.
