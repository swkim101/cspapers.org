This paper introduces RecBoard, a unified web-based platform that facilitates researchers and practitioners to train, test, deploy, and monitor recommendation systems. RecBoard streamlines the end-to-end process of building recommendation systems by providing a collaborative user interface that automates repetitive tasks related to dataset management, model training, visualization, deployments, and monitoring. Our demo prototype demonstrates how RecBoard can empower common tasks in research and development. RecBoard will be open-sourced and publicly available upon publication.
