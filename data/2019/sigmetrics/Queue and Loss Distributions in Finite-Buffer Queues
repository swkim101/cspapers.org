We derive simple bounds on the queue distribution in finite-buffer queues with Markovian arrivals. The bounds capture a truncated exponential behavior, involving joint horizontal and vertical shifts of an exponential function; this is fundamentally different than existing results capturing horizontal shifts only. We also obtain similar bounds on the loss distribution, which is a key metric to understand the impact of finite-buffer queues on real-time applications. Simulations show that the bounds are accurate in heavy-traffic regimes, and improve existing ones by orders of magnitude.
