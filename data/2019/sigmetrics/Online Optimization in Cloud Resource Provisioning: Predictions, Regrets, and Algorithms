Several different control methods are used in practice or have been proposed to cost-effectively provision IT resources. Due to the dependency of many control methods on having accurate predictions of the future to make good provisioning decisions, there has been a great deal of literature on prediction workload demand. However, even with all of this literature on workload predictions and their utilization in control algorithms, the understanding of prediction error and how to handle it remains an important open issue and research challenge. In this paper we aim to mend this gap by making the following contributions: (i) Prediction error is modeled to aid in proving worst-case dynamic regret bounds for control algorithms. (ii) Upper bounds on dynamic regret are proven for a variety of algorithms in terms of the prediction error model. In order to choose which algorithm to run without prediction error knowledge, a simple online meta-algorithm is designed. (iii) A detailed analysis of prediction accuracy is done for cloud computing by fitting real-world CPU utilization traces of Azure virtual machines to popular prediction models. (iv) Using real-world trace based simulations of CPU allocation for virtual machines, the proposed meta-algorithm is shown to outperform a popular algorithm selection policy and perform very closely to that of the best algorithm chosen in hindsight.
