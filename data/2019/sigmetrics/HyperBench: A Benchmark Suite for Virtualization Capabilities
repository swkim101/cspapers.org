Virtualization is becoming increasingly common in data centers due to its various advantages. However, how to choose among different platforms, including both software and hardware, is a considerable challenge. In this context, evaluating the virtualization capabilities of different platforms is critically important. Regrettably, the existing benchmarks are not qualified for meeting this requirement. Different hardware mechanisms and hypervisor designs introduce many different hypervisor-level events, such as transitions between VMs and the hypervisor, two-dimensional page walk, and binary translation. These events are key factors affecting virtualization performance. Existing benchmarks either overlook these changes or are tightly coupled to a particular hypervisor. In this paper, we present HyperBench, a benchmark suite that focuses on the capabilities of different virtualization platforms. Currently, we design 15 hypervisor benchmarks covering CPU, memory, and I/O. The virtualization-sensitive operation in each benchmark triggers hypervisor-level events, which examines the platform's ability in the target area. HyperBench is designed as a custom kernel which can adapt to different hypervisors and architectures. What's more, adding a new benchmark is pretty easy. Finally, we perform a series of experiments on the host machine and several popular hypervisors, such as QEMU, KVM, and Xen, demonstrating that HyperBench is capable of revealing the performance implications of the hardware mechanism and hypervisor design.
