The shielded computation of hardware-based trusted execution environments such as Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) can provide secure cloud computing on remote systems under untrusted privileged system software. However, hardware overheads for securing protected memory restrict its capacity to a modest size of several tens of megabytes, and more demands for protected memory beyond the limit cause costly demand paging. Although one of the widely used applications benefiting from the enhanced security of SGX, is the in-memory key-value store, its memory requirements are far larger than the protected memory limit. Furthermore, the main data structures commonly use fine-grained data items such as pointers and keys, which do not match well with the coarse-grained paging of the SGX memory extension technique. To overcome the memory restriction, this paper proposes a new in-memory key-value store designed for SGX with application-specific data security management. The proposed key-value store, called ShieldStore, maintains the main data structures in unprotected memory with each key-value pair individually encrypted and integrity-protected by its secure component running inside an enclave. Based on the enclave protection by SGX, ShieldStore provides secure data operations much more efficiently than the baseline SGX key-value store, achieving 8--11 times higher throughput with 1 thread, and 24--30 times higher throughput with 4 threads.
