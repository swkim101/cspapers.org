A large literature evaluates how virtual agents impact the lives of people with dementia using perceptions of technology. We assess how a home virtual agent from "Living Well with Anne" impacts the quality of life of elderly with dementia rather than only their perceptions of the technology. Assessing impact on life alongside technology perception is pertinent given the importance of a person's perceived quality of daily home life and that positive technology perception does not always lead to actual use. We propose an approach to evaluate assistive technology for elderly people with dementia by assessing impact on life using semi-structured interviews and the QOL-AD scale. A preliminary proof-of-concept study tests whether perceptions of a virtual agent, actual use of the agent and participants' quality of life are related, and whether a virtual agent improves quality of life.
