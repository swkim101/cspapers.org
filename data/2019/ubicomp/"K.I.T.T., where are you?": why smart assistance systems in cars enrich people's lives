Personal smart assistance systems make people's lives easier and enable exceptional convenience, e.g. by supporting users during bothersome tasks. While personal intelligent assistants offer a lot of comfort to their users, there are also worries about data protection and data security since personal data about users is collected, aggregated and analyzed for ubiquitous assistance systems. Smart assistance systems can for example be found in cars. Connected to other internet of things devices, those assistants can help with the search for free parking lots in a crowded city or enable easy refueling in cooperation with intelligent charging stations. As the users' motivation to engage in those smart assistance systems is still undetected we investigate the influence of several potential drivers on the intention to use smart assistance systems in cars. This study uses survey data (N = 150) and structural equation modeling as the analysis method. Our results provide empirical evidence that convenience motives, performance expectancy, personal innovativeness, and perceived risk are drivers for consumers' intention to use smart assistance systems in cars. Moreover, we motivate further research in the field of smart assistance systems. Furthermore, we discuss academic and practical implications.
