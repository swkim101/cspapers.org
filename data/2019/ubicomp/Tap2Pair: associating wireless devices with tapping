The IoT era demands ad-hoc wireless devices association for a convenient and spontaneous cross-device interaction experience. Currently, users associate two devices by selecting the advertising device (e.g. a mouse) from a list displayed by the scanning device (e.g. a laptop). However, the association can be misplaced since it is often more convenient to initiate association from the advertising device (e.g. when switching a mouse between two computers). Tap2Pair allows users to simply tap on an advertising device to associate with the target scanning device. It does not require any modification of existing wireless devices and is compatible with most wireless protocols. Hands tap near the advertising device's antenna can change the strength of the signal received by scanning devices. Scanning devices can then calculate signal features and initiate association if certain criteria are met. We demonstrate two association strategies for different scenarios: 1. Hold and tap an advertising device near the target scanning device; 2. Tap at the corresponding frequency of the target scanning device.
