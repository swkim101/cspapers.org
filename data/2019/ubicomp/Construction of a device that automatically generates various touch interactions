This paper proposes a device that automatically generates various touch interactions including multi-touch to realize touch interactions at high speed, continuously, and hands free. The proposed device does not require additional software installations to the touch panel, and it can be expected to improve efficiency and realize automation of work using the touch panel. The proposed device consists of an electrode sheet printed with conductive ink and a voltage control circuit, and generates touch interactions by changing the capacitance of the touch panel temporally and spatially.
