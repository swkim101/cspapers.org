Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies transform our lives into a more convenient and advanced ones. The revolutionary transformation arise in healthcare and medical fields. IoT devices make it feasible to examine patient status in daily lives. Clinicians say that continuous examination of patient status out of the hospital should be valuable to manage target disorder or disease. Moreover, engineers expect that AI techniques could find novel treatments for the disorder or disease based on huge amount of daily patient data. We have investigated such technology-supported methodologies with an urologist in Severance Hospital for better treatments to patients who have nocturnal enuresis.
