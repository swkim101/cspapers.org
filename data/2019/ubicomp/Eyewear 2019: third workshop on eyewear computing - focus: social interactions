Computing devices worn on the human body have a long history in academic and industrial research, most importantly in wearable computing, mobile eye tracking, and mobile mixed and augmented reality. As humans receive most of their sensory input via the head, it is a very interesting body location for simultaneous sensing and interaction as well as cognitive assistance. Eyewear Computing devices have recently emerged as commercial products and can provide an research platform for a range of fields, including human-computer interaction, ubiquitous computing, pervasive sensing, psychology and social sciences. The proposed workshop will bring together researchers from a wide range of disciplines, such as mobile and ubiquitous computing, eye tracking, optics, computer vision, human vision and perception, usability, as well as systems research. This year it will also bring in researchers from psychology, with a focus on the social and interpersonal aspects of eyewear technology. The workshop is a continuation from 2016/2018 and will focus on discussing application scenarios as well as focusing on eyewear sensing and supporting social interactions.
