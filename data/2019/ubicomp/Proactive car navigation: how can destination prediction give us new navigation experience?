Conventional car navigation systems that require manual input of a user's destination are not frequently used for familiar routes such as daily commutes and regular shopping. In this paper, we propose and realize proactive car navigation, which integrates daily destination prediction system to car navigation system in order to eliminate input by user by displaying information related to destinations automatically. By questionnaire-based evaluation, we found that proactive car navigation innovates a user's driving experiences, and offers them various advantages, even for regularly frequented destinations.
