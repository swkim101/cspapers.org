PDR is a method of estimating the relative position from initial position using only an accelerometer and gyroscope. In recent years, hearable devices are becoming increasingly popular, and there are many researches on head pose estimation with them. In this paper, we aim to realize PDR considering head pose using only sensor data obtained with hearable devices. However, horizontal head swing affects the estimation of the traveling direction of PDR when wearing the sensor on ear. Using the difference of acceleration applied to both ears to detect head swing. For evaluation, we created the device with accelerometer and gyroscope attached to the left and right speaker of the headphone. As a result of the evaluation, the accuracy of swing motion estimation is 88.0%. F-measure of head swing is 0.87. In conclusion, the detection result of swing is adopted to PDR, and realized PDR that use sensor data obtained by hearable device.
