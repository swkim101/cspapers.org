A smartphone app to screen for neonatal jaundice has a large potential impact in reducing neonatal death and disability. Our app, neoSCB, uses a colour measurement of the sclera to make a screening decision. Although there are numerous benefits of a smartphone-based approach, smartphone colour measurement that is accurate and repeatable is a challenge. Using data from a clinical setting in Ghana, we compare sclera colour measurement using an ambient subtraction method to sclera colour measurement using a standard colour card method, and find they are comparable provided the subtracted signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) is sufficient. Calculating a screening decision metric via the colour card method gave 100% sensitivity and 69% specificity (n=87), while applying the ambient subtraction method gave 100% sensitivity and 78% specificity (SSNR>3.5; n=50).
