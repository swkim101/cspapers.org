We present 'True Colors,' a social wearable prototype designed to augment co-located social interaction among players in a LARP (live action role play). We designed it to enable the emergence of rich social dynamics between wearers and non-wearers. True Colors is Y-shaped, worn around the upper body, and has distinct front and back interfaces to afford actions taken by the wearer (front), and actions taken by others (back). To design True Colors [3], we followed a Research-through-Design approach, used experiential qualities and social affordances to guide our process, and co-designed with LARP designers. 13 True Colors wearables were deployed in a 3-day LARP event, attended by 109 people. Out of all the functionalities and interactivity the device afforded, players gravitated most towards those that emphasized the social value of experiencing vulnerability as a prompt to get together.
