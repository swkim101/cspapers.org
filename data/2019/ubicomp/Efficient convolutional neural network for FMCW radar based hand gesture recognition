FMCW radar could detect object's range, speed and Angle-of-Arrival, advantages are robust to bad weather, good range resolution, and good speed resolution. In this paper, we consider the FMCW radar as a novel interacting interface on laptop. We merge sequences of object's range, speed, azimuth information into single input, then feed to a convolution neural network to learn spatial and temporal patterns. Our model achieved 96% accuracy on test set and real-time test.
