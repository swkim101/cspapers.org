We propose and implement data transmission method for capacitive touch panel using physical interface and micro-computer that can generate touch to capacitive touch panel. The proposed device consists of one-board microcomputer, an external power supply, and multiple touch control devices that can be individually controlled. One touch control device is in contact with one touch area, and touch is individually generated for the touch panel. Our software in the touch panel detects touch patterns. The snapshot of the detected touch patterns is interpreted as a bit string. By controlling the touch generation device at high speed, long bit string can be transmitted.
