Mode of transport recognition is an important part of understanding the context of a person with a mobile phone being the best device on which to do this since a person typically carries it around for most of the day. In this paper, we present a method to understand the mode of transport (also called locomotion recognition) using data collected from Android mobile phones. The method is the submitted solution for "Team Jellyfish" for the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation recognition challenge. The goal is to develop a body-position independent classifier that uses data from a set of commonly available sensors on a phone - accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and barometer. The solution is an ensemble of XGBoost and neural network classifiers. The precision and recall using 5-fold cross validation on the validation set is 0.946 and 0.945 respectively.
