The grand vision of pervasive computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) involves providing people with a range of seamless functionality, be it through automation, information delivery, etc. However, much of the IoT is opaque; it is often difficult for users to uncover and understand how and why particular functionality occurs, the sources of information, the entities involved, and so forth. We argue that automation scripts, as well as logs and provenance records could be leveraged to assist in illuminating the workings of connected and automated environments. This paper explores the use of voice assistants (an accessible, intuitive and increasingly common interface) as a means for allowing users to interrogate what is happening in the IoT systems that surround them. In presenting an exploratory Alexa 'Skill', we discuss several considerations for the implementation of such a system. This work represents a starting point for considering how such assistants could help people better understand---and indeed, evaluate, challenge, and accept---technology that is increasingly pervading our world.
