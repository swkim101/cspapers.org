Population flow data (traffic sets of crowds from one regions to another) is of great value in a wide range of fields from urban traffic resource allocation to public security protection. Since the data of the individual-level mobility requires privacy protection, it's hard to collect detailed population flow data. There have been published works on generating population flow from aggregated data. But they have the limitations of considering the flow between neighbors only or modeling the mapping from aggregated population data to flow by a simple physical model without taking regionally diversity into account. However, long-range dependencies and regionally diversity is very important. Since population flow contains more information than that in aggregated population variation, generating the detailed former from the aggregated latter is quite difficult. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end structure deep learning based model to generate population flow from aggregated historical population variation data. We use real-world datasets to compare the performance of our model with several baselines, which shows the superiority of our model. This proves the potential of using deep learning in population flow generation.
