Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) recognition challenge provides a large dataset including train, validation and test data. Our team name is ICT-BUPT League. Moreover, the main work is to recognition eight transportation modes. Our method combines the CNN and LSTM. In this system, CNNs allow us to learn suitable features representation for recognition that are robust against transportation mode recognition. We make use of LSTM units on the CNN output, which play the role of a structured dimensionality reduction on the feature vector leading to drastic improvements in transportation mode recognition performance. As a result, the CNN+LSTM transportation mode recognition system could predict eight classes with a success rate of 76%.
