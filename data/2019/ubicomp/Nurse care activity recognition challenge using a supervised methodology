Human activity recognition is one of the important research topics in machine learning. Different algorithms have been proposed for human activity recognition in several years. But nurse care activity recognition is a new section in machine learning which mainly focused on physical activity recognition. We are the members of the team "Data Digger" accepted a challenge named "Nurse Care Activity Recognition Challenge". We used Carecom nurse care activity dataset for that challenge [14]. We compare several machine learning algorithms for the dataset. The proposed method was trained and evaluated on Carecom nurse care activity recognition dataset and got 69% accuracy after splitting the dataset.
