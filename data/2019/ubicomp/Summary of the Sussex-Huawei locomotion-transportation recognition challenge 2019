In this paper we summarize the contributions of participants to the Sussex-Huawei Transportation-Locomotion (SHL) Recognition Challenge organized at the HASCA Workshop of Ubi-Comp 2019. The goal of this machine learning/data science challenge is to recognize eight locomotion and transportation activities (Still, Walk, Run, Bike, Bus, Car, Train, Subway) from the inertial sensor data of a smartphone in a placement independent manner. The training data is collected with smartphones placed at three body positions (Torso, Bag and Hips), while the testing data is collected with a smartphone placed at another body position (Hand). We introduce the dataset used in the challenge and the protocol for the competition. We present a meta-analysis of the contributions from 14 submissions, their approaches, the software tools used, computational cost and the achieved results. Overall, three submissions achieved F1 scores between 70% and 80% five with F1 scores between 60% and 70%, five between between 50% and 60%, and one below 50%, with a latency of a maximum of 5 seconds.
