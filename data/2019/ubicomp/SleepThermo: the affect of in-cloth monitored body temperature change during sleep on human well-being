With the advent of 24/7 technology-driven society, there are rising discomforts and increasing concerns over sleep. Quality of sleep critically affects human well-being and everyday performance. A good night's sleep, therefore, is essential to prepare one's mind and body for the next day. In this paper, we propose SleepThermo, a system that identifies the affect of in-cloth monitored body temperature change during sleep on human well-being. The primary purpose of this research is to determine the relationship between in-clothing body temperature and mental/physical conditions, and then elicit positive insights to improve sleep quality. Our evaluation proved that there is a potential for body temperature to be used in identifying mental and physical conditions. In addition, personalized models achieved better balanced accuracy than overall models in all subjects.
