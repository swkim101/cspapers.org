Wearables that combine practical functionality and physical functionality are part of a new and growing field. The main goal of wearables for health applications is to improve the quality of life overall by designing a usable, comfortable, and fashionable device with a purpose. Constructing wearables requires knowledge from a variety of different areas, which can result in a diversity of new ideas. Customization of wearables gives the user comfort and personalized style while also increasing health benefits. One major area for wearable opportunities is adaptive clothing for individuals with physical and/or intellectual disabilities. Adaptive clothing is currently in limited supply and often tries to group multiple disabilities together, when different disabilities have distinctly different needs. Wearables, however, do have technical barriers when it comes to cleaning, cost, and analyzing qualitative data from research participants.
