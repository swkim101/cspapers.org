This abstract discusses the EEG Visualising Pendant (2012) [3], an emotive wearable that maps and visualises EEG data from a NeuroSky MindWave Mobile Bluetooth EEG headset. It has been developed through several iterations as a doctoral research prototype for studies evaluating the use of bespoke, aesthetic wearables in the role of nonverbal communication.
