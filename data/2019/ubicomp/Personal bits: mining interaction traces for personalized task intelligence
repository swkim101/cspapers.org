As we work, play, shop, and communicate in digital interfaces, we continuously generate traces of information. To turn such noisy sources of personal data into actual insight, my research introduces Personal Bits, a service that enables personalized task support in various kinds of information tasks such as instant message handling, information retrieval, and text entry. Personal Bits mines a user's interaction traces with web apps and native mobile apps and extracts task-centric entities. I present three example apps for Personal Bits: Deja Wu, MessageOnTap, and ContextBoard, to address inefficiencies presented in these information tasks. Personal Bits acts as the central nexus for intelligence between apps and interaction traces, making it easy for apps to acquire personally relevant task entities in fine granularity.
