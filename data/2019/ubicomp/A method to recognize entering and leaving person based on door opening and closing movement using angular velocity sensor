In our daily lives, we use places shared by multiple people such as homes and offices. Although many methods for individual recognition have been proposed, when they are used in such places, they have some problems in terms of psychological and physical burden. Therefore, in this research, we propose a method to recognize a person who entered or left the room by using the opening and closing movement of a door. In the proposed method, an angular velocity sensor is installed on the doorknob, and the user is identified based on personal characteristics of door's motion that is naturally accompanied with entering and leaving a room. We implement the proposed system on a door with a lever handle typed doorknob for a target scene of general household. From experimental results that F value of user's leaving motion was 0.90 and user's entering motion was 0.73, we confirmed the effectiveness of our method.
