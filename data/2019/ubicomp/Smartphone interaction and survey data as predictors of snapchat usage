Snapchat is a highly popular smartphone app that allows personalised multimedia communication for spontaneous experiences, where the shared content disappears after a short period of time. In this paper, we examine the predictors of Snapchat usage based on a range of data collected through surveys and from interaction with the handset, using a cohort of 64 recruited participants. The results show that age, Smartphone Addiction, happiness and the use of the popular chatting apps WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are significant predictors for Snapchat usage. We discuss the implications of these findings against the related literature, and also against the design of the app itself.
