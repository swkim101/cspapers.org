Emerging smart eyewear solutions offer new ways to present information. In addition, new technology provides an unobtrusive way to study human cognitive and attentional functions in real life. This combination presents a unique possibility to design more usable and intuitive interfaces and information visualizations for the users. Flexible and fluent allocation of attention to relevant information are key functions needed in today's work life, especially in knowledge work. Supporting these essential functions e.g., with intelligent glasses, can increase working fluency and decrease work-related strain. This study shows how work-related stress is associated with the ability to flexibly disengage and reorient cognitive (attention) resources. The results suggest that cognitive weariness related to job-burnout impairs fluent and flexible attentional allocation.
