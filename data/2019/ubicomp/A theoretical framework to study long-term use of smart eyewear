Wearable displays with augmented reality are in an early phase of adoption by the public. The uptake is slow and user studies regarding acceptance and use are scarce and have limitations to understand long-term use and their influence on daily life. The complexity of understanding long-term use requires a multidisciplinary approach to different stakeholder perspectives. A variety of complementary theoretical perspectives are needed to create a framework to study the impact and perils of the use of smart eyewear. In this position paper, we develop such a framework, integrating theoretical perspectives from Philosophy, Psychology, Science and Technology Studies and Information Systems. The resulting framework has concrete implications for future studies regarding the design, acceptance and long-term use of smart eyewear.
