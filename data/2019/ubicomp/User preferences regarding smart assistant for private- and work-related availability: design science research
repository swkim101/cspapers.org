Communication technologies (CTs) have made it possible for employees to stay connected with their jobs beyond the traditional boundaries of the workplace and workday. Some researchers implied that CT may become the "electronic leash" [1], since employees may feel trapped or excessively tied to their CT device [2]. In contrast to these findings, we follow the design science research [3] aiming at the development of a smart assistant that will reflect the variety of individuals' availability preferences. To better understand the needs and demands of potential users, we conducted standardized qualitative open-ended interviews with 67 employees from different backgrounds (knowledge workers, social workers, and blue collar workers). The survey revealed many important features concerning this technological solution, like filtering by the priority of the person contacting, time, location and actual life domain, as well as location tracking different availability stages and feedback loops.
