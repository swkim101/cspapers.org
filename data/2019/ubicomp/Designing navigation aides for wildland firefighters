In this research, we explored the design of navigation technology for wildland firefighters. We worked within a set of empirically informed design constraints to create prototypes of a wearable system that provides peripheral navigation cues via visual and haptic feedback. We used physical and interactive prototypes of this system as technology probes to provoke discussions with wildland firefighters about their navigation and location technology needs. Our pilot study results indicate that our prototypes helped to uncover ideas for future technical work in the domain of wildland firefighting, as well as on mobile and wearable navigation systems, more broadly.
