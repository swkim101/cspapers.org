In this paper, we propose PASNIC, a lightweight privacy-aware sensor node for image capturing. PASNIC masks the region of faces and private screens (smartphone and portable computer displays) in captured visible images before sending them to remote sites. Thermal information, which can also be captured with a thermal image sensor, is used to detect the regions of faces and private screens. Our masking algorithms are so simple that even sensor nodes with low processing power can sufficiently process them.
