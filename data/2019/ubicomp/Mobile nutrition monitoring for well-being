The EU-funded project WellCo1 aims to deliver a new mobile app with a virtual coach to encourage the users towards healthier behaviour choices in order to improve their physical, cognitive, mental and social well-being. Healthy nutrition can substantially contribute to health and wellbeing. We will use different techniques for dietary assessment in the WellCo project - eating detection by gesture recognition using a wrist-worn device, and estimating the quality of diet by self-reporting using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). This paper describes the latter. We designed a short FFQ, compared it to validated questionnaires, and developed a web service and a web application to determine dietary quality score for each user by using the designed FFQ.
