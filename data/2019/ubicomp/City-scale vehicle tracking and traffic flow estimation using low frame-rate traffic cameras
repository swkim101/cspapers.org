Vehicle flow estimation has many potential smart cities and transportation applications. Many cities have existing camera networks which broadcast image feeds; however, the resolution and frame-rate are too low for existing computer vision algorithms to accurately estimate flow. In this work, we present a computer vision and deep learning framework for vehicle tracking. We demonstrate a novel tracking pipeline which enables accurate flow estimates in a range of environments under low resolution and frame-rate constraints. We demonstrate that our system is able to track vehicles in New York City's traffic camera video feeds at 1 Hz or lower frame-rate, and produces higher traffic flow accuracy than popular open source tracking frameworks.
