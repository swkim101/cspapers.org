Herein, we studied a multiuser human body communication system that uses multiple human bodies as a transmission channel when assuming data sharing among users. We evaluated electric field distributions around human bodies and transmission characteristics between wearable transceivers through electromagnetic field simulation using whole-body human models. Simulation results showed that the electric field strongly propagates between human bodies via physical contact; however, the contact area between two users has little influence on the electric field. In addition, the dominant control on the transmission characteristics is the position of the receiver.
