The purpose of this study is the measurement of MAAI and value co-creation in Japanese-style service interaction through quantification of service interaction between a customer and a salesperson in retail stores. In this paper, we propose the MAAI measurement technique of service interaction in retail store. We confirmed that MAAI measurement enables modeling value co-creation in this customer service situation. As a result, the technique proposed here to measure MAAI is expected to be useful to manage and computing customer service.
