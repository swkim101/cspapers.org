This article describes the methodology and technology for data collection of hand gestures of master craftspeople, with a case study tracing the Intangible Cultural Heritage practice of Horse Tail Embroiderers of Shui ethnic minority in collaboration with GYPEC1 in Guiyang, Southwestern China. We describe unique technological design solutions to enable mobility to remote villages, and freedom of movement to capture the hand gestures of master craftspeople. The significance of this work is vitally important, as it outlines a technique to digitally record, analyse and archive the intricate dynamics of craft practices. We contextualise the research within a contemporary context, and describe the aims and objectives of the research for an interactive media museum interface to provide new insights into traditional practices. Finally, we propose future potential to investigate embodied knowledge and alternative pedagogical applications for innovative contemporary design.
