Note-taking, an active learning strategy, has a long history in the educational setting. Learners would tend to make notes for a variety of reasons such as planning their learning activities, extracting useful information from the learning content and to reflect their understanding about learning material [9]. The research studies conducted in educational domain support that note-taking can help learners think, understand and create their knowledge, thereby increasing their learning performance. Although note-taking is crucial for learning, this activity is highly complex which requires comprehension and selection of information. As a result, resource demanding cognitive operations are triggered which coordinate in rapid succession thereby making the activity of note-taking cognitively effortful [12]. One other drawback of this activity is the split attention effect induced when learners split their attention between the act of writing notes and attending to learning content [10]. This results in the withdrawal of attention from the global context to writing selective information which can thereby increase cognitive load and adversely affect the learning performance.
