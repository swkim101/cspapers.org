Cosplay, where people dress up with special costumes resembling or inspired by an imaginary character, derived e.g. from game or comic genre, is an interesting area of social clothing design. In our on-going research, we consider cosplay as a source of inspiration for wearable computing. We investigate different aspects related to the identity and expression with cosplay costumes, and seek to identify factors that affect the engagement and user satisfaction in participating in the cosplay. We believe that wearable computing research can learn from cosplay, and take elements that help in designing future wearables.
