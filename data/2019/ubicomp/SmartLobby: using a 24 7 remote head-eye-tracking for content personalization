In this work, we present the SmartLobby, an intelligent environment system integrated into the lobby of a research institute. The SmartLobby is running 24/7, i.e. it can be used any time by anyone without any preparations. The goal of the system is to conduct research in the domain of human machine cooperation. One important first step towards this goal is a detailed human state modeling and estimation with head-eye-tracking as key component. The SmartLobby mainly integrates state-of-the-art algorithms that enable a thorough analysis of human behavior and state. These algorithms constitute the fundamental basis for the development of higher level system components. Here, we present our system with its various hardware and software components. Thereby, we focus on the head-eye-tracking as a key component to continuously observe persons using the system and customize content shown to them. The results of a multi-week lasting experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.
