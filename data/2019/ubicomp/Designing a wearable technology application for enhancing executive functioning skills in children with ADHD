There are limitations and poor adherence to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions when treating children with ADHD. Wearable technology has great potential to overcome this limitation due to their portability and capability to measure biosignals. Unfortunately, the acceptance of this technology in children with ADHD has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to understand the acceptability of wearables and propose designs for applications to enhance executive functioning in these children. Results from a qualitative study involving children with ADHD and their teachers showed that concerns from the children outweighed the advantages for using smartwatch technology, and suggested that an application should mimic the current practices of self-regulation taught at their school and be able to monitor self-reflection of mood and behavior. These findings suggest that wearables can potentially be used as interventions supporting the executive function of children with ADHD.
