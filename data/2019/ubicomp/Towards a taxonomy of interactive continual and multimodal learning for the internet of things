With advances in Internet of Things many opportunities arise if the challenges of continual learning in a multimodal setting can be tackled. One common issue in Online Learning is to obtain labelled data, as this generally is costly. Active Learning is a popular approach to collect labelled data efficiently, but in general includes unrealistic assumptions. In this work we present a first step towards a taxonomy of Interactive Learning strategies in a multimodal and dynamic setting. By relaxing assumptions of standard Active Learning, the strategies become better suited for real-world settings and can achieve better performance.
