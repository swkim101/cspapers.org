We developed a highly-visible head-mounted novelty wearable to be used in social settings. We tested our Interactive Social Novelty Wearable (iSNoW) prototype in a partner-based user study to see if perceptions of the experience would change if the information displayed on the wearable was contextually relevant. Thematic analyses revealed important considerations for the design of future devices, regarding distraction and pressure to understand the rules of the game. Participants wearing contextually relevant information were more likely to recommend the device to their friends. We highlight future opportunities for exploration in this relatively untouched space.
