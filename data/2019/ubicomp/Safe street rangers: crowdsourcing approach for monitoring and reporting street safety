Looking out for each other's safety is always a nice thing to do. Crowdsourcing enables us to do just that as we've developed a system called Safe Street Rangers that allows the user or ranger to monitor and report via a mobile app the level of safety concern of any street segment regarding seven aspects including traffic signs, road obstacles, brightness, road condition, animals, solitariness, and traffic accidents, in relation to a transport mode (i.e., driving or walking). The system consists of three main components; mobile app, web app, and data server. Each submitted report will be verified and approved by an admin user via our web app. The data server handles all data storage and processing. It checks for overlapping of reported street segments with the existing ones and updates the safety rating values of street waypoints accordingly. The system has been tested with the real users from which its usefulness is highly perceived.
