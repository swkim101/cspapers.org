For the patients with speech and motion impairments, there is an indispensable need to facilitate their communication with other people, using approaches such as eyeball tracking. However, these systems are usually complex and expensive. In this demo, we propose a WiFi-based contactless text input system, called WiMorse. The system allows these patients to communicate with other people by using WiFi signals to track single-finger movements and encoding them as Morse code to input text. However, we note that a small change in the target's location would lead to a significant change in the received WiFi signal pattern, making it impossible to recognize the finger gestures. To tackle this problem, we propose a signal transformation mechanism to obtain a consistent and stable signal pattern at various locations. By deploying only a pair of COTS WiFi devices, WiMorse can achieve real time recognition of finger generated Morse code with high accuracy, and is robust against input position, environment change, and user diversity.
