Nowadays, various branches of industry are based on continuous processes. Therefore, efficient and accurate data analysis became crucial for maintaining control and optimizing the monitored trials. This paper presents a novel solution for in-situ analysis of complex numerical data. The proposed system employs mixed-reality technology to visualize data and enable collaborative analysis in remote locations. The system was implemented using Microsoft HoloLens and tested in laboratory environment, with its proof-of-concept version applied to solve real expert analysis task. After the experiment NASA TLX and SUS questionnaires were filled and demonstrated improvement performance and enabling more extensive analysis, including their spatio-temporal features.
