Inertial sensors have been used for tracking applications on every scale for decades. Commercial IMUs suffer from a spectrum of errors such as axes misalignment, bias etc. leading to a drifted output. Approximation models are usually implemented to address these issues which are highly sensor-dependent with constrained testing and sometimes use complementary infrastructure which limits their use in the wild. In this demonstration we introduce 'AiRite', an effective solution for 3-D tracking of a smart device using only the onboard IMU. Trajectories of basic shapes and cursive words written in air using smart devices are visualized in 3-D, which are first observations of their kind in the field. We demonstrate device-independence and ubiquity of our tracking method by using different smartphones and smart-watches for writing in air.
