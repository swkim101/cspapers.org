In this work, we propose P-Loc, a device-free indoor localization system based on power-line network within the building. P-Loc measures the electromagnetic (EM) coupling between a human body and existing power-lines, which are simultaneously used for electric power transmission. To avoid the impact of AC mains and noise from other electrical sources, we inject a signal into the ground-line to generate the occupant location fingerprint of a specific frequency. A 0.48m average error distance is obtained in the preliminary experiments.
