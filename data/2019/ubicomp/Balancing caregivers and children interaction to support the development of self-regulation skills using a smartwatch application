Wearable computing solutions have been used to support children and adults with autism and ADHD previously. The design of these technologies, however, require a deep understanding not only of what is possible from a clinical standpoint but also how the children themselves might understand and orient towards wearable technologies, such as a smartwatch. In this work, we were interested in supporting children and their caregivers in participating in co-design to explore the issue of transitioning from self-regulation to co-regulation.
