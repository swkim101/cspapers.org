The inclusion of mobile computing in outdoor recreation raises important questions about its ability to contribute meaningfully to activities without detracting from their benefits to well-being. In this paper, we present results from our research, which seeks to explore and set directions for computing's place in outdoor recreation. Our work addresses smartphone use while hiking. Our position is that computing already has a place in outdoor recreation and can contribute meaningfully to well-being in the outdoors now and in the future.
