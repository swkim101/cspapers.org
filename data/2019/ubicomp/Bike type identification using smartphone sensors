We present an approach to identify bike types using smart-phone sensors. Knowledge of the bike type is necessary to provide ubiquitous services such as navigation services that consider bike-specific road conditions in route planning to improve driving safety. In order to differentiate between bike types, we use four machine learning classifiers. To evaluate our approach, we collected sensor readings on two routes with six rides each for two bike types. The evaluation shows very good predictive performance for all classifiers with F1 scores of up to 0.94. Overall, the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier yields the best results for both bike types and both routes.
