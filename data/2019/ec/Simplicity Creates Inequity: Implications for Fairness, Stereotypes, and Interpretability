Algorithms can be a powerful aid to decision-making - particularly when decisions rely, even implicitly, on predictions [7]. We are already seeing algorithms play this role in domains including hiring, education, lending, medicine, and criminal justice [2, 6, 10]. As is typical in machine learning applications, accuracy is an important measure for these tasks.
