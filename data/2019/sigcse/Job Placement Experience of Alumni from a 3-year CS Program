Computing educators entice students with information about stable, readily available, and lucrative careers in computing. Do our promises turn into reality for all students? We report on an in-depth alumni survey of 50 college graduates from a 3-year cohort-based program (CSin3), one year post-graduation. The majority of graduates from the two first cohorts surveyed are Hispanic, first-generation college students from a rural area in California. More than a third of the respondents (36%) are female. Notwithstanding the fast pace of the program (three years instead of the traditional four), the vast majority of graduates (88%) were full-time employed at the time of the survey and were hired less than 3 months after graduation, on average. The most common challenges that alumni reported facing professionally are: Work-life balance (36%) Cost of living (36%) Lack of diversity (25%), and Stress in current position (25%) (they could select multiple choices). While no correlation was found between GPA and job satisfaction level or annual salary, significant low grades in upper division programming courses were a common factor among unemployed alumni. We also examined differences, based on gender, in annual salary and job satisfaction level; intention to remain in the technology sector; their level of satisfaction about how well the CSin3 program prepared them professionally; correlation between job satisfaction level and choice of CS as a career; and factors and alumni's perceptions of what contributed to their success in the job market, such as their participation in an internship program and the academic enrichment activities.
