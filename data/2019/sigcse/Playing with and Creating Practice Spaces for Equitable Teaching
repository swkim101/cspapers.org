In computer science classrooms, the assumptions teachers have about students can significantly shape their interactions. Deeper understandings of the decisions impacting equity offers teacher educators and researchers new leverage in cultivating equitable teaching. Our work uses interactive online practice spaces to focus on specific teaching decisions that may be affected by teachers' assumptions about students. Teacher practice spaces are learning experiences, inspired by games and simulations, that allow teachers to rehearse and reflect on important decisions in teaching. Practice spaces are a potentially powerful approach for encoding equitable teaching strategies because they have the potential to reveal the different assumptions and interpretations which drive different teaching decisions We developed these practice spaces and embedded them within CS teacher preparation programs where they have been used by over 6,000 teachers. In this workshop, we'll use online practice spaces as a novel way to approach discussions about equity in computer science classrooms. We'll have participants try out different variations on these practice spaces, brainstorm ideas for improving existing practice space, and invite reflection about challenges they've observed in training CS teachers in equitable teaching. Participants will leave with links to practice spaces and related curriculum materials they can use in their own work.
