We describe a study of learning outcomes in an undergraduate C Programming course taught in two modalities: in-person and online. Because this course has been taught by the same instructor, using the same scaffolding activities, materials and approaches, we were uniquely positioned to conduct a quasi-experimental study of learning outcomes between courses and within students. Our goal was to glean knowledge and implications about assessment practices for undergraduate courses that are taught in two modalities. The objectives of our research are to discern what differential impacts are found between in-person and online delivery modalities. We aimed to discover learning outcome patterns among the students who participate in these modalities. Findings from this study provide valuable information for undergraduate Computer Science programs by identifying any differential learning outcomes that students experience between in-person and online course instruction. The research questions addressed were: 1) What impact does modality have on student learning outcomes? 2) What patterns are discernable across student groups 3) What relationship is there between final course grades and assignment module learning outcomes? We were surprised that no significant differences were obtained between course modality. While this is an encouraging finding, we believe that further data collection and analysis are needed, before making general conclusions. We are planning future studies to account for additional variables, such as instructor, multiple modalities, and online course design approaches.
