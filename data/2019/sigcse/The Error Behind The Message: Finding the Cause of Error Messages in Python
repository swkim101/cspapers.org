The interaction between a novice programmer, and the compiler plays a crucial role in the learning process of the novice programmer. Of particular importance is the compiler's feedback on errors in the program code. Accordingly, compiler error messages are an important and active field of research. Yet, a language that has largely been left out of this discussion so far is Python. We have collected Python programs from high school students taking introductory courses. For each collected erroneous program, we sought to classify the effective error, and assess if the student was able to fix the error. Our study is a precursor to providing improved error messages in Python, and assess their effectiveness. As such, we are eventually interested in finding ways to automatically determine the effective error, so as to base the displayed message on. From our data, we found that a considerable part of students' errors can be attributed to minor mistakes, which can easily be identified and corrected. However, beyond such minor mistakes, a proper error diagnosis might have to be based on a goal/plan analysis of the entire program. Likewise, proper assessment of whether an error has been fixed frequently requires more context than is provided by the program alone.
