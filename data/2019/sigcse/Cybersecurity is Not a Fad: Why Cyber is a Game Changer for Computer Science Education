First, the bad news - Cybersecurity is here to stay. Threats are escalating and organizations are increasingly vulnerable. Hackers are smarter, there are more of them, and they continue to wreak havoc across critical infrastructure systems. There is a huge, growing shortfall of cyber talent. All students, and especially computer science students, need to learn cyber, but there is an acute shortage of cybersecurity faculty. The good news - Cybersecurity is here to stay. We continue to need skilled cyber workers. Students like cyber. Cyber can draw more students to Computer Science and create opportunities for Computer Science faculty. Dr. Blair Taylor will share her experiences building cyber curriculum from the classroom perspective and from her experience working with NSA to build a National Cybersecurity Curriculum Program.
