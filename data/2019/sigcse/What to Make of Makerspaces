Makerspaces are areas set aside in schools, libraries, and other locations, where inventors and Do-It-Yourselfers gather to create and collaborate. Activities run the gamut from high(er) tech, such as electronic kit making and Arduino programming, 3D design and printing, to more traditional crafts such as sewing and woodworking. As makerspaces become more prevalent, the question arises where, if anywhere, do they fit into the post secondary environment, and specifically, in the computer science realm? Should computer science departments host them? What, exactly, can we do with them? They would be appear to be a good outlet for our students, allowing them to exercise their creative side, but can they do more? Can we use them to draw in non-majors, or to encourage collaboration between students in different fields? Can they be used to supplement various courses? If so, which, and how might they be used? We are interested in talking to others who have makerspace experience at the post-secondary level so that we can share ideas.
