Academic co-curricular activities (e.g., programming contests, hackathons, student ACM clubs, tutoring, internships, undergrad research) are popular with students, may promote academic engagement, and can give a leg up to students applying for jobs and grad schools. Yet information about co-curricular activities in departments and schools can be hard to come by. This BOF will provide participants with a forum for comparing notes: What co-curricular opportunities exist in your department? Does your department or school explicitly support or promote undergraduate co-curricular activities? If so, how (e.g., staff positions, faculty release time, student leadership - volunteer or for pay or credit) What have you learned from your experiences with co-curricular activities? Are co-curricular activities a good investment of department resources?
