\beginabstract Cognitive tests have been long used as a measure of student knowledge, ability, and as a predictor for success in engineering and computer science. However, these tests are not without their own problems relating to priming, difficulty (resulting in test fatigue) and time on exam. This paper discusses efforts to modify Parker et al.'s Second CS1 aptitude test (SCS1) \citeParker16 to reduce the time spent on the exam, provide greater customization to match concepts taught across three universities, and reduce redundancy of test questions all while maintaining the instrument's reliability. This instrument was modified for use on an ongoing grant investigating whether spatial abilities impact the success of students in introductory CS courses. The instrument developed in this paper is a revised shortened version of Second Computer Science 1 (SCS1) aptitude test, designated as SCS1R. \endabstract
