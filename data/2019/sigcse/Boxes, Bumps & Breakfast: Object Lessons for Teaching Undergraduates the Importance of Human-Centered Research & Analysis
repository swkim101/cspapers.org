The interdisciplinary fields of Computer Science & Engineering and Human Computer Interaction are increasingly faced with developing human-centered solutions faster, with fewer project members. As a result, while learning the process of human-centered research and design within human-computer interaction classes, CSE students often appear to feel pressured to just go ahead and start building as quickly as possible. This is not the right approach, as students will then ignore the crucial problem identification phase of any project. In order to foster the right research and analysis mindset in students, it is often necessary to get them to think outside the box, break down the bumps in the project path, and analyze the action of everyday activities. This poster presents three different object lessons I have used in the undergraduate and graduate classroom that wake students up to the need to research issues, analyze evidence and think critically about connections between people, information and technology - all before they code or make.
