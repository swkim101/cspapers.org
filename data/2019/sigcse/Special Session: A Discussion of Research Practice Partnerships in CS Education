In the summer of 2017, the National Science Foundation funded a cohort of Research Practice Partnership (RPP) projects focused on expanding access to Computer Science Education in the United States. Funded as one of the RPP projects was the RPPforCS project, a collaboration between Sagefox Consulting Group and CSforALL. The project operates as a community of practice for the individual RPP projects, holding regular webinars, producing a newsletter, and curating a discussion forum on Slack. In this special session we propose a structured poster session specifically for the RPP projects funded by the NSF.
