Program auto-graders used to be tough applications to install and use by instructors, meaning many instructors avoided them, and for those that used them, most assignments were created by specialists with scripting and other expertise. As such, creating new auto-graded programming assignments was a rare event done by just a few people. But modern cloud-based program auto-graders enable nearly any instructor or TA to create new auto-graded assignments in just tens of minutes, fully created and carried out via the web. This capability has led to an explosion in the number of instructors and TAs creating auto-graded programming assignments, benefiting students via immediate feedback and the option to resubmit, and saving teachers huge amounts of grading time. BUT, this new frontier is very different from hand-graded assignments, with plenty of pitfalls for teachers to avoid, and emerging best practices. This BOF allows teachers to share do's and don'ts, so each can improve their use of auto-graded labs, and teachers new to auto-graded labs can benefit from others' experiences. Special focus is on early CS classes (CS0, CS1, CS2) but topics may apply to many CS classes.
