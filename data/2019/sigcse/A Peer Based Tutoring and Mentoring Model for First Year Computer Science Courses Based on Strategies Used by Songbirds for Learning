Effective tutoring is not limited to humans alone. A significant amount of research in songbird learning has shown that birds' songs are not coded in the DNA like other behavioral features but learned over time through one-on-one tutoring involving experimentation, error detection and adaptation. Like students, juvenile songbirds use active listening to learn a tutor's song that is repeated multiple times. The songbird first divides the complex song into short syllables and later uses trial and error to match the syllables sequence to the tutor's song. Birds learn more effectively when listening to an adult bird from the same species. We draw a parallel to bird learning in humans by implementing one-on-one peer-based tutoring of first-year students by senior students, who share the same culture. This poster presents a successful ongoing mentoring and tutoring model used at the Computer Systems Technology department of New York City College of Technology (CUNY) for over five years. This peer-based model utilizes strategies shared by both first-year students and young birds involving social interaction, active learning and problem decomposition. Furthermore, the tutors hired were trained to use the same strategies observed in songbirds tutoring. This project has shown an increase in first-year student retention rate of 83% for students who participated in this program as compared to 61% retention for students who did not. The tutoring program impact demonstrated that the students' academic performance increased significantly (mixed model anova F(1, 247) = 29.11, p < 0.001).
