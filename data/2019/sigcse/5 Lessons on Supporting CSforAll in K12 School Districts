This lightning talk shares emerging lessons on helping K12 school districts plan around CSforAll. The CSed community rightly spends a lot time thinking about what CS to teach and how to teach it. And as efforts to bring CSed to K12 schools grow, we're starting to think more about how to support teachers through effective professional development. But we don't really know a lot about how the institutional contexts in which CSforAll efforts will succeed, or, potentially, fail - K12 districts - can approach CSed holistically. If we want to reach all kids, then districts are going to be a key leverage point to ensure that CSed efforts are equitable, rigorous and sustainable. We also know that they're incredibly complex systems that are difficult to change. In this talk we share lessons emerging from a research-practice partnership with sixteen K12 school districts. Based on studying how these districts have engaged in strategic planning and decision making, we share five emerging lessons for supporting K12 districts on their journey to make CSforAll to their schools. We focus on (1) the importance answering the question of "why CS for all students?", (2) developing a local definition of what "counts' as CS learning goals, (3) mapping existing activities and expertise related to CS, (4) integrating CSed efforts not just with existing curricula but also broader, existing institutional infrastructures, and (5) establishing coherence across learning goals, professional development, curricula and a guiding vision for CS education in a district.
