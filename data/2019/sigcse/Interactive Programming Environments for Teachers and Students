We present in this hands-on workshop a suite of interactive programming environments for teachers and students, each of them cloud-based and free. The first is CS50 Sandbox, a web app at sandbox.cs50.io that enables teachers and students to create temporary programming environments quickly and share copies of those sandboxes with others. With this app can a teacher start programs in class that students can then finish, distribute starter code for problems, and post interactive solutions. The second tool is CS50 Lab, a web app at lab.cs50.io that enables teachers to create step-by-step programming lessons, providing incremental feedback at each step, and enables students to progress from an empty file (or starter code) to working code, with hints and feedback along the way. Via this app can teachers author their own Codecademy-style lessons using just a GitHub repository of their own. And third in the suite is CS50 IDE, a web app at ide.cs50.io built atop Cloud9 that provides students with their own cloud-based Linux environment. Each of these environments offers a built-in file browser and code editor and, most importantly, an interactive terminal window with shell access to their very own container. And each enables students to write programs in any language. Throughout this workshop will we discuss lessons learned from having deployed these tools in CS50 at Harvard to hundreds of students on campus and thousands of students online. And we'll discuss challenges encountered and best practices adopted.
