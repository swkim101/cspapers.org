As projections of the shortage of cybersecurity workers grow [4], the spotlight is on cybersecurity education. In December of 2017, the Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education published Cybersecurity Curricula 2017: Curriculum Guidelines for Post-Secondary Degree Programs in Cybersecurity [6] (CSEC2017), representing a new discipline in ACM's Computing Curricula Series [5]. Now the ACM CCECC (Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges) is leading creation of a similar set of guidelines for two-year cybersecurity programs at the associate-degree level, called CSEC2Y. This special session, led by the ACM CCECC, will engage participants in the curriculum development process for associate-degree programs in the increasingly important field of cybersecurity. Participants will have the opportunity to review the current CSEC2Y draft and related materials, to recommend changes, plan further revisions, and otherwise assist in crafting the curricular guidance.
