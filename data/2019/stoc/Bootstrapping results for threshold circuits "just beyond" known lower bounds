The best known lower bounds for the circuit class TC0 are only slightly super-linear. Similarly, the best known algorithm for derandomization of this class is an algorithm for quantified derandomization (i.e., a weak type of derandomization) of circuits of slightly super-linear size. In this paper we show that even very mild quantitative improvements of either of the two foregoing results would already imply super-polynomial lower bounds for TC0. Specifically: (1) If for every c>1 and sufficiently large d∈ℕ it holds that n-bit TC0 circuits of depth d require n1+c−d wires to compute certain NC1-complete functions, then TC0≠NC1. In fact, even lower bounds for TC0 circuits of size n1+c−d against these functions when c>1 is fixed and sufficiently small would yield lower bounds for polynomial-sized circuits. Lower bounds of the form n1+c−d against these functions are already known, but for a fixed c≈2.41 that is too large to yield new lower bounds via our results. (2) If there exists a deterministic algorithm that gets as input an n-bit TC0 circuit of depth d and n1+(1.61)−d wires, runs in time 2no(1), and distinguishes circuits that accept at most B(n)=2n1−(1.61)−d inputs from circuits that reject at most B(n) inputs, then NEXP⊈TC0. An algorithm for this “quantified derandomization” task is already known, but it works only when the number of wires is n1+c−d, for c>30, and with a smaller B(n)≈2n1−(30/c)d. Intuitively, the “takeaway” message from our work is that the gap between currently-known results and results that would suffice to get super-polynomial lower bounds for TC0 boils down to the precise constant c>1 in the bound n1+c−d on the number of wires. Our results improve previous results of Allender and Koucký (2010) and of the second author (2018), respectively, whose hypotheses referred to circuits with n1+c/d wires (rather than n1+c−d wires). We also prove results similar to two results above for other circuit classes (i.e., ACC0 and CC0).
