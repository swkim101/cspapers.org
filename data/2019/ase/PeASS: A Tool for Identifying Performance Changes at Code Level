We present PeASS (Performance Analysis of Software System versions), a tool for detecting performance changes at source code level that occur between different code versions. By using PeASS, it is possible to identify performance regressions that happened in the past to fix them. PeASS measures the performance of unit tests in different source code versions. To achieve statistic rigor, measurements are repeated and analyzed using an agnostic t-test. To execute a minimal amount of tests, PeASS uses a regression test selection. We evaluate PeASS on a selection of Apache Commons projects and show that 81% of all unit test covered performance changes can be found by PeASS.
