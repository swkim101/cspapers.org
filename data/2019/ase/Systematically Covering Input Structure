Grammar-based testing uses a given grammar to produce syntactically valid inputs. To cover program features, it is necessary to also cover input featuresâ€”say, all URL variants for a URL parser. Our k-path algorithm for grammar production systematically covers syntactic elements as well as their combinations. In our evaluation, we show that this results in a significantly higher code coverage than state of the art.
