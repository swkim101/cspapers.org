Automated test generation and evaluation in simulation environments is a key technology for verification of automated driving (AD) applications. Search-based testing (SBT) is an approach for automated test generation that leverages optimization to efficiently generate interesting concrete tests from abstract test descriptions. In this experience paper, we report on our observations after successfully applying SBT to AD control applications in several use cases with different characteristics. Based on our experiences, we derive a number of lessons learned that we consider important for the adoption of SBT methods and tools in industrial settings. The key lesson is that SBT finds relevant errors and provides valuable feedback to the developers, but requires tool support for writing specifications.
