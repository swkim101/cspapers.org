"Cloud-native" container platforms, such as Kubernetes, have become an integral part of production cloud environments. One of the principles in designing cloud-native applications is called Single Concern Principle, which suggests that each container should handle a single responsibility well. In this paper, we propose X-Containers as a new security paradigm for isolating single-concerned cloud-native containers. Each container is run with a Library OS (LibOS) that supports multi-processing for concurrency and compatibility. A minimal exokernel ensures strong isolation with small kernel attack surface. We show an implementation of the X-Containers architecture that leverages Xen paravirtualization (PV) to turn Linux kernel into a LibOS. Doing so results in a highly efficient LibOS platform that does not require hardware-assisted virtualization, improves inter-container isolation, and supports binary compatibility and multi-processing. By eliminating some security barriers such as seccomp and Meltdown patch, X-Containers have up to 27X higher raw system call throughput compared to Docker containers, while also achieving competitive or superior performance on various benchmarks compared to recent container platforms such as Google's gVisor and Intel's Clear Containers.
