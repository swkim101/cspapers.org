SCALE provides a framework for load data from distributed load-sensitive modules for exploring force-based interaction. Force conveys not only the force vector itself but also rich information about activities, including way of touching, object location and body motion. Our system captures these interactions on a single pipeline of load data processing. Furthermore, we have expanded the interaction area from a flat 2D surface to 3D volume by building a mathematical framework, which enables us to capture the vertical height of a touch point. These technical invention opens broad applications, including general shape capturing and motion recognition. We have packaged the framework into a physical prototyping kit, and conducted a workshop with product designers to evaluate our system in practical scenarios.
