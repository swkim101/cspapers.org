Motivated by the celebrated Beck‐Fiala conjecture, we consider the random setting where there are n elements and m sets and each element lies in t randomly chosen sets. In this setting, Ezra and Lovett showed an O((tlogt)1/2) discrepancy bound when n ≤ m and an O(1) bound when n ≫ mt. In this paper, we give a tight O(t) bound for the entire range of n and m, under a mild assumption that t=Ω((loglogm)2) . The result is based on two steps. First, applying the partial coloring method to the case when n=mlogO(1)m and using the properties of the random set system we show that the overall discrepancy incurred is at most O(t) . Second, we reduce the general case to that of n≤mlogO(1)m using LP duality and a careful counting argument.
