The search path to the accessed element s is rebuilt as follows. Number the nodes on the search path to s bottom up, starting at zero. Make s the root and attach to the root the two paths of smaller and larger nodes respectively. Then on both paths perform the following rotations. If the nodes numbered 2k + 1 and 2k+ 2 end up in the same path, perform a rotation on the edge connecting them. In the example, we perform rotations on the edges (5,6), (7,8), and (3,4). This description of splay is a global view of splay introduced in [CGK+15]. The standard description is a bottom-up rebuild of the search path. The cost of a search (the cost of serving a request) is the length of the search path and the cost of a sequence of searches is the sum of the costs of the individual searches. We use Cost(T,X) to denote the cost of serving X with initial tree T by splay.
