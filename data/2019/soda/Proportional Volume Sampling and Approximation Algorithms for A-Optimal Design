We study optimal design problems in which the goal is to choose a set of linear measurements to obtain the most accurate estimate of an unknown vector. We study the [Formula: see text]-optimal design variant where the objective is to minimize the average variance of the error in the maximum likelihood estimate of the vector being measured. We introduce the proportional volume sampling algorithm to obtain nearly optimal bounds in the asymptotic regime when the number [Formula: see text] of measurements made is significantly larger than the dimension [Formula: see text] and obtain the first approximation algorithms whose approximation factor does not degrade with the number of possible measurements when [Formula: see text] is small. The algorithm also gives approximation guarantees for other optimal design objectives such as [Formula: see text]-optimality and the generalized ratio objective, matching or improving the previously best-known results. We further show that bounds similar to ours cannot be obtained for [Formula: see text]-optimal design and that [Formula: see text]-optimal design is NP-hard to approximate within a fixed constant when [Formula: see text].
