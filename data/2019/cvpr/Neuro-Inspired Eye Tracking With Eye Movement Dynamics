Generalizing eye tracking to new subjects/environments remains challenging for existing appearance-based methods. To address this issue, we propose to leverage on eye movement dynamics inspired by neurological studies. Studies show that there exist several common eye movement types, independent of viewing contents and subjects, such as fixation, saccade, and smooth pursuits. Incorporating generic eye movement dynamics can therefore improve the generalization capabilities. In particular, we propose a novel Dynamic Gaze Transition Network (DGTN) to capture the underlying eye movement dynamics and serve as the topdown gaze prior. Combined with the bottom-up gaze measurements from the deep convolutional neural network, our method achieves better performance for both within-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations compared to state-of-the-art. In addition, a new DynamicGaze dataset is also constructed to study eye movement dynamics and eye gaze estimation.
