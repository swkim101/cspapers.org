Image captioning has received significant attention with remarkable improvements in recent advances. Nevertheless, images in the wild encapsulate rich knowledge and cannot be sufficiently described with models built on image-caption pairs containing only in-domain objects. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by augmenting standard deep captioning architectures with object learners. Specifically, we present Long Short-Term Memory with Pointing (LSTM-P) --- a new architecture that facilitates vocabulary expansion and produces novel objects via pointing mechanism. Technically, object learners are initially pre-trained on available object recognition data. Pointing in LSTM-P then balances the probability between generating a word through LSTM and copying a word from the recognized objects at each time step in decoder stage. Furthermore, our captioning encourages global coverage of objects in the sentence. Extensive experiments are conducted on both held-out COCO image captioning and ImageNet datasets for describing novel objects, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, we obtain an average of 60.9% in F1 score on held-out COCO dataset.
