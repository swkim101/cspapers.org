Hybrid exoskeletons, which combine functional electrical stimulation (FES) with a motorized testbed, can potentially improve the rehabilitation of people with movement disorders. However, hybrid exoskeletons have inherently nonlinear and uncertain dynamics, including combinations of discrete modes that switch between different continuous dynamic subsystems, which complicate closed-loop control. A particular complication is the uncertain muscle control effectiveness associated with FES. In this work, adaptive integral concurrent learning (ICL) motor and FES controllers are developed for a hybrid biceps curl exoskeleton, which are designed to achieve opportunistic and data-based learning of the uncertain human and electromechanical testbed parameters. Global exponential trajectory tracking and parameter estimation errors are proven through a Lyapunov-based stability analysis. The motor effectiveness is assumed to be unknown, and, to help with fatigue reduction, FES is enabled to switch between multiple electrodes on the biceps brachii, further complicating the analysis. A consequence of switching between the different uncertain subsystems is that the parameters must be opportunistically learned for each subsystem (i.e. each electrode and the motor), while that subsystem is active. Experiments were performed to validate the developed ICL controllers on twelve healthy participants. The average (± standard deviation) position tracking errors across each participant were 1.44 ± 5.32 deg, −0.25 ± 2.85 deg, and −0.17 ± 2.66 deg across biceps Curls 1-3, 4-7, and 8-10, respectively, where the average across the entire experiment was 0.28 ± 3.53 deg.
