Hyperspectral images can provide rich clues for various computer vision tasks. However, the requirements of professional and expensive hardware for capturing hyperspectral images impede its wide applications. In this paper, based on a simple but not widely noticed phenomenon that the color printer can print color masks with a large number of independent spectral transmission responses, we propose a simple and low-budget scheme to capture the hyperspectral images with a random mask printed by the consumer-level color printer. Specifically, we notice that the printed dots with different colors are stacked together, forming multiplicative, instead of additive, spectral transmission responses. Therefore, new spectral transmission response uncorrelated with that of the original printer dyes are generated. With the random printed color mask, hyperspectral images could be captured in a snapshot way. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based method is developed to reconstruct the hyperspectral images from the captured image. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed system are verified on both synthetic and real captured images.
