We introduce a self-supervised learning method that focuses on beneficial properties of representation and their abilities in generalizing to real-world tasks. The method incorporates rotation invariance into the feature learning framework, one of many good and well-studied properties of visual representation, which is rarely appreciated or exploited by previous deep convolutional neural network based self-supervised representation learning methods. Specifically, our model learns a split representation that contains both rotation related and unrelated parts. We train neural networks by jointly predicting image rotations and discriminating individual instances. In particular, our model decouples the rotation discrimination from instance discrimination, which allows us to improve the rotation prediction by mitigating the influence of rotation label noise, as well as discriminate instances without regard to image rotations. The resulting feature has a better generalization ability for more various tasks. Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on standard self-supervised feature learning benchmarks.
