We propose a novel way of using videos to obtain high precision object proposals for weakly-supervised object detection. Existing weakly-supervised detection approaches use off-the-shelf proposal methods like edge boxes or selective search to obtain candidate boxes. These methods provide high recall but at the expense of thousands of noisy proposals. Thus, the entire burden of finding the few relevant object regions is left to the ensuing object mining step. To mitigate this issue, we focus instead on improving the precision of the initial candidate object proposals. Since we cannot rely on localization annotations, we turn to video and leverage motion cues to automatically estimate the extent of objects to train a Weakly-supervised Region Proposal Network (W-RPN). We use the W-RPN to generate high precision object proposals, which are in turn used to re-rank high recall proposals like edge boxes or selective search according to their spatial overlap. Our W-RPN proposals lead to significant improvement in performance for state-of-the-art weakly-supervised object detection approaches on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012.
