Great progress has been made on estimating disparity maps from stereo images. However, with the limited stereo data available in the existing datasets and unstable ranging precision of current stereo methods, industry-level stereo matching in autonomous driving remains challenging. In this paper, we construct a novel large-scale stereo dataset named DrivingStereo. It contains over 180k images covering a diverse set of driving scenarios, which is hundreds of times larger than the KITTI Stereo dataset. High-quality labels of disparity are produced by a model-guided filtering strategy from multi-frame LiDAR points. For better evaluations, we present two new metrics for stereo matching in the driving scenes, i.e. a distance-aware metric and a semantic-aware metric. Extensive experiments show that compared with the models trained on FlyingThings3D or Cityscapes, the models trained on our DrivingStereo achieve higher generalization accuracy in real-world driving scenes, while the proposed metrics better evaluate the stereo methods on all-range distances and across different classes.
