Tracking by siamese networks has achieved favorable performance in recent years. However, most of existing siamese methods do not take full advantage of spatial-temporal target appearance modeling under different contextual situations. In fact, the spatial-temporal information can provide diverse features to enhance the target representation, and the context information is important for online adaption of target localization. To comprehensively leverage the spatial-temporal structure of historical target exemplars and get benefit from the context information, in this work, we present a novel Graph Convolutional Tracking (GCT) method for high-performance visual tracking. Specifically, the GCT jointly incorporates two types of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) into a siamese framework for target appearance modeling. Here, we adopt a spatial-temporal GCN to model the structured representation of historical target exemplars. Furthermore, a context GCN is designed to utilize the context of the current frame to learn adaptive features for target localization. Extensive results on 4 challenging benchmarks show that our GCT method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers while running around 50 frames per second.
