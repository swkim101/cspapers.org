Recently, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method employing the coarse-to-fine network with the contextual attention module (CAM) has shown outstanding results in image inpainting. However, this method requires numerous computational resources due to its two-stage process for feature encoding. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present a novel network structure, called PEPSI: parallel extended-decoder path for semantic inpainting. PEPSI can reduce the number of convolution operations by adopting a structure consisting of a single shared encoding network and a parallel decoding network with coarse and inpainting paths. The coarse path produces a preliminary inpainting result with which the encoding network is trained to predict features for the CAM. At the same time, the inpainting path creates a higher-quality inpainting result using refined features reconstructed by the CAM. PEPSI not only reduces the number of convolution operation almost by half as compared to the conventional coarse-to-fine networks but also exhibits superior performance to other models in terms of testing time and qualitative scores.
