Single image calibration is the problem of predicting the camera parameters from one image. This problem is of importance when dealing with images collected in uncontrolled conditions by non-calibrated cameras, such as crowd-sourced applications. In this work we propose a method to predict extrinsic (tilt and roll) and intrinsic (focal length and radial distortion) parameters from a single image. We propose a parameterization for radial distortion that is better suited for learning than directly predicting the distortion parameters. Moreover, predicting additional heterogeneous variables exacerbates the problem of loss balancing. We propose a new loss function based on point projections to avoid having to balance heterogeneous loss terms. Our method is, to our knowledge, the first to jointly estimate the tilt, roll, focal length, and radial distortion parameters from a single image. We thoroughly analyze the performance of the proposed method and the impact of the improvements and compare with previous approaches for single image radial distortion correction.
