We present a method for predicting dense depth in scenarios where both a monocular camera and people in the scene are freely moving. Existing methods for recovering depth for dynamic, non-rigid objects from monocular video impose strong assumptions on the objectsâ€™ motion and may only recover sparse depth. In this paper, we take a data-driven approach and learn human depth priors from a new source of data: thousands of Internet videos of people imitating mannequins, i.e., freezing in diverse, natural poses, while a hand-held camera tours the scene. Since the people are stationary, training data can be created from these videos using multi-view stereo reconstruction. At inference time, our method uses motion parallax cues from the static areas of the scenes, and shows clear improvement over state-of-the-art monocular depth prediction methods. We demonstrate our method on real-world sequences of complex human actions captured by a moving hand-held camera, and show various 3D effects produced using our predicted depth.
