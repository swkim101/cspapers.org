This paper proposes a method that uses deep convolutional neural networks to achieve automatic and accurate tooth instance segmentation and identification from CBCT (cone beam CT) images for digital dentistry. The core of our method is a two-stage network. In the first stage, an edge map is extracted from the input CBCT image to enhance image contrast along shape boundaries. Then this edge map and the input images are passed to the second stage. In the second stage, we build our network upon the 3D region proposal network (RPN) with a novel learned-similarity matrix to help efficiently remove redundant proposals, speed up training and save GPU memory. To resolve the ambiguity in the identification task, we encode teeth spatial relationships as an additional feature input in the identification task, which helps to remarkably improve the identification accuracy. Our evaluation, comparison and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that our method produces accurate instance segmentation and identification results automatically and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to use neural networks to achieve automatic tooth segmentation and identification from CBCT images.
