Exploiting multi-level context information to cost volume can improve the performance of learning-based stereo matching methods. In recent years, 3-D Convolution Neural Networks (3-D CNNs) show the advantages in regularizing cost volume but are limited by unary features learning in matching cost computation. However, existing methods only use features from plain convolution layers or a simple aggregation of multi-level features to calculate cost volume, which is insufficient because stereo matching requires discriminative features to identify corresponding pixels in rectified stereo image pairs. In this paper, we propose a unary features descriptor using multi-level context ultra-aggregation (MCUA), which encapsulates all convolutional features into a more discriminative representation by intra- and inter-level features combination. Specifically, a child module that takes low-resolution images as input captures larger context information; the larger context information from each layer is densely connected to the main branch of the network. MCUA makes good usage of multi-level features with richer context and performs the image-to-image prediction holistically. We introduce our MCUA scheme for cost volume calculation and test it on PSM-Net. We also evaluate our method on Scene Flow and KITTI 2012/2015 stereo datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin and effectively improves the accuracy of stereo matching.
