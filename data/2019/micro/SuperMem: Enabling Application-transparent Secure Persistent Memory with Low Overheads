Non-volatile memory (NVM) suffers from security vulnerability to physical access based attacks due to non-volatility. To ensure data security in NVM, counter mode encryption is often used by considering its high security level and low decryption latency. However, the counter mode encryption incurs new persistence problem for crash consistency guarantee due to the requirement for atomically persisting both data and its counter. To address this problem, existing work requires a large battery backup or complex modifications on both hardware and software layers due to employing a writeback counter cache. The large battery backup is expensive and software-layer modifications limit the portability of applications from the un-encrypted NVM to the encrypted one. Our paper proposes SuperMem, an application-transparent secure persistent memory by leveraging a write-through counter cache to guarantee the atomicity of data and counter writes without the needs of a large battery backup and software-layer modifications. To reduce the performance overhead of a baseline write-through counter cache, SuperMem leverages a locality-aware counter write coalescing scheme to reduce the number of write requests by exploiting the spatial locality of counter storage and data writes. Moreover, SuperMem leverages a cross-bank counter storage scheme to efficiently distribute data and counter writes to different banks, thus speeding up writes by exploiting bank parallelism. Experimental results demonstrate that SuperMem improves the performance by about 2Ã— compared with an encrypted NVM with a baseline write-through counter cache, and achieves the performance comparable to an ideal secure NVM that exhibits the optimal performance of an encrypted NVM.
