The improvement of single-thread performance is much needed. Among the many structures that comprise a processor, the issue queue (IQ) is one of the most important structures that influences high single-thread performance. Correctly assigning the issue priority and providing high capacity efficiency are key features, but no conventional IQ organizations do not sufficiently have these. In this paper, we propose an IQ called the switching issue queue (SWQUE), which dynamically configures the IQ as a modified circular queue (CIRC-PC) or random queue with an age matrix (AGE) by responding to the degree of capacity demand. CIRC-PC corrects the issue priority when wrap-around occurs by exploiting the finding that instructions that are wrapped around are latency-tolerant. CIRC-PC is used for phases in which capacity efficiency is less important and the correct priority is more important; and AGE is used for phases in which capacity efficiency is more important. Our evaluation results using SPEC2017 benchmark programs show that SWQUE achieved higher performance by averages of 9.7% and 2.9% (up to 24.4% or 10.6%) for integer and floating-point programs, respectively, compared with AGE, which is widely used in current processors.
