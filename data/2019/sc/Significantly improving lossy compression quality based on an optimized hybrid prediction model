With the ever-increasing volumes of data produced by today's large-scale scientific simulations, error-bounded lossy compression techniques have become critical: not only can they significantly reduce the data size but they also can retain high data fidelity for postanalysis. In this paper, we design a strategy to improve the compression quality significantly based on an optimized, hybrid prediction model. Our contribution is fourfold. (1) We propose a novel, transform-based predictor and optimize its compression quality. (2) We significantly improve the coefficient-encoding efficiency for the data-fitting predictor. (3) We propose an adaptive framework that can select the best-fit predictor accurately for different datasets. (4) We evaluate our solution and several existing state-of-the-art lossy compressors by running real-world applications on a supercomputer with 8,192 cores. Experiments show that our adaptive compressor can improve the compression ratio by 112~165% compared with the second-best compressor. The parallel I/O performance is improved by about 100% because of the significantly reduced data size. The total I/O time is reduced by up to 60X with our compressor compared with the original I/O time.
