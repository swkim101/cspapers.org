In this work, we present a new operator, called Instance Mask Projection (IMP), which projects a predicted instance segmentation as a new feature for semantic segmentation. It also supports back propagation and is trainable end-to end. By adding this operator, we introduce a new way to combine top-down and bottom-up information in semantic segmentation. Our experiments show the effectiveness of IMP on both clothing parsing (with complex layering, large deformations, and non-convex objects), and on street scene segmentation (with many overlapping instances and small objects). On the Varied Clothing Parsing dataset (VCP), we show instance mask projection can improve mIOU by 3 points over a state-of-the-art Panoptic FPN segmentation approach. On the ModaNet clothing parsing dataset, we show a dramatic improvement of 20.4% compared to existing baseline semantic segmentation results. In addition, the Instance Mask Projection operator works well on other (non-clothing) datasets, providing an improvement in mIOU of 3 points on “thing” classes of Cityscapes, a self-driving dataset, over a state-of-the-art approach.
