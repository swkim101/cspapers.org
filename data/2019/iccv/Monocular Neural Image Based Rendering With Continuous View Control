Figure. 2 shows the synthesized views produced by both the pixel and depth branch, as well as the blended results. The network tends to use information from the depth branch as much as possible, and uses the pixel branch to fill-in parts that are not in the source view via a learned image prior. The mask branch correctly predicts the visibility of source view pixels in the target view. This mask can be used not only to fuse results from the pixel and depth branches, but also to combine information from multiple source views when they are available.
