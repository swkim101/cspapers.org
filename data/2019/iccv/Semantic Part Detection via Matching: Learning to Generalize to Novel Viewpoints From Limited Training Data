Detecting semantic parts of an object is a challenging task, particularly because it is hard to annotate semantic parts and construct large datasets. In this paper, we present an approach which can learn from a small annotated dataset containing a limited range of viewpoints and generalize to detect semantic parts for a much larger range of viewpoints. The approach is based on our matching algorithm, which is used for finding accurate spatial correspondence between two images and transplanting semantic parts annotated on one image to the other. Images in the training set are matched to synthetic images rendered from a 3D CAD model, following which a clustering algorithm is used to automatically annotate semantic parts of the CAD model. During the testing period, this CAD model can synthesize annotated images under every viewpoint. These synthesized images are matched to images in the testing set to detect semantic parts in novel viewpoints. Our algorithm is simple, intuitive, and contains very few parameters. Experiments show our method outperforms standard deep learning approaches and, in particular, performs much better on novel viewpoints.
