Images play a crucial role for people to express their opinions online due to the increasing popularity of social networks. While an affective image retrieval system is useful for obtaining visual contents with desired emotions from a massive repository, the abstract and subjective characteristics make the task challenging. To address the problem, this paper introduces an Attention-aware Polarity Sensitive Embedding (APSE) network to learn affective representations in an end-to-end manner. First, to automatically discover and model the informative regions of interest, we develop a hierarchical attention mechanism, in which both polarity- and emotion-specific attended representations are aggregated for discriminative feature embedding. Second, we present a weighted emotion-pair loss to take the inter- and intra-polarity relationships of the emotional labels into consideration. Guided by attention module, we weight the sample pairs adaptively which further improves the performance of feature embedding. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmark datasets show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.
