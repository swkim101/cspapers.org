Unsupervised domain transfer is the task of transferring or translating samples from a source distribution to a different target distribution. Current solutions unsupervised domain transfer often operate on data on which the modes of the distribution are well-matched, for instance have the same frequencies of classes between source and target distributions. However, these models do not perform well when the modes are not well-matched, as would be the case when samples are drawn independently from two different, but related, domains. This mode imbalance is problematic as generative adversarial networks (GANs), a successful approach in this setting, are sensitive to mode frequency, which results in a mismatch of semantics between source samples and generated samples of the target distribution. We propose a principled method of re-weighting training samples to correct for such mass shift between the transferred distributions, which we call batch weight. We also provide rigorous probabilistic setting for domain transfer and new simplified objective for training transfer networks, an alternative to complex, multi-component loss functions used in the current state-of-the art image-to-image translation models. The new objective stems from the discrimination of joint distributions and enforces cycle-consistency in an abstract, high-level, rather than pixel-wise, sense. Lastly, we experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in several image-to-image translation tasks.
