In this paper, we propose an unsupervised graph association (UGA) framework to learn the underlying viewinvariant representations from the video pedestrian tracklets. The core points of UGA are mining the underlying cross-view associations and reducing the damage of noise associations. To this end, UGA is adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) intra-camera learning stage and (2) intercamera learning stage. The former learns the intra-camera representation for each camera. While the latter builds a cross-view graph (CVG) to associate different cameras. By doing this, we can learn view-invariant representation for all person. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on seven re-id datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed UGA over most state-of-the-art unsupervised and domain adaptation re-id methods.
