We propose a variational Bayesian framework for enhancing few-shot learning performance. This idea is motivated by the fact that single point based metric learning approaches are inherently noise-vulnerable and easy-to-be-biased. In a nutshell, stochastic variational inference is invoked to approximate bias-eliminated class specific sample distributions. In the meantime, a classifier-free prediction is attained by leveraging the distribution statistics on novel samples. Extensive experimental results on several benchmarks well demonstrate the effectiveness of our distribution-driven few-shot learning framework over previous point estimates based methods, in terms of superior classification accuracy and robustness.
