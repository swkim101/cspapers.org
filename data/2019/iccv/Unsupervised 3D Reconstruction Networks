In this paper, we propose 3D unsupervised reconstruction networks (3D-URN), which reconstruct the 3D structures of instances in a given object category from their 2D feature points under an orthographic camera model. 3D-URN consists of a 3D shape reconstructor and a rotation estimator, which are trained in a fully-unsupervised manner incorporating the proposed unsupervised loss functions. The role of the 3D shape reconstructor is to reconstruct the 3D shape of an instance from its 2D feature points, and the rotation estimator infers the camera pose. After training, 3D-URN can infer the 3D structure of an unseen instance in the same category, which is not possible in the conventional schemes of non-rigid structure from motion and structure from category. The experimental result shows the state-of-the-art performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.
