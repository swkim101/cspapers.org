Dexterous robotic manipulation of unknown objects can open the way to novel tasks and applications of robots in semi-structured and unstructured settings, from advanced industrial manufacturing to exploration of harsh environments. However, it is challenging for at least three reasons: the desired motion of the object might be too complex to be described analytically, precise models of the manipulated objects are not available, the controller should simultaneously ensure both a robust grasp and an effective in-hand motion. To solve these issues we propose to learn in-hand robotic manipulation tasks from human demonstrations, using Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs), and to reproduce them with a robust compliant controller based on the Virtual Springs Framework (VSF), that employs real-time feedback of the contact forces measured on the robot fingertips. With this solution, the generalization capabilities of DMPs can be transferred successfully to the dexterous in-hand manipulation problem: we demonstrate this by presenting real-world experiments of in-hand translation and rotation of unknown objects.
