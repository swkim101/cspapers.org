When a humanoid robot manipulates a heavy object, balance and heavy loads become problems. To solve these problems, we provide a method to generate a key pose sequence of the robot and the object which balance constraints and joint torque limits are kept. As we consider the configurations of both the robot and the object, the key poses of them are optimized in a view of kinematics and statics. Moreover, we generate a smooth key pose sequence by adding an objective function which makes adjacent poses closer. By using the proposed method, we make a humanoid robot RHP4B place a heavy suitcase on a step.
