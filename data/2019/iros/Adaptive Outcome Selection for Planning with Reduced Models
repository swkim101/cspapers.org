Reduced models allow autonomous robots to cope with the complexity of planning in stochastic environments by simplifying the model and reducing its accuracy. The solution quality of a reduced model depends on its fidelity. We present 0/1 reduced model that selectively improves model fidelity in certain states by switching between using a simplified deterministic model and the full model, without significantly compromising the run time gains. We measure the reduction impact for a reduced model based on the values of the ignored outcomes and use this as a heuristic for outcome selection. Finally, we present empirical results of our approach on three different domains, including an electric vehicle charging problem using real-world data from a university campus.
