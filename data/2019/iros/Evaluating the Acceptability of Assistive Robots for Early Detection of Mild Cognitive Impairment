The employment of Social Assistive Robots (SARs) for monitoring elderly users represents a valuable gateway for at-home assistance. Their deployment in the house of the users can provide effective opportunities for early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a condition of increasing impact in our aging society, by means of digitalized cognitive tests. In this work, we present a system where a specific set of cognitive tests is selected, digitalized, and integrated with a robotic assistant, whose task is the guidance and supervision of the users during the completion of such tests. The system is then evaluated by means of an experimental study involving potential future users, in order to assess its acceptability and identify key directions for technical improvements.
