Shape morphing is at the core of future research, which shows promise for wide applications ranging from reconfigurable electronics to soft material robots. In this paper, we present a novel buckling-induced mechanism for shape morphing using dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), by bonding the planar precursor structure’s “feet” with the DEA. With spatially-varying electric fields applied, the inplane deformation of the DEA generates compressive loads to trigger buckling of planar precursors into desired three-dimensional configurations. To enlarge the achievable motion range at the “feet”, we develop a design optimization approach to the electrode arrangement which is concisely described by cosine functions. By numerically optimizing the cosine function coefficients, we obtain the optimal spatially-varying electrodes for various precursors with different patterns of bonding sites. The experimental results demonstrate the remarkable shape-morphing from two dimensions to three dimensional configurations. Our work paves the way to novel actuation mechanisms for shape-morphing structures, with advantages of rapid response and reversible controllability.
