Dynamic self-assembly is treated as a promising approach for generating a robotic swarm to perform coordinated tasks, and the assembled pattern can be tuned by regulating the energy input. However, location of a dynamically assembled pattern is hard to be determined, especially under global fields, such as magnetic field. In this paper, we report the formation and manipulation of dynamic self-assembled droplets at the air-liquid interface with the assistance of a magnetic needle. Affected by the locally induced field gradient near the needle, reconfigurable assembled droplets are obtained with higher time-efficiency, and the location of the pattern can be determined. The pattern is reversibly tuned to exhibit expansion and shrinkage by adjusting the height of the needle. Assembled droplets are able to be steered via following the needle in a controlled manner. Moreover, cargo is trapped by exploiting the induced rotational flow around the droplets, and it can also be caged into the central area of the pattern and transported to the desired location. The proposed method opens new prospects of using energy-dissipative pattern as an untethered end-effector for microrobotic manipulation.
