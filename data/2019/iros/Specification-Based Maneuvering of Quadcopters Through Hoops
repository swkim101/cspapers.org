In this paper, we study the problem of navigating quadcopters through a sequence of hoops. The specification may be given directly or indirectly via a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula. We approach this problem in three phases. First, we introduce a planner that generates a path through a given sequence of hoops. Second, we augment our planner to leverage a given specification in linear temporal logic (LTL) and generate a sequence that satisfies this specification. Third, we implement cross-entropy optimization on this planner to enhance trajectory performance where quadcopter trajectories are modified within the solution space to optimize over a cost function. We implement this planner as a novel interaction modality between users and quadcopters on the Robotarium. Simulation and experimental results are provided.
