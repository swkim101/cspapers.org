When robotic assistance is present into vitreoretinal surgery, the surgeon will experience reduced sensory input that is otherwise derived from the tool’s interaction with the eye wall (sclera). We speculate that disconnecting the surgeon from this sensory input may increase the risk of injury to the eye and affect the surgeon’s usual technique. On the other hand, robot autonomous motion to enhance patient safety might inhibit the surgeons tool manipulation and diminish surgeon comfort with the procedure. In this study, to investigate the parameters of patient safety and surgeon comfort in a robot-assisted eye surgery, we implemented three different approaches designed to keep the scleral force in a safe range during a synergic eye manipulation task. To assess the surgeon comfort during these procedures, the amount of interference with the surgeons usual maneuvers has been analyzed by defining quantitative comfort metrics. The first two utilized scleral force control approaches are based on an adaptive force control method in which the robot actively counteracts any excessive force on the sclera. The third control method is based on a virtual fixture approach in which a virtual wall is created for the surgeon in the unsafe directions of manipulation. The performance of the utilized approaches was evaluated in user studies with two experienced retinal surgeons and the outcomes of the procedure were assessed using the defined safety and comfort metrics. Results of these analyses indicate the significance of the opted control paradigm on the outcome of a safe and comfortable robot-assisted eye surgery.
