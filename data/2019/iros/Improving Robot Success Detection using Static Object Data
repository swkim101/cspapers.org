Roadside light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is commonly used to record the traffic data of the whole intersection scene or road segment in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). However, general deep-learning object detection methods do not adequately consider the static background captured by roadside LiDAR. Moreover, critical issues remain to be overcome in object detection using roadside LiDAR: false alarms caused by complex background interference and multiscale objects with limited characteristics. To this end, a feature enhancement and cascade network (FecNet) is proposed to alleviate the problems. From the perspective of feature enhancement, FecNet improves foreground feature discrimination by extracting foreground information and fusing it with feature maps of multiple stages. Also, from the perspective of feature cascade, a feature cascade backbone is proposed to enhance the localization and contextual information of multiscale objects with limited characteristics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted using a roadside LiDAR dataset. The experimental results suggest that FecNet is superior to the benchmark detectors and achieves better computational efficiency and detection accuracy.
