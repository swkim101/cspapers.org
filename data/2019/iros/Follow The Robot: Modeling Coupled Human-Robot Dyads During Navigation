Many robot applications being explored involve robots leading humans during navigation. Developing effective robots for this task requires a way for robots to understand and model a humanâ€™s following behavior. In this paper, we present results from a user study of how humans follow a guide robot in the halls of an office building. We then present a data-driven Markovian model of this following behavior, and demonstrate its generalizability across time interval and trajectory length. Finally, we integrate the model into a global planner and run a simulation experiment to investigate the benefits of coupled human-robot planning. Our results suggest that the proposed model effectively predicts how humans follow a robot, and that the coupled planner, while taking longer, leads the human significantly closer to the target position.
