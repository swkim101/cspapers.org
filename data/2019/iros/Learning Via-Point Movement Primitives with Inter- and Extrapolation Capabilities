Movement Primitives (MPs) are a promising way for representing robot motions in a flexible and adaptable manner. Due to the simple and compact form, they have been widely used in robotics. A major goal of the research activities on MPs is to learn models, which can adapt to changing task constraints, e.g. new motion targets. However, the adaptability of current MPs is limited to a small set of constraints due to their simple structures. It is indeed not a trivial task to maintain the simplicity of MPs representation and, at the same time, enhance their adaptability. In this paper, we discuss the adaptability of popular MPs such as Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) and Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMP) and propose a new simple but efficient formulation of MPs, the Via-points Movement Primitive (VMP), that can adapt to arbitrary via-points using a simple structured model that is based on the previous approaches but outperforms those in terms of extrapolation abilities.
