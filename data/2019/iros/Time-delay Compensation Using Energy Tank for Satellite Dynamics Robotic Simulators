In this work we present a novel approach which compensates the destabilising effects of the time delay intrinsic in the control loop of an admittance-controlled robot employed for satellite dynamics simulation. The method is based on an energy storing element, the tank, which is exploited by the controller to preserve the passivity of the system and to avoid instability. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the proposed method with existing energy-based approaches, namely time-domain-passivity and wave variable transformation. The performance comparison and robustness of the methods are analysed in a Montecarlo simulation and validated experimentally.
