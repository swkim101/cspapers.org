This paper focuses on a stabilization control for multi-contact motion which enables a humanoid robot to locomote by realizing dynamic contact transitions on non-flat environment. In the stabilization process of the multi-contact motion, the desired Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) is modified by the position of the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) error with respect to the 3D Center of Mass (CoM) motion generated from the force distribution ratio. The contact wrench of each end-effector is determined by quadratic optimization considering the centroidal dynamics and contact friction constraints so as to satisfy the modified ZMP. Each end-effector is controlled by optimized force reference through a projection of null space by force distribution ratio. We propose a multi-contact stabilization framework which can be designed not only to generate 3D CoM motion but also the CoM position estimation and the optimal force distribution around the reference ZMP in a unified manner from a balance controller, by using the force distribution ratio. The effectiveness of proposed method is validated by a quadruped locomotion leaning against a vertical wall using the joint position controlled humanoid HRP-5P in a dynamic simulator.
