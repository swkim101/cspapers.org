Omnidirectional catadioptric systems are popular in robotic applications thanks to their large field of view. For 3D scene reconstruction in a single shot, usually two different catadioptric cameras are needed. More cameras may contribute to better reconstruction while larger mounting space and higher power cost are required. In this paper, a single camera multi-stereo catadioptric system with vertical and horizontal baseline structure is proposed. It features achieving multi-pair of central or non-central omnidirectional stereos in a compact manner. To make the 3D reconstruction process general and adaptive to various types of system configurations, a flexible calibration and reconstruction algorithm pipeline is presented. The algorithm features approximating the system into multiple central sub-cameras and carrying out the stereo matching in a spherical representation. In addition, an effective 3D point cloud fusion algorithm is proposed to optimize the reconstruction results from multiple stereo pairs. The experiment carried out with synthetic and real data verified the feasibility and effectiveness of our system.
