The development of effective reduced order models for soft robots is paving the way toward the development of a new generation of model based techniques, which leverage classic rigid robot control. However, several soft robot features differentiate the soft-bodied case from the rigid-bodied one. First, soft robots are built to work in the environment, so the presence of obstacles in their path should always be explicitly accounted by their control systems. Second, due to the complex kinematics, the actuation of soft robots is mapped to the state space nonlinearly resulting in spaces with different sizes. Moreover, soft robots often include internal constraints and thus actuation is typically limited in the range of action and it is often unidirectional. This paper proposes a control pipeline to tackle the challenge of controlling soft robots with internal constraints in environments with obstacles. We show how the constraints on actuation can be propagated and integrated with geometrical constraints, taking into account physical limits imposed by the presence of obstacles. We present a hierarchical control architecture capable of handling these constraints, with which we are able to regulate the position in space of the tip of a soft robot with the discussed characteristics.
