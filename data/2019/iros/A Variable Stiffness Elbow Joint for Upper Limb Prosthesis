One of the main research trends toward next-generation prostheses and bionic aids is to better replicate human motor behaviours and to improve the interconnection with the human sensory-motor architecture. One of the natural characteristics of the human arm of utmost importance in our interaction with the environment is our ability to vary the mechanical impedance of our joints by commanding the co-contraction of antagonist muscles. Integration in prostheses of such features is currently under studies. The introduction of physical variable impedance in the mechatronic structure of the devices could at the same time improve interaction and robustness and allow for more sophisticated controls with the goal of naturalness of motion. The system proposed in this paper is a variable stiffness elbow joint for upper limb prostheses that reproduces mechanical abilities of the human joint, in terms of performance, inherent compliance and natural behaviour. This variable stiffness mechanism can be actively controlled by the user, and by using an agonist-antagonistic configuration of proper elastic elements, its output functions are similar to the models of the human muscle. The design and mechanical implementation of the device are detailed in this document together with its experimental validation and characterisation.
