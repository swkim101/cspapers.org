Generating robot motions from a precomputed graph has proven to be an effective approach to solving many motion planning problems. After their generation, roadmaps reduce complex motion planning problems to that of solving a graph-based shortest path. However, generating the graph can involve tradeoffs, such as how sparse or dense to make the graph. Sparse graphs may not provide enough options to navigate around a new obstacle or may result in grossly suboptimal motions. Dense graphs may take too long to search and result in an unresponsive robot. In this paper we present an algorithm that generates a graph with multiple sparse levelsâ€“ the sparsest level can be searched quickly, while the densest level allows for asymptotically optimal motions. With the paired multilevel shortest path algorithm, after the robot computes an initial solution, it can then incrementally refine the shortest-path as time allows. We demonstrate the algorithms on an articulated robot with 8 degrees of freedom, having them compute an initial solution in a fraction of the time required for a full graph search, and subsequently, incrementally refine the solution to the optimal shortest path from the densest level of the graph.
