Current methods for autonomous management use strict first-come, first-serve (FCFS) ordering to manage incoming autonomous vehicles at an intersection. In this work, we present a coordination policy that swaps agent ordering to increase the system-wide performance while ensuring that the swaps are socially compliant. By considering an agentâ€™s Social Value Orientation (SVO), a social psychology metric for their willingness to help another vehicle, the central coordinator can reduce system delays while ensuring each individual vehicle increases their own utility. The FCFS-SVO algorithm is both computationally tractable and accounts for a variety of real-world agent types, such as human drivers and a variety of social orientations. Simulation results show that average vehicle delays decrease with swapping by enabling cooperation between agents. In addition, we show that the proportion of human drivers, as well as, the distribution of prosocial and egoistic vehicles in the system can have a prominent effect on the performance of the system.
