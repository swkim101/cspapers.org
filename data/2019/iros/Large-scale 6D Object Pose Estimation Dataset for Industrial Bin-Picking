In this paper, we introduce a new public dataset for 6D object pose estimation and instance segmentation for industrial bin-picking. The dataset comprises both synthetic and real-world scenes. For both, point clouds, depth images, and annotations comprising the 6D pose (position and orientation), a visibility score, and a segmentation mask for each object are provided. Along with the raw data, a method for precisely annotating real-world scenes is proposed.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public dataset for 6D object pose estimation and instance segmentation for bin-picking containing sufficiently annotated data for learning-based approaches. Furthermore, it is one of the largest public datasets for object pose estimation in general. The dataset is publicly available at http://www.bin-picking.ai/en/ dataset.html.
