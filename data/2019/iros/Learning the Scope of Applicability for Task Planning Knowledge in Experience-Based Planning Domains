Experience-based planning domains (EBPDs) have been proposed to improve problem solving by learning from experience. They rely on acquiring and using task knowledge, i.e., activity schemata, for generating solutions to problem instances in a class of tasks. Using Three-Valued Logic Analysis (TVLA), we extend our previous work to generate a set of conditions that determine the scope of applicability of an activity schema. The inferred scope is an abstract representation of a potentially unbounded set of problems, in the form of a 3-valued logical structure, which is used to test the applicability of the respective activity schema for solving different task problems. We validate this work on two classical planning domains and a simulated PR2 in Gazebo.
