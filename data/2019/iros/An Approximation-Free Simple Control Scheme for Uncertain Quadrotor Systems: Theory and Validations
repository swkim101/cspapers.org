In this paper, a simple tracking control scheme is proposed for quadrotor systems with uncertain dynamics. It precludes the necessity for prohibitive analytic computation of the derivatives of the desired (virtual) attitude that is typically employed in controlling quadrotor systems. Moreover, this control scheme is approximation-free in the sense that it does not incorporate any adaptive laws, observers, or command filters to compensate for unknown parameters in the dynamics and the absence of the analytic differentiation, thus exhibiting remarkably low complexity levels and making its implementation straightforward. The thrust saturation is approached in the position control design which also enables the singularity in desired attitude extraction to be avoided entirely. It is demonstrated that based on the proposed scheme, the tracking errors can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately selecting design parameters. Extensive simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of our scheme.
