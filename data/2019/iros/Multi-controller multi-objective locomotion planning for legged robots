Different legged robot locomotion controllers offer different advantages; from speed of motion to energy, computational demand, safety and others. In this paper we propose a method for planning locomotion with multiple controllers and sub-planners, explicitly considering the multi-objective nature of the legged locomotion planning problem. The planner first obtains body paths extended with a choice of controller or sub-planner, and then fills the gaps by sub-planning. The method leads to paths with a mix of static and dynamic walking which only plan footsteps where necessary. We show that our approach is faster than pure footstep planning methods both in computation (2x) and mission time (1.4x), and safer than pure dynamic-walking methods. In addition, we propose two methods for aggregating the multiple objectives in search-based planning and reach desirable trade-offs without weight tuning. We show that they reach desirable Pareto-optimal solutions up to 8x faster than fairly-tuned traditional weighted-sum methods. Our conclusions are drawn from a combination of planning, physics simulation, and real robot experiments.
