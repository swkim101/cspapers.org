A continuous collision checking method for a cable-driven parallel robot with an embarked robotic arm is proposed in this paper. The method aims at validating paths by checking for collisions between any pair of robot bodies (mobile platform, cables, and arm links). For a pair of bodies, an upper bound on their relative velocity and a lower bound on the distance between the bodies are computed and used to validate a portion of the path. These computations are done repeatedly until a collision is found or the path is validated. The method is integrated within the Humanoid Path Planner (HPP) software, tested with the cable-driven parallel robot CoGiRo, and compared to a discretized validation method.
