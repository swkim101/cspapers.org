In this work, we propose a framework to learn an inverse model of redundant systems. We address three problems. By formalizing what it actually means to learn an inverse model, we derive a method where the inverse model, represented as a neural network, is learned by minimizing an upper bound on the real performance error, which is provided by a forward model (kernel regression or Gaussian process) learned on the currently available data. Most machine learning methods focus on learning the mapping of the function. For inverse models, it is, however, crucial to know the reachable set of the true forward model, since this becomes the domain of the inverse. Therefore, we secondly propose a method to estimate the reachable set of the system. Finally, we develop an active exploration strategy that is based on maximizing a lower bound on the true fill-distance to efficiently generate the data in the high dimensional input space. A key feature of our method is that the resulting learned inverse model provides error bounds on its performance.From an application point of view, this work is motivated by learning to control musculoskeletal systems. In the experiments, we show for both a simulated model of a human arm with six muscles and a real muscle-driven robot that the proposed method is able to learn the reachable set of these systems as well as a policy that enables to accurately control the position.
