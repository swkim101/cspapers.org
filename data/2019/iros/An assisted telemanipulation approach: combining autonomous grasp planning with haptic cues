This paper presents an assisted telemanipulation approach with integrated grasp planning. It also studies how the human teleoperation performance benefits from the incorporated visual and haptic cues while manipulating objects in cluttered environments. The developed system combines the widely used master-slave teleoperation with our previous model-free and learning-free grasping algorithm by means of a dynamic grasp re-ranking strategy and a semi-autonomous reach-to-grasptrajectory guidance. The proposed re-ranking metric helps in dynamically updating the stable grasps based on the current state of the slave device. The trajectory guidance system assists in maintaining smooth trajectory by controlling the haptic forces. A virtual pose controller has been integrated with the guidance scheme to automatically correct the end-effector orientation while reaching towards the grasp. Various experiments are conducted evaluating the proposed method using a six degrees of freedom (dof) haptic master and a seven dof slave robot. Results obtained with these tests along with the results gathered from the performed human-factor trials demonstrate the efficiency of our method in terms of objective metrics of task completion, and also subjective metrics of user experience.
