Design automation for continuous-flow microfluidic large-scale integration (mLSI) biochips has made remarkable progress over the past few years. Nowadays a biochip containing up to hundreds of components can be automatically synthesized within a few minutes. However, the current advanced design automation tools are mostly developed for research use, which focus essentially on the algorithmic performance but overlook the accessibility. Therefore, we have started the Cloud Columba project since 2017 to provide users from different backgrounds with easy access to the state-of-the-art design automation approaches. Without being limited by the computing power of their end devices, users just need to formulate their design requests in a high abstraction level, based on which the cloud server will automatically synthesize a customized manufacturing-ready biochip design, which can be viewed and stored using simply a web browser. With the computer-synthesized designs, Cloud Columba supports application developers to explore a wider range of possibilities, and algorithm developers to validate and improve their ideas based on a practical foundation.
