The ever increasing computational cost of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and the demand for energy efficient hardware for DNN acceleration has made accuracy and hardware cost co-optimization for DNNs tremendously important, especially for edge devices. Owing to the large parameter space and cost of evaluating each parameter in the search space, manually tuning of DNN hyperparameters is impractical. Automatic joint DNN and hardware hyperparameter optimization is indispensable for such problems. Bayesian optimization-based approaches have shown promising results for hyperparameter optimization of DNNs. However, most of these techniques have been developed without considering the underlying hardware, thereby leading to inefficient designs. Further, the few works that perform joint optimization are not generalizable and mainly focus on CMOS-based architectures. In this work, we present a novel pseudo agent-based multiobjective hyperparameter optimization (PABO) for maximizing the DNN performance while obtaining low hardware cost. Compared to the existing methods, our work poses a theoretically different approach for joint optimization of accuracy and hardware cost and focuses on memristive crossbar based accelerators. PABO uses a supervisor agent to establish connections between the posterior Gaussian distribution models of network accuracy and hardware cost requirements. The agent reduces the mathematical complexity of the co-optimization problem by removing unnecessary computations and updates of acquisition functions, thereby achieving significant speed-ups for the optimization procedure. PABO outputs a Pareto frontier that underscores the trade-offs between designing high-accuracy and hardware efficiency. Our results demonstrate a superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods both in terms of accuracy and computational speed (âˆ¼100x speed up).
