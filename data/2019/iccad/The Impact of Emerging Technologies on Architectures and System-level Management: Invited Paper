The goal of this work is to introduce and discuss different kinds of emerging technologies for logic circuitry and memory with respect to the key question of how they will impact future system-on-chip architectures and system-level management techniques. It is obvious that emerging technologies should have an impact there in order to fully exploit their technological advantages but also in order to deal with any disadvantages they might come with. In this special session paper, three promising emerging technologies are presented: (i) Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistor (NCFET) as a new CMOS technology with advantages primarily for low-power design, (ii) Ferroelectric FET (FeFET) as a non-volatile, area-efficient and low-power combined logic and memory as well as (iii) a Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive RAM (ReRAM) offering a large potential for tackling the memory wall problem in the von Neumann architecture. Our analysis demonstrates that not only new computing paradigms are promoted by these new technologies, it will also be seen that the trade-offs between the classical design parameters of low power, performance etc. will shift and hence emerging technologies will offer new Pareto points in the design space of future on-chip architectures. In that context, this work is unique as it bridges the gap between the technology side and system/architecture-level side to draw a vision of new technologies and their impact on architectures and system-level management.
