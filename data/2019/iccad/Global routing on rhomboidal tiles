We suggest a new model and algorithms for global routing in chip design. Traditional global routing covers the chip with a 3D grid graph. However, terminals are implicitly mapped to tile centers, any tile-internal wiring is largely ignored, hindering accurate congestion estimates, and the structure of the nets is altered. To overcome these deficiencies, we propose a new model that always considers exact pin and wire positions. We work with rhomboidal tiles and pack Steiner trees rather into the tiles than into a grid graph. We present a new algorithm for computing shortest paths with respect to tile prices, exploiting the rhomboidal shape of the tiles. We then solve the Steiner tree packing problem using the min-max resource sharing algorithm to approximately minimize the total wire length subject to wire density constraints. Our results are routes connecting to pin shapes which correlate well with detailed routing in terms of wire length and via count. Moreover, our rhomboidal model allows us to scale up the tile size and still produce reliable input for the detailed router. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach with experimental results on industrial chips.
