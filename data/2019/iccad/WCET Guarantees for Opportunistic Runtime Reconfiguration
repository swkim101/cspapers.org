Time-critical systems need to be analyzable for timing guarantees. There is an increasing demand for predictable performance that modern processor architectures fail to provide since they focus on average-case performance only. Recent work has demonstrated that runtime reconfiguration of hardware accelerators via an FPGA is a viable way to achieve high performance for optimized worst-case execution time (WCET) guarantees. Since execution of the worst-case path is highly improbable, configuring accelerators for this path costs reconfigurable area that could better be used to accelerate more probable paths. This work presents the first approach that comprises (1) an online average-case execution time (ACET) optimization while (2) maintaining the optimized WCET guarantee utilizing reconfigurable accelerators. We achieve this by a new design-time technique which determines the runtime slack bounds that allow speculative reconfiguration of accelerators that benefit the ACET. Combined with an online slack monitoring approach that introduces negligible overheads by using a performance counter, we show a runtime reduction of up to 10.4% for a complex and real-world application on top of an already-optimized WCET guarantee.
