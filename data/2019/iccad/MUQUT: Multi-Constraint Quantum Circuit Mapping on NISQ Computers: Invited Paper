Rapid advancement in the domain of quantum technologies have opened up researchers to the real possibility of experimenting with quantum circuits, and simulating small-scale quantum programs. Nevertheless, the quality of currently available qubits and environmental noise pose a challenge in smooth execution of the quantum circuits. Therefore, efficient design automation flows for mapping a given algorithm to the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer becomes of utmost importance. State-of-the-art quantum design automation tools are primarily focused on reducing logical depth, gate count and qubit counts with recent emphasis on topology-aware (nearest-neighbour compliance) mapping. In this work, we extend the technology mapping flows to simultaneously consider the topology and gate fidelity constraints while keeping logical depth and gate count as optimization objectives. We provide a comprehensive problem formulation and multi-tier approach towards solving it. The proposed automation flow is compatible with commercial quantum computers, such as IBM QX and Rigetti. Our simulation results over 10 quantum circuit benchmarks, show that the fidelity of the circuit can be improved up to 3.37 × with an average improvement of 1.87 ×.
