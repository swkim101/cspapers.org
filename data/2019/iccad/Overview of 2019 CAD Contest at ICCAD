The “CAD Contest at ICCAD” is a challenging, multi-month, research and development competition, focusing on advanced, real-world problems in the field of electronic design automation (EDA). Since 2012, the contest has published many sophisticated circuit design problems, from system-level design to physical design, together with industrial benchmarks and solution evaluators. Contestants can participate in one or more problems provided by EDA/IC industry. The winners will be awarded at an ICCAD special session dedicated to this contest. Every year, the contest attracts more than a hundred teams, fosters productive industry-academia collaborations, and leads to hundreds of publications in top-tier conferences and journals. The contest keeps enhancing impact and boosting EDA research.
