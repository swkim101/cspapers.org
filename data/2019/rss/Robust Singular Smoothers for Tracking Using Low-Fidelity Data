Tracking underwater autonomous platforms is often difficult because of noisy, biased, and discretized input data. Classic filters and smoothers based on standard assumptions of Gaussian white noise break down when presented with any of these challenges. Robust models (such as the Huber loss) and constraints (e.g. maximum velocity) are used to attenuate these issues. Here, we consider robust smoothing with singular covariance, which covers bias and correlated noise, as well as many specific model types, such as those used in navigation. In particular, we show how to combine singular covariance models with robust losses and state-space constraints in a unified framework that can handle very low-fidelity data. A noisy, biased, and discretized navigation dataset from a submerged, low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) package, with ultra short baseline (USBL) data for ground truth, provides an opportunity to stress-test the proposed framework with promising results. We show how robust modeling elements improve our ability to analyze the data, and present batch processing results for 10 minutes of data with three different frequencies of available USBL position fixes (gaps of 30 seconds, 1 minute, and 2 minutes). The results suggest that the framework can be extended to real-time tracking using robust windowed estimation.
