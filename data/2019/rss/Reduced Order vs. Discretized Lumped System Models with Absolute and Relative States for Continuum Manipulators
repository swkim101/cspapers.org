—A reliable, accurate, and yet simple dynamic model is important to analyze, design and control continuum manipulators. Such models should be fast, as simple as possible and user-friendly to be widely accepted by the ever-growing robotics research community. In this study, we introduce two new mod- eling methods for continuum manipulators: a general reduced-order model (ROM) and a discretized model with absolute states and Euler-Bernoulli beam segments (EBA). Additionally, a new formulation is presented for a recently introduced discretized model based on Euler-Bernoulli beam segments and relative states (EBR). The models are validated in comparison to ex- perimental results for dynamics of a STIFF-FLOP continuum appendage. Our comparison shows higher simulation accuracy (8-14% normalized error) and numerical robustness of the ROM model for a system with small number of states, and computational efﬁciency of the EBA model with near real-time performances that makes it suitable for large systems. The challenges with designing control and observation scenarios are brieﬂy discussed in the end.
