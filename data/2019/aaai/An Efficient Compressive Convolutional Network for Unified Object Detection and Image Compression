This paper addresses the challenge of designing efficient framework for real-time object detection and image compression. The proposed Compressive Convolutional Network (CCN) is basically a compressive-sensing-enabled convolutional neural network. Instead of designing different components for compressive sensing and object detection, the CCN optimizes and reuses the convolution operation for recoverable data embedding and image compression. Technically, the incoherence condition, which is the sufficient condition for recoverable data embedding, is incorporated in the first convolutional layer of the CCN model as regularization; Therefore, the CCN convolution kernels learned by training over the VOC and COCO image set can be used for data embedding and image compression. By reusing the convolution operation, no extra computational overhead is required for image compression. As a result, the CCN is 3.1 to 5.0 fold more efficient than the conventional approaches. In our experiments, the CCN achieved 78.1 mAP for object detection and 3.0 dB to 5.2 dB higher PSNR for image compression than the examined compressive sensing approaches.
