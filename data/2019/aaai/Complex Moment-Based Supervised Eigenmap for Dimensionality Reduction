Dimensionality reduction methods that project highdimensional data to a low-dimensional space by matrix trace optimization are widely used for clustering and classification. The matrix trace optimization problem leads to an eigenvalue problem for a low-dimensional subspace construction, preserving certain properties of the original data. However, most of the existing methods use only a few eigenvectors to construct the low-dimensional space, which may lead to a loss of useful information for achieving successful classification. Herein, to overcome the deficiency of the information loss, we propose a novel complex moment-based supervised eigenmap including multiple eigenvectors for dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, the proposed method provides a general formulation for matrix trace optimization methods to incorporate with ridge regression, which models the linear dependency between covariate variables and univariate labels. To reduce the computational complexity, we also propose an efficient and parallel implementation of the proposed method. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method is competitive compared with the existing dimensionality reduction methods for the recognition performance. Additionally, the proposed method exhibits high parallel efficiency.
