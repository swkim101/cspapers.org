We study the ability of a simple mutation-only evolutionary algorithm to solve propositional satisfiability formulas with inherent community structure. We show that the community structure translates to good fitness-distance correlation properties, which implies that the objective function provides a strong signal in the search space for evolutionary algorithms to locate a satisfying assignment efficiently. We prove that when the formula clusters into communities of size s ∈ ω(logn) ∩O(nε/(2ε+2)) for some constant 0
