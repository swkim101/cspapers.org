Previously, researchers paid no attention to the creation of unambiguous morpheme embeddings independent from the corpus, while such information plays an important role in expressing the exact meanings of words for parataxis languages like Chinese. In this paper, after constructing the Chinese lexical and semantic ontology based on word-formation, we propose a novel approach to implanting the structured rational knowledge into distributed representation at morpheme level, naturally avoiding heavy disambiguation in the corpus. We design a template to create the instances as pseudo-sentences merely from the pieces of knowledge of morphemes built in the lexicon. To exploit hierarchical information and tackle the data sparseness problem, the instance proliferation technique is applied based on similarity to expand the collection of pseudo-sentences. The distributed representation for morphemes can then be trained on these pseudo-sentences using word2vec. For evaluation, we validate the paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations of morpheme embeddings, and apply the obtained embeddings to word similarity measurement, achieving significant improvements over the classical models by more than 5 Spearman scores or 8 percentage points, which shows very promising prospects for adoption of the new source of knowledge.
