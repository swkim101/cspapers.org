We introduce the discussion mechanism into the multiagent communicating encoder-decoder architecture for Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks and prove that by applying the discussion mechanism, the communication between agents becomes more effective. Generally speaking, an encoder-decoder architecture predicts target-sequence word by word in several time steps. At each time step of prediction, agents with the discussion mechanism predict the target word after several discussion steps. In the first step of discussion, agents make their choice independently and express their decision to other agents. In the next discussion step, agents collect other agentsâ€™ decision to update their own decisions, then express the updated decisions to others again. After several iterations, the agents make their final decision based on a well-communicated situation. The benefit of the discussion mechanism is that multiple encoders can be designed as different structures to fit the specified input or to fetch different representations of inputs.We train and evaluate the discussion mechanism on Table to Text Generation, Text Summarization and Image Caption tasks, respectively. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent discussion mechanism is helpful for maximizing the utility of the communication between agents.
