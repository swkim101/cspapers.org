We are developing Texera, an open source system that allows users to perform data analysis on a computing cluster using a GUI-based workflow. A unique functionality of the system is its support for interactive and responsive debugging on dataflows during their execution, while still being scalable and fault tolerant. In particular, users can pause/resume a workflow, investigate the state of operators, change the behavior of an operator, and set conditional breakpoints. In this way, a user will not feel "in the dark" during the long-running execution of an analytics task, a problem faced by other big data processing frameworks. In this demonstration we show this powerful functionality in Texera.
