Shopping in VR malls has been regarded as a paradigm shift for E-commerce, but most of the conventional VR shopping platforms are designed for a single user. In this paper, we envisage a scenario of VR group shopping, which brings major advantages over conventional group shopping in brick-and-mortar stores and Web shopping: 1) configure flexible display of items and partitioning of subgroups to address individual interests in the group, and 2) support social interactions in the subgroups to boost sales. Accordingly, we formulate the Social-aware VR Group-Item Configuration (SVGIC) problem to configure a set of displayed items for flexibly partitioned subgroups of users in VR group shopping. We prove SVGIC is APX-hard and also NP-hard to approximate within [EQUATION]. We design a 4-approximation algorithm based on the idea of Co-display Subgroup Formation (CSF) to configure proper items for display to different subgroups of friends. Experimental results on real VR datasets and a user study with hTC VIVE manifest that our algorithms outperform baseline approaches by at least 30.1% of solution quality.
