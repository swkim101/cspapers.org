We frequently compute a score for each item in a data set, sometimes for its intrinsic value, but more often as a step towards classification, ranking, and so forth. The importance of computing this score fairly cannot be overstated. In this tutorial, we will develop a framework for how to think about this task, and then present techniques for responsible scoring and link these to traditional data management challenges.
