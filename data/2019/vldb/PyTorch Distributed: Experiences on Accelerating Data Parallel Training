EDDIS is a novel distributed deep learning library designed to efficiently utilize heterogeneous GPU resources for training deep neural networks (DNNs), addressing scalability and communication challenges in distributed training environments. It offers three training modes (synchronous, asynchronous, and hybrid) and supports TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. EDDIS significantly accelerates DNN training in heterogeneous GPU settings, achieving up to 17.5x faster training with 16 nodes compared to a single node. Remarkably, the Hybrid training mode surpasses Horovod, achieving training speeds 2.53 times faster for the ResNet50 model.
