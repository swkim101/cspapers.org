This paper presents a new technique for migrating data between different schemas. Our method expresses the schema mapping as a Datalog program and automatically synthesizes a Datalog program from simple input-output examples to perform data migration. This approach can transform data between different types of schemas (e.g., relational-tograph, document-to-relational) and performs synthesis efficiently by leveraging the semantics of Datalog. We implement the proposed technique as a tool called Dynamite and show its effectiveness by evaluating Dynamite on 28 realistic data migration scenarios.
