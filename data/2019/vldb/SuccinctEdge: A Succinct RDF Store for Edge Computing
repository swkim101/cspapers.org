As edge computing is becoming a new platform for rich applications and services, it becomes more and more important to design adapted data management systems for this environment. In this paper, we present a prototype corresponding to a compact, in-memory RDF store that can answer SPARQL queries requiring reasoning services without necessitating any decompression. This demonstration highlights a design based on succinct data structures, shows some implementation details and provides encouraging performance measures over a set of real-world and synthetic data and query sets.
