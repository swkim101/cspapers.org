 Pointwise order dependencies (PODs) are dependencies that specify ordering semantics on attributes of tuples. POD discovery refers to the process of identifying the set Σ of valid and minimal PODs on a given data set
 D.
 In practice
 D
 is typically large and keeps changing, and it is prohibitively expensive to compute Σ from scratch every time. In this paper, we make a first effort to study the incremental POD discovery problem, aiming at computing changes ΔΣ to Σ such that Σ ⊕ ΔΣ is the set of valid and minimal PODs on
 D
 with a set Δ
 D
 of tuple insertion updates. (1) We first propose a novel indexing technique for inputs Σ and
 D.
 We give algorithms to build and choose indexes for Σ and
 D
 , and to update indexes in response to Δ
 D.
 We show that POD violations
 w.r.t.
 Σ incurred by Δ
 D
 can be efficiently identified by leveraging the proposed indexes, with a cost dependent on
 log
 (|
 D
 |). (2) We then present an effective algorithm for computing ΔΣ, based on Σ and identified violations caused by Δ
 D.
 The PODs in Σ that become invalid on
 D
 + Δ
 D
 are efficiently detected with the proposed indexes, and further new valid PODs on
 D
 + Δ
 D
 are identified by refining those invalid PODs in Σ on
 D
 + Δ
 D.
 (3) Finally, using both real-life and synthetic datasets, we experimentally show that our approach outperforms the batch approach that computes from scratch, up to orders of magnitude.
