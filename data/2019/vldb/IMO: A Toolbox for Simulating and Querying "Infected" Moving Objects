Due to the widespread use of GPS-enabled devices such as smartphones, the research field of moving objects databases has been quite active in the past decade. Human movements are recorded, managed and analyzed for a plethora of applications. In this demo, we introduce a toolbox named IMO to simulate and query infected moving objects. This is primarily motivated by COVID-19 virus pandemic recently. We model the spreading behavior to demonstrate when and where people are infected. The protection policy is simulated such that one can see the isolation and self protection effects such as human movement restriction and the wearing of masks. Optimization techniques are developed to enhance the performance, including data storage, data partition and index structures. This is not a standalone software but a toolbox embedded in SECONDO, an open source and extensible database system. To the best of our knowledge, simulating and querying infected objects are not supported in existing moving objects prototype systems. Demo attendees can conveniently pose their queries and adjust parameters in the interface and the system will visualize the result after only a short delay.
