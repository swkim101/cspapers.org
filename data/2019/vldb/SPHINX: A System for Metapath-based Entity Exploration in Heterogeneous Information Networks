We present SPHINX, a system for metapath-based entity exploration in Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). SPHINX allows users to define different views over a HIN based on both automatically selected and user-defined meta-paths. Then, entity ranking and similarity search can be performed over these views to find and explore entities of interest, taking also into account any spatial or temporal properties of entities. A Web-based user interface is provided to facilitate users in performing the various functionalities supported by the system, including metapath-based view definition, index construction, search parameters specification, and visual comparison of the results.
