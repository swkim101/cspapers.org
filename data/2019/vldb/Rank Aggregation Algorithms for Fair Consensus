Aggregating multiple rankings in a database is an important task well studied by the database community. High-stakes application domains include hiring, lending, and education where multiple decision makers rank candidates and their input is then combined into an overall consensus ranking. While state-of-art aggregation methods succeed in giving equal say to each decision maker, to date no methods ensure fair representation for groups of candidates being ranked, who risk being impacted by discriminatory bias. We present the first solution to this open problem of guaranteeing fairness for disadvantaged groups of candidates, while still producing a good consensus of the base rankings. We design a family of exact fair algorithms achieving optimality for fair rank aggregation. We also develop approximate methods achieving fairness with guaranteed minimal approximation error scaling to millions of candidates in the rankings. A comparative study evaluates our proposed methods, revealing trade-offs between aggregation accuracy and different degrees of unfair bias in a rich variety of rank aggregation scenarios. Our real-world case study demonstrates that our solutions mitigate unfair bias using real-world data.
