As applications in large organizations evolve, the machine learning (ML) models that power them must adapt the same predictive tasks to newly arising data modalities (e.g., a new video content launch in a social media application requires existing text or image models to extend to video). To solve this problem, organizations typically create ML pipelines from scratch. However, this fails to utilize the domain expertise and data they have cultivated from developing tasks for existing modalities. We demonstrate how organizational resources, in the form of aggregate statistics, knowledge bases, and existing services that operate over related tasks, enable teams to construct a common feature space that connects new and existing data modalities. This allows teams to apply methods for data curation (e.g., weak supervision and label propagation) and model training (e.g., forms of multi-modal learning) across these different data modalities. We study how this use of organizational resources composes at production scale in over 5 classification tasks at Google, and demonstrate how it reduces the time needed to develop models for new modalities from months to weeks or days.
