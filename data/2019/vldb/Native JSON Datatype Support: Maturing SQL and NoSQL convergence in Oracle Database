Both RDBMS and NoSQL database vendors have added varying degrees of support for storing and processing JSON data. Some vendors store JSON directly as text while others add new JSON type systems backed by binary encoding formats. The latter option is increasingly popular as it enables richer type systems and efficient query processing. In this paper, we present our new native JSON datatype and how it is fully integrated with the Oracle Database ecosystem to transform Oracle Database into a mature platform for serving both SQL and NoSQL style access paradigms. We show how our uniquely designed Oracle Binary JSON format (OSON) is able to speed up both OLAP and OLTP workloads over JSON documents.
