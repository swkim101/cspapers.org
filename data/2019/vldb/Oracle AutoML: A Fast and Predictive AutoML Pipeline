Machine learning (ML) is at the forefront of the rising popularity of data-driven software applications. The resulting rapid proliferation of ML technology, explosive data growth, and shortage of data science expertise have caused the industry to face increasingly challenging demands to keep up with fast-paced develop-and-deploy model lifecycles. Recent academic and industrial research efforts have started to address this problem through automated machine learning (AutoML) pipelines and have focused on model performance as the first-order design objective. We present Oracle AutoML, a novel iteration-free AutoML pipeline designed to not only provide accurate models, but also in a shorter runtime. We are able to achieve these objectives by eliminating the need to continuously iterate over various pipeline configurations. In our feed-forward approach, each pipeline stage makes decisions based on metalearned proxy models that can predict candidate pipeline configuration performances before building the full final model. Our approach, which builds and tunes only the best candidate pipeline, achieves better scores at a fraction of the time compared to state-of-the-art open source AutoML tools, such as H2O and Auto-sklearn. This makes Oracle AutoML a prime candidate for addressing current industry challenges.
