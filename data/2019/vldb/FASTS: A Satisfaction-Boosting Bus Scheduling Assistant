In this paper, we demonstrate a satisfaction-boosting bus scheduling assistant called FASTS, which assists users to ﬁnd an optimal bus schedule. FASTS performs bus scheduling based on the constraints speciﬁed by the user in either a coarse-grained or a ﬁne-grained manner, supports diﬀerent explorations with a varying number of constraints, and provides analysis to quantify the performance of bus schedules and presents the results in a visually pleasing way. We demonstrate FASTS using real-world bus routes (396 routes) and one-week bus touch-on/touch-oﬀ records (28 million trip records) in Singapore.
