Automated generation of a right set of materialized views is a challenging task. It is a highly desirable feature for autonomous databases. The selection of materialized views must be based on cost and verifiable in the actual database environment. This paper describes an automated system that generates, selects, verifies, and maintains materialized views in the Oracle RDBMS; it presents a novel technique, called the extended covering sub-expression algorithm, for the automated generation of materialized views. An extensive set of experiments is described that demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of this approach. This system has been fully implemented and is going to be deployed on the Oracle Autonomous Database on the Cloud.
