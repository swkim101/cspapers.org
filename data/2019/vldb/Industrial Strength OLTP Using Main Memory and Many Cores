GaussDB, and its open source version named openGauss, are Huawei's relational database management systems (RDBMS), featuring a primary disk-based storage engine. This paper presents a new storage engine for GaussDB that is optimized for main memory and many cores. We started from a research prototype which exploits the power of the hardware but is not useful for customers. This paper describes the details of turning this prototype to an industrial storage engine, including integration with GaussDB. Standard benchmarks show that the new engine provides more than 2.5x performance improvement to GaussDB for full TPC-C on Intel's x86 many-cores servers, as well as on Huawei TaiShan servers powered by ARM64-based Kunpeng CPUs.
