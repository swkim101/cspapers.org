Most current approaches to metaphor identi-ﬁcation use restricted linguistic contexts, e.g. by considering only a verb’s arguments or the sentence containing a phrase. Inspired by pragmatic accounts of metaphor, we argue that broader discourse features are crucial for better metaphor identiﬁcation. We train simple gradient boosting classiﬁers on representations of an utterance and its surrounding discourse learned with a variety of document embedding methods, obtaining near state-of-the-art results on the 2018 VU Amsterdam metaphor iden-tiﬁcation task without the complex metaphor-speciﬁc features or deep neural architectures employed by other systems. A qualitative analysis further conﬁrms the need for broader context in metaphor processing.
