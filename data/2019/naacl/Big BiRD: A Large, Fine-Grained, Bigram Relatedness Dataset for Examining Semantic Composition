major problem in machine learning. Researchers have given considerable attention to the applications in many real-world scenarios. Although several works have utilized the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to select potentially optimal classiﬁers in imbalanced classiﬁcations, limited studies have been devoted to ﬁnding the classiﬁcation threshold for testing or unknown datasets. In general, the classiﬁcation threshold is simply set to 0.5, which is usually unsuitable for an imbalanced classiﬁcation. In this study, we analyze the drawbacks of using ROC as the sole measure of imbalance in data classiﬁcation problems. In addition, a novel framework for ﬁnding the best classiﬁcation threshold is proposed. Experiments with SCOP v.1.53 data reveal that, with the default threshold set to 0.5, our proposed framework demonstrated a 20.63% improvement in terms of F-score compared with that of more commonly used methods. The ﬁndings suggest that the proposed framework is both effective and eﬃcient.
