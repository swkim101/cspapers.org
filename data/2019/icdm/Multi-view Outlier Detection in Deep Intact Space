Recently, multi-view outlier detection has emerged as a challenging research topic in outlier detection because of complex distributions of data across different views. There are mainly three types of outliers, i.e., attribute outliers, class outliers and class-attribute outliers. Most existing multi-view outlier detection approaches only detect part of the three types of outliers in a pairwise manner across different views, which is not able to accomplish the task of multi-view outlier detection comprehensively and uniformly. Outlier detection in a pairwise manner across different views also leads to time-consuming computation. We propose a new algorithm termed Multi-view Outlier Detection in Deep Intact Space (MODDIS) to find all the three types of outliers simultaneously and avoid comparing different views in a pairwise manner. Rather than leveraging subspace clustering, the performance of which is seriously affected by the dependence of subspaces on most real datasets, neural networks are employed in MODDIS in that neural networks have a stronger representation learning ability. Meanwhile, based on the view insufficiency assumption, a multi-view intact outlierness space assumption is proposed. Based on this assumption, a multi-view latent intact space is constructed to encode outlierness information of all views, where outlierness in any view is a snapshot from some perspective. Finally, an outlier detection measurement is defined in the latent intact space. Experiments are conducted on several UCI datasets and the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
