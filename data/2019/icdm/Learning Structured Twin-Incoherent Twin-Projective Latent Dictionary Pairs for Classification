In this paper, we extend the popular dictionary pair learning (DPL) into the scenario of twin-projective latent flexible DPL under a structured twin-incoherence. Technically, a novel framework called Twin-Projective Latent Flexible DPL (TP-DPL) is proposed, which minimizes the twin-incoherence constrained flexibly-relaxed reconstruction error to avoid the possible over-fitting issue and produce accurate reconstruction. In this setting, TP-DPL integrates the twin-incoherence based latent flexible DPL and the joint embedding of codes as well as salient features by twin-projection into a unified model in an adaptive neighborhood-preserving manner. Therefore, TP-DPL can unify the procedures of salient feature representation and classification. The twin-incoherence constraint on coefficients and features can explicitly ensure high intra-class compactness and inter-class separation over them. TP-DPL also integrates the adaptive weighting to preserve local neighborhood of both coefficients and salient features within each class explicitly. For efficiency, TP-DPL selects the Frobenius-norm and abandons the costly l0/l1-norm for group sparse representation. Another byproduct is that TP-DPL can directly apply the class-specific twin-projective reconstruction residual to compute the label of data. Extensive results on public databases show that TP-DPL can deliver the state-of-the-art performance.
