In heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA), since the feature spaces of the source and target domains are different, knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain is really challenging. How to align the different feature spaces and then adaptively transfer the related knowledge is critical for HDA. In this paper, we develop an adaptive teacher-and-student model for heterogeneous domain adaptation (AtsHDA). In AtsHDA, the source domain as a teacher and the target domain as a student are aligned or co-adapted to each other first, so that their correlation can be maximized. Then the target domain adaptively learns from the source domain. Specifically, there is a balance between the learning by the target domain itself and the instruction from the source domain. That is, when the guidance from the source domain is helpful for learning, the learning of target classifier emphasizes the instruction of source knowledge, and considers its own knowledge more, otherwise. Further, an ensemble method is designed to decide such a balance. Finally, empirical results show that AtsHDA can achieve competitive results compared with the state-of-arts.
