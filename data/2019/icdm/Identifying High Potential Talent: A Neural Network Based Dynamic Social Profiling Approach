How to identify high-potential talent (HIPO) earlier in their career always has strategic importance for human resource management. While tremendous efforts have been made in this direction, most existing approaches are still based on the subjective selection of human resource experts. This could lead to unintentional bias and inconsistencies. To this end, in this paper, we propose a neural network based dynamic social profiling approach for quantitatively identifying HIPOs from the newly-enrolled employees by modeling the dynamics of their behaviors in organizational social networks. A basic assumption is that HIPOs usually perform more actively and have higher competencies than their peers to accumulate their social capitals during their daily work practice. Along this line, we first propose to model the social profiles of employees with both Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and social centrality analysis in a comprehensive way. Then, an adaptive Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with global attention mechanism is designed to capture the profile dynamics of employees in the organizational social networks during their early career. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness of our approach as well as the interpretability of our results.
