We present a fast search on graph algorithm for Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). This optimization problem is challenging since traditional Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search methods may not perform efficiently in the non-metric similarity measure. Our proposed method is based on the property that Mobius transformation introduces an isomorphism between a subgraph of l^2-Delaunay graph and Delaunay graph for inner product. Under this observation, we propose a simple but novel graph indexing and searching algorithm to find the optimal solution with the largest inner product with the query. Experiments show our approach leads to significant improvements compared to existing methods.
