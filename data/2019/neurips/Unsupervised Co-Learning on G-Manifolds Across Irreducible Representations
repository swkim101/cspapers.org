We introduce a novel co-learning paradigm for manifolds naturally equipped with a group action, motivated by recent developments on learning a manifold from attached fibre bundle structures. We utilize a representation theoretic mechanism that canonically associates multiple independent vector bundles over a common base manifold, which provides multiple views for the geometry of the underlying manifold. The consistency across these fibre bundles provide a common base for performing unsupervised manifold co-learning through the redundancy created artificially across irreducible representations of the transformation group. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithmic paradigm through drastically improved robust nearest neighbor search and community detection on rotation-invariant cryo-electron microscopy image analysis.
