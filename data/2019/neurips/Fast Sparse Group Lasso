Sparse Group Lasso is a method of linear regression analysis that finds sparse parameters in terms of both feature groups and individual features. Block Coordinate Descent is a standard approach to obtain the parameters of Sparse Group Lasso, and iteratively updates the parameters for each parameter group. However, as an update of only one parameter group depends on all the parameter groups or data points, the computation cost is high when the number of the parameters or data points is large. This paper proposes a fast Block Coordinate Descent for Sparse Group Lasso. It efficiently skips the updates of the groups whose parameters must be zeros by using the parameters in one group. In addition, it preferentially updates parameters in a candidate group set, which contains groups whose parameters must not be zeros. Theoretically, our approach guarantees the same results as the original Block Coordinate Descent. Experiments show that our algorithm enhances the efficiency of the original algorithm without any loss of accuracy.
