The Science DMZ (SDMZ) is a special purpose network architecture proposed by ESnet (Energy Sciences Network) to facilitate distributed science experimentation on terabyte- (or petabyte-) scale data, exchanged over ultra-high bandwidth WAN links. Critical security challenges faced by these networks include: (i) network monitoring at high bandwidths, (ii) reconciling site-specific policies with project-level policies for conflict-free policy enforcement, (iii) dealing with geographically-distributed datasets with varying levels of sensitivity, and (iv) dynamically enforcing appropriate security rules. To address these challenges, we develop a fine-grained dataflow-based security enforcement system, called CoordiNetZ (CNZ), that provides coordinated situational awareness, i.e., the use of context-aware tagging for policy enforcement using the dynamic contextual information derived from hosts and network elements. We also developed tag and IP-based security microservices that incur minimal overheads in enforcing security to data flows exchanged across geographically-distributed SDMZ sites. We evaluate our prototype implementation across two geographically distributed SDMZ sites with SDN-based case studies, and present performance measurements that respectively highlight the utility of our framework and demonstrate efficient implementation of security policies across distributed SDMZ networks.
