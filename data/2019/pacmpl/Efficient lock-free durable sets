Non-volatile memory is expected to co-exist or replace DRAM in upcoming architectures. Durable concurrent data structures for non-volatile memories are essential building blocks for constructing adequate software for use with these architectures. In this paper, we propose a new approach for durable concurrent sets and use this approach to build the most efficient durable hash tables available today. Evaluation shows a performance improvement factor of up to 3.3x over existing technology.
