A number of logs are generated from IT devices. Since logs have important information regarding a system, they are used for finding the trace of an intrusion or obtaining important information through a big data analysis. Hence, the logs have become a major attack surface for attackers. To protect logs, IT devices require secure logging methods as a mandatory service. Secure logging can provide detection of malicious manipulation of logs and verification of their origin. In this paper, we propose a secure logging method satisfying forward and backward secrecy based on ARM TrustZone for embedded systems, which enables to efficiently generate secure logs through inter-process communication without modification of the existing system (Syslog). Also, we show that the proposed method does not require extra overhead compared with the existing logging method.
