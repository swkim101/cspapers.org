Attack trees are a popular graphical notation for capturing threats to IT systems. They can be used to describe attacks in terms of attacker goals and attacker actions. By focusing on the viewpoint of a single attacker and on a particular attacker goal in the creation of an attack tree, one reduces the conceptual complexity of threat modeling substantially. Aspects not covered by attack trees, like the behavior of the system under attack, can then be described using other models to enable a security analysis based on a combination of the models. Despite the high popularity of attack trees in security engineering for many years, some pitfalls in their use were identified only recently. In this talk, I will point out such difficulties, outline how attack trees can be used in combination with system models, and clarify the consequences of different combinations for security analysis results. After a security analysis of an abstract model, the insights gained need to be mapped to reality. I will introduce an automata-based model of run-time monitors and will show how defenses in this model can be realized at runtime with the CliSeAu system.
