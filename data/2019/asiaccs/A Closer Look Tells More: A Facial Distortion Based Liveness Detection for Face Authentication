Face authentication is vulnerable to media-based virtual face forgery (MVFF) where adversaries display photos/videos or 3D virtual face models of victims to spoof face authentication systems. In this paper, we propose a liveness detection mechanism, called FaceCloseup, to protect the face authentication on mobile devices. FaceCloseup detects MVFF-based attacks by analyzing the distortion of face regions in a user's closeup facial videos captured by built-in camera on mobile device. It can detect MVFF-based attacks with an accuracy of 99.48%.
