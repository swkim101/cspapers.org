Probabilistic programming languages are a ﬂexi-ble tool for specifying statistical models, but this ﬂexibility comes at the expense of efﬁcient analysis. It is currently difﬁcult to compactly represent the subtle independence properties of a probabilistic program and to exploit independence properties to decompose inference. Classical graphical model abstractions do capture some properties of the underlying distribution, enabling inference algorithms to operate at the level of the graph topology. However, we observe that graph-based abstractions are often too coarse to capture interesting properties of programs. We propose a form of sound abstraction for probabilistic programs wherein the abstractions are themselves simpliﬁed programs. We provide a theoretical foundation for these abstractions, as well as an algorithm to generate them. Experimentally, we also illustrate the practical beneﬁts of our framework as a tool to decompose probabilistic program inference.
