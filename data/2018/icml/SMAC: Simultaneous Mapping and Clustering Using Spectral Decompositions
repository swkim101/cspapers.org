We introduce a principled approach for simultaneous mapping and clustering (SMAC) for establishing consistent maps across heterogeneous object collections (e.g., 2D images or 3D shapes). Our approach takes as input a heterogeneous object collection and a set of maps computed between some pairs of objects, and outputs a homogeneous object clustering together with a new set of maps possessing optimal intra- and inter-cluster consistency. Our approach is based on the spectral decomposition of a data matrix storing all pairwise maps in its blocks. We additionally provide tight theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of SMAC under established noise models. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on synthetic and real datasets.
