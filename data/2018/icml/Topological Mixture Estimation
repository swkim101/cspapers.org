Density functions that represent sample data are often multimodal, i.e. they exhibit more than one maximum. Typically this behavior is taken to indicate that the underlying data deserves a more detailed representation as a mixture of densities with individually simpler structure. The usual specification of a component density is quite restrictive, with log-concave the most general case considered in the literature, and Gaussian the overwhelmingly typical case. It is also necessary to determine the number of mixture components \emph{a priori}, and much art is devoted to this. Here, we introduce \emph{topological mixture estimation}, a completely nonparametric and computationally efficient solution to the one-dimensional problem where mixture components need only be unimodal. We repeatedly perturb the unimodal decomposition of Baryshnikov and Ghrist to produce a topologically and information-theoretically optimal unimodal mixture. We also detail a smoothing process that optimally exploits topological persistence of the unimodal category in a natural way when working directly with sample data. Finally, we illustrate these techniques through examples.
