Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience, we designed a bi-directional and recurrent neural net, namely deep predictive coding networks (PCN). It uses convolutional layers in both feedforward and feedback networks, and recurrent connections within each layer. Feedback connections from a higher layer carry the prediction of its lower-layer representation; feedforward connections carry the prediction errors to its higher-layer. Given image input, PCN runs recursive cycles of bottom-up and top-down computation to update its internal representations to reduce the difference between bottom-up input and top-down prediction at every layer. After multiple cycles of recursive updating, the representation is used for image classification. In training, the classification error backpropagates across layers and in time. With benchmark data (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and MNIST), PCN was found to always outperform its feedforward-only counterpart: a model without any mechanism for recurrent dynamics, and its performance tended to improve given more cycles of computation over time. In short, PCN reuses a single architecture to recursively run bottom-up and top-down process, enabling an increasingly longer cascade of non-linear transformation. For image classification, PCN refines its representation over time towards more accurate and definitive recognition.
