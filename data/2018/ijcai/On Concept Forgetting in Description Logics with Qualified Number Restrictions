This paper presents a practical method for computing solutions of concept forgetting in the description logic ALCOQ(neg,and,or), basic ALC extended with nominals, qualified number restrictions, role negation, role conjunction and role disjunction. The method is based on a non-trivial generalisation of Ackermann's Lemma, and attempts to compute either semantic solutions of concept forgetting or uniform interpolants in ALCOQ(neg,and,or). It is so far the only approach to concept forgetting in description logics with number restrictions plus nominals, as well as in description logics with ABoxes. Results of an evaluation with a prototypical implementation have shown that the method was successful in more than 90% of the test cases from a large corpus of biomedical ontologies. In only 13.2% of these cases the solutions were semantic solutions.
