Abstraction Refinement is a recently introduced technique which allows for reducing materialization of an ontology with a large ABox to materialization of a smaller (compressed) `abstraction' of this ontology.Â  In this paper, we show how Abstraction Refinement can be adopted for incremental ABox materialization by combining it with the well-known DRed algorithm for materialization maintenance. Such a combination is non-trivial and to preserve soundness and completeness, already Horn ALCHI requires more complex abstractions. Nevertheless, we show that significant benefits can be obtained for synthetic and real-world ontologies.
