Recently a number of algorithmic results have appeared which show the tractability of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) instances under strong restrictions on variable domains and/or coefficients (AAAI 2016, AAAI 2017, IJCAI 2017). In this paper, we target ILPs where neither the variable domains nor the coefficients are restricted by a fixed constant or parameter; instead, we only require that our instances can be encoded in unary.



We provide new algorithms and lower bounds for such ILPs by exploiting the structure of their variable interactions, represented as a graph. Our first set of results focuses on solving ILP instances through the use of a graph parameter called clique-width, which can be seen as an extension of treewidth which also captures well-structured dense graphs. In particular, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for instances of bounded clique-width whose domain and coefficients are polynomially bounded by the input size, and we complement this positive result by a number of algorithmic lower bounds. Afterwards, we turn our attention to ILPs with acyclic variable interactions. In this setting, we obtain a complexity map for the problem with respect to the graph representation used and restrictions on the encoding.
