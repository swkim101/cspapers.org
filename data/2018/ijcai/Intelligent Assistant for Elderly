A rapidly ageing population in the developed world brings a necessity and opportunity for the AI-based ICT solutions. We present a system, developed within the scope of an EU H2020 project IN LIFE, which aims to prolong the age at which individual can still live at home independently while at the same time increasing comfort and safety. In this demo we present the final result of the project, a virtual AI carer monitoring user 24/7 in a form of a smartwatch. The system provides a range of useful services among which fall detection and activity monitoring are highlighted here. The device and accompanying services were tested during the project on 150 elderly users for several months, their feedback was taken into account for potential future improvements.
