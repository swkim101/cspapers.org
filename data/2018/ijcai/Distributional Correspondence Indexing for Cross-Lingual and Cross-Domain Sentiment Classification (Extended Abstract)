Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques aim at enabling machine learning methods learn effective classifiers for a “target” domain when the only available training data belongs to a different “source” domain. In this extended abstract, we briefly describe our new DA method called Distributional Correspondence Indexing (DCI) for sentiment classification. DCI derives term representations in a vector space common to both domains where each dimension reflects its distributional correspondence to a pivot, i.e., to a highly predictive term that behaves similarly across domains. The experiments we have conducted show that DCI obtains better performance than current state-of-the-art techniques for cross-lingual and cross-domain sentiment classification.
