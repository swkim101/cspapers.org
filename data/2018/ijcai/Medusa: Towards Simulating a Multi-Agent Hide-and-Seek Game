In the game of hide and seek, one or more agents (hiders) can hide behind objects to prevent other agents (seekers) from seeing them through their line of sight (visibility). These hider agents can be eventually found by seekers who explore the environment. The hide and seek model serves as an abstraction of many real world scenarios such as police agents trying to capture intruders hiding in a warehouse, security/patrolling agents on the lookout for any suspicious activity, spying drones trying to prevent themselves from being caught. Medusa allows modeling such scenarios by supporting the simulation, visualization and analysis of hider and seeker agent strategies under different environments.
