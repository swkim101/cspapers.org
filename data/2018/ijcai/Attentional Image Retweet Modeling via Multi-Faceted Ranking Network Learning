Retweet prediction is a challenging problem in social

media sites (SMS). In this paper, we study the problem

of image retweet prediction in social media,

which predicts the image sharing behavior that the

user reposts the image tweets from their followees.

Unlike previous studies, we learn user preference

ranking model from their past retweeted image

tweets in SMS. We first propose heterogeneous

image retweet modeling network (IRM) that

exploits users' past retweeted image tweets with associated

contexts, their following relations in SMS

and preference of their followees. We then develop

a novel attentional multi-faceted ranking network

learning framework with multi-modal neural networks

for the proposed heterogenous IRM network

to learn the joint image tweet representations and

user preference representations for prediction

task. The extensive experiments on a large-scale

dataset from Twitter site shows that our method

achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art

solutions to the problem.
