We describe an online, interactive system with a

graphical interface to illustrate the power and operation

of consistency algorithms in a friendly and

popular context, namely, solving Sudoku puzzles.

Our tool implements algorithms for enforcing five

(domain-based) consistency properties on binary

and non-binary constraint models. Our tool is useful

for research, education, and outreach. From

a scientific standpoint, we propose a new consistency

property that can solve the hardest known

9×9 Sudoku instances without search, but leave

open the question of the lowest level of consistency

needed to solve every 9×9 Sudoku puzzle. We

have used the current tool and its predecessor in the

classroom to introduce students to modeling problems

with constraints, explain consistency properties,

and illustrate the operations of constraint propagation

and lookahead. Finally, we have also used

this tool during outreach activities to demystify AI

to children and the general public and show them

how computers think.
