The ageing of the population deeply impacts on the social costs relative to health care. The use of modern technologies is one of the most promising approaches, under current study, to reduce such impact. In this demonstration, we propose a framework that can be employed for at-home assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). It is composed by a set of digitalized cognitive tests, developed from their paper-and-pencil counterparts, and by a Virtual Caregiver, which oversees the test execution and provides instructions.
