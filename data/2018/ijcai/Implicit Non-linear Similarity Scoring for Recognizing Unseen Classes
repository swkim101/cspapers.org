Recognizing unseen classes is an important task for real-world applications, due to: 1) it is common that some classes in reality have no labeled image exemplar for training; and 2) novel classes emerge rapidly. Recently, to address this task many zero-shot learning (ZSL) approaches have been proposed where explicit linear scores, like inner product score, are employed to measure the similarity between a class and an image. We argue that explicit linear scoring (ELS) seems too weak to capture complicated image-class correspondence. We propose a simple yet effective framework, called Implicit Non-linear Similarity Scoring (ICINESS). In particular, we train a scoring network which uses image and class features as input, fuses them by hidden layers, and outputs the similarity. Based on the universal approximation theorem, it can approximate the true similarity function between images and classes if a proper structure is used in an implicit non-linear way, which is more flexible and powerful. With ICINESS framework, we implement ZSL algorithms by shallow and deep networks, which yield consistently superior results.
