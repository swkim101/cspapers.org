Partial Cooperation is a paradigm and a corresponding

model, proposed to represent multi-agent

systems in which agents are willing to cooperate

to achieve a global goal, as long as some minimal

threshold on their personal utility is satisfied. Distributed

local search algorithms were proposed in

order to solve asymmetric distributed constraint optimization

problems (ADCOPs) in which agents are

partially cooperative.



We contribute by: 1) extending the partial cooperative

model to allow it to represent dynamic cooperation

intentions, affected by changes in agents’

wealth, in accordance with social studies literature.

2) proposing a novel local search algorithm

in which agents receive indications of others’ preferences

on their actions and thus, can perform actions

that are socially beneficial. Our empirical

study reveals the advantage of the proposed algorithm

in multiple benchmarks. Specifically, on realistic

meeting scheduling problems it overcomes

limitations of standard local search algorithms.
