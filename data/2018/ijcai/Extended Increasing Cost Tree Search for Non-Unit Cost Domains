Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) has applications

in navigation, robotics, games and planning. Most

work on search-based optimal algorithms for

MAPF has focused on simple domains with unit

cost actions and unit time steps. Although these

constraints keep many aspects of the algorithms

simple, they also severely limit the domains that

can be used. In this paper we introduce a new definition

of the MAPF problem for non-unit cost and

non-unit time step domains along with new multiagent

state successor generation schemes for these

domains. Finally, we define an extended version

of the increasing cost tree search algorithm (ICTS)

for non-unit costs, with two new sub-optimal variants

of ICTS: epsilon-ICTS and w-ICTS. Our experiments

show that higher quality sub-optimal solutions

are achievable in domains with finely discretized

movement models in no more time than

lower-quality, optimal solutions in domains with

coarsely discretized movement models.
