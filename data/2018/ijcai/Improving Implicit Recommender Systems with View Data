Most existing recommender systems leverage the primary feedback data only, such as the purchase records in E-commerce. In this work, we additionally integrate view data into implicit feedback based recommender systems (dubbed as Implicit Recommender Systems). We propose to model the pairwise ranking relations among purchased, viewed, and non-viewed interactions, being more effective and ﬂexible than typical pointwise matrix factorization (MF) methods. However, such a pairwise formulation poses efﬁciency challenges in learning the model. To address this problem, we design a new learning algorithm based on the element-wise Alternating Least Squares (eALS) learner. Notably, our algorithm can efﬁciently learn model parameters from the whole user-item matrix (including all missing data), with a rather low time complexity that is dependent on the observed data only. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art MF methods by 10% ∼ 28.4%.
