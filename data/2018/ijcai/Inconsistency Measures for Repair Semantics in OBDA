In this paper, we place ourselves in the Ontology Based Data Access (OBDA) setting and investigate reasoning with inconsistent existential rules knowledge bases. We use the notion of inconsistency measures on sets of facts to rank and filter repairs. We propose a generic framework to answer queries by using the best repairs and study productivity and properties of such a framework.
