Recent work on Conditional Simple Temporal Networks (CSTNs) has

focused on checking the dynamic consistency (DC) property assuming

that execution strategies can react instantaneously to observations.

Three alternative semantics---IR-DC, 0-DC, and π-DC---have been presented. 

The most practical DC-checking algorithm for CSTNs has only been analyzed 

with respect to the IR-DC semantics, while the 0-DC semantics was shown to have a serious flaw

that the π-DC semantics fixed. Whether the IR-DC semantics had

the same flaw and, if so, what the consequences would be for the

DC-checking algorithm remained open questions.



This paper (1) shows that the IR-DC semantics is also flawed; 

(2) shows that one of the constraint-propagation rules from 

the IR-DC-checking algorithm is not sound with respect to the IR-DC

semantics; 

(3) presents a simpler algorithm, called the π-DC-checking algorithm; 

(4) proves that it is sound and complete with respect to the π-DC semantics; 

and (5) empirically evaluates the new algorithm.
