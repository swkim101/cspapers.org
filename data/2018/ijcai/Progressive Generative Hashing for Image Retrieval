Recent years have witnessed the success of the emerging hashing techniques in large-scale image retrieval. Owing to the great learning capacity, deep hashing has become one of the most promising solutions, and achieved attractive performance in practice. However, without semantic label information, the unsupervised deep hashing still remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a novel progressive generative hashing (PGH) framework to help learn a discriminative hashing network in an unsupervised way. Very different from existing studies, it first treats the hash codes as a kind of semantic condition for the similar image generation, and simultaneously feeds the original image and its codes into the generative adversarial networks (GANs). The real images together with the synthetic ones can further help train a discriminative hashing network based on a triplet loss. By iteratively inputting the learnt codes into the hash conditioned GANs, we can progressively enable the hashing network to discover the semantic relations. Extensive experiments on the widely-used image datasets demonstrate that PGH can significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods.
