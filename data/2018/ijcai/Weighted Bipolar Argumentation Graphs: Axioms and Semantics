The paper studies how arguments can be evaluated in weighted bipolar argumentation graphs (i.e., graphs whose arguments have basic weights and may be supported and attacked). It introduces principles that an evaluation method (or semantics) would satisfy, analyzes existing semantics with respect to them, and finally proposes a new semantics for the class of non-maximal acyclic graphs.
