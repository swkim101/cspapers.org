This paper studies an effect-abstraction based relaxation

 for reasoning about linear numeric planning problems. The effect-abstraction

 decomposes non-constant linear numeric effects into actions with conditional

 effects over additive constant numeric effects. With little effort, on this

 compiled version, it is possible to use known subgoaling based relaxations

 and relative heuristics. The combination of these two steps leads to a novel

 relaxation based heuristic. Theoretically, the relaxation is proved tighter

 than previous interval based relaxation and leading to safe-pruning

 heuristics. Empirically, a heuristic developed on this relaxation leads to

 substantial improvements for a class of problems that are currently out of

 the reach of state-of-the-art numeric planners.
