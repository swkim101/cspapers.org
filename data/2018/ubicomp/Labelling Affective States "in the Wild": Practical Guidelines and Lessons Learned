In affective computing (AC) field studies it is impossible to obtain an objective ground truth. Hence, self-reports in form of ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) are frequently used in lieu of ground truth. Based on four paradigms, we formulate practical guidelines to increase the accuracy of labels generated via EMAs. In addition, we detail how these guidelines were implemented in a recent AC field study of ours. During our field study, 1081 EMAs were collected from 10 subjects over a duration of 148 days. Based on these EMAs, we perform a qualitative analysis of the effectiveness of our proposed guidelines. Furthermore, we present insights and lessons learned from the field study.
