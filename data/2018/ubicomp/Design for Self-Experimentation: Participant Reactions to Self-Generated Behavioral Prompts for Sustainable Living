Research has suggested that asking participants to generate their own arguments or ideas for the purpose of behavioral improvement (e.g., quit smoking) could lead to better intervention outcomes. Based on this concept, the opportunity for participants to personalize or generate own behavioral prompts intends to engage them in deeper self-reflection, with the ultimate goal of making the intervention more effective. Theory of active involvement has not yet been tested out in longer-term behavior change interventions. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by examining participant reactions toward personalizing and inventing new behavioral prompts in a mobile intervention for sustainable living. The data highlighted both the advantages and disadvantages of this intervention approach.
