In this study, an automated healthcare assistance "Nurse Bot" has been developed for elderly population. For past few decades, life expectancy has increased and the global percentage of elderly population is upward. But the rise of this ageing population gravitates towards different health related problems. Therefore, they need extra care and some sorts of assistance to make their life comfortable. Elderly people tend to forget to take their medicines on time. In this research, we have developed an automated mini robot with a scheduler and a monitoring system, which delivers medicines to the elderly person on scheduled time. We have constructed a cost-effective system, so that majority of the people can afford it. Besides that, to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of this system, we visited a retirement home. During our demonstration, we received enthusiastic and positive responses from the authority and the residents of that retirement home.
