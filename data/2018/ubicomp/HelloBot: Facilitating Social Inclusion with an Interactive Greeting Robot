Smiling and saying hello to people can possibly increase social inclusion or belongingness, which is one of the basic needs of human. We present HelloBot, a social robot that proactively gives greetings to passersby and reacts to their smiles to induce positive feelings. We performed an in-the-wild trial to evaluate the emotional effect of interacting with HelloBot. We observed 123 students and 32 answered the accompanying questionnaire. 92 of 123 participants made a natural laugh or smile. 50%(N=16) of participants reported that they felt better after interacting with HelloBot. Our results show that interactive social greeting bots have the potential to induce social inclusion and positive feelings.
