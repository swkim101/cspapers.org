Virtual/augmented reality headsets, smart sensing glasses and similar "Smart Eyewear" have recently emerged as commercial products and can provide an interesting research platform for a range of research fields, including human-computer interaction, ubiquitous computing, pervasive sensing, and social sciences. The proposed workshop will bring together researchers from a wide range of computing disciplines, such as mobile and ubiquitous computing, eye tracking, optics, computer vision, human vision and perception, usability, as well as systems research. The workshop is a continuation from 2016 and will focus on discussing application scenarios and shared interest use cases for eyewear computing between corporate and academic researchers.
