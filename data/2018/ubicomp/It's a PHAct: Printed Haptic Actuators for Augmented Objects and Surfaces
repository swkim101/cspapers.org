In this work, we discuss the application of printed haptic actuators based on Electroactive Polymer (EAP) for HCI. We envision a printed haptic layer that can be used to augment objects and surfaces with feedback. The printing process offers unique opportunities to fabricate actuators of various shapes, sizes and layouts. We show that printed actuators provide strong output that is clearly perceived even under challenging conditions. We discuss the current possibilities and limitations, and provide HCI example cases that show the benefits of printed haptic actuators.
