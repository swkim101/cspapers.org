Many people suffer from panic disorder worldwide. Panic disorder has a bad influence on overall social relations as well as mental/physical health, debasing the quality of life. Thus, we introduce Moonglow, a wrist-wearable device with a user-centered design aimed at helping with cognitive behavioral therapy of panic disorder patients. Moonglow will help patients relieve panic disorder symptoms by consistently training them and correcting wrong thought patterns through diary records. We confirmed the necessity of Moonglow through a literature review and preliminary study related to cognitive behavioral therapy and designed based on the gleaned insights.
