In this demo, we present a smartwatch app that is designed to help users eating meals at an appropriate rate. Our app measures the user's eating rate in real time and delivers appropriate feedback to slow down when eating fast. To this end, we explore four different types of feedback - graphics, text, clock, and vibration, in order to find the suitable type of feedback depending on the eating environments.
