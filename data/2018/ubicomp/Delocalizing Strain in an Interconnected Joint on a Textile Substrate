Interconnect join failure is a common theme in wearable technology, but has yet to be addressed or resolved. The purpose of this thesis is to begin study of isolating and identifying ways to relieve an interconnect joint stress that is common in e-textiles and wearable technology. An overview of related work in the area of delocalizing strain in an interconnected joint are presented, followed by proposing an experimental design used to determine the cause-effect relationship between variables that affect interconnect joint failure.
