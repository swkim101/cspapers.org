Human beings are social by nature and like to form the group with the similar minded people. Therefore, for understanding the behaviour of an individual, besides the information of the individual, we need to look at the interaction of the individual in physical world groups. Likewise, the workers form various formal and informal groups in the organization for mutual interactions. For monitoring context as well as behaviours of the workers, identification of such groups and understanding their dynamics are essential. Moreover, this information is used for analysing the organizational efficiency. In an institutional environment, the knowledge of the student group formation helps the instructor to the analyse the performance of the students. On the other side, the proper selection of groups leads to the improvement of the students. Understanding the group dynamics in sports is also important.
