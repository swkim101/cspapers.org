UPDATED---August 17, 2018. Blood pressure (BP) is the most commonly performed medical office test. We developed a system that uses exclusively wristband-collected photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP. A dataset was collected and annotated during daily activities of 22 subjects. Preprocessing was applied to remove the signal noise and artefacts. Signal was segmented into cycles and features were computed. The RReliefF algorithm was used to select a subset of relevant features. The approach was validated with a person-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) experiment. The LOSO experiment was updated with personalization to improve the results. The lowest mean absolute error (MAE) was 6.70 mmHg for systolic and 4.42 for diastolic BP. Ensemble of regression trees achieved the best results, which borderline meet the requirements set by two standards for BP estimation devices.
