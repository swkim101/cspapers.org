This demo presents an interactive experiment environment for physics and electrical engineering students and aims to provide a deep insight into the basic electrical theories (i.e Ohm's, Kirchoff's law) using real-time sensing system with augmented-reality (AR) visualization enhancements. To this end, a system was designed to measure the current, voltage, AC frequency and RFID based 2D positioning. A mixed reality glass, HoloLens, was used to provide the visualization and augmentation. An application is designed for HoloLens to provide different visualization of nodal measurements and detected circuit schematic. Using this interactive experiment setting, the goal is to reduce the cognitive load of a learner while allowing more enjoyable and intuitive learning experience.
