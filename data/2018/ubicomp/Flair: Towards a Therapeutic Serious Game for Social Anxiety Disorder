In this paper we present Flair, an interactive fiction game that is intended to serve as a psycho-educational material for the therapeutic treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). Along with the game design approach, explanation of the inclusion of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques into Flair's story, and the psychological benefits of doing so, is extensively discussed. The initial results are encouraging as patients (15 users) and a therapist respond positive on the current game design.
