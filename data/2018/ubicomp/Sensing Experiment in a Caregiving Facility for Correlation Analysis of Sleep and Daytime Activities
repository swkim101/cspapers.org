We present an experiment for 5 months with 30 residents in a caregiving facility to collect big data and to analyze the correlation between sleep and daytime activities. Analysis of sleep is useful for health care and for self analysis. Especially, knowing how daytime activities are influenced by sleep quality, and vice versa, are important as well as analyzing the sleep status itself. Existing analysis of correlation between sleep and the daytime activities collected at maximum 1 week and the recorded activities are primitive such as 'activity levels'. In this paper, we performed a sensing experiment at a caregiving facility to collect big data for 30 subjects and for 5 months. Furthermore, by collecting care records for subject, it is possible to collect the daytime activities data. Finally, we analyzed the data of five subjects for 26 days, and found that (1) the sleeping situation can estimate whether users will do daytime exercise with an accuracy of 91% for specific users, and (2) that the information of the daytime exercise influences the time when users start to sleep for specific users.
