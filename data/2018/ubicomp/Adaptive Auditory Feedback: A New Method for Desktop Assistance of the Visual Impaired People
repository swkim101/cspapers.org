This paper presents a new technique of adaptive auditory feedback in desktop assistance for the people with visual impairment. Adaptive auditory feedback is based on switching between speech only and non-speech only (i.e., Spearcons) sounds. The auditory feedback adaptively changes that changing based on user mode. Active users are assigned with speech only while the engaged users with the non-speech only auditory feedback. Ten participants perform tasks on desktop computers using within-subject design. The proposed adaptive auditory feedback is more efficient in comparison to speech only and non-speech auditory feedbacks. It can also improve a user experience in the desktop environment. Finally, it may help different researchers to use adaptive auditory feedback as a substitute for speech only or non-speech auditory feedback during the designing of accessibility softwares, tools, and systems.
