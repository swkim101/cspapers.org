What does well-being mean in the context of smart environments? What restrictions are set, how can well-being be measured and predicted? Can smart environments control or influence individual well-being? We seek to answer these questions by aggregating existing research on well-being and identifying the concepts relevant for smart environments. As a result, we provide a falsifiable definition candidate for well-being in smart environments and outline the experiments necessary for verifying the validity of the definition.
