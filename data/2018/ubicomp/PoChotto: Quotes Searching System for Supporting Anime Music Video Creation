An anime music video (AMV) is a fan-made music video consisting of scenes from Japanese anime set to an audio track, often songs or promotional trailer audio. Quote MAD is one genre of AMV that consists of video clips of quotes. Quote MAD creators will be required to search and extract the necessary scenes from anime. Since both searching and extracting processes take a lot of time, it is a burden for the creators. We developed a system called PoChotto that enables the creators to search for the scenes that they are looking for. This system helps the creators to search for scenes using quote information in anime and provides an interface for extracting scenes. From our preliminary experiments, we found that the time required for searching scenes can be as three times faster than the conventional method. This implies the burden on the creator can be reduced by our system.
