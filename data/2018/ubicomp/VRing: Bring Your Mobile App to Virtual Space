We will demonstrate a mobile app test system in VR environments. The system enables developers to use a real smartphone in VR and to evaluate their apps at the locations of interest, with various network situations. The system consists of 2 core engines. First one is the real world reproduction engine which reproduces 3D city models and network environments to virtual environments. The second one is the laboratory-virtual environment mapping engine which brings a real device into VR and set environmental information in VR to the device.
