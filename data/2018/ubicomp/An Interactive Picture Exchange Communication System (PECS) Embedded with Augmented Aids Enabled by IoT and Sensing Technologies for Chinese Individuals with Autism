PECS or Picture Exchange Communication System, involving teaching individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to use the picture cards for requesting items and activities; it has been used with not only the individuals with ASD, but also their families and teachers with notably success. Despite the much progress achieved so far, to our knowledge, there are very few dedicated PECS (software) application available in Chinese. Motivated by these previous research, we are developing a highly customizable and contextually expandable PECS system embedded with augmented aids and some additional communication abilities. In particular, our system can not only offer content-authoring tools but also expands picture vocabularies by automatically offering context-sensitive picture cards (via location- and event sensing) for users to make on-demand request through WeChat, one of the most used social communication tools in China. Last but not the least, the simpler version with typical PECS capabilities with message-sending module has also been loaded in a children's tablet which makes our PECS very affordable for Chinese children's use in rural areas.
