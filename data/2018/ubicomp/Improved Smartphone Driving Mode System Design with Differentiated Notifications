By enabling driver mode on a smartphone, the smartphone can autonomously detect driving activities and suppress any incoming notifications so that drivers can focus on their attention on driving activities. However, the current driving mode implementations are limited in the fact that they frequently misjudge driving activities and also only have the option of nullifying all incoming notifications. In this work we present an improvement to this design and propose two major improvements to the current driving mode implementations: the first to improve driving activity detection and the second to diversify the notification mechanisms when the user is detected to be driving. While the work is still at its preliminary stages, we foresee this work as a meaningful effort to initiate the design of smartphone notification systems more tailored to the users' needs.
