The multitude of data generated by sensors available on users' mobile devices, combined with advances in machine learning techniques, support context-aware services in recognizing the current situation of a user (i.e., physical context) and optimizing the system's personalization features. However, context-awareness performances mainly depend on the accuracy of the context inference process, which is strictly tied to the availability of large-scale and labeled datasets. In this work, we present a framework developed to collect datasets containing heterogeneous sensing data derived from personal mobile devices. The framework has been used by 3 voluntary users for two weeks, generating a dataset with more than 36K samples and 1331 features. We also propose a lightweight approach to model the user context able to efficiently perform the entire reasoning process on the user mobile device. To this aim, we used six dimensionality reduction techniques in order to optimize the context classification. Experimental results on the generated dataset show that we achieve a 10x speed up and a feature reduction of more than 90% while keeping the accuracy loss less than 3%.
