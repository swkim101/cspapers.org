Head Mounted Display (HMD) based Augmented Reality (AR) allows users to access digital information related to real world objects without being distracted from their real world task. With the introduction of the HoloLens (and increasingly other similar devices) a platform allowing wide spread practical application of such solutions has finally become available. However, today, not many such real world applications exist, and it is not yet fully understood which specific applications can benefit most from the technology in what form. As a promising novel application that optimally leverages the advantages of HMD based AR we propose a HoloLens based solution to support the debugging of electronic circuits. As a first step we have implemented a HoloLens interface to an oscilloscope. In this paper we describe the general idea, the fist implementation of the oscilloscope interface, and summarize initial qualitative feedback that we have received from users.
