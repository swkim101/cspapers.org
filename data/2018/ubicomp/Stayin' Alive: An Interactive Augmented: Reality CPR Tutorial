Education is the Achilles heel of successful resuscitation in cardiac arrest. Therefore, we aim to contribute to the educational efficiency by providing a novel augmented-reality (AR) guided interactive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) "trainer". For this trainer, a mixed reality smart glass, Microsoft HoloLens, and a CPR manikin covered with pressure sensors were used. To introduce the CPR procedure to a learner, an application with an intractable virtual teacher model was designed. The teaching scenario consists of the two main parts, theory and practice. In the theoretical part, the virtual teacher provides all information about the CPR procedure. Afterward, the user will be asked to perform the CPR cycles in three different stages. In the first two stages, it is aimed to gain the muscle memory with audio and optical feedback system. In the end, the performance of the participant is evaluated by the virtual teacher.
