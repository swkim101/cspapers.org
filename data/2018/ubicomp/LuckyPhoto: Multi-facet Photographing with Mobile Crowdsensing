Visual crowdsensing (VCS) uses built-in cameras of smart devices and asks people to capture the details of interesting objects or views in the real world. To decrease the incentive costs, we propose the task allocation method to assign light subtasks of multi-facet VCS tasks to participants. We also develop a task assistant in the mobile app to help participants collect the required photos efficiently. The experimental results show that both the task allocation ratio and the covered-facet ratio are raised, and participants can accomplish the multi-facet VCS tasks more easily.
