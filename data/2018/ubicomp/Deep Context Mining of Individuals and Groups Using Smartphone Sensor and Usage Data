I am a fifth year Ph.D. Student (enrolled January '14) working in Data Science (Department of Mathematics) at Shiv Nadar University, India. I have an undergraduate major in Computer Science, and my research interests lie in two primary areas - (i) developing systems for event detection and pattern recognition using smartphone sensor data, and (ii) leveraging micro-events for deep context mining including human-human interactions and behavior. Having been an active part of the ubiquitous computing research community during my undergraduate as well as during my Ph.D. (expected completion Summer '19), my future aspirations are to join as a post-doctoral researcher in the same field, and continue to build upon my skills and contribute both as an active researcher as well as a mentor for budding undergraduate students.
