In this study, an Arduino based mini nurse robot has been developed for assisting elderly people. Bangladesh which is a low income developing country has 7% of its total population of elderly people (60+ age) [8]. Elderly people are often neglected in this developing society where providing support is challenging from the family structure. An automated robot can assist them in such a situation, especially in healthcare. In the context of developing countries, automated solutions are not available and affordable compared to the developed countries. Our major contribution is to develop a low-cost healthcare robot for the elderly people to assist in taking medicines according to schedule.
