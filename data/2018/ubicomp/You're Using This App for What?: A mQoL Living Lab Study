Smartphones are personal ubiquitous devices that provide an immense source of information via diverse applications (apps) that contribute to our decision-making process throughout the day and improve our quality of life in the long term. In the past, an app only had one or a few specific functions, while nowadays, given the same interface, an app provides multiple interactive services to their users. However, we still have a weak understanding of user expectations and experiences with these apps. Towards this end, we extended our previous smartphone logging app, to the new 'mQoL Lab' for mobile Quality of Life, to strategically trigger user surveys and to achieve a better understanding of the user's actions in popular Android apps, like: Spotify, WhatsApp, Instagram, Maps, Chrome, Facebook and its Messenger. We present and discuss the results and their implications acquired during our first pilot study conducted with five users for four weeks in our Living Lab settings.
