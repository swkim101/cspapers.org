An interactive tangible interface has been developed to capture and communicate emotions between people who are missing and longing for loved ones. EmoEcho measures the wearer's pulse, touch and movement to provide varying vibration patterns on the partner device. During an informal evaluation of two prototype devices users acknowledged how EmoEcho could help counter the negative feeling of missing someone through the range of haptic feedback offered. In general, we believe, tangible interfaces appear to offer a non-obtrusive means towards interpreting and communicating emotions to others.
