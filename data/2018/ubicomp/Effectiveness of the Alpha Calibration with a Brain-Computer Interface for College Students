During college, students make important decisions that will affect the rest of their life while also dealing with the burdens of social and academic expectations, often while living alone for the first time. For these reasons, stress deteriorates mental health and ability to relax. Meditation has been shown to reduce stress and mitigate its negative effects. EEG activity in the alpha spectrum has been shown to increase during meditative sessions and has been linked to feelings of relaxation. In this study, students without being given training in meditative practices, are asked to try to clear their mind and meditate for 10 minutes. Participants were also given a questionnaire to help determine if they were able to clear their thoughts. Results show that 77.14% of participants were not able to clear their mind for proper meditation. This shows that students do not usually have a natural ability to relax and meditate.
