In technology enabled self-tutoring systems, it could be useful to monitor learners' cognitive and affective states in real time to provide useful feedback when a student faces difficulty or seems disengaged. Biometric sensors such as EEG, GSR and eye trackers have been used to indicate cognitive and affective states of individuals. In order to make EEG relevant and affordable for such HCI applications we need to be able to use consumer-grade devices. We conducted a pilot study using a wearable consumer grade MUSEÂ© headband to record EEG signals. We used the ratio of the frequencies alpha and theta (theta/alpha) to investigate cognitive load and the frontal asymmetry in the alpha frequency band to investigate learners' affective states. We found evidence supporting the use of theta/alpha as a cognitive load metric. However, alpha frontal asymmetry was not indicative of affective states. We discuss the results and possible implications of our study.
