In this study, a set of transmitter/receiver modules was designed to facilitate human body communication (HBC) between pairs of users. The modules, which use a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) to produce frequency shift keying (FSK) modulated signals at arbitrary frequencies, are compatible with a wide range of systems through the use of a USB port interface. The proposed method was tested by implementing an LED color control system where the HBC modules were paired with a smartphone to successfully transmit color information between a pair of users.
