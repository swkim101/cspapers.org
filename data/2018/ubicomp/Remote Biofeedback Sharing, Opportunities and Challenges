Biofeedback is commonly used to regulate one's state, for example to manage stress. The underlying idea is that by perceiving a feedback about their physiological activity, a user can act upon it. In this paper we describe through two recent projects how biofeedback could be leveraged to share one's state at distance. Such extension of biofeedback could answer to the need of belonging, further widening the applications of the technology in terms of well-being.
