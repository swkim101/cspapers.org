Human-computer interaction is progressively shifting towards natural language communication, determining the rise of conversational agents. In the context of ubiquitous computing, the opportunities for interacting with new services and systems in a conversational manner are increasing and, nowadays, it is common to talk to home assistants to interact with a smart environment or to write to chatbots to access an online service. This workshop aims at bringing together researchers from academia and industry in order to establish a multidisciplinary community interested in discovering and exploring the challenges and opportunities coming from the ubiquity of conversational agents.
