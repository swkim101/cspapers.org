The use of mobile phones has transcended its initial use as a communication device to become a medium to fulfilling social needs. While this has been beneficial to some, studies have exposed adverse effects such as depression and social media addiction. Since it is not always clear which category the user belongs, we propose a mobile application that records the social media interaction patterns of a user. The application also captures their mood before and after each social media use, until it can automatically infer the mood of the user through their social media interaction pattern. Consenting users can transmit the data collected on their device to a central location for further analysis by researchers of human behaviour or mobile application developers to provide intervention to users or design guidelines for mobile applications.
