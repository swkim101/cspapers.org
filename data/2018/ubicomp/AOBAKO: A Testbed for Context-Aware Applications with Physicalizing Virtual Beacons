In this study, we propose AOBAKO, a testbed for context-aware applications, which focuses on the testing of mobile applications using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor positioning. AOBAKO emulates BLE-beacon communications based on accurate frame-level emulation. In the proposed testbed, the emulation result is transferred to a physical space and beacon frames are emitted via radio waves. AOBAKO makes it possible to verify context awareness in a mobile application and can reduce the cost of a field survey.
