Anime music videos (AMVs) are fan-made music videos that are created by editing and synthesizing anime footage and music. Anime fans create AMVs and share them on the Internet and with their friends. However, AMV creation takes time and effort. It is also hard to synchronize the scene changes with the musical rhythm. We propose a system to ease these difficulties. Our system splits a video by frames and crops the face images of the characters. The system then associates the face images and the scenes of the characters and classifies the face images to each character. Using this information, our system automatically extracts the scenes as clips for each character. This drastically reduces the time and effort to create an AMV.
