As transborder data flows of personal data are increasing in volume and frequency, a jurisdiction's capacity to enforce personal data protection laws outside its territory is becoming more necessary and more difficult. As is shown in this paper, there have been three main approaches to dealing with this issue: the jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction, organization-to-organization, and the data localization approaches. While the jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction approach makes transborder data flows contingent upon the existence of adequate/equivalent national data protection laws, the organization-to-organization approach makes it the responsibility of individual data controllers to meet basic standards of data protection when those data are processed offshore. The data localization approach on the other hand, obliges third parties to store personal data within the boundaries of the country of operation. The fact that each of these models has its strengths and weaknesses, and that different jurisdictions have adopted different approaches based on different motivations and interests, makes the actual pursuit of international data protection increasingly complex..
