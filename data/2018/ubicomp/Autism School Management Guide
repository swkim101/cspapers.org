Autism has emerged as one of the most critical issues globally in recent times. The situation is more complicated in developing countries like Bangladesh where infrastructure is not up to the mark. The education system for autistic people in Bangladesh lacks the aid of technology which can make the system more efficient. There is a communication gap between the teacher and the caregivers of autistic kids. Our work addresses these issues by developing a school management guide for the autism schools which will make the management issues of autism schools much more efficient. The system is designed in such a way that will help the communication between parents and teachers by providing adequate information to the parents of autistic kids about the daily teaching procedures in the school.
