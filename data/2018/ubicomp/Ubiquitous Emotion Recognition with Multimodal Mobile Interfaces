In 1997 Rosalind Picard introduced fundamental concepts of affect recognition [1]. Since this time, multimodal interfaces such as Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), RGB and depth cameras, physiological wearables, multimodal facial data and physiological data have been used to study human emotion. Much of the work in this field focuses on a single modality to recognize emotion. However, there is a wealth of information that is available for recognizing emotions when incorporating multimodal data. Considering this, the aim of this workshop is to look at current and future research activities and trends for ubiquitous emotion recognition through the fusion of data from various multimodal, mobile devices.
