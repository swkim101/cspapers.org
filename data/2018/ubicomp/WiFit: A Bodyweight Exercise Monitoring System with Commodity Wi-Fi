Bodyweight exercises, such as push-up, sit-up, and squat, are effective forms of strength training to maintain good health. In order to improve people's exercise experience and provide feedback, lots of work has been done to monitor the bodyweight exercise by requiring people to wear special sensors on body. Different from traditional ways, a non-intrusive system WiFit is shown in this demo which uses surrounding Wi-Fi signals to monitor the bodyweight exercises without any attachment requirements. It not only could recognize the exercise type but also count the repetition number of exercise for diverse population even in different environments.
