With the rapid development of online social networks (OSNs), many people have linked their accounts of multiple OSN sites and share contents across them. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the usage of the Swarm app's cross-site sharing feature, i.e., the feature that enables Swarm users to share their check-ins to Twitter, and reveal factors that impact Swarm users' sharing behavior. We classify factors into two groups, i.e., check-in-related factors and profile-related factors, and dedicate to figure out their individual and combined influence on Swarm users' sharing behavior. Our work can provide a reference for researchers who collect Swarm check-ins from Twitter to study the characteristics of Swarm check-ins, assisting them to identify that whether their Twitter-collected check-ins are representative of the randomly selected check-ins collected directly from Swarm. The OSN sites can also improve their design of the sharing feature through the findings of this work.
