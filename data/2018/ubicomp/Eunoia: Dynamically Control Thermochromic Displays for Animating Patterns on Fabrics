To expand the possibilities of thermochromic displays, we design Eunoia, which is a series of animations on textiles patterns that control the area and time of the color change activation by using the properties of fabrics, thermochromic pigments and conductive threads. The six different design patterns are related to the length of the conductive threads, voltage regulation, fabric density, the temperature of thermochromic pigment, fade-in and fade-out time, and maintenance time. For example, we could control the changing color area around a conductive thread by regulating the giving voltage or we could control the time that a pattern is activated by using different fabrics. We collaborate with a graphic artist to design the animations using each of these properties and. aim to provide some guidance to graphic designers, fashion designers, and artists to create new ways of dynamic fabrics. In this way, we aim that Eunoia will provide guidance to graphic designers, fashion designers, and artists to create novel ways of dynamic fabrics.
