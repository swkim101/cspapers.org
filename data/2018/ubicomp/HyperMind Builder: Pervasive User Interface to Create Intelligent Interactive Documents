We introduce a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to create intelligent interactive documents for everyone. The intelligent interactive document refers to a document displaying contents dynamically according to a reader's behavior. To the best of our knowledge, creating such documents requires a certain amount of efforts and implementation skills. By utilizing our system, users including non-technological experts can create interactive documents without any programming. Our system supports many people to enhance the possibility of designing new human-document interactions.
