We present eSense - an open and multi-sensory in-ear wearable platform for personal-scale behaviour analytics. eSense is a true wireless stereo (TWS) earbud and supports dual-mode Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy. It is also augmented with a 6-axis in-ertial measurement unit and a microphone. We demonstrate the eSense platform, the data exploration tool with the open APIs for the real-time visualisation of multi-modal sensory data, and its manifestation in a 360Â° workplace well-being application.
