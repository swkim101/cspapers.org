Many office-workers and students tend to overlook the potential dangers from a spreading cough infection. To address such problems, we propose CoughCCTV, a group-wise cough management system. It aims to increase awareness of the cough occurring in a group and induce group-wise infection defensive actions (e.g., frequently washing hands, ventilating and wearing masks). In this paper, we share our initial design of CoughCCTV and report our preliminary results from a 5-day deployment study with 6 participants. We found that CoughCCTV was effective to increase awareness of coughing in an office, yet not enough to motivate infection-defensive actions.
