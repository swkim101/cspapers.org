Grief resulting from the death of a deceased loved one has a great impact on both the personal and social life styles of the bereaved persons. However, this has become important to explore within the technological context considering how technologies are recently helping to understand the grieving needs of the bereaved persons. This paper presents an initial work drawn from the continuing bonds theory. The theory explains how the bereaved persons are continually being reminded of their lost loved ones while they encounter certain memory triggers (such as familiar sound from the past, faces that resemble the deceased person and places that they had once visited with the deceased). Hence, as life logging technologies (technology that continually captures and preserve memorable moments) become pervasive, it is necessary to understand how it can support these memory-related events associated with grieving.
