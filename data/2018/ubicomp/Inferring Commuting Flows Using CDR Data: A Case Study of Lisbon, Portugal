Commuting is recurring travel between home and workplace, which accounts for most trips made daily. Understanding commuting patterns and flows is therefore essential for city and transport system design and planning. Traditionally, commuting flow information was collected using surveys and interviews, which are expensive and time-consuming. This paper introduces a way to extract commuting flow and route choice information from analyzing mobile phone communication logs. We present two new methods for inferring individual commuting route choice, which collectively constitutes city-level commuting flows. Both morning and evening flows are inferred and visualized. We believe that our methods and results are useful and contributing to both theory and practice, especially in the interdisciplinary field of urban computing and city science.
