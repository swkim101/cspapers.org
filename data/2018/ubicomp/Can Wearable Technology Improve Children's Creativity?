Wearable technology is becoming increasingly common in primary and high school settings. Furthermore, research has shown that augmented reality, another type of wearable has the potential to benefit student learning. Combining these two technologies to support creativity and problem-solving for children has not been well explored. In this work, we describe our initial exploration into the contextual variables that impact the levels of low to high creativity moments. Ultimately, we aim to use wearable technology (and its sensors) to close the gap between the topic of children's creativity by measuring moments of creative fixation and then using feedback in these low creativity moments to spur creativity. The main contributions of this work, is a preliminary pilot study with ten primary-school students (K-6), our initial results and examination and discussion of how children's creativity can be supported or enhanced using wearable technology and augmented reality.
