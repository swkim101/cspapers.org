In this paper, our method (Team Tk-2) for Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) recognition challenge [1] is described. First, the sliding window technique was applied on sensor data with six window sizes of 60, 30, 10, 6, 3 and 1 second to obtain recognizing instances. Then, SVM classifiers for each instance size are trained with mean, variance, maximum value, minimum value, and zero crossing rate. After test data is recognized by the six SVM models with each instance size, the result is determined by a voting of the results by the SVM models.
