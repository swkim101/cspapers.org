Smartphones with embedded and connected sensors are playing vital role in healthcare through various apps and mHealth platforms. RADAR-base is a modern mHealth data collection platform built around Confluent and Apache Kafka. RADAR-base enables study design and set up, active and passive remote data collection. It provides secure data transmission, and scalable solutions for data storage, management and access. The application is used presently in RADAR-CNS study to collect data from patients suffering from Multiples Sclerosis, Depression and Epilepsy. Beyond RADAR-CNS, RADAR-base is being deployed across a number of other funded research programmes.
