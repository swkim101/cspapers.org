Chronic Kidney Diseases are one of the leading reasons for untimely deaths worldwide taking lives of millions of people every year. Bangladesh as a developing country with the dense population and inadequate resources is very vulnerable to the problem. We are working on a cloud-based solution that tries to compensate for the doctor-patient ratio which affects the quality of healthcare highly. The system connects patients, doctors and caregivers. It presents all the necessary information of the patients to the doctor and helps them to analyze the condition of the patients in less time. The system provides interfaces for the communication of the doctors, patients and caregivers. Patients and caregivers are notified about the instructions of the doctor and help them navigate through different phases of the disease.
