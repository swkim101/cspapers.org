Our world is increasingly interconnected via a wide variety of computers, IoT, wearable and mobile devices. The information provided collectively through these devices offers insightful information on our everyday lives, daily patterns, mood, behaviour, and surrounding environment. Our workshop brings together researchers interested in collecting and augmenting context to understand device specific behaviour and routines, human behaviour and mood, and changes in the environment. The outcomes of this workshop are new tools, methodologies, and potential collaborations for sensing the outlying world as well as ourselves.
