As it is generally difficult to utilize GPS positioning indoors, methods such as Wi-Fi positioning and PDR positioning are proposed. In particular, in addition to being able to estimate the absolute position, the Wi-Fi positioning has attracted attention due to the low introduction cost due to already installed Wi-Fi base stations in various facilities. In Wi-Fi positioning, position estimation is mainly performed by using radio wave intensity (RSSI). However, at the time of radio observation, the body of the user shields the radio waves, which reduces the RSSI, and there is a problem that the positioning accuracy deteriorates. Therefore, in this research, the radio wave environment map is expressed using GMM (Gaussian mixture model), and the positioning accuracy is improved by considering radio wave attenuation by the human body in the Wi-Fi positioning using the particle filter.
