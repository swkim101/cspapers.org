Advertising and media industry has shown rapid growth in past few decades by aligning with the increased popularity of mobile phones. As a result, advertising firms tend to try new technologies to capture the target audience attractively. Since its method of identification is independent of the application, audio fingerprinting has been used for various purposes including content-based audio retrieval. This project aims to demonstrate one potential application of audio fingerprinting algorithm in the media industry in the form of a mobile application which is able to detect and identify advertisement tracks and notify the user of related details and offers. The audio fingerprinting algorithm extracts different attributes from an audio file, processes them into audio fingerprints, and compares them with a database of audio fingerprints to find the closest-matching audio file. The proposed application has tested on a small-scale database and shown a respectable performance.
