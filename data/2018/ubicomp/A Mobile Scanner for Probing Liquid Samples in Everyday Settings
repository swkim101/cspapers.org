Our work investigates the use of a Near InfraRed Spectroscopy scanner for the identification of liquids. While previous work has shown promising results for the identification of solid objects, identifying liquids poses additional challenges. These challenges include light scattering and low reflectance caused by the transparency of liquids, which interfere with the infrared measurement. We develop a prototype solution consisting of a 3D printed clamp that attaches to a tube, such that it blocks ambient light from interfering. Our preliminary results indicate that our prototype works, and we demonstrate this by measuring sugar levels in a liquid solution.
