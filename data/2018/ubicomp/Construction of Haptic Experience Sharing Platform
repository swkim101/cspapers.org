In this research, we introduce an experience sharing platform that enables users to record and playback experiences accompanied with haptics. This platform makes it possible to record and reproduce haptic data with tactile sensation added to video and audio by smartphone using file format MPEG-4. In addition, users can share the experiences including haptics by uploading and downloading this haptic data to and from a cloud system. We expect to use it for applications such as finding haptic similarity using tags added at the time of recording. In this paper, we focus on the design and verification of the haptic device, the data format of haptic data, and the cloud system. As a result, we present the effectiveness of data compression and storage of vibration tactile sense into the MPEG-4 container.
