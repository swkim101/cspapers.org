The goal of my research is to study how individuals perform self-experiments and to build behavior-powered systems that help them run such experiments. I have developed SleepCoacher, a sleep-tracking system that provides and evaluates the effect of actionable personalized recommendations for improving sleep. Going further, my aim is to go beyond sleep and develop the first guided self-experimentation system, which educates users about health interventions and helps them plan and carry out their own experiments. My thesis aims to use self-experimentation to help people take better care of their well-being by uncovering the hidden causal relationships in their lives.
