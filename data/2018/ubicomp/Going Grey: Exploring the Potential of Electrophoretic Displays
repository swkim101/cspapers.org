Electrophoretic devices, also known as Electronic Paper (E-paper), are gaining popularity due to their merits including low-energy consumption, flexible form factors as well as their non-glowing nature. These advantages are making E-paper an interesting alternative to conventional glowing LCD displays, which are generally believed to have negative impact on users' physiological and psychological well-being. Existing research on E-paper devices focuses on evaluating readability, usability and user-acceptance. However, there is little research on applying E-paper devices in scenarios other than reading. In this research, we aim to bridge this gap by investigating the potential of using E-paper devices in input-heavy applications scenarios that are realistic for both office work and school education, in pursuit of high efficiency, better usability and a healthier life style.
