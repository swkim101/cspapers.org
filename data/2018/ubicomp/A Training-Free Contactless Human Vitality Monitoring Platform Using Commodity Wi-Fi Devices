Human vitality information is pivotal to many sensing applications. By vitality, we mean the status of a human target in a multi-room environment: whether he/she is still and which room he/she is located in. Continuous monitoring of human vitality helps us obtain important high-level contexts like one's emotions, living habits, and physical conditions. Unlike the most existing solutions that require human efforts in offline training or calibration, in this demo, we present WiVit, a training-free contactless Wi-Fi based sensing platform that can capture human vitality information in 7*24 hours. In typical indoor environments, WiVit can achieve 98% accuracy of vitality detection and nearly 100% accuracy of area detection.
