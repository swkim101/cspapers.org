The development of ubiquitous computing and wearable sensing devices has lead to a situation where off-the-shelf hardware can be used for ubiquitous computing applications. We are arguing for using these available devices for designing unobtrusive context-aware systems that are capable of detecting in-situ changes of complex cognitive states. We believe that this is also marking the time for taking studies on context-awareness out of constrained settings into the wild, in order to test these systems in the real world situations, in which they shall later be implemented.
