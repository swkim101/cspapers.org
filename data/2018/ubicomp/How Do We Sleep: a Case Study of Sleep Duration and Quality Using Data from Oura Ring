We spend almost one third of our life in sleep. Sleep is one of the main contributors to our life and wellbeing. Sleep disorders are know to have adverse health effects but studies have also shown that too little or too much sleep is correlated with a greater risk of death. Sleep trackers have introduced new tools for sleep related studies by providing detailed, long-term sleep data. In this study, data collected with a wearable wellness device, Oura ring, is used to reveal how people sleep from the point of view of duration, consistency and timing. It is shown that, on average, Oura users sleep approximately 7 hours per night and that following a consistent sleep schedule is associated with more efficient sleep.
