I explore designing and creating sensing modules for older adults to guide them in avoiding prolonged exposure to harmful pollutants, such as PM2.5 and noise, that are positively associated with mild cognitive impairment as per what recent epidemiological studies revealed. Mild cognitive impairment is a stage of cognitive decline that falls between the cognitive changes due to normal aging and early onset dementia. My work explores designing and deploying a sensing wearable accompanied by a smartphone application for older adults to increase their awareness of how much they were exposed to these pollutants and to suggest possible actions to reduce exposure.
