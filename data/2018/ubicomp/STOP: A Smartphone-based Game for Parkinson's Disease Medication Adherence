Parkinson's disease (PD) is a second most common neurological disorder that affects up to 10 million people worldwide. It has an evolving nature and the symptoms may vary from patient to patient. Thus, to increase the effectiveness of PD treatment, it is necessary a personalized medication plan. Currently, PD patients undergo symptom observation on semiannual clinical visits. This work aims at the development of a new way of observation via smartphones, while at the same time offering the PD patient a tool to better understand his medication needs. Our mobile application leverages smartphone's inbuilt sensors in order to keep track of subject's medication adherence throughout the day, taking shape as a short-term accelerometer-based game played several times a day, and allows PD patients to record when they took medication. The combination of collected datasets can be used in further studies in order to estimate the changes in PD severity and medication effectiveness over time.
