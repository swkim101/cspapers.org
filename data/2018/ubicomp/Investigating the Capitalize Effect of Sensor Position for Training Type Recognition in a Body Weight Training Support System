A body weight training (BWT) means the training which utilizes the self-weight instead of the weight machine. The feedback of form and proper training menu recommendation is important for maximizing the effect of BWT. The objective of this study is to realize a novel support system which allows beginners to perform effective BWT alone, under wearable computing environment. To make an effective feedback, it is necessary to recognize BWT type with high accuracy. However, since the accuracy is greatly affected by the position of wearable sensors, we need to know the sensor position which achieves the high accuracy in recognizing the BWT type. We investigated 10 types BWT recognition accuracy for each sensor position. We found that waist is the best position when only 1 sensor is used. When 2 sensors are used, we found that the best combination is of waist and wrist. We conducted an evaluation experiment to show the effectiveness of sensor position. As a result of leave-one-person-out cross-validation from 13 subjects to confirm validity, we calculated the F-measure of 93.5% when sensors are placed on both wrist and waist.
