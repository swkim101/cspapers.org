Promoting students' well-being is instrumental to foster their academic performance and prevent health issues or drop outs. Since an average student spends 4 hours a day in the classroom, the emotional climate during lectures is likely to affect a student's overall well-being. We propose using the physiological synchrony among students as a measure of the classroom emotional climate. We analyze an existing data set containing electrodermal activity signals and affective states self-reports of 24 different students during 42 lectures. We show that an increment in group physiological synchrony is related to an improvement of the classroom emotional climate. The possibility to measure the classroom emotional climate unobtrusively has important implications for classroom experience sensing systems: it allows teachers to monitor and potentially control the classroom emotional climate, thereby improving students' teaching-learning performance and overall well-being.
