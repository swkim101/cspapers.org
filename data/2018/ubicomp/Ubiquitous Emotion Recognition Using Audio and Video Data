In this paper we present a method for recognizing emotions using video and audio data captured from a mobile phone. A mobile application is also presented that captures audio and video data, which were used to predict emotion with a convolutional neural network. We show results of our deep network on images taken from the BP4D+ [11] database, and audio signals taken from the RAVDESS dataset [4], which were also used to train the CNN used in the presented mobile application.
