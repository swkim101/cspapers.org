In this research, we propose a system that allows one to find a hidden spot that is scenic, yet unpopulated, with the intention of improving the satisfaction of one's trip. These hidden spots are not yet noted in the existing tourism services, however can provide a new place for the tourists to discover. We developed an application as a prototype to analyze and pinpoint hidden spots by using venue data from Foursquare [1]. We acquired 19,705 data around Tokyo and calculated the relative hiding spot degree. Thus, we made it possible to provide users with hidden spot information from smartphone application.
