We propose Tiger1, an eyeglasses-type wearable system to help users follow the 20-20-20 rule to alleviate the Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) symptoms such as eyestrain, headaches, and dry eyes. It monitors user's screen viewing activities and provides real-time feedback to help users take appropriate actions. We present a system architecture with an initial version of hardware prototype. We also report preliminary results to assess the feasibility.
