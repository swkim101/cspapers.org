Nowadays many people rely on smartphones in their daily lives for chatting in SNS, voice communications, searching for shopping information, and watching video contents, etc.. We tried to predict the used application on a smartphone based on Call Detail Records (CDRs) in our previous work[2]. However, we have found that classification of small messages into SNS messages or simple Web browsing is difficult. In this work, we focus on enhancing the possibility of predicting the SNS messages by extracting the notification to receivers of SNS messaging before the receivers actually access to the message body. We have conducted a small experiment to distinguish the SNS notifications from short background messages in Android. The result has shown that F_1 score is 0.87
