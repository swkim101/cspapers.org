Motion capture generates data which are often more accurate than those captured by multiple of accelerometer sensors by their physical specification. Based on the observation that accelerometer data can be obtained by the second derivation of position data from motion capture, we propose a simulator, called MEASURed, for activity recognition classifiers. MEASURed can accommodate any number of virtual accelerometer sensors on the body based on some given motion capture data. Therefore, MEASURed can evaluate activity recognition classifiers in settings with different number, placement, and sampling rate of accelerometer sensors. Our results show that the F1-Score estimated by MEASURed is close to that obtained with the real accelerometer data.
