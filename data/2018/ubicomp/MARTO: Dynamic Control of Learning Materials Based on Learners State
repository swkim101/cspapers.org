E-learning using digital learning materials is widespread due to freedom in choosing time and space for learning. Often, these learning materials are provided uniformly regardless of the learners' knowledge and the attention. However, to maximize the power of digitized materials, the presented materials can be dynamically adapted to the learner's state of learning, in particular, the degree of concentration. Based on the background, we propose MARTO, a system to change the content of learning based on the concentration level of the learner using an EEG. We have also examined how properly the concentration level is obtained with EEG by comparing it with the result obtained with eye gaze movement.
