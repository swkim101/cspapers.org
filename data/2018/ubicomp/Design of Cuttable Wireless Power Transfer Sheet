We propose a cuttable wireless power transfer sheet which allows users to modify its size and shape. This intuitive manipulation allows the users to easily add wireless power transmission capabilities to everyday objects. The properties of the sheet such as thinness, flexibility, and lightness make our sheet highly compatible with various configurations. The sheet includes H-tree wiring that allows the sheet to remain functional even when cut from the outside of the sheet. To show its feasibility, we present three applications in the combinations of our sheet and daily objects: wireless charging furniture, bag, and jacket.
