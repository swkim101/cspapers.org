When it comes to attention and notification management, most of the previous attempts to visualise notifications and smartphone usage have focused on digital representations on screens that are not fully embedded in the users' environment. Today, the constant development in hardware and embedded systems including mini displays, LEDs, actuators as well as digital fabrication, have begun to provide new opportunities for representing data physically in surrounding environments. In this paper, we introduce a new way of visualising notification data using physical representations that are deeply integrated within the physical space and everyday objects. Based on our preliminary design and prototypes, we identify a variety of design challenges for embedded data representation, and suggest opportunities for future research.
