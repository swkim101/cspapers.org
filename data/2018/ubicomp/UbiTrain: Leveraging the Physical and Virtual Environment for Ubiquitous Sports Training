Training for any kind of sports not only requires dedication, but also the correct way of obtaining the necessary information. To maximize training, we delve into the understanding of bridging between spectating and practice by bridging the virtual and physical space. We introduce the concept of ubiquitous sports training in UbiTrain, where the user is able to train anytime, anywhere with the help of mixed reality (MR) and virtual reality (VR). The contribution of this work are the following; 1) it leverages the use of physical and virtual space for sports training, 2) it adapts to any physical space the user is currently in, thus allowing ubiquitous usage, and 3) it combines both practice and observation as an effective learning package.
