Activity recognition and understanding are very important research areas. Video (RGB-Depth) sensors, accelerometer, LoRaWAN, etc. are explored for activity recognition for different applications. In this short paper, research areas related to these fields are added. The core research challenges will be discussed with the participants. I have been exploring sensor-based activities and health-care support system in Bangladesh and Japan for the last few years. Therefore, we can explore to share my research works, and discuss for further ideas and research partnerships.
