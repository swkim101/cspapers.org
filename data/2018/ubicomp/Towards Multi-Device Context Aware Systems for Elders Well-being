An increasing number of devices are getting enough computing and storage capacity to adapt their behaviour to the needs and preferences of their users. However, in multi device systems, this will require new techniques allowing several devices to take the contextual information of their users into account to adapt or coordinate themselves so they can improve the well-being of their users. This paper presents the Liquid Context and the Situational Context concepts. Both concepts are focused on facilitating the migration of the virtual profiles among different devices and on the computation of the contextual information of several entities in order to coordinate the surrounding devices. The main goal of this coordination is the improvement of the elders well-being by a better adaptation of the surrounding technology to their needs and preferences.
