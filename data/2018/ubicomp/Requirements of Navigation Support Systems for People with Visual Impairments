Tactile patterns are a means to convey general direction information to pedestrians (for example when turning right) and specific navigation instructions (for example when approaching the stairs). Tactile patterns are especially helpful for people with visual impairments in navigation scenarios and can also be used to deliver general notifications. This workshop paper is supposed to spark a discussion within the workshop about correctly identifying requirements and other needs of the visually impaired population in order to create a useful guidance tool to eventually replace the white cane as a primary navigation tool for the visually impaired.
