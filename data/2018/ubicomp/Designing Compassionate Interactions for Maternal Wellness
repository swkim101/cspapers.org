Life transitions are part of human experience. For women, transitions are an integral part of their lives, mainly due to the inherent biological changes unique to them. Life transitions such as menarche, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and menopause have profound implications for women's physical and mental wellness. For a woman, transition to motherhood is a joyous as well as stressful period in her life. Lack of care and support during this time can result in long-term adverse consequences for both mother and baby. Previous studies have identified a gap in expected and received support for new mothers, which can sometimes lead to postpartum depression (PPD). Compassion, which is empathy in action, may help reduce this gap. My research aims to develop a framework for understanding and designing compassionate interactions to foster maternal wellness during transition to motherhood.
