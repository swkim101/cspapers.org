Mobile instant messengers lack the social appropriateness of conversation, which incurs embarrassing situations when an unwanted message is unexpectedly exposed to people nearby. To avoid such situations, we develop a relationship-aware mobile messenger that takes into account the relationship of a receiver to a sender and people nearby. Based on the in-situ relationship, it selectively shows or hides a content of incoming messages on the notification pop-up. We develop a messenger prototype and show its usefulness via a deployment study.
