As new generations of sensors and modalities become available the possible sensor modalities to apply for occupant sensing accumulate. The fusion of heterogeneous sensing technologies has transposed the sensing scenarios where data is only based on one sensor modality. This paper presents a mapping and evaluation framework distilled from categorizing several heterogeneous sensing modalities and their limitation factors. The paper introduces the limitation factors: geometrical, tampering, reliability, environmental that has a repercussion on the performance. In this paper we mainly highlight two limitation factors- geometry and tampering and apply them in a case scenario considering diverse sensing modalities.
