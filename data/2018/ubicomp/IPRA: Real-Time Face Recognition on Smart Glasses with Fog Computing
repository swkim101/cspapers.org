The availability of artificial intelligence and smart glasses, equipped with cameras and displays, presents a strong foundation on which to build a wearable cognitive assistant, a device that provides the user with context-aware information. Although technical challenges such as power consumption and insufficient latency have plagued early versions of such products, developments in fog computing present a potential solution. In this paper, we present an application that uses fog computing to provide real-time face recognition on smart glasses. To understand the impact of fog computing on latency and battery consumption, we compare it with an adapted version that does not rely on fog computing.
