The traditional hospital set-up is not appropriate for long-term epilepsy seizure detection in naturalistic ambulatory settings. To explore the feasibility of seizure detection in such a setting, an in-hospital study was conducted to evaluate three wearable devices and a data collection platform for ambulatory seizure detection. The platform collects and processes data for study administrators, clinicians and data scientists, who use it to create models to detect seizures. For that purpose, all data collected from the wearable devices is additionally synchronized with the hospital EEG and video, with gold-standard seizure labels provided by trained clinicians. Data collected by wearable devices shows potential for seizure detection in out-of-hospital based and ambulatory settings.
