In this paper, we describe a new theoretically motivated application framework, Wenner, for developing tailored interactions for an exercise-oriented well-being application. The framework allows us to conduct in-lab and 'in the wild' studies to directly deploy and evaluate the effects of our interventions. We describe two systems that have been developed using the framework. The first WennerStep is an individually tailored text based approach to delivering adaptive persuasive messaging using a smartwatch. The second WennerAgent, is a virtual embodied coach who adaptively reacts to user activity with emotionally appropriate responses. We conclude with a discussion in which we describe outstanding challenges for our approach and relate this to current work on Chatbot deployments for well-being.
