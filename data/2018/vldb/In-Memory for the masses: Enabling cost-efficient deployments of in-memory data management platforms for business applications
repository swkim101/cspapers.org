With unrivaled performance, modern in-memory data management platforms such as SAP HANA [5] enable the creation of novel types of business applications. By keeping all data in memory, applications may combine both demanding transactional as well as complex analytical workloads in the context of a single system. While this excellent performance, data freshness, and ﬂexibility gain is highly desirable in a vast range of modern business applications [6], the corresponding large appetite for main memory has signiﬁcant implications on server sizing. Particularly, hardware costs on premise as well as in the cloud are at risk to increase sig-niﬁcantly, driven by the high amount of DRAM that needs to be provisioned potentially. In this talk, we discuss a variety of challenges and opportunities that arise when running business applications in a cost-eﬃcient manner on in-memory database systems.
