We demonstrate Grano 1 , an end-to-end anomaly detection and root cause analysis (or RCA for short) system for cloud-native distributed data platform by providing a holistic view of the system component topology, alarms and application events. Grano provides: a Detection Layer to process large amount of time-series monitoring data to detect anomalies at logical and physical system components; an Anomaly Graph Layer with novel graph modeling and algorithms for leveraging system topology data and detection results to identify the root cause relevance at the system component level; and an Application Layer that automatically notiﬁes on-call personnel and presents real-time and on-demand RCA support through an interactive graph interface. The system is deployed and evaluated using eBay’s production data to help on-call personnel to shorten the identiﬁcation of root cause from hours to minutes.
