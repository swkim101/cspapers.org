 Recent
 deterministic database systems
 have achieved high scalability and high availability in distributed environments given OLTP workloads. However, modern OLTP applications usually have changing workloads or access patterns, so how to make the resource provisioning elastic to the changing workloads becomes an important design goal for a deterministic database system.
 Live migration,
 which moves the specified data from a source machine to a destination node while continuously serving the incoming transactions, is a key technique required for the elasticity. In this paper, we present MgCrab, a live migration technique for a deterministic database system, that leverages the
 determinism
 to maintain the consistency of data on the source and destination nodes at very low cost during a migration period. We implement MgCrab on an open-source database system. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of MgCrab.
