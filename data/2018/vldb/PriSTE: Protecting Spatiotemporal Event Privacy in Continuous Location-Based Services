Location privacy-preserving mechanisms (LPPMs) have been extensively studied for protecting a user’s location in location-based services. However, when user’s perturbed locations are released continuously, existing LPPMs may not protect users’ sensitive spatiotemporal event , such as “visited hospital in the last week” or “regularly commuting between location 1 and location 2 every morning and afternoon” (it is easy to infer that locations 1 and 2 may be home and oﬃce). In this demonstration, we demonstrate PriSTE for protecting spatiotemporal event privacy in continuous location release. First, to raise users’ awareness of such a new privacy goal, we design an interactive tool to demonstrate how accurate an adversary could infer a secret spatiotemporal event from a sequence of locations or even LPPM-protected locations. The attendees can ﬁnd that some spatiotemporal events are quite risky and even these state-of-the-art LPPMs do not always protect spatiotemporal event privacy. Second, we demonstrate how a user can use PriSTE to automatically or manually convert an LPPM for location privacy into one protecting spatiotemporal event privacy in continuous location-based services. Finally, we visualize the trade-oﬀ between privacy and utility so that users can choose appropriate privacy parameters in diﬀerent application scenarios.
