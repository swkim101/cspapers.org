With the increase in amount of remote sensing data, there have been eﬀorts to eﬃciently process it to help ecologists and geographers answer queries. However, they often need to process this data in combination with vector data, for example, city boundaries. Existing eﬀorts require one dataset to be converted to the other representation, which is extremely ineﬃcient for large datasets. In this demonstration, we focus on the zonal statistics problem, which computes the statistics over a raster layer for each polygon in a vector layer. We demonstrate three approaches, vector-based, raster-based, and raptor-based approaches. The latter is a recent eﬀort of combining raster and vector data without a need of any conversion. This demo will allow users to run their own queries in any of the three methods and observe the diﬀerences in their performance depending on diﬀerent raster and vector dataset sizes.
