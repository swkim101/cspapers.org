Companies like Alibaba operate tens of data centers (DCs) across geographically distributed locations. These DCs collectively provide the storage space and computing power for the company, storing EBs of data and serving millions of batch analytics jobs every day. In Alibaba, as our businesses grow, there are more and more cross-DC dependencies caused by jobs reading data from remote DCs. Consequently, the precious wide area network bandwidth becomes a major bottleneck for operating geo-distributed DCs at scale. In this paper, we present Yugong — a system that manages data placement and job placement in Alibaba’s geo-distributed DCs, with the objective to minimize cross-DC bandwidth usage. Yugong uses three methods, namely project placement, table replication, and job outsourcing, to address the issues of high bandwidth consumption across the DCs. We give the details of Yugong’s de-sign and implementation for the three methods, and describe how it cooperates with other systems (e.g., Alibaba’s big data analytics platform and cluster scheduler) to improve the productivity of the DCs. We also report comprehensive performance evaluation re-sults, which validate the design of Yugong and show that signiﬁcant reduction in cross-DC bandwidth usage has been achieved.
