Entity resolution (ER) is the problem of accurately identifying multiple, differing, and possibly contradicting representations of unique real-world entities in data. It is a challenging and fundamental task in data cleansing and data integration. In this work, we propose graph differential dependencies (GDDs) as an extension of the recently developed graph entity dependencies (which are formal constraints for graph data) to enable approximate matching of values. Furthermore, we investigate a special discovery of GDDs for ER by designing an algorithm for generating a non-redundant set of GDDs in labelled data. Then, we develop an effective ER technique, Certus, that employs the learned GDDs for improving the accuracy of ER results. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of our proposals on five real-world ER benchmark datasets and a proprietary database to test their effectiveness and efficiency. The results from the experiments show the discovery algorithm and Certus are efficient; and more importantly, GDDs significantly improve the precision of ER without considerable trade-off of recall.
