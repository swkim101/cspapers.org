Entity Resolution (ER) is the task of identifying diﬀerent representations of the same real-world object. To achieve scalability and the desired level of quality, the typical ER pipeline includes multiple steps that may involve low-level coding and extensive human labor. We present SystemER , a tool for learning explainable ER models that reduces the human labor all throughout the stages of the ER pipeline. SystemER achieves explainability by learning rules that not only perform a given ER task but are human-comprehensible; this provides transparency into the learning process, and further enables veriﬁcation and customization of the learned model by the domain experts. By leveraging a human in the loop and active learning, SystemER also ensures that a small number of labeled examples is suﬃcient to learn high-quality ER models. SystemER is a full-ﬂedged tool that includes an easy to use interface, support for both ﬂat ﬁles and semi-structured data, and scale-out capabilities by distributing computation via Apache Spark
