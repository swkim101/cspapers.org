Driven by the recent adoption of temporal expressions into SQL:2011, extensions of temporal support in conventional database management systems (a.b.a. DBMSs) have re-emerged as a research hotspot. In this paper, we present a lightweight yet eﬃcient built-in temporal implementation in Tencent’s distributed database management system, namely TDSQL. The novelty of TDSQL’s temporal implementation includes: (1) a new temporal data model with the extension of SQL:2011, (2) a built-in temporal implementation with various optimizations, which are also applicable to other DBMSs, and (3) a low-storage-consumption in which only data changes are maintained. For the repeatability purpose, we elaborate the integration of our proposed techniques into MySQL. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-life dataset and synthetic TPC benchmarks by comparing TD-SQL with other temporal databases. The results show that TDSQL is lightweight and eﬃcient
