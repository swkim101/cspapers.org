E-commerce taxonomy plays an essential role in online retail business. Existing taxonomy of e-commerce platforms organizes items into an ontology structure. However, the ontology-driven approach is subject to costly manual maintenance and often does not capture user’s search intention, particularly when user searches by her personalized needs rather than a universal definition of the items. Observing that search queries can effectively express user’s intention, we present a novel large-Scale Hierarchical taxOnomy via grAph based query coaLition (SHOAL) to bridge the gap between item taxonomy and user search intention. SHOAL organizes hundreds of millions of items into a hierarchical topic structure. Each topic that consists of a cluster of items denotes a conceptual shopping scenario, and is tagged with easy-to-interpret descriptions extracted from search queries. Furthermore, SHOAL establishes correlation between categories of ontology-driven taxonomy, and offers opportunities for explainable recommendation. The feedback from domain experts shows that SHOAL achieves a precision of 98% in terms of placing items into the right topics, and the result of an online A/B test demonstrates that SHOAL boosts the Click Through Rate (CTR) by 5%. SHOAL has been deployed in Alibaba and supports millions of searches for online shopping per day. PVLDB Reference Format: Zhao Li, Xia Chen, Xuming Pan, Pengcheng Zou, Yuchen Li and Guoxian Yu.
