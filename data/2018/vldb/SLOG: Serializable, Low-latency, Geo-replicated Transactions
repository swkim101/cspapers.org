For decades, applications deployed on a world-wide scale have been forced to give up at least one of (1) strict serializability (2) low latency writes (3) high transactional throughput. In this paper we discuss SLOG: a system that avoids this tradeoff for workloads which contain physical region locality in data access. SLOG achieves high-throughput, strictly serializable ACID transactions at geo-replicated distance and scale for all transactions submitted across the world, all the while achieving low latency for transactions that initiate from a location close to the home region for data they access. Experiments find that SLOG can reduce latency by more than an order of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art strictly serializable geo-replicated database systems such as Spanner and Calvin, while maintaining high throughput under contention.
