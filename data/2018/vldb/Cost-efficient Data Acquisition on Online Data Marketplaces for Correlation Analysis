 Incentivized by the enormous economic profits, the data marketplace platform has been proliferated recently. In this paper, we consider the data marketplace setting where a data shopper would like to buy data instances from the data marketplace for correlation analysis of certain attributes. We assume that the data in the marketplace is dirty and not free. The goal is to find the data instances from a large number of datasets in the marketplace whose join result not only is of high-quality and rich join informativeness, but also delivers the best correlation between the requested attributes. To achieve this goal, we design DANCE, a middleware that provides the desired data acquisition service. DANCE consists of two phases: (1) In the
 off-line
 phase, it constructs a two-layer join graph from samples. The join graph includes the information of the datasets in the marketplace at both schema and instance levels; (2) In the
 online
 phase, it searches for the data instances that satisfy the constraints of data quality, budget, and join informativeness, while maximizing the correlation of source and target attribute sets. We prove that the complexity of the search problem is NP-hard, and design a heuristic algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Experiment results on two benchmark and one real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our heuristic data acquisition algorithm.
