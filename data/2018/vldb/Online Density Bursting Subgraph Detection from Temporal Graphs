 Given a temporal weighted graph that consists of a potentially endless stream of updates, we are interested in finding density bursting subgraphs (DBS for short), where a DBS is a subgraph that accumulates its density at the fastest speed. Online DBS detection enjoys many novel applications. At the same time, it is challenging since the time duration of a DBS can be arbitrarily long but a limited size storage can buffer only up to a certain number of updates. To tackle this problem, we observe the critical decomposability of DBSs and show that a DBS with a long time duration can be decomposed into a set of indecomposable DBSs with equal or larger burstiness. We further prove that the time duration of an indecomposable DBS is upper bounded and propose an efficient method
 TopkDBSOL
 to detect indecomposable DBSs in an online manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of
 TopkDBSOL
 in detecting significant DBSs from temporal graphs in real applications.
