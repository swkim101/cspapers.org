AI/ML is becoming a horizontal technology: its application is expanding to more domains, and its integration touches more parts of the technology stack. Given the strong dependence of ML on data, this expansion creates a new space for applying data management techniques. At the same time, the deeper integration of ML in the technology stack provides more touch points where ML can be used in data management systems and vice versa. In this panel, we invite researchers working in this domain to discuss this emerging world and its implications on datamanagement research. Among other topics, the discussion will touch on the opportunities for interesting research, how we can interact with other communities, what is the core expertise we bring to the table, and how we can conduct and evaluate this research effectively within our own community. The goal of the panel is to nudge the community to appreciate the opportunities in this new world of horizontal AI/ML and to spur a discussion on how we can shape an effective research agenda.

THE ERA OF HORIZONTAL ML/AI ML/AI is applied in an increasing range of domains, e.g., medical diagnosis, transportation, farming, chip design, and scientific research, to name a few. In each of these domains, the application of ML/AI is transformational, as the ongoing advances in ML (mostly on deep neural networks) are enabling big leaps in terms of domain-specific technologies and functionality.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.14778/3352063.3352149 In parallel to this expansion, ML is being integrated in larger parts of the technology stack. Machine-learned models have successfully replaced parts of the stack, from smallerscope modules (e.g., replacing heuristic strategies for caching) to larger subsystems (e.g., using models for end-to-end translation). In addition, the touch points to ML have spurred new research directions in other communities, e.g., hardware accelerators for ML. Overall, the emerging reality is that ML is becoming “horizontal”: it applies to more domains, it works in increasingly diverse hardware and software environments, and it has acquired a larger user base with a diverse skill set. At a high level, this is good news for the data-management community. One obvious benefit is that it becomes easier to integrate ML in our own stack and thus enable improvements and simplification to internal components. Perhaps more importantly, our community gains an expanded impact surface due to the close relationship between ML and data management. For instance, it is well known that highquality data is critical for training good models, and also that ML pipelines are themselves data flows that resemble and extend data-analysis flows that we know how to optimize. Techniques and methods for data management in these contexts have already proven valuable for ML, and now we have the opportunity to expand our research to even more contexts in which ML is applied. What are some concrete directions for new and exciting data-management research in this new era of horizontal ML/AI? How do we engage with the ML community to popularize our research? How do we ensure that our community is able to conduct and evaluate this research in the first place, and what should we do to better prepare new researchers and practitioners in our domain? These are some of the questions that we will attempt to answer in this panel.
