 With the increase of devices equipped with location sensors, mining spatio-temporal data for interesting behavioral patterns has gained attention in recent years. One of such well-known patterns is the convoy pattern which can be used, e.g., to find groups of people moving together in public transport or to prevent traffic jams. A convoy consists of at least
 m
 objects moving together for at least
 k
 consecutive time instants where
 m
 and
 k
 are user-defined parameters. Convoy mining is an expensive task and existing sequential algorithms do not scale to real-life dataset sizes. Existing sequential as well as parallel algorithms require a complex set of data-dependent parameters which are hard to set and tune. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new fast exact sequential convoy pattern mining algorithm "k/2-hop" that is free of data-dependent parameters. The proposed algorithm processes the data corresponding to a few specific key timestamps at each step and quickly prunes objects with no possibility of forming a convoy. Thus, only a very small portion of the complete dataset is considered for mining convoys. Our experimental results show that k/2-hop outperforms existing sequential as well as parallel convoy pattern mining algorithms by orders of magnitude, and scales to larger datasets which existing algorithms fail on.
