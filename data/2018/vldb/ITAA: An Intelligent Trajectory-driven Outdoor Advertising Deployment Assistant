In this paper, we demonstrate an Intelligent Trajectory-driven outdoor Advertising deployment Assistant (ITAA), which assists users to find an optimal strategy for outdoor advertising (ad) deployment. The challenge is how to measure the influence to the moving trajectories of ads, and how to optimize the placement of ads among billboards that maximize the influence has been proven NP-hard. Therefore, we develop a framework based on two trajectory-driven influence models. ITAA is built upon this framework with a user-friendly UI. It serves both ad companies and their customers. We enhance the interpretability to improve the users understanding of the influence of ads. The interactive function of ITAA is made interpretable and easy to engage.
