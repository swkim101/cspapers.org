Machine learning (ML) has gained a pivotal role in answering complex predictive analytic queries. Model building for large scale datasets is one of the time consuming parts of the data science pipeline. Often data scientists are willing to sacriﬁce some accuracy in order to speed up this process during the exploratory phase. In this paper, we propose to demonstrate ApproxML, a system that eﬃciently constructs approximate ML models for new queries from previously constructed ML models using the concepts of model materialization and reuse . ApproxML supports a variety of ML models such as generalized linear models for supervised learning
