Modern elastic computing systems allow applications to scale up and down automatically, increasing capacity for workload spikes and ensuring cost savings during lulls in activity. Adapting database management systems to work on top of such elastic infrastructure is not a trivial task, and requires a deep understanding of the sophisticated interplay between data fragmentation, replica allocation, and cluster provisioning. This demonstration showcases NashDB, an end-to-end method for addressing these concerns in an automatic way. NashDB relies on economic models to maximize query performance while staying within a userâ€™s budget. This demonstration will (1) allow audience members to see how NashDB handles shifting workloads in an adaptive way, and (2) allow audience members to test NashDB themselves by constructing synthetic workloads and seeing how NashDB adapts a cluster to them in real time.
