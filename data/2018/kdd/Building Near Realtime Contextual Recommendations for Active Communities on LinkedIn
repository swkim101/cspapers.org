At LinkedIn our mission is to build active communities for all of our members such that members are able to disseminate or seek professional content at the right time on the right channel. We mine a variety of data sources including LinkedIn's Economic Graph and member activities on the site and use large scale machine learning algorithms to recommend members to connect to people they might know to build active communities. We build real-time recommendations to disseminate information so that members never miss a relevant conversation that is going on in any of the communities they are part of. Through this talk we will showcase how we are trying to solve some of the most challenging problems on internet-scale social network analysis, streaming algorithms, and multi-objective optimization.
