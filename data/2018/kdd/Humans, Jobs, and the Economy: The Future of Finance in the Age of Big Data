Finance is the efficient allocation of capital to achieve individual and societal objectives. Finance runs on information, from the number of ships under construction in the ports of Dalian, to the beliefs of investors in a marketplace--we want to put capital to work in the places it will have the biggest impact. Increasingly, large new data sources are facilitating our understanding of how individuals, teams, companies, governments, and other entities operate, allowing for new types of modelling that can unlock value and accelerate growth. In this talk, we will explore several open questions at the intersection of individuals, jobs, companies, and financial markets, where new data brings the promise of new understanding. How do people and firms interact to create economic value? How do we accelerate this value creation? How can the KDD community help?
