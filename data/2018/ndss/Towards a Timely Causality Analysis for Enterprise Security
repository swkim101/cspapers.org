—The increasingly sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks have become a serious challenge for enterprise IT security. Attack causality analysis , which tracks multi-hop causal relationships between ﬁles and processes to diagnose attack provenances and consequences, is the ﬁrst step towards under- standing APT attacks and taking appropriate responses. Since attack causality analysis is a time-critical mission, it is essential to design causality tracking systems that extract useful attack information in a timely manner. However, prior work is limited in serving this need. Existing approaches have largely focused on pruning causal dependencies totally irrelevant to the attack, but fail to differentiate and prioritize abnormal events from numerous relevant, yet benign and complicated system operations, resulting in long investigation time and slow responses. To address this problem, we propose P RIO T RACKER , a back- ward and forward causality tracker that automatically prioritizes the investigation of abnormal causal dependencies in the tracking process. Speciﬁcally, to assess the priority of a system event, we consider its rareness and topological features in the causality graph. To distinguish unusual operations from normal system events, we quantify the rareness of each event by developing a reference model which records common routine activities in corporate computer systems. We implement P RIO T RACKER , in 20K lines of Java code, and a reference model builder in 10K lines of Java code. We evaluate our tool by deploying both systems in a real enterprise IT environment, where we collect 1TB of 2.5 billion OS events from 150 machines in one week. Experimental results show that P RIO T RACKER can capture attack traces that are missed by existing trackers and reduce the analysis time by up to two orders of magnitude .
