Developers of large-scale software systems may use third-party modules to reduce costs and accelerate release cycles, at some risk to safety and security. BREAKAPP exploits module boundaries to automate compartmentalization of systems and enforce security policies, enhancing reliability and security. BREAKAPP transparently spawns modules in protected compartments while preserving their original behavior. Optional high-level policies decouple security assumptions made during development from requirements imposed for module composition and use. These policies allow fine-tuning trade-offs such as security and performance based on changing threat models or load patterns. Evaluation of BREAKAPP with a prototype implementation for JavaScript demonstrates feasibility by enabling simplified security hardening of existing systems with low performance overhead.
