We show experimental evidence and argue that communication-centric modelling of complex embedded computing systems provides predictive power over the workload dependent behaviour of these systems. System and external observables included in this behaviour can be utilised in the system's analysis. We provide the preliminary results from our detection (monitoring) and imitation (simulation) phases, both part of a larger workflow in development.
