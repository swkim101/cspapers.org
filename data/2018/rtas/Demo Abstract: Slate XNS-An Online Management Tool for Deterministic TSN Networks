Time-Sensitive Networks are becoming the standard in real-time networking over IEEE 802 Ethernet. The set of TSN standards currently being defined by the IEEE TSN task group offer mechanisms introducing real-time behavior over specialized hardware network nodes. Out of these standards we identify those enabling the integration of deterministic real-time communication with the legacy best-effort traffic. In this demonstration we show the management of a simple TSN hardware setup via the Slate XNS tool-chain. We demonstrate the ease-of-use of the tools in charge of the entire network as well as the provided scheduling capabilities allowing one-click deployment of deterministic communications with properly configured IEEE 802.1Qbv and IEEE 802.1ASrev sub-standards.
