Problem: In Ethereum network, a smart contract is software code that implements a computer protocol. Smart contracts automatically execute when preset conditions are met and cannot be terminated. Smart contracts can disguise Ponzi schemes in which only few out of hundreds of participants make profit from a contract. As the blockchain legal framework is still not fully developed, regulators may be unable to deter the creators of Ponzi schemes.
