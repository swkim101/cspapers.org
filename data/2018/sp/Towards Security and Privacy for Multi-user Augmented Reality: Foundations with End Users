Immersive augmented reality (AR) technologies are becoming a reality. Prior works have identified security and privacy risks raised by these technologies, primarily considering individual users or AR devices. However, we make two key observations: (1) users will not always use AR in isolation, but also in ecosystems of other users, and (2) since immersive AR devices have only recently become available, the risks of AR have been largely hypothetical to date. To provide a foundation for understanding and addressing the security and privacy challenges of emerging AR technologies, grounded in the experiences of real users, we conduct a qualitative lab study with an immersive AR headset, the Microsoft HoloLens. We conduct our study in pairs - 22 participants across 11 pairs - wherein participants engage in paired and individual (but physically co-located) HoloLens activities. Through semi-structured interviews, we explore participants' security, privacy, and other concerns, raising key findings. For example, we find that despite the HoloLens's limitations, participants were easily immersed, treating virtual objects as real (e.g., stepping around them for fear of tripping). We also uncover numerous security, privacy, and safety concerns unique to AR (e.g., deceptive virtual objects misleading users about the real world), and a need for access control among users to manage shared physical spaces and virtual content embedded in those spaces. Our findings give us the opportunity to identify broader lessons and key challenges to inform the design of emerging single-and multi-user AR technologies.
