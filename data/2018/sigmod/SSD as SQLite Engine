As a proof-of-concept for the vision “SSD as SQL Engine” (SaS in short), we demonstrate that SQLite [4], a popular mobile database engine, in its entirety can run inside a real SSD development platform. By turning storage device into database engine, SaS allows applications to directly interact with full SQL database server running inside storage device. In SaS, the SQL language itself, not the traditional dummy block interface, will be provided as new interface between applications and storage device. In addition, since SaS plays the role of the uni ed platform of database computing node and storage node, the host and the storage need not be segregated any more as separate physical computing components.
