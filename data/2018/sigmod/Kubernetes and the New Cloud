We are in the midst of shifting the notion of “Cloud” to a higher level of abstraction than virtual machines — one based on services, processes and APIs. Kubernetes epitomizes this shift and has rapidly become the de facto way to manage this new era of container-based applications. It aims to simplify the deployment and management of services, including the construction of applications as sets of interacting but independent services. We explain some of the key concepts in Kubernetes and Istio and show how they work together to simplify evolution, scaling and operations.
