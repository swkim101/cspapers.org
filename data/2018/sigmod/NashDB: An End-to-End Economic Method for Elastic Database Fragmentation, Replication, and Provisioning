Distributed data management systems often operate on "elastic'' clusters that can scale up or down on demand. These systems face numerous challenges, including data fragmentation, replication, and cluster sizing. Unfortunately, these challenges have traditionally been treated independently, leaving administrators with little insight on how the interplay of these decisions affects query performance. This paper introduces NashDB, an adaptive data distribution framework that relies on an economic model to automatically balance the supply and demand of data fragments, replicas, and cluster nodes. NashDB adapts its decisions to query priorities and shifting workloads, while avoiding underutilized cluster nodes and redundant replicas. This paper introduces and evaluates NashDB's model, as well as a suite of optimization techniques designed to efficiently identify data distribution schemes that match workload demands and transition the system to this new scheme with minimum data transfer overhead. Experimentally, we show that NashDB is often Pareto dominant compared to other solutions.
