1 PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION Schema matching is a data integration task that provides correspondences between concepts describing the meaning of data in various heterogeneous, distributed data sources (e.g., attributes in database schemata). The research of data integration and schema matching spans over multiple decades, holds both theoretical and practical appeal, and enjoys a continued interest by researchers and practitioners (See surveys [7] and books [6, 18] for an overview). In recent years, there has been an evolution of data accumulation, management, analytics, and visualization (also known as big data). Big data is primarily about collecting volumes of data in an increased velocity from various sources and varying veracity. Big data is characterized by technological advancements such as Internet of things (accumulation), cloud computing (management), and deep learning (analytics). Putting it all together provides us with a new, exciting, and challenging research agenda. Schema matching problems have been historically defined as a semi-automated task in which correspondences are generated by matching algorithms and subsequently validated by a single human expert. The reason for that is the inherent assumption that humans â€œdo it better," which is not necessarily the case [28]. This research is devoted to the investigation of respective roles of humans and machines in achieving cognitive tasks. We focus on matching as a concrete task where the traditional roles of humans and machines are subject to change due to the availability of data and advances in machine learning. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Preliminaries are given in Section 2 followed the model and approach (Section 3). We conclude in 4 with our main contributions and results.
