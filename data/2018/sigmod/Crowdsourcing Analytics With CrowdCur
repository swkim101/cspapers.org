We propose to demonstrate CrowdCur \xspace, a system that allows platform administrators, requesters, and workers to conduct various analytics of interest. CrowdCur \xspace includes a worker curation component that relies on explicit feedback elicitation to best capture workers' preferences, a task curation component that monitors task completion and aggregates their statistics, and an OLAP-style component to query and combine analytics by a worker, by task type, etc. Administrators can fine tune their system's performance. Requesters can compare platforms and better choose the set of workers to target. Workers can compare themselves to others and find tasks and requesters that suit them best.
