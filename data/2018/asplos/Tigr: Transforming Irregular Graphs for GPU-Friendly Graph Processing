Graph analytics delivers deep knowledge by processing large volumes of highly connected data. In real-world graphs, the degree distribution tends to follow the power law -- a small portion of nodes own a large number of neighbors. The high irregularity of degree distribution acts as a major barrier to their efficient processing on GPU architectures, which are primarily designed for accelerating computations on regular data with SIMD executions. Existing solutions to the inefficiency of GPU-based graph analytics either modify the graph programming abstraction or rely on changes to the low-level thread execution models. The former requires more programming efforts for designing and maintaining graph analytics; while the latter couples with the underlying architectures, making it difficult to adapt as architectures quickly evolve. Unlike prior efforts, this work proposes to address the above fundamental problem at its origin -- the irregular graph data itself. It raises a critical question in irregular graph processing: Is it possible to transform irregular graphs into more regular ones such that the graphs can be processed more efficiently on GPU-like architectures, yet still producing the same results? Inspired by the question, this work introduces Tigr -- a graph transformation framework that can effectively reduce the irregularity of real-world graphs with correctness guarantees for a wide range of graph analytics. To make the transformations practical, Tigr features a lightweight virtual transformation scheme, which can substantially reduce the costs of graph transformations, while preserving the benefits of reduced irregularity. Evaluation on Tigr-based GPU graph processing shows significant and consistent speedup over the state-of-the-art GPU graph processing frameworks for a spectrum of irregular graphs.
