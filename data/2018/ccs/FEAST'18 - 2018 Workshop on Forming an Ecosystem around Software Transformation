It is time for us to welcome you to the Third Workshop on Forming an Ecosystem Around Software Transformation (FEAST 2018)! This year's workshop is held in conjunction with the 25th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) on October 19th, 2018 in Toronto, Canada. As always, the workshop is geared toward discussion and understanding of several critical topics surrounding late-stage software transformation for improving the security and efficiency of all software used in security-critical applications. The scope of discussion for this workshop will include topics that may be necessary to fully explore the power and impact of late-stage software customization efforts, on binary code and beyond. The call for papers attracted strong submissions from both academy and industry. In total, we accepted 5 full technical papers, and augmented them with a number of exciting invited talks, short talks, and planned discussions. Putting together FEAST'18 is a team effort, and we could not have done it without the authors (and their excellent submissions), the program committee (for their insightful reviews), and the Office of Naval Resea rch for the creation of this workshop in the first place. We are excited about this workshop, and we are sure that you will be as well! Please enjoy the programs, the discussions, and the resulting spread and creation of new ideas!
