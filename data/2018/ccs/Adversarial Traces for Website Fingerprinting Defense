Website Fingerprinting (WF) is a traffic analysis attack that enables an eavesdropper to infer the victim's web activity even when encrypted and even when using the Tor anonymity system. Using deep learning classifiers, the attack can reach up to 98% accuracy. Existing WF defenses are either too expensive in terms of bandwidth and latency overheads (e.g. 2-3 times as large or slow) or ineffective against the latest attacks. In this work, we explore a novel defense based on the idea of adversarial examples that have been shown to undermine machine learning classifiers in other domains. Our Adversarial Traces defense adds padding to a Tor traffic trace in a manner that reliably fools the classifier into classifying it as coming from a different site. The technique drops the accuracy of the state-of-the-art attack from 98% to 60%, while incurring a reasonable 47% bandwidth overhead, showing its promise as a possible defense for Tor.
