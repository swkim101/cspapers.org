A variety of secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols have been proposed up to now. Since their performance characteristics are incomparable, the most suitable MPC protocol may be completely different depending on the given computational task and environment. It is tedious work to compare all the possibility to choose the most suitable MPC. The paper " Generalizing the SPDZ Compiler For Other Protocols'' in this ACM-CCS 2018 shows a framework for adding MPC protocols to a development tool of MPC program called "SPDZ'', which enables to compare multiple protocols easily. This poster and demo show how this framework is useful for choosing the suitable protocol for given target computation and environment.
