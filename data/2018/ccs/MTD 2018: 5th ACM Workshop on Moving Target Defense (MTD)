The objective of the 5th ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD 2018) - held in Toronto, Canada on October 15, 2018, in conjunction with the 24th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2018) - is to bring together researchers from academia, government, and industry to discuss novel randomization, diversification, and dynamism techniques for improving the security of computer systems and network, and new metric and analytical frameworks to assess and quantify the effectiveness of MTD techniques. As in previous editions, the 2018 workshop offers a forum to discuss the challenges and opportunities that such defenses provide. We have assembled an exciting and diverse program including nine refereed papers and one invited keynote talk that will provide participants with a vibrant and thought-provoking set of ideas and insights.
