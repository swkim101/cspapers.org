Home-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices have gained in popularity and many households became "smart'' by using devices such as smart sensors, locks, and voice-based assistants. Given the limitations of existing authentication techniques, we explore new opportunities for user authentication in smart home environments. Specifically, we design a novel authentication method in IoT-enabled smart homes. We perform initial experiments and a user study leveraging network traffic collected from 8 IoT devices in our university lab. Preliminary results show that our LSTM model achieves a maximum accuracy of 75% in identifying users.
