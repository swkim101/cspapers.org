Sub-event detection can help faster and deeper understanding of an event by providing human-friendly clusters, and thus has become an important research topic in Web mining and knowledge management. In existing sub-event detection methods, clustering based methods are brittle for using heuristic similarity metric to judge whether documents belong to the same sub-event, while topic model based methods are limited to the bag of words assumption. To overcome these drawbacks in previous research, in this paper, we propose an encoder-memory-decoder framework for sub-event detection. Our model learns document and sub-event representations suitable for the similarity metric in a data-driven manner, and transforms sub-event detection into selecting the most proper sub-event representation that can maximize text reconstruction probability. Considering the case of over-fitting, we also apply transfer learning in our model. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to develop an unsupervised deep neural model for sub-event detection. We use Twitter as an examplar social media platform for our study, and experimental results show that our model outperforms baseline methods for sub-event detection.
