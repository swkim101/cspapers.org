BBoxDB is a distributed and highly available key-bounding-box-value store which enhances the classical key-value data model with an axis-parallel bounding box. The bounding box describes the location of the values in an n-dimensional space, and enables BBoxDB to efficiently distribute multi-dimensional data across a cluster of nodes. Well-known geometric algorithms (such as the K-D Tree) are used to create distribution regions (multi-dimensional shards). Distribution regions are created dynamically, based on the stored data. BBoxDB stores data of multiple tables co-partitioned, which enables efficient distributed spatial joins. Spatial joins on co-partitioned tables can be executed without data shuffling between nodes. A two-level index structure is employed to retrieve stored data quickly. We demonstrate the interaction with the system, the dynamic creation of distribution regions and the data redistribution feature of BBoxDB.
