In machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks, sentence inference is an important but extremely difficult problem. Most of MRC models directly interact articles with questions from the word level, which ignores inter and intra information of sentences and cannot well focus on problems about sentence reasoning and inference, especially when the answer clues are far apart in the article. In this paper, we propose an option gate approach for reading comprehension. We consider applying a sentence-level option gate module to make the model incorporate sentence information. In our approach we (1) extract key sentences in the article to filter out noise unrelated to the question and the options, (2) encode each sentence in articles, questions and options with dot-product self-attention to obtain intra sentence representations, (3) model inter relationships between the article and the question with bilinear attention and (4) apply an option gate with sentence inference information to each option representation with the question-aware article representation. This module can help better reasoning instead of directly word matching or paraphrasing. And this module can easily supply sentence information for most of the existing reading comprehension models. Experimental results on the RACE dataset show that this easy and simple module helps outperform the baseline models by 2.5% at most (single model), and achieve state-of-the-art results on the RACE-H dataset.
