Since heterogeneous information network (HIN) is able to integrate complex information and contain rich semantics, there is a surge of HIN based recommendation in recent years. Although existing methods have achieved performance improvement to some extent, they still face the following problems: how to extensively exploit and comprehensively explore the local and global information in HIN for recommendation. To address these issues, we propose a unified model LGRec to fuse local and global information for top-N recommendation in HIN. We firstly model most informative local neighbor information for users and items respectively with a co-attention mechanism. In addition, our model learns effective relation representations between users and items to capture rich information in HIN by optimizing a multi-label classification problem. Finally, we combine the two parts into an unified model for top-N recommendation. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
