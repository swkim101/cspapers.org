The problem of ad-hoc structured document retrieval arises in many information access scenarios, from Web to product search. Yet neither deep neural networks, which have been successfully applied to ad-hoc information retrieval and Web search, nor the attention mechanism, which has been shown to significantly improve the performance of deep neural networks on natural language processing tasks, have been explored in the context of this problem. In this paper, we propose a deep neural architecture for ad-hoc structured document retrieval, which utilizes attention mechanism to determine important phrases in keyword queries as well as the relative importance of matching those phrases in different fields of structured documents. Experimental evaluation on publicly available collections for Web document, product and entity retrieval from knowledge graphs indicates superior retrieval accuracy of the proposed neural architecture relative to both state-of-the-art neural architectures for ad-hoc document retrieval and probabilistic models for ad-hoc structured document retrieval.
