Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) are Internet hubs that mainly provide the switching infrastructure to interconnect networks and exchange traffic. While the initial goal of IXPs was to bring together networks residing in the same city or country, and thus keep local traffic local, this model is gradually shifting. Many networks connect to IXPs without having physical presence at their switching infrastructure. This practice, called Remote Peering, is changing the Internet topology and economy, and has become the subject of a contentious debate within the network operatorsâ€™ community. However, despite the increasing attention it attracts, the understanding of the characteristics and impact of remote peering is limited. In this work, we introduce and validate a heuristic methodology for discovering remote peers at IXPs. We (i) identify critical remote peering inference challenges, (ii) infer remote peers with high accuracy (>97%) and coverage (94%) per IXP, and (iii) characterize different aspects of the remote peering ecosystem by applying our methodology to 30 large IXPs. We observe that remote peering is a significantly common practice in all the studied IXPs; for the largest IXPs, remote peers account for 40% of their member base. We also show that today, IXP growth is mainly driven by remote peering, which contributes two times more than local peering.
