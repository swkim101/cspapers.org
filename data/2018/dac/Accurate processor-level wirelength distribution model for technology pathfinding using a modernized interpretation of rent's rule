Faithful system-level modeling is vital to design and technology pathfinding, and requires accurate representation of interconnects. In this study, Rentâ€™s rule is modernized to cater to advanced technology and design, and applied to derive a priori wirelength distribution models. Furthermore, a priori interconnect branching models are proposed to capture design constraints and their handling by the Electronic-Design-Automation tools. These interconnect branching models are embedded into the wire-length distribution models and validated against a suite of state-of-the-art commercial designs across technology nodes. Novel design-specific critical-path models are presented which capture trends in technology and microarchitecture, providing a reliable framework for future technology and design benchmarking.
