We propose a technique to reduce compulsory misses of packet processing cache (PPC), which largely affects both throughput and energy of core routers. Rather than prefetching data, our technique called response prediction cache (RPC) speculatively stores predicted data into PPC without additional access to the low-throughput and power-consuming memory (i.e., TCAM). RPC predicts the data related to a response flow at the arrival of the corresponding request flow, based on the request-response model of internet communications. RPC can improve the cache miss rate, throughput, and energy-efficiency of PPC systems by 15.3%, 17.9%, and 17.8%, respectively.
