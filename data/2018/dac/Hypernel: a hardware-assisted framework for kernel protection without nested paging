Large OS kernels always suffer from attacks due to their numerous inherent vulnerabilities. To protect the kernel, hypervisors have been employed by many security solutions. However, relying on a hypervisor has a detrimental impact on the system performance due mainly to nested paging. In this paper, we present Hypernel, a security framework combining hardware and software components to address this problem. Hypersec, the software component, provides an isolated execution environment for security solutions, and the hardware monitor component enables a word-granularity monitoring capability on the kernel memory. Our evaluation shows that Hypernel efficiently fulfills the role of a security framework, while imposing mere 3.1% of runtime overhead on the system.
