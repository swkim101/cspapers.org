Byte-addressable non-volatile memories can be used with DRAM to build a hybrid memory system of volatile/non-volatile main memory (NVMM). NVMM file systems demand consistency techniques such as logging and copy-on-write to guarantee data consistency in case of system crashes. However, conventional consistency techniques may incur write amplification that severely degrades the file system performance. In this paper, we propose LAWN (logless, a lternate w riting for NVMM), a novel approach that achieves data consistency and significantly improves performance via reducing write amplification. Our evaluation reveals that LAWN boosts the performance of a state-of-the-art NVMM file system by up to 12.0 Ã—.
