Brain-inspired Hyperdimensional (HD) computing emulates cognition tasks by computing with hypervectors rather than traditional numerical values. In HD, an encoder maps inputs to high dimensional vectors (hypervectors) and combines them to generate a model for each existing class. During inference, HD performs the task of reasoning by looking for similarities of the input hypervector and each pre-stored class hypervector However, there is not a unique encoding in HD which can perfectly map inputs to hypervectors. This results in low HD classification accuracy over complex tasks such as speech recognition. In this paper we propose MHD, a multi-encoder hierarchical classifier, which enables HD to take full advantages of multiple encoders without increasing the cost of classification. MHD consists of two HD stages: a main stage and a decider stage. The main stage makes use of multiple classifiers with different encoders to classify a wide range of input data. Each classifier in the main stage can trade between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically varying the hypervectors’ dimensions. The decider stage, located before the main stage, learns the difficulty of the input data and selects an encoder within the main stage that will provide the maximum accuracy, while also maximizing the efficiency of the classification task. We test the accuracy/efficiency of the proposed MHD on speech recognition application. Our evaluation shows that MHD can provide a 6.6× improvement in energy efficiency and a 6.3× speedup, as compared to baseline single level HD.
