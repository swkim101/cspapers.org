Vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) is a core operation in many signal and data processing algorithms. Previous work showed that analog multipliers based on nonvolatile memories have superior energy efficiency as compared to digital counterparts at low-to-medium computing precision. In this paper, we propose extremely energy efficient analog mode VMM circuit with digital input/output interface and configurable precision. Similar to some previous work, the computation is performed by gate-coupled circuit utilizing embedded floating gate (FG) memories. The main novelty of our approach is an ultra-low power sensing circuitry, which is designed based on translinear Gilbert cell in topological combination with a floating resistor and a low-gain amplifier. Additionally, the digital-to-analog input conversion is merged with VMM, while current-mode algorithmic analog-to-digital circuit is employed at the circuit backend. Such implementations of conversion and sensing allow for circuit operation entirely in a current domain, resulting in high performance and energy efficiency. For example, post-layout simulation results for 400 Ã— 400 5-bit VMM circuit designed in 55 nm process with embedded NOR flash memory, show up to 400 MHz operation, 1.68 POps/J energy efficiency, and 39.45 TOps/mm2 computing throughput. Moreover, the circuit is robust against process-voltage-temperature variations, in part due to inclusion of additional FG cells that are utilized for offset compensation.1
