In digital circuit designs, sequential components such as flip-flops are used to synchronize signal propagations. Logic computations are aligned at and thus isolated by flip-flop stages. Although this fully synchronous style can reduce design efforts significantly, it may affect circuit performance negatively, because sequential components can only introduce delays into signal propagations instead of accelerating them. In this paper, we propose a new timing model, VirtualSync, in which signals, specially those along critical paths, are allowed to propagate through several sequential stages without flip-flops. Timing constraints are still satisfied at the boundary of the optimized circuit to maintain a consistent interface with existing designs. By removing clock-to-q delays and setup time requirements of flip-flops on critical paths, the performance of a circuit can be pushed even beyond the limit of traditional sequential designs. Experimental results demonstrate that circuit performance can be improved by up to 11.5% (average 3.1%) compared with that after thorough sizing and retiming, while the increase of area is still negligible.
