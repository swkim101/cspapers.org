Parallel applications are essential for efficiently using the computational power of a Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC). Unfortunately, these applications do not scale effortlessly with the number of cores because of synchronization operations that take away valuable computational time and restrict the parallelization gains. Moreover, synchronization is also a bottleneck due to sequential access to shared memory. We address this issue and introduce ”Subutai”, a hardware/software (HW/SW) architecture designed to distribute essential synchronization mechanisms over the Network-on-Chip (NoC). It includes Network Interfaces (NIs), drivers and a custom library of a NoC-based MPSoC architecture that speeds up the essential synchronization primitives of any legacy parallel application. Besides, we provide a fast simulation tool for parallel applications and a HW architecture of the NI. Experimental results with PARSEC benchmark show an average application speedup of 2.05 compared to the same architecture running legacy SW solutions for 36% overhead of HW architecture.
