Engineering Change Orders (ECO) modify a synthesized netlist after its specification has changed. ECO is divided into two major tasks: finding target signals whose functions should be updated and synthesizing the patch that produces the desired change. This paper proposes an efficient SAT-based solution for the second task: resource-aware computation of multi-output patch functions. The solution is based on several new algorithms and outperforms the top three winners of the 2017 ICCAD CAD Contest (Problem A).
