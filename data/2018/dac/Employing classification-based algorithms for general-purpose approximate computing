Approximate computing has recently reemerged as a design solution for additional performance and energy improvements at the cost of output quality. In this paper, we propose using a tree-based classification algorithm as an approximation tool for general-purpose applications. We show that, without any hardware support, completely implemented in software, our approach can improve performance by up to 4x (1.95x on average) and reduce EDP by up to 19x (4.04 on average) when compared to precise executions. Besides that, in some cases, our software-based mechanism can even outperform traditional hardware-based Neural Network's state-of-the-art designs.
