Modern processors support instruction fetch with the instruction cache (I-cache) and branch target buffer (BTB). Due to timing and area constraints, the I-cache and BTB must efficiently make use of their limited capacities. Blocks in the I-cache or entries in the BTB that have low potential for reuse should be replaced by more useful blocks/entries. This work explores predictive replacement policies based on reuse prediction that can be applied to both the I-cache and BTB. Using a large suite of recently released industrial traces, we show that predictive replacement policies can reduce misses in the I-cache and BTB. We introduce Global History Reuse Prediction (GHRP), a replacement technique that uses the history of past instruction addresses and their reuse behaviors to predict dead blocks in the I-cache and dead entries in the BTB. This paper describes the effectiveness of GHRP as a dead block replacement and bypass optimization for both the I-cache and BTB. For a 64KB set-associative I-cache with a 64B block size, GHRP lowers the I-cache misses per 1000 instructions (MPKI) by an average of 18% over the least-recently-used (LRU) policy on a set of 662 industrial workloads, performing significantly better than Static Re-reference Interval Prediction (SRRIP) and Sampling Dead Block Prediction (SDBP). For a 4K-entry BTB, GHRP lowers MPKI by an average of 30% over LRU, 23% over SRRIP, and 29% over SDBP.
