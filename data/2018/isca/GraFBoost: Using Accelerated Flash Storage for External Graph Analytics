The primary goal of GraFBoost, as well as many of our subsequent efforts, is to reduce the cost of large-scale data processing. We focus on hardware acceleration of out-of-core algorithms, replacing costly and power-hungry DRAM with cheap and efficient solid-state storage such as NAND Flash, without loss of performance. For GraFBoost, we targeted graph analytics because it is an egregious example of sparse and irregular data accesses, challenging ourselves to overcome one of the worst applications for out-of-core performance.
