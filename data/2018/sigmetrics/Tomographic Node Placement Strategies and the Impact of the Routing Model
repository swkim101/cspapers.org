Tomographic techniques can be used for the fast detection of link failures at low cost. Our paper studies the impact of the routing model on tomographic node placement costs. We present a taxonomy of path routing models and provide optimal and near-optimal algorithms to deploy a minimal number of asymmetric and symmetric tomography nodes for basic network topologies under different routing model classes. Intriguingly, we find that in many cases routing according to a more restrictive routing model gives better results: compared to a more general routing model, computing a good placement is algorithmically more tractable and does not entail high monitoring costs, a desirable trade-off in practice.
