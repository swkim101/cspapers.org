This editorial announces a new series on diversity in the ACM Sigmetrics Performance Evaluation Review (PER). In several upcoming and future issues we will feature invited articles on diversity from authors in the performance evaluation community, but also from the larger Computing Science (CS) community. The articles will touch various aspects in CS including K-12 and post-secondary education, graduate studies, academic recruitment, industry perspectives, harassment issues, and gender, ethnicity, and racial bias.
