The QoS buffer management problem, with significant and diverse computer applications, e.g., in online cloud resource allocation problems, is a classic online admission control problem in the presence of resource constraints. In its basic setting, packets with different values, arrive in online fashion to a switching node with limited buffer size. Then, the switch needs to make an immediate decision to either admit or reject the incoming packet based on the value of the packet and its buffer availability. The objective is to maximize the cumulative profit of the admitted packets, while respecting the buffer constraint. Even though the QoS buffer management problem was proposed more than a decade ago, no optimal online solution has been proposed in the literature. This paper proposes an optimal randomized online algorithm for this problem.
