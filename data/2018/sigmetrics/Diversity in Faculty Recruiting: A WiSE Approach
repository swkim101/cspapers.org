In this article, we share approaches and practices that we have found to be successful in supporting women in STEM fields, based on our experience with the University of Southern California's (USC) Women in Science and Engineering Program (WiSE). Specifically, we focus on faculty recruitment and retention, as faculty makeup and their success affects the entire pipeline, including graduate and undergraduate students.
