This poster describes a low-cost and robust embedded platform, designed for vehicle mounted sensing of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). The prototype is specifically designed to be mounted on the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) buses. Movement of the buses adds noise to pollution data. Error in GPS measurement causes issues in detecting moving vs. stationary state of the buses, useful to filter out noisy pollution data collected in the moving state. Intermittent cellular network connectivity causes frequent disconnects with the remote server. Our prototype is designed to handle such real world deployment challenges. Pilot deployment with this platform is currently ongoing. Preliminary data analysis from the pilot deployment will be discussed as part of the poster presentation, along with demonstration of the prototype sensor platform. This hardware prototype has the potential of creating locality wise, dense air pollution data providing crucial insights into the causes of air pollution.
