For future 5G core networks, Service Based Architecture (SBA) has been proposed in 3GPP Release 15. To realize the idea of SBA, we propose Service Level Virtualization (SLV) in which each network entity is decomposed into different service blocks to provide respective services. In addition, each service block can be virtualized independently into different virtual machine. Thus, SLV can increase the flexibility of the core network.
