This paper proposes a smartphone-based indoor navigation and evacuation system, called EasyGO, to minimize moving time for mobile users through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. In normal time, EasyGO can estimate the density of indoor people in each area and determine the moving speeds to pass through different areas. Based on the determined moving speed of each area, an indoor navigation path can be planned to provide the shortest moving time for EasyGO users. In emergent time, EasyGO can accurately estimate the escaping time for each EasyGO user by considering the capacity and length of passageways, the capacity of exits, and the current distribution and parallel moving of indoor people. Based on the estimated escaping time, EasyGO can evenly distribute the evacuation load among exits and alleviate the congestion of all passageways and exits to minimize the total escaping time. An Android-based prototype with iBeacon indoor localization is implemented to verify the feasibility of our EasyGO system.
