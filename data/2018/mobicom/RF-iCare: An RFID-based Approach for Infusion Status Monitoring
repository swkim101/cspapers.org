Infusion monitoring is in great demand for the hospital. In this demo, we propose RF-iCare, an RFID-based approach for monitoring the infusion status, including the liquid level and the drop speed. With a tag array attached on the infusion bottle, we design an RSSI-based signal match model to estimate the liquid level. With a tag attached on the Murphy's dropper, we leverage the phase variation of the tag to estimate the drop speed. We implement RF-iCare with a COTS RFID system and evaluate it in the real-world hospitals. Our experiments demonstrate that RF-iCare can accurately monitor the completion of the infusion over 91% tests, and estimate the liquid level with the mean accuracy of 0.8 cm as well as the drop speed with the error rate less than 3%.
