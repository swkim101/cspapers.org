Performance animation is an expressive method for animating characters through human performance. However, character motion is only one part of creating animated stories. The typical workflow also involves writing a script, coordinating actors, and editing recorded performances. In most cases, these steps are done in isolation with separate tools, which introduces friction and hinders iteration. We propose TakeToons, a script-driven approach that allows authors to annotate standard scripts with relevant animation events like character actions, camera positions, and scene backgrounds. We compile this script into a story model that persists throughout the production process and provides a consistent structure for organizing and assembling recorded performances and propagating script or timing edits to existing recordings. TakeToons enables writing, performing and editing to happen in an integrated and interleaved manner that streamlines production and facilitates iteration. Informal feedback from professional animators suggests that our approach can benefit many existing workflows supporting individual authors and production teams with many different contributors.
