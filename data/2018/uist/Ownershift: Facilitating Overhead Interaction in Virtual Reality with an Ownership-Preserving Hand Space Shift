We present Ownershift, an interaction technique for easing overhead manipulation in virtual reality, while preserving the illusion that the virtual hand is the user's own hand. In contrast to previous approaches, this technique does not alter the mapping of the virtual hand position for initial reaching movements towards the target. Instead, the virtual hand space is only shifted gradually if interaction with the overhead target requires an extended amount of time. While users perceive their virtual hand as operating overhead, their physical hand moves gradually to a less strained position at waist level. We evaluated the technique in a user study and show that Ownershift significantly reduces the physical strain of overhead interactions, while only slightly reducing task performance and the sense of body ownership of the virtual hand.
