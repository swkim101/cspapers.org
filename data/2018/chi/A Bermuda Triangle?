This introduction discusses recent developments in the Nordic welfare states as well as an overview of the contributions to this regional issue on Nordic welfare states. The issue focuses on topics of demography, financing, solidarity, and migration. The overview points to a potential conflict between resource availability, user expectations, and norms of professionalism. Navigating this ‘ Bermuda triangle ’ will likely require constant negotiation over the developing path of the Nordic welfare states. Specific challenges include how to maintain the historical tradition of high equality of income, economic opportunity, and access to services for men and women, native and foreign-born. Welfare states will be constantly recalibrating, to accommodate residents' demands for what they are willing to accept in terms of benefits and what they are willing to pay in terms of social contributions.
