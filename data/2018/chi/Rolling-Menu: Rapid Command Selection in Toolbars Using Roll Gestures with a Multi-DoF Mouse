This paper presents Rolling-Menu, a technique for selecting toolbar items, based on the use of roll gestures with a multidimensional device, the Roly-Poly Mouse (RPM). Rolling-Menu reduces object-command transition, resulting in a better integration between command selection and direct manipulation of application objects. Selecting a toolbar item with Rolling-Menu requires rolling RPM in a predefined direction corresponding to the item. We propose a design space of Rolling-Menu that includes different roll mapping and validation modes. A first user's study, with a simple toolbar containing up to 14 items, establishes that the best version of Rolling-Menu takes, on average, up to 29% less time than the Mouse to select a toolbar item. Moreover accuracy of the selection with Rolling-Menu is above 90%. Both the validation mode and the mapping between roll direction and toolbar items influence the performance of Rolling-Menus. A second study compares the three best versions of Rolling-Menu with the Mouse to select an item in two types of multidimensional toolbars: a toolbar containing dropdown lists, and a grid toolbar. Results confirm the advantage of Rolling-Menu over a Mouse.
