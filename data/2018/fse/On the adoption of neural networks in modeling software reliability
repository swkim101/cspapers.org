This work models the reliability of software systems using recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units and truncated backpropagation algorithm, and encoder-decoder LSTM architecture and proposes LSTM with software reliability functions as activation functions and LSTM with input features as the output of software reliability functions. An initial evaluation on data coming from 4 industrial projects is also provided.
