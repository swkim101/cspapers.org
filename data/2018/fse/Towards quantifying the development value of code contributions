Quantifying the value of developersâ€™ code contributions to a software project requires more than simply counting lines of code or commits. We define the development value of code as a combination of its structural value (the effect of code reuse) and its non-structural value (the impact on development). We propose techniques to automatically calculate both components of development value and combine them using Learning to Rank. Our preliminary empirical study shows that our analysis yields richer results than those obtained by human assessment or simple counting methods and demonstrates the potential of our approach.
