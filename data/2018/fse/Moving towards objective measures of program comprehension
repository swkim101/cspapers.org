Traditionally, program comprehension research relies heavily on indirect measures of comprehension, where subjects report on their own comprehension levels or summarize part of an artifact so that researchers can instead deduce the level of comprehension. However, there are several potential issues that can result from using these indirect measures because they are prone to participant biases and implicitly deduce comprehension based on various factors. The proposed research presents a framework to move towards more objective measures of program comprehension through the use of brain imaging and eye tracking technology. We aim to shed light on how the human brain processes comprehension tasks, specifically what aspects of the source code cause measurable increases in the cognitive load of developers in both bug localization tasks, as well as code reviews. We discuss the proposed methodology, preliminary results, and overall contributions of the work
