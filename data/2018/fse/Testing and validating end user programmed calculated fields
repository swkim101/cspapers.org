This paper reports on an approach for systematically generating test data from production databases for end user calculated field program via a novel combination of symbolic execution and database queries. We also discuss the opportunities and challenges that this specific domain poses for symbolic execution and shows how database queries can help complement some of symbolic execution's weaknesses, namely in the treatment of loops and also of path conditions that exceed SMT solver capabilities.
