1 We present Salsify, a system for real-time Internet video 2 transmission that achieves 3.9× lower delay and 2.7 dB 3 higher visual quality on average when compared with 4 five existing systems: FaceTime, Hangouts, Skype, and 5 WebRTC with and without scalable video coding. 6 Salsify achieves these gains through a joint design of 7 the video codec and transport protocol that features a 8 tighter integration between these components. The design 9 includes three major improvements. First, Salsify’s trans10 port protocol is video-aware and accounts for the fact that 11 video encoders send data in bursts rather than “full throt12 tle.” Second, Salsify’s video codec exposes its internal 13 state to the application, allowing it to be saved and re14 stored. Salsify uses this to explore two compression levels 15 for every frame, sending the frame that best matches the 16 network conditions after compression. Third, Salsify com17 bines the video codec’s and transport protocol’s control 18 loops so that both components run in lockstep, and frames 19 are encoded when the network can accommodate them. 20 This improves responsiveness on variable network paths. 21
