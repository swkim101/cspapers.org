Girls Who Code, a national nonprofit founded in 2012 with the mission to close the gender gap in the computer science (CS) fields, has reached tens of thousands of girls through our CS enrichment programs. To date, our Summer Immersion Program (SIP) has provided nearly 5,000 rising 11th- and 12th-grade girls from across the U.S. with the opportunity to engage in a seven-week introductory CS course. In this lightning talk we will describe our recently established Research Team's efforts to understand the ways SIP is affecting girls, describe challenges and limitations of this work, and offer a glimpse at how we hope to assess the program's longer-term impact on CS persistence and longevity by leveraging our organization's growing alumni network.
