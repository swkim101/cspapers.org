The SCRIPT, the School CSforALL Resource & Implementation Planning Tool, is a new tool created by the CSforALL Consortium that will serve as a framework and platform to guide CSforALL advocates and district staff in the creation of CSforALL implementation plans that adhere to CSforALL values and reflect the unique needs and goals of any school district. The SCRIPT engages school districts in self reflection, review of examples, and goal setting for 6 areas designed from the literature supporting curriculum adoption and organizational change. These areas include: (1) Leadership, (2) Technology Infrastructure, (3) Teacher Capacity, (4) Curriculum and Materials Selection and Refinement, (5) Partners, and (6) Community. The goal of this workshop is to train any CSforALL advocate to be able to lead a school district in an implementation planning session to create a K-12 district wide computer science education plan, by following the SCRIPT. Based on an extensive needs assessment conducted by the CSforALL Consortium (publication under review), districts require professional development and resources to (1) understand the goals of the CSforALL movement and how it can benefit their students, (2) identify ways to create meaningful K-12 pathways for students, and (3) navigate available resources in order to identify appropriate partners and resources to support the implementation of CS education. The SCRIPT was created to address these needs in a replicable way that could be used at scale by any CSforALL advocate.
