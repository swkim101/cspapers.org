When creating assessments, computer science educators and researchers must balance items? cognitive complexity and authenticity against scoring efficiency. In this poster, the author reports results from an end-of-course assessment administered to over 500 high school students in an introductory block-based programming course. The poster focuses on three atypical multiple-choice items, in which students had to select all the correct responses. The items were designed to be more cognitively complex than simple multiple choice questions while remaining easy to score. Results show that this type of item was challenging for students but was predictive of their overall performance.
