The need for K-12 students to engage in Computer Science has been acknowledged in the White House call for "Computer Science for All" and supported through a variety of institutions. Implicit in many initiatives, and explicit in Google's CS4HS initiative, is the notion of a "Community of Practice" involving K-12 teachers. Communities of Practice are mutually supportive groups to assist newcomers as they find their way in a new endeavor. Teachers can support one another at multiple levels: technical, pedagogical, political, and emotional. Maintaining a Community of Practice for CS teachers, however, can be challenging. Demands on teacher time, lack of institutional buy-in, physical isolation, and lack of appropriate peer institutions are some confounding factors. A true community of practice requires maintenance: ways to identify newcomers or other participants in need, and ways to identify and share the resources that can help others. In this BoF, educators who are working to expand CS within K-12 education will discuss the challenges in the Community of Practice approach and share proven ways of addressing them.
