Peer Instruction (PI) is an active learning technique with over 25 years of research supporting its efficacy. Documented benefits in CS include lower WDF rates, higher exam scores, and improved retention in the CS major. One key difference between PI and traditional lecture is the use of "clicker questions" in class to challenge students' conceptual understanding. Students discuss and answer these questions in small groups before the instructor goes over the question with the entire class. This BoF is for both those using PI and those interested in starting. Attendees will meet other PI practitioners, discuss tips and tricks, and exchange materials. We will provide pointers to PI materials for a variety of courses, including CS1 & CS2, Machine Organization, Programming Languages, OS and more.
