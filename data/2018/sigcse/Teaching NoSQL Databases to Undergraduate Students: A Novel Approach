An increase in data tracking by organizations has created a need for systems that can handle a variety of data models at scale. NoSQL databases and Polyglot persistence - the industry's preferred solution to modern data problems is not covered in sufficient detail, if covered at all in the undergraduate curriculum. The paper reports on our experience of introducing NoSQL paradigms using a four-tiered learning model to undergraduate students over the last two years. We believe that our methodology exposes these new ideas in an approachable manner and would provide a great starting point for other programs interested in teaching modern database paradigms and distributed data modeling and processing.
