This paper presents BlueBook, a lightweight, cross-platform, computer-based, open source examination environment that overcomes traditional hurdles with computerized testing for computer science courses. As opposed to paper exam testing, BlueBook allows students to type coding problems on their laptops in an environment similar to their normal programming routine (e.g., with syntax highlighting), but purposefully does not provide them the ability to compile and/or run their code. We seamlessly transitioned from paper exams to BlueBook and found that students appreciated the ability to type their responses. Additionally, we are just beginning to harness the benefits to grading by having student answers in digital form. In the paper, we discuss the pedagogical benefits and trade-offs to using a computerized exam format, and we argue that both the students and the graders benefit from it.
