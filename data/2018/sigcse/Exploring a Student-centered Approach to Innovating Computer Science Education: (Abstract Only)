This lightning talk will present experiences from using a student-centered approach when implementing educational innovations in computer science programs. The Norwegian Center for Excellent IT education (Excited) is currently researching new ways to organize computer science education and innovative educational structures. By involving students from day one of the research and development process we hope to learn more about what educational and structural changes and innovations are most effective and why. However, we have faced some challenges in this effort. One challenge is the fact that many of the courses in need of innovation has a large student population. This can make it difficult to implement changes without substantial bureaucracy and organizational efforts, as well as the risk of damaging the students' educational progress. Another challenge is that the students do not respond well to the proposed changes. This was somewhat surprising; however, it is a problem that must be solved in order to succeed in creating better computer science education. Therefore, we have proposed using a student-centered approach to the implementation and evaluation of new initiatives. By organizing changes in smaller pilot-groups with students involved the whole time, we can hopefully reduce the bureaucracy and risk attached to changing large and important courses. Additionally, with the students involved every step of the way the resistance to change might decrease. The project has just begun, and this talk will present the initiative in more detail, experiences from the first semester and further plans.
