Peer Instruction is an active learning pedagogy that has been shown to improve student outcomes in computing, including lower failure rates, higher exam scores, and better retention in the CS major. A key classroom mechanism for Peer Instruction is the "clicker question": a formative multiple-choice question on which students vote, then discuss, then vote again. While research indicates that clicker questions lead to learning gains for students, relatively little is known about the questions themselves and how faculty employ them. Additionally, much of the work has examined clicker data collected by CS Education researchers operating in a quasi-experimental setting. In this project, we examine clicker data collected incidentally by multiple instructors using clickers as a pedagogical technique in their classroom. This work represents a first effort to systematically evaluate how instructors use clicker questions, including how many clicker questions are used in a course, how difficult the questions used are, and whether instructors add or modify questions over time.
