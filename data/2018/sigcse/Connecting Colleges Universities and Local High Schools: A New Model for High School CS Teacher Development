In this paper, we describe our experiences with a new model for in-service computer science (CS) professional development that embeds college/university faculty into local high school classrooms partnered with a high school teacher. The high schools we have worked with had not previously offered any rigorous CS courses, and the teachers had little or no CS background. Our goal is to provide the development necessary for the high school teachers to be able to independently teach an engaging and rigorous college level CS course. We have leveraged the local nature of our program to ensure an on-going partnership between the high schools and the college/university lasting beyond the structured professional development program. Here we describe our program, the teachers and schools we have worked with, our community building efforts, and our next steps. We also present outcomes and data from our initial evaluations.
