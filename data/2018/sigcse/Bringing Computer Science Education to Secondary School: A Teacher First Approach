The Progra-MEER professional development workshop is a one year program organized collaboratively by the computer science departments of three Flemish universities. It aims to improve the computer science knowledge of in service teachers in a physical computing context. Since Flemish schools are starting to implement STEM in their schools, the program links computer science to STEM and project based learning. This paper gives a description of the design and implementation of the program while providing an analysis of its strengths and weaknesses. We show that the program leads to the successful implementation of different physical computing projects. However, it needs to further support the practical project implementations while spending more attention on assessment and context definition. Additionally, the program has to invest more effort in creating a sustainable community of practice so knowledge and experiences can still be shared even after the program has finished.
