Over the last few years, efforts to reinvigorate K-12 computer science (CS) education have emerged from the inner circles of education and become a global movement. CS is now seen as a competitive advantage in the global economy and a way up the economic ladder for countries of all sizes. Nations including the UK, South Korea, New Zealand, Israel and Estonia have taken the lead in establishing CS as a core subject. Using the US-based Computer Science for All (CSforALL) initiative as a case study, Ruthe Farmer, Chief Evangelist at CSforALL and former Senior Policy Advisor for Tech Inclusion under President Obama, will share lessons learned and challenges faced in the work to bring CS to all US students such as education policy transformation, weathering changes in political leadership, and leveraging the "long tail" of the CS stakeholder community to achieve sustainable change through collective impact and local engagement. This talk will offer examples and opportunities for all SIGCSE attendees to contribute to the CSforALL movement and become nodes in the distributed national network of organizations and initiatives, both big and small, that will make CSforAll a reality.
