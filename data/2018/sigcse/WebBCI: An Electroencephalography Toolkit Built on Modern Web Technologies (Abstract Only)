In recent years, advances in electroencephalography (EEG) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have led to the development of applications that allow users to control prosthetic arms, fly drones, and play video games using only their thoughts. However, these use cases are occasionally restricted to laboratory environments. As BCI software is often designed to work with research-grade equipment, it can be inaccessible to the average consumer. This research poster describes why JavaScript-based BCIs would be more accessible to developers and students. We also discuss the current issues with JavaScript-based BCIs and introduce a new library, WebBCI, which is designed to take the initial step towards addressing these issues. Example BCI systems that can be created with WebBCI are described in this poster, along with the outputs of these systems given sample EEG data.
