It is projected that over 51% of all STEM jobs will be in CS-related fields by 2018 (Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce Report). CS4All is the initiative to "empower a generation of American students with the computer science skills they need to thrive in a digital economy" (Computer Science for All, 2016). While embracing this initiative enthusiastically, the undergraduate computer science education community faces many challenges including the curriculum and program development to meet the non-CS major's background and retain their interests in computer science skills in their own degree program. One starting implementation point in the CS4All initiative is to broaden the awareness of computer science in other disciplines. Efforts such as CS+X focus on the joint majors/degree plans between CS and other humanities disciplines (Joint Majors: CS+X). At Texas Woman's University, the Mathematics and Computer Science department developed several new Informatics degree programs that were crafted to be interprofessional and interdisciplinary with a core of traditional computer science courses. In this poster, the authors describe the holistic design and development of those programs, the obstacles and challenges during the degree program approval process, the competency based education practice, and corresponding challenges observed on the traditional undergraduate CS program in the department.
