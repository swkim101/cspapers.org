Bloom's taxonomy is a model that allows characterizing students' learning achievements. It is frequently used in computer science education (CSE), but its use is not straightforward. We present a systematic review conducted to know actual use of the taxonomy in CSE. We found that it was mostly used in programming education and to assess students' performance. A more relevant contribution is a classification of authors' difficulties. In particular, the most often reported difficulty is determining the level of the taxonomy where an assessment task can be classified. In addition, we present authors' hypotheses about possible causes of the difficulties and the solutions they adopted.
