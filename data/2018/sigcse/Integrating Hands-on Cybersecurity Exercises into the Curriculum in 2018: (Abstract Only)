We need to greatly expand the community of faculty teaching cybersecurity using hands-on exercises. The number of security-focused competitions and exercises has increased in recent years so that faculty need to choose those that can best be integrated into their courses. As a community, we can contribute to each other/s projects. We would like to bring together both new and experienced faculty to build community. Our Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/TeachingCyber/) allows us to work together outside of SIGCSE events, and we are developing a critical mass of users. In the BoF, participants can sign up for the closed group. Participants will discuss answers to specific questions on teaching security. One goal of our BoF is to provide support for new members to learn about resources and get help. These resources include exercises, webinars, and slides. We will share experiences, practices and ongoing efforts, including our own (e.g. Security Injections, the Security Knitting Kit project, and EDURange). The BoF also benefits experienced members, helping them to disseminate their work and reach other faculty with similar interests. As a community we have begun to share exercises and discuss what works and what problems students and instructors have encountered. We will discuss ways to integrate security-related exercises into existing courses. The questions we will ask are, What materials and exercises have you tried? What are your experiences? How do we expand and improve cybersecurity education?
