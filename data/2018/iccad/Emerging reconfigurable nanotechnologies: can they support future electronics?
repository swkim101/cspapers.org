Several emerging reconfigurable technologies have been explored in recent years offering device level runtime reconfigurability. These technologies offer the freedom to choose between p- and n-type functionality from a single transistor. In order to optimally utilize the feature-sets of these technologies, circuit designs and storage elements require novel design to complement the existing and future electronic requirements. An important aspect to sustain such endeavors is to supplement the existing design flow from the device level to the circuit level. This should be backed by a thorough evaluation so as to ascertain the feasibility of such explorations. Additionally, since these technologies offer runtime reconfigurability and often encapsulate more than one functions, hardware security features like polymorphic logic gates and on-chip key storage come naturally cheap with circuits based on these reconfigurable technologies. This paper presents innovative approaches devised for circuit designs harnessing the reconfigurable features of these nanotechnologies. New circuit design paradigms based on these nano devices will be discussed to brainstorm on exciting avenues for novel computing elements.
