With the advent of many-core systems, use cases of embedded systems have become more dynamic: Plenty of applications are concurrently executed, but may dynamically be exchanged and modified even after deployment. Moreover, resources may temporally or permanently become unavailable because of thermal aspects, dynamic power management, or the occurrence of faults. This poses new challenges for reaching objectives like timeliness for real-time or performance for best-effort program execution and maximizing system utilization. In this work, we first focus on dynamic management schemes for reliability/aging optimization under thermal constraints. The reliability of on-chip systems in the current and upcoming technology nodes is continuously degrading with every new generation because transistor scaling is approaching its fundamental limits. Protecting systems against degradation effects such as circuits' aging comes with considerable losses in efficiency. We demonstrate in this work why sustaining reliability while maximizing the utilization of available resources and hence avoiding efficiency loss is quite challenging – this holds even more when thermal constraints come into play. Then, we discuss techniques for run-time management of multiple applications which sustain real-time properties. Our solution relies on hybrid application mapping denoting the combination of design-time analysis with run-time application mapping. We present a method for Real-time Mapping Reconfiguration (RMR) which enables the Run-Time Manager (RM) to execute realtime applications even in the presence of dynamic thermal- and reliability-aware resource management.
