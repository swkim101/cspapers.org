Multi-cell spacing constraints arise due to aggressive scaling and manufacturing issues. For example, we can incorporate multi-cell spacing constraints due to pin accessibility problem in sub-10nm nodes. This work studies detailed placement considering multi-cell spacing constraints. A naive approach is to model each multi-cell spacing constraint as a set of 2-cell spacing constraints, but the resulting total cell displacement would be much larger than necessary. Thus, we aim to tackle this problem and propose a practical multi-cell method by first analyzing the initial layout to determine which cell pair in each multi-cell spacing constraint is the easiest to break apart. Secondly, we apply a single-row dynamic programming (SRDP)-based method one row at a time, called Intra-Row Move (IRM) to resolve a majority of violations while minimizing the total cell displacement or wirelength increase. With cell virtualization and movable region computation techniques, our IRM can be easily extended to handle mixed cell-height designs with only a slight modification of the cost computation in the SRDP method. Finally, we apply an integer linear programming-based method called Global Move (GM) to resolve the remaining violations. Experimental results indicate that our multi-cell method is much better than a 2-cell method both in solution quality and runtime.
