Advancements in machine learning led to its adoption into numerous applications ranging from computer vision to security. Despite the achieved advancements in the machine learning, the vulnerabilities in those techniques are as well exploited. Adversarial samples are the samples generated by adding crafted perturbations to the normal input samples. An overview of different techniques to generate adversarial samples, defense to make classifiers robust is presented in this work. Furthermore, the adversarial learning and its effective utilization to enhance the robustness and the required constraints are experimentally provided, such as up to 97.65% accuracy even against CW attack. Though adversarial learning's effectiveness is enhanced, still it is shown in this work that it can be further exploited for vulnerabilities.
