In this paper, we present a ferroelectric FET (FeFET) based power-efficient architecture to accelerate data-intensive applications such as deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose a cross-cutting solution combining emerging device technologies, circuit optimizations, and micro-architecture innovations. At device level, FeFET crossbar is utilized to perform vector-matrix multiplication (VMM). As a field effect device, FeFET significantly reduces the read/write energy compared with the resistive random-access memory (ReRAM). At circuit level, we propose an all-digital peripheral design, reducing the large overhead introduced by ADC and DAC in prior works. In terms of micro-architecture innovation, a dedicated hierarchical network-on-chip (H-NoC) is developed for input broadcasting and on-the-fly partial results processing, reducing the data transmission volume and latency. Speed, power, area and computing accuracy are evaluated based on detailed device characterization and system modeling. For DNN computing, our design achieves 254x and 9.7x gain in power efficiency (GOPS/W) compared to GPU and ReRAM based designs, respectively.
