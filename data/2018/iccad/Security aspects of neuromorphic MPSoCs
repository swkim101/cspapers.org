Neural networks and deep learning are promising techniques for bringing brain inspired computing into embedded platforms. They pave the way to new kinds of associative memories, classifiers, data-mining, machine learning or search engines, which can be the basis of critical and sensitive applications such as autonomous driving. Emerging non-volatile memory technologies integrated in the so called Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) architectures enable the realization of such computational paradigms. These architectures take advantage of the Network-on-Chip concept to efficiently carry out communications with dedicated distributed memories and processing elements. However, current MPSoC-based neuromorphic architectures are deployed without taking security into account. The growing complexity and the hyper-sharing of hardware resources of MPSoCs may become a threat, thus increasing the risk of malware infections and Trojans introduced at design time. Specially, MPSoC microarchitectural side-channels and fault injection attacks can be exploited to leak sensitive information and to cause malfunctions. In this work we present three contributions to that issue: i) first analysis of security issues in MPSoC-based neuromorphic architectures; ii) discussion of the threat model of the neuromorphic architectures; ii) demonstration of the correlation between SNN input and the neural computation.
