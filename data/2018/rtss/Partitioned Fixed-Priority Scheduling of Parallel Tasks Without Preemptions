The study of parallel task models executed with predictable scheduling approaches is a fundamental problem for real-time multiprocessor systems. Nevertheless, to date, limited efforts have been spent in analyzing the combination of partitioned scheduling and non-preemptive execution, which is arguably one of the most predictable schemes that can be envisaged to handle parallel tasks. This paper fills this gap by proposing an analysis for sporadic DAG tasks under partitioned fixed-priority scheduling where the computations corresponding to the nodes of the DAG are non-preemptively executed. The analysis has been achieved by means of segmented self-suspending tasks with nonpreemptable segments, for which a new fine-grained analysis is also proposed. The latter is shown to analytically dominate state-of-the-art approaches. A partitioning algorithm for DAG tasks is finally proposed. By means of experimental results, the proposed analysis has been compared against a previouslyproposed analysis for DAG tasks with non-preemptable nodes managed by global fixed-priority scheduling. The comparison revealed important improvements in terms of schedulability performance.
