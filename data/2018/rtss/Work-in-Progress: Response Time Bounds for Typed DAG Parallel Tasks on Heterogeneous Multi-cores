Heterogenerous multi-cores utilize the strength of different architectures for executing particular types of workload, and usually offer higher performance and energy efficiency. In this paper, we study the worst-case response time (WCRT) analysis of typed scheduling of parallel DAG tasks on heterogeneous multi-cores, where the workload of each vertex in the DAG is only allowed to execute on a particular type of cores. The only known WCRT bound for this problem is grossly pessimistic and suffers the non-self-sustainability problem. In this paper, we propose two new WCRT bounds. The first new bound has the same time complexity as the existing bound, but is more precise and solves its non-self-sustainability problem. The second new bound explores more detailed task graph structure information to greatly improve the precision, but is computationally more expensive. We prove that the problem of computing the second bound is strongly NP-hard if the number of types in the system is a variable, and develop an efficient algorithm which has polynomial time complexity if the number of types is a constant. Experiments with randomly generated workload show that our proposed new methods are significantly more precise than the existing bound while having good scalability.
