The US federal court system is exploring ways to improve
the accountability of electronic surveillance, an
opaque process often involving cases sealed from public
view and tech companies subject to gag orders against
informing surveilled users. One judge has proposed publicly
releasing some metadata about each case on a paper
cover sheet as a way to balance the competing goals of
(1) secrecy, so the target of an investigation does not discover
and sabotage it, and (2) accountability, to assure
the public that surveillance powers are not misused or
abused.
Inspired by the courtsâ€™ accountability challenge, we
illustrate how accountability and secrecy are simultaneously
achievable when modern cryptography is brought
to bear. Our system improves configurability while preserving
secrecy, offering new tradeoffs potentially more
palatable to the risk-averse court system. Judges, law
enforcement, and companies publish commitments to
surveillance actions, argue in zero-knowledge that their
behavior is consistent, and compute aggregate surveillance
statistics by multi-party computation (MPC).
We demonstrate that these primitives perform efficiently
at the scale of the federal judiciary. To do so,
we implement a hierarchical form of MPC that mirrors
the hierarchy of the court system. We also develop
statements in succinct zero-knowledge (SNARKs)
whose specificity can be tuned to calibrate the amount
of information released. All told, our proposal not only
offers the court system a flexible range of options for enhancing
accountability in the face of necessary secrecy,
but also yields a general framework for accountability in
a broader class of secret information processes.
