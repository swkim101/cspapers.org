Programs are bloated. Our study shows that only 5% of libc is used on average across the Ubuntu Desktop envi- ronment (2016 programs); the heaviest user, vlc media player, only needed 18%.
In this paper: (1) We present a debloating framework built on a compiler toolchain that can successfully de- bloat programs (shared/static libraries and executables). Our solution can successfully compile and load most li- braries on Ubuntu Desktop 16.04. (2) We demonstrate the elimination of over 79% of code from coreutils and 86% of code from SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark pro-
grams without affecting functionality. We show that even complex programs such as Firefox and curl can be
debloated without a need to recompile. (3) We demon- strate the security impact of debloating by eliminating over 71% of reusable code gadgets from the coreutils suite, and show that unused code that contains real-world vulnerabilities can also be successfully eliminated with- out adverse effects on the program. (4) We incur a low load time overhead.
