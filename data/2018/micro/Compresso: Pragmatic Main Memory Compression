Today, larger memory capacity and higher memory bandwidth are required for better performance and energy efficiency for many important client and datacenter applications. Hardware memory compression provides a promising direction to achieve this without increasing system cost. Unfortunately, current memory compression solutions face two significant challenges. First, keeping memory compressed requires additional memory accesses, sometimes on the critical path, which can cause performance overheads. Second, they require changing the operating system to take advantage of the increased capacity, and to handle incompressible data, which delays deployment. We propose Compresso, a hardware memory compression architecture that minimizes memory overheads due to compression, with no changes to the OS. We identify new data-movement trade-offs and propose optimizations that reduce additional memory movement to improve system efficiency. We propose a holistic evaluation for compressed systems. Our results show that Compresso achieves a 1.85x compression for main memory on average, with a 24% speedup over a competitive hardware compressed system for single-core systems and 27% for multi-core systems. As compared to competitive compressed systems, Compresso not only reduces performance overhead of compression, but also increases performance gain from higher memory capacity.
