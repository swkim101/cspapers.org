With Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) beginning to enter the mainstream computing market, it is time to consider how to secure NVM-equipped computing systems. Recent Meltdown and Spectre attacks are evidence that security must be intrinsic to computing systems and not added as an afterthought. Processor vendors are taking the first steps and are beginning to build security primitives into commodity processors. One security primitive that is associated with the use of emerging NVMs is memory encryption. Memory encryption, while necessary, is very challenging when used with NVMs because it exacerbates the write endurance problem. Secure architectures use cryptographic metadata that must be persisted and restored to allow secure recovery of data in the event of power-loss. Specifically, encryption counters must be persistent to enable secure and functional recovery of an interrupted system. However, the cost of ensuring and maintaining persistence for these counters can be significant. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to maintain encryption counters without the need for frequent updates. Our new memory controller design, Osiris, repurposes memory Error-Correction Codes (ECCs) to enable fast restoration and recovery of encryption counters. To evaluate our design, we use Gem5 to run eight memory-intensive workloads selected from SPEC2006 and U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) proxy applications. Compared to a write-through counter-cache scheme, on average, Osiris can reduce 48.7% of the memory writes (increase lifetime by 1.95x), and reduce the performance overhead from 51.5% (for write-through) to only 5.8%. Furthermore, without the need for backup battery or extra power-supply hold-up time, Osiris performs better than a battery-backed write-back (5.8% vs. 6.6% overhead) and has less write-traffic (2.6% vs. 5.9% overhead).
