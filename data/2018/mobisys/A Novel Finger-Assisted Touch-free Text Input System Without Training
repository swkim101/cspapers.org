Recently, tiny smart devices have become increasingly popular in our lives because of their neat features and stylish appearance. However, their small form factors, especially screens, make it inconvenient for users to enter texts with conventional methods such as soft keyboards, which need a fairly large screen. To address this problem, we propose a novel texts-input system, called EchoType, with which users can enter texts with a finger writing in the air. EchoType makes use of acoustic sensors (i.e., microphone and speaker) to sense finger gestures and infer texts based on mapping relation between gestures and basic letters. We take a step to enable users to input texts with acoustic signals. Compared with existing approaches, EchoType enjoys merits of low hardware requirements and high scalability to different mobile devices.
