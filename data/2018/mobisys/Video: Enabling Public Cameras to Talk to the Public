This video presents a real-time end-to-end system which enables cameras to send personalized messages to people in a public area without knowing any addresses of their mobile phones. For facilitating this communication, we solve the problem of digitally associating people in the camera view with their smartphones without prior knowledge of the phones' IP/MAC addresses. The system doesn't need any dedicated devices and doesn't request people to wear digital tags. It utilizes users' motion patterns and leverages the diversity in motion features as the address for communication. The cameras broadcast a message to all the phones in the camera view using the target's motion features as the destination. Then a user's phone can locally compare the "motion address" of the packet against its own sensor data and will accept the packet if it's a "good" match. To protect the privacy of users' sensor data, we keep the users' personal sensing data on their phones instead of asking them to upload the data to server. Moreover, to prevent users' walking behavior from being revealed to public, we transform the raw motion features via principal component analysis (PCA) while maintaining their distinguishing power. On the whole, our system achieves 98%, 95%, 90%, 90%, 87% matching correctness for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 users respectively.
