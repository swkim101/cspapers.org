Introduction: To date, the most widely deployed human-computer interface is based on keyboards and mouses. However, they are not applicable for users with disabilities. Existing solutions, such as brain-computer interface [1] and eye movements [6], lack of either stability and privacy-preservation [3, 4]. Respiration is a universal, inconspicuous and controllable physiology feature that an individual can control the sequence, the strength, the length of inhalation and exhalation without noticeable movement. To this end, we propose a proof-of-concept respiration-based humancomputer interface with its application to user password login. By utilizing a portable and cost-effective radio-frequency radar, the user can create her own password through respiratory pattern in a secure and inclusive manner.
