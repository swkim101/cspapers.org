Effect handlers are a program structuring paradigm with rising popularity in the functional programming language community and can express many advanced control flow abstractions. We present the first implementation of effect handlers for Java - an imperative, object oriented programming language. Our framework consists of three core components: A type selective CPS transformation via JVM bytecode transformation, an implementation of delimited continuations on top of the bytecode transformation and finally a library for effect handlers in terms of delimited continuations.
