The literature on gradual typing presents three fundamentally different ways of thinking about the integrity of programs that combine statically typed and dynamically typed code. This paper presents a uniform semantic framework that explains all three approaches, illustrates how each approach affects a developer's work, and adds a systematic performance comparison for a single implementation platform.
