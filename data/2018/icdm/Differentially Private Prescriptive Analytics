Privacy preservation is important. Prescriptive analytics is a method to extract corrective actions to avoid undesirable outcomes. We propose a privacy preserving prescriptive analytics algorithm to protect the data used during the construction of the prescriptive analytics algorithm. We use differential privacy mechanism to achieve strong privacy guarantee. Differential privacy mechanism requires computation of sensitivity: maximum change in the output between two training datasets, which is differed by only one instance. The main challenge we addressed is the computation of sensitivity of the prescription vector. In absence of any analytical form, we construct a nested global optimization problem to compute the sensitivity. We solve the optimization problem using constrained Bayesian optimization, as the nested structure makes the objective function expensive. We demonstrate our algorithm on two real world datasets and observe that the prescription vectors remains useful even after making them private.
