Over the last couple of years, Bitcoin cryptocurrency and the Blockchain technology that forms the basis of Bitcoin have witnessed an unprecedented attention. Designed to facilitate a secure distributed platform without central regulation, Blockchain is heralded as a novel paradigm that will be as powerful as Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning. The Blockchain technology garners an ever increasing interest of researchers in various domains that benefit from scalable cooperation among trust-less parties. As Blockchain data analytics further proliferates, a need to glean successful approaches and to disseminate them among a diverse body of data scientists became a critical task. As an inter-disciplinary team of researchers, our aim is to fill this vital role. In this tutorial, we offer a holistic view on Blockchain Data Analytics. Starting with the core components of Blockchain, we will discuss the state of art in Blockchain data analytics for privacy, security, finance, and management domains. We will share tutorial notes and further reading pointers on the tutorial website blockchaintutorial.github.io.
