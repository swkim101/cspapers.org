Tree inventories are important datasets for many societal applications (e.g., urban planning). However, tree inventories still remain unavailable in most urban areas. We aim to automate tree identification at individual levels in urban areas at a large scale using remote sensing datasets. The problem is challenging due to the complexity of the landscape in urban scenarios and the lack of ground truth data. In related work, tree identification algorithms have mainly focused on controlled forest regions where the landscape is mostly homogeneous with trees, making the methods difficult to generalize to urban environments. We propose a TIMBER framework to find individual trees in complex urban environments and a Core Object REduction (CORE) algorithm to improve the computational efficiency of TIMBER. Experiments show that TIMBER can efficiently detect urban trees with high accuracy.
