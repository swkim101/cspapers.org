In this work, we study the problem of concept mining, which serves as the first step in transforming unstructured text into structured information, and supports downstream analytical tasks such as information extraction, organization, recommendation and search. Previous work mainly relies on statistical signals, existing knowledge bases, or predefined linguistic patterns. In this work, we propose a novel approach that mines concepts based on their occurrence contexts, by learning embedding vector representations that summarize the context information for each possible candidates, and use these embeddings to evaluate the concept's global quality and their fitness to each local context. Experiments over several real-world corpora demonstrate the superior performance of our method. A publicly available implementation is provided at https://github.com/kleeeeea/ECON.
