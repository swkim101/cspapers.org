In action prediction (early action recognition), the goal is to predict the class label of an ongoing action using its observed part so far. In this paper, we focus on online action prediction in streaming 3D skeleton sequences. A dilated convolutional network is introduced to model the motion dynamics in temporal dimension via a sliding window over the time axis. As there are significant temporal scale variations of the observed part of the ongoing action at different progress levels, we propose a novel window scale selection scheme to make our network focus on the performed part of the ongoing action and try to suppress the noise from the previous actions at each time step. Furthermore, an activation sharing scheme is proposed to deal with the overlapping computations among the adjacent steps, which allows our model to run more efficiently. The extensive experiments on two challenging datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed action prediction framework.
