In this paper, we propose a GraphBit method to learn deep binary descriptors in a directed acyclic graph unsupervisedly, representing bitwise interactions as edges between the nodes of bits. Conventional binary representation learning methods enforce each element to be binarized into zero or one. However, there are elements lying in the boundary which suffer from doubtful binarization as "ambiguous bits". Ambiguous bits fail to collect effective information for confident binarization, which are unreliable and sensitive to noise. We argue that there are implicit inner relationships between bits in binary descriptors, where the related bits can provide extra instruction as prior knowledge for ambiguity elimination. Specifically, we design a deep reinforcement learning model to learn the structure of the graph for bitwise interaction mining, reducing the uncertainty of binary codes by maximizing the mutual information with inputs and related bits, so that the ambiguous bits receive additional instruction from the graph for confident binarization. Due to the reliability of the proposed binary codes with bitwise interaction, we obtain an average improvement of 9.64%, 8.84% and 3.22% on the CIFAR-10, Brown and HPatches datasets respectively compared with the state-of-the-art unsupervised binary descriptors.
