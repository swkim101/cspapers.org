We present an algorithm for modifying small non-local variations between repeating structures and patterns in multiple images of the same scene. The modification is consistent across views, even-though the images could have been photographed from different view points and under different lighting conditions. We show that when modifying each image independently the correspondence between them breaks and the geometric structure of the scene gets distorted. Our approach modifies the views while maintaining correspondence, hence, we succeed in modifying appearance and structure variations consistently. We demonstrate our methods on a number of challenging examples, photographed in different lighting, scales and view points.
