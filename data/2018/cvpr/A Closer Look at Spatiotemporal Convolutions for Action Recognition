In this paper we discuss several forms of spatiotemporal convolutions for video analysis and study their effects on action recognition. Our motivation stems from the observation that 2D CNNs applied to individual frames of the video have remained solid performers in action recognition. In this work we empirically demonstrate the accuracy advantages of 3D CNNs over 2D CNNs within the framework of residual learning. Furthermore, we show that factorizing the 3D convolutional filters into separate spatial and temporal components yields significantly gains in accuracy. Our empirical study leads to the design of a new spatiotemporal convolutional block "R(2+1)D" which produces CNNs that achieve results comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art on Sports-1M, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51.
