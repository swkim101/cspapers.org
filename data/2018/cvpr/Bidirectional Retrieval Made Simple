This paper provides a very simple yet effective character-level architecture for learning bidirectional retrieval models. Aligning multimodal content is particularly challenging considering the difficulty in finding semantic correspondence between images and descriptions. We introduce an efficient character-level inception module, designed to learn textual semantic embeddings by convolving raw characters in distinct granularity levels. Our approach is capable of explicitly encoding hierarchical information from distinct base-level representations (e.g., characters, words, and sentences) into a shared multimodal space, where it maps the semantic correspondence between images and descriptions via a contrastive pairwise loss function that minimizes order-violations. Models generated by our approach are far more robust to input noise than state-of-the-art strategies based on word-embeddings. Despite being conceptually much simpler and requiring fewer parameters, our models outperform the state-of-the-art approaches by 4.8% in the task of description retrieval and 2.7% (absolute R@1 values) in the task of image retrieval in the popular MS COCO retrieval dataset. We also show that our models present solid performance for text classification, specially in multilingual and noisy domains.
