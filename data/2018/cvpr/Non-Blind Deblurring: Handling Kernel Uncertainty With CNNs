Blind motion deblurring methods are primarily responsible for recovering an accurate estimate of the blur kernel. Non-blind deblurring (NBD) methods, on the other hand, attempt to faithfully restore the original image, given the blur estimate. However, NBD is quite susceptible to errors in blur kernel. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network-based approach to handle kernel uncertainty in non-blind motion deblurring. We provide multiple latent image estimates corresponding to different prior strengths obtained from a given blurry observation in order to exploit the complementarity of these inputs for improved learning. To generalize the performance to tackle arbitrary kernel noise, we train our network with a large number of real and synthetic noisy blur kernels. Our network mitigates the effects of kernel noise so as to yield detail-preserving and artifact-free restoration. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method delivers state-of-the-art results. To further underscore the benefits that can be achieved from our network, we propose two adaptations of our method to improve kernel estimates, and image deblurring quality, respectively.
