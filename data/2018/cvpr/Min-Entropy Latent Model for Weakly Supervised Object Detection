Weakly supervised object detection is a challenging task when provided with image category supervision but required to learn, at the same time, object locations and object detectors. The inconsistency between the weak supervision and learning objectives introduces randomness to object locations and ambiguity to detectors. In this paper, a min-entropy latent model (MELM) is proposed for weakly supervised object detection. Min-entropy is used as a metric to measure the randomness of object localization during learning, as well as serving as a model to learn object locations. It aims to principally reduce the variance of positive instances and alleviate the ambiguity of detectors. MELM is deployed as two sub-models, which respectively discovers and localizes objects by minimizing the global and local entropy. MELM is unified with feature learning and optimized with a recurrent learning algorithm, which progressively transfers the weak supervision to object locations. Experiments demonstrate that MELM significantly improves the performance of weakly supervised detection, weakly supervised localization, and image classification, against the state-of-the-art approaches.
