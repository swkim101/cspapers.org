We propose a novel end-to-end trainable, deep, encoder-decoder architecture for single-pass semantic segmentation. Our approach is based on a cascaded architecture with feature-level long-range skip connections. The encoder incorporates the structure of ResNeXt's residual building blocks and adopts the strategy of repeating a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology. The decoder features a novel architecture, consisting of blocks, that (i) capture context information, (ii) generate semantic features, and (iii) enable fusion between different output resolutions. Crucially, we introduce dense decoder shortcut connections to allow decoder blocks to use semantic feature maps from all previous decoder levels, i.e. from all higher-level feature maps. The dense decoder connections allow for effective information propagation from one decoder block to another, as well as for multi-level feature fusion that significantly improves the accuracy. Importantly, these connections allow our method to obtain state-of-the-art performance on several challenging datasets, without the need of time-consuming multi-scale averaging of previous works.
