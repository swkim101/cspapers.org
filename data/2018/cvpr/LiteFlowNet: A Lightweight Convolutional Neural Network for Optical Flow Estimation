Figures S1 to S3 show some examples of flow fields of different best performing networks on Sintel clean and final passes [2], KITTI12 [4], KITTI15 [7], and Middlebury [1] benchmarks. A video clip (https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=pfQ0zFwv-hM) is available on our project page (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu. hk/projects/LiteFlowNet/) to showcase the performance of LiteFlowNet [5] and the effectiveness of the proposed components in our network. Flow fields of the compared methods, FlowNet1 [3], FlowNet22 [6] and SPyNet3 [8], are generated using the trained models and the code packages provided by the corresponding authors.
