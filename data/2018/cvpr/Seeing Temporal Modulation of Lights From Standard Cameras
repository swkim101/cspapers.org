In this paper, we propose a novel method for measuring the temporal modulation of lights by using off-the-shelf cameras. In particular, we show that the invisible flicker patterns of various lights such as fluorescent lights can be measured by a simple combination of an off-the-shelf camera and any moving object with specular reflection. Unlike the existing methods, we do not need high speed cameras nor specially designed coded exposure cameras. Based on the extracted flicker patterns of environment lights, we also propose an efficient method for deblurring motion blurs in images. The proposed method enables us to deblur images with better frequency characteristics, which are induced by the flicker patterns of environment lights. The real image experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method.
