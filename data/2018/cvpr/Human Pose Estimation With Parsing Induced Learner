Human pose estimation still faces various difficulties in challenging scenarios. Human parsing, as a closely related task, can provide valuable cues for better pose estimation, which however has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel Parsing Induced Learner to exploit parsing information to effectively assist pose estimation by learning to fast adapt the base pose estimation model. The proposed Parsing Induced Learner is composed of a parsing encoder and a pose model parameter adapter, which together learn to predict dynamic parameters of the pose model to extract complementary useful features for more accurate pose estimation. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks LIP and extended PASCAL-Person-Part show that the proposed Parsing Induced Learner can improve performance of both single- and multi-person pose estimation to new state-of-the-art. Cross-dataset experiments also show that the proposed Parsing Induced Learner from LIP dataset can accelerate learning of a human pose estimation model on MPII benchmark in addition to achieving outperforming performance.
