In this paper, we aim to solve the pose estimation problem of calibrated pinhole and generalized cameras w.r.t. a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) model by leveraging both 2D-3D correspondences as well as 2D-2D correspondences. Traditional approaches either focus on the use of 2D-3D matches, known as structure-based pose estimation or solely on 2D-2D matches (structure-less pose estimation). Absolute pose approaches are limited in their performance by the quality of the 3D point triangulations as well as the completeness of the 3D model. Relative pose approaches, on the other hand, while being more accurate, also tend to be far more computationally costly and often return dozens of possible solutions. This work aims to bridge the gap between these two paradigms. We propose a new RANSAC-based approach that automatically chooses the best type of solver to use at each iteration in a data-driven way. The solvers chosen by our RANSAC can range from pure structure-based or structure-less solvers, to any possible combination of hybrid solvers (i.e. using both types of matches) in between. A number of these new hybrid minimal solvers are also presented in this paper. Both synthetic and real data experiments show our approach to be as accurate as structure-less approaches, while staying close to the efficiency of structure-based methods.
