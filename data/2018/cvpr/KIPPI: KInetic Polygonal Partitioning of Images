Recent works showed that floating polygons can be an interesting alternative to traditional superpixels, especially for analyzing scenes with strong geometric signatures, as man-made environments. Existing algorithms produce homogeneously-sized polygons that fail to capture thin geometric structures and over-partition large uniform areas. We propose a kinetic approach that brings more flexibility on polygon shape and size. The key idea consists in progressively extending pre-detected line-segments until they meet each other. Our experiments demonstrate that output partitions both contain less polygons and better capture geometric structures than those delivered by existing methods. We also show the applicative potential of the method when used as preprocessing in object contouring.
