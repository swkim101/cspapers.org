In this work, we propose a motion-guided cascaded refinement network for video object segmentation. By assuming the foreground objects show different motion patterns from the background, for each video frame we apply an active contour model on optical flow to coarsely segment the foreground. The proposed Cascaded Refinement Network (CRN) then takes as guidance the coarse segmentation to generate an accurate segmentation in full resolution. In this way, the motion information and the deep CNNs can complement each other well to accurately segment the foreground objects from video frames. To deal with multi-instance cases, we extend our method with a spatial-temporal instance embedding model that further segments the foreground regions into instances and propagates instance labels. We further introduce a single-channel residual attention module in CRN to incorporate the coarse segmentation map as attention, which makes the network effective and efficient in both training and testing. We perform experiments on popular benchmarks and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with high time efficiency.
