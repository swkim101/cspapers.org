We developed a robotic lower-limb exoskeleton for those who have weakened muscle due to aging and experience difficulty in walking or getting up without help. The exoskeleton covering both limbs from the feet to the waist has 6 electric actuators in the hip abduction/adduction, hip extension/flexion and knee extension/flexion joints. For users with volitional motion, delivering assistance power according to their intention is a challenging task. We propose an adaptive oscillator-based controller to assist users walk in the lower-limb exoskeleton. To adapt to changes in walking speed and environment, motion command from the controller is modulated by estimate walking speed and walking environment recognized as one of the following categories: level ground, stairs up/down and slope up/down. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed environment recognition method and the impact of assistance on the metabolic cost of walking on level and inclined treadmills.
