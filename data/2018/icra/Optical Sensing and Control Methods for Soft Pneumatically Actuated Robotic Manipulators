A low-cost optical sensing method for improved measurement and control of soft pneumatic manipulator motion is presented. The core of a soft continuum robot is embedded with several optically-diffuse elastomer sensors which attenuate light depending on their strain mode and degree. The optical sensors measure local strains at the robot's axial center, and these strain data are combined with measured actuator chamber pressures to determine the pose of the robot under various gravitational and tip loading conditions. Regression analyses using neural networks (NNs) demonstrate that when the soft continuum robot's base orientation is fixed, the position of its end-effector can be estimated with 3.42 times more accuracy (71 % smaller root mean squared error) when using both optical sensor and pressure data (~2.44mm) than when using only pressure data (~8.3mm). When the robot's base orientation was varied, the combined optical sensor and pressure data provide position estimates which are as much as 37.8 times more accurate (~2.76mm) than pressure data alone (~104mm).
