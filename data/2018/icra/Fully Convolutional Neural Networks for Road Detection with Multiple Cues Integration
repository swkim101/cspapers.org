Road detection from images is a key task in autonomous driving. The recent advent of deep learning (and in particular, CNN or convolutional neural networks) has greatly improved the performance of road detection algorithms. In this paper, we show how to fuse multiple different cues under the same convolutional network framework. Specifically, we adopt a pre-trained Resnet-lOl to extract feature maps from RGB images; we then connect it with three extra deconvolution layers. These deconvolution layers is trained conditioning on appropriate image cues, and in our case they are a height image (i.e. elevation map obtained by e.g. Lidar scanner), image gradient, and position map. We also design two skip layers to speed up the convergence. Experiments on KITTI benchmark show competitive performance of our new networks.
