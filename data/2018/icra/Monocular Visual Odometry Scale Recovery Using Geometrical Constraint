Scale recovery is one of the essential problems for monocular visual odometry. The camera height is usually used as an absolute reference to recover the scale. In this case, the precision of scale recovery depends on the accuracy of the road region detection and road geometrical model calculation. In previous works, road detection and road geometrical model calculation are solved sequentially: the road geometrical model calculation is based on the road detection and the road region detection is based on the color information. However, the color information of a road is not stable enough. In the proposed method, the estimated road geometrical model is taken into consideration to detect the road region as a feedback. Therefore, the road region detection and road geometrical model estimation can benefit each other. Delaunay Triangulation method is used to segment an input image to many triangles with the matched feature points as vertices. Every triangle region is classified as a road region or not by comparing their geometrical model with that of the road and the road geometrical model is updated online. We evaluate our visual odometry scale recovery method on the KITTI dataset and the results show that our method is achieving the best performance among all existing monocular visual odometry scale recovery methods without additional sensors.
