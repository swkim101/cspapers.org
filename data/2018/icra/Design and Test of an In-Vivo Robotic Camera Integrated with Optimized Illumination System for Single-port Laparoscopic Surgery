This paper proposes a novel in-vivo robotic laparo-scopic camera design with an optimized illumination system, which is a crucial component for achieving high imaging quality. The robotic camera design with three extendable wings can reserve sufficient on-board space to harbor the optimized illumination system without affecting the compactness of the camera. We contribute a freeform optical lens design method and develop three miniature optical lenses for the LEDs to achieve greater than 95% illumination uniformity, greater than 14, 000 lx illuminance on a target plane with a distance of 100 mm, and greater than 89% optical efficiency. The prototype is implemented and experimentally tested, which demonstrates great performance of the in-vivo robotic laparoscopic camera and the significance of the optimized illumination system.
