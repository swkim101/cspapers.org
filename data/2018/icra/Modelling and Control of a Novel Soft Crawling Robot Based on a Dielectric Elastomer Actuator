Soft robots have recently evoked extensive attention due to their abilities to work effectively in unstructured environments. As an actuation technology of soft robots, dielectric elastomers exhibit many intriguing attributes such as large strain and high energy density. This work presents a novel dielectric elastomer based soft crawling robot inspired by inchworms. To fill the need of control of the soft robot, a model describing the interaction between the dielectric elastomer actuator and the environment is proposed, which takes inertia, viscoelasticity and friction into consideration. The model can well describe the robot's dynamic performances and the modelling approach used here can be extended to other dielectric elastomer actuators with complicated geometries for control purposes. The obtained model allows us to design a feedforward plus feedback control scheme for the robot to achieve desired motion. Simulation shows fast response and good tracking performances which are further confirmed by the experiments.
