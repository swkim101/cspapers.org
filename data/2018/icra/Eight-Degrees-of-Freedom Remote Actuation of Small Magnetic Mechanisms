Magnetically-driven micrometer to millimeter-scale robotic devices have recently shown great capabilities for remote applications in medical procedures, in microfluidic tools and in microfactories. Significant effort recently has been on the creation of mobile or stationary devices with multiple independently-controllable degrees of freedom (DOF) for multiagent or complex mechanism motions. In most applications of magnetic microrobots, however, the relatively large distance from the field generation source and the microscale devices results in controlling magnetic field signals which are applied homogeneously over all agents. While some progress has been made in this area allowing up to six independent DOF to be individually commanded, there has been no rigorous effort in determining the maximum achievable number of DOF for systems with homogeneous magnetic field input. In this work, we show that this maximum is eight and we introduce the theoretical basis for this conclusion, relying on the number of independent usable components in a magnetic field at a point. In order to verify the claim experimentally, we develop a simple demonstration mechanism with 8 DOF designed specifically to show independent actuation. Using this mechanism with $500 \mu \mathrm{m}$ magnetic elements, we demonstrate eight independent motions of 0.6 mm with 8.6 % coupling using an eight coil system. These results will enable the creation of richer outputs in future microrobotic devices.
