Highly Autonomous Driving (HAD) systems rely on deep neural networks for the visual perception of the driving environment. Such networks are train on large manually annotated databases. In this work, a semi-parametric approach to one-shot learning is proposed, with the aim of bypassing the manual annotation step required for training perceptions systems used in autonomous driving. The proposed generative framework, coined Generative One-Shot Learning (GOL), takes as input single one-shot objects, or generic patterns, and a small set of so-called regularization samples used to drive the generative process. New synthetic data is generated as Pareto optimal solutions from one-shot objects using a set of generalization functions built into a generalization generator. GOL has been evaluated on environment perception challenges encountered in autonomous vision.
