This paper presents design and force-tracking impedance control of 2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) wall-cleaning manipulator equipped with disturbance observer (DOB) and sliding mode control (SMC). In order to keep in contact with various shapes of walls, the proposed manipulator is designed to ensure 2-DOF motions of translation and tilting by using ball screws. The position-based force tracking impedance control (FTIC) is first adopted for the proposed manipulator not only to interact with walls in a desired dynamic behavior but also to maintain a constant contact force. Also, to improve the force tracking capability of proposed manipulator against different walls and brushes for manipulator, the FTIC is combined with the disturbance observer (DOB) and the sliding mode control (SMC). Extensive experiments prove that although different brushes used for manipulator rotate against varying shapes of walls, the proposed manipulator can keep a constant contact force within a bound of Â± 4.5 N by virtue of the proposed FTIC equipped with the DOB and the SMC.
