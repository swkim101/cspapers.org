Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) demonstrated advantages on control precision, system robustness and computational efficiency, and have been widely applied to redundant manipulator control optimization. Existing RNN control schemes locally optimize trajectories and are efficient and reliable on obstacle avoidance. However, for motion planning, they suffer from local minimum and do not have planning completeness. This work explained the cause of the planning incompleteness and addressed the problem with a novel RNN control scheme. The paper presented the proposed method in detail and analyzed the global stability and the planning completeness in theory. The proposed method was compared with other three control schemes on the precision, the robustness and the planning completeness in software simulation and the results shows the proposed method has improved precision and robustness, and planning completeness.
