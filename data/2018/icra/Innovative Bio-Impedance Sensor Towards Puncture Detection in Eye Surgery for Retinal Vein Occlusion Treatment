At the moment, surgeons struggle curing a widespread eye disease known as retinal vein occlusion where clots obstruct the retinal vessels. Latter vascular disorder involves black spots in people's eyesight and lead eventually to blindness. A recent promising treatment consists in flushing a thrombolytic agent inside the clotted retinal vessels. The surgery implies puncturing vessels ranging from 50 to 400 microns diameter on the backside of the eye, namely the retina. Latest research succeeded in tackling several challenges around this operation: the surgeon's hand tremor and the high precision required amongst other requirements. Despite several breakthroughs, the surgeon only relies on a microscope to perform the surgery through the patient eye's lens, giving poor depth perception to properly puncture the retinal vessels. This way, the surgeon is most likely to pierce through the vessel and inject the thrombolytic drug under the retina, which would endanger the person's eyesight. In this paper, we investigate the use of a novel bio-impedance sensor developed for eye surgery. Together with this new sensor, a detection algorithm has been developed to detect the puncture and double puncture events to give a feedback to the operator of the system. As far as we are aware of, such technology doesn't exist yet in eye surgery to tackle the depth perception question. This paper aims at demonstrating the benefits of this technology.
