Many modern roboticists take inspiration from biology to create novel robotic structures, including those that are modeled after the octopus. This paper advances this trend by creating soft robots modeling the complex motion patterns of octopus tentacles employing a bio-mimetic approach. The proposed octopus robot is entirely made from soft material and uses a novel fluidic actuation mechanism that allows the robot to advance forward, change directions and rotate around its primary axis. The paper presents the robot's design and fabrication process. An experimental study is conducted showing the feasibility of the proposed robot and actuation mechanism.
