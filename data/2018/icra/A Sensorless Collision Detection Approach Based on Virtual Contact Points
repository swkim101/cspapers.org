This paper presents a force-sensorless collision detection approach based on virtual contacts. A series of indices based on virtual instantaneous powers are introduced associating to several virtual contacts defined on corresponding links of a manipulator. A possible contact link can be determined by comparing the introduced indices without any force or tactile sensors. Simulation results of 2D collision detection tasks by using a three DOF (Degree of Freedom) planar manipulator and 3D collision detection tasks by using a six DOF spatial manipulator validate the effectiveness of the proposed collision detection approach.
