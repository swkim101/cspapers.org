Manipulation of motile cells such as bacteria and sperm is required in both cell biology and clinical applications. For immobilizing a motile sperm, the sperm head and tail positions must be accurately tracked, interference of proximal sperms on the target sperm must be tackled, and the orientation of the sperm must be properly aligned with the manipulation tool in order not to damage the sperm head where DNA is contained. Manual operation of sperm immobilization has stringent skill requirements, and both manual operation and existing robotic sperm immobilization suffer from inconsistent success rates and incapability of manipulating sperms swimming in all directions. This paper presents a robotic system for fully automated tracking, orientation control, and immobilization of motile sperms. Algorithms were developed for robustly tracking the sperm head and estimating the sperm tail positions under interfering conditions. A new visual servo control strategy was developed to enable the robotic system to actively adjust sperm orientation for immobilizing a sperm swimming in any direction. Experimental results from robotic immobilization of 400 sperms confirmed that the robotic system achieved a consistent success rate of 94.5 %, independent of sperm velocity or swimming direction.
