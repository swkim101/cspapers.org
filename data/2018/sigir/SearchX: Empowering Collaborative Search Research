Collaborative search has been an active area of research within the IR community for many years. While for "single-user'' research a variety of up-to-date open-source search systems exist, few "multi-user'' search tools are open-source and even fewer are being maintained. In this paper, we present SearchX, an open-source collaborative search system we are currently developing-and using for our research. We designed and built SearchX using the modern Web stack (and are thus not siloed by an operating system or a particular browser type), enabling efficient research across platforms (Desktop, mobile) and with online users (e.g. crowdworkers).
