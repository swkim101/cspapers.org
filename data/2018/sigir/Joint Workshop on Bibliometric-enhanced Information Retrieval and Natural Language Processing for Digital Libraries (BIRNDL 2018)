The large scale of scholarly publications poses a challenge for scholars in information seeking and sensemaking. Information retrieval~(IR), bibliometric and natural language processing (NLP) techniques could enhance scholarly search, retrieval and user experience but are not yet widely used. To this purpose, we propose the third iteration of the Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL). The workshop is intended to stimulate IR, NLP researchers and Digital Library professionals to elaborate on new approaches in natural language processing, information retrieval, scientometrics, text mining and recommendation techniques that can advance the state-of-the-art in scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale. The BIRNDL workshop will incorporate multiple invited talks, paper sessions, a poster session and the 4th edition of the Computational Linguistics (CL) Scientific Summarization Shared Task.
