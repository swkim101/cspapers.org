We examine search engine performance for rank-safe query execution using the WAND and state-of-the-art BMW algorithms. Supported by extensive experiments, we suggest two approaches to improve query performance: initial list thresholds should be used when k values are large, and our split-list WAND approach should be used instead of the normal WAND or BMW approaches. We also recommend that reranking-based distributed systems use smaller k values when selecting the results to return from each partition.
