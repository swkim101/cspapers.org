For integers k⩾1 and n⩾2k+1 , the Kneser graph K(n,k) is the graph whose vertices are the k ‐element subsets of {1,…,n} and whose edges connect pairs of subsets that are disjoint. The Kneser graphs of the form K(2k+1,k) are also known as the odd graphs. We settle an old problem due to Meredith, Lloyd, and Biggs from the 1970s, proving that for every k⩾3 , the odd graph K(2k+1,k) has a Hamilton cycle. This and a known conditional result due to Johnson imply that all Kneser graphs of the form K(2k+2a,k) with k⩾3 and a⩾0 have a Hamilton cycle. We also prove that K(2k+1,k) has at least 22k−6 distinct Hamilton cycles for k⩾6 . Our proofs are based on a reduction of the Hamiltonicity problem in the odd graph to the problem of finding a spanning tree in a suitably defined hypergraph on Dyck words.
