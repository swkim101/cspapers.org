We study security games in which a defender commits to a mixed strategy for protecting a finite set of targets of different values. An attacker, knowing the defender's strategy, chooses which target to attack and for how long. If the attacker spends time $t$ at a target $i$ of value $\alpha_i$, and if he leaves before the defender visits the target, his utility is $t \cdot \alpha_i $; if the defender visits before he leaves, his utility is 0. The defender's goal is to minimize the attacker's utility. The defender's strategy consists of a schedule for visiting the targets; it takes her unit time to switch between targets. Such games are a simplified model of a number of real-world scenarios such as protecting computer networks from intruders, crops from thieves, etc. 
We show that optimal defender play for this continuous time security games reduces to the solution of a combinatorial question regarding the existence of infinite sequences over a finite alphabet, with the following properties for each symbol $i$: (1) $i$ constitutes a prescribed fraction $p_i$ of the sequence. (2) The occurrences of $i$ are spread apart close to evenly, in that the ratio of the longest to shortest interval between consecutive occurrences is bounded by a parameter $K$. We call such sequences $K$-quasi-regular. 
We show that, surprisingly, $2$-quasi-regular sequences suffice for optimal defender play. What is more, even randomized $2$-quasi-regular sequences suffice for optimality. We show that such sequences always exist, and can be calculated efficiently. 
The question of the least $K$ for which deterministic $K$-quasi-regular sequences exist is fascinating. Using an ergodic theoretical approach, we show that deterministic $3$-quasi-regular sequences always exist. For $2 \leq K < 3$ we do not know whether deterministic $K$-quasi-regular sequences always exist.
