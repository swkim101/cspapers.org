A Coalescing-Branching Random Walk (C o B ra ) is a natural extension to the standard random walk on a graph. The process starts with one pebble at an arbitrary node. In each round of the process every pebble splits into k pebbles, which are sent to k random neighbors. At the end of the round all pebbles at the same node coalesce into a single pebble. The process is also similar to randomized rumor spreading, with each informed node pushing the rumor to k random neighbors each time it receives a copy of the rumor. Besides its mathematical interest, this process is relevant as an information dissemination primitive and a basic model for the spread of epidemics. We study the cover time of C o B ra walks, which is the time until each node has seen at least one pebble. Our main result is a bound of O (pâˆ’1 log n) rounds with high probability on the cover time of a CoBra walk with k = 2 on any regular graph with n nodes and conductance p. This bound improves upon all previous bounds in terms of graph expansion parameters (Dutta et al. [13], Mitzenmacher et al. [27], Cooper et al. [8, 9]). Moreover, we show that for any connected regular graph the cover time is O (n log n) with high probability, independently of the expansion. Both bounds are asymptotically tight. Since our bounds coincide with the worst-case time bounds for P ush rumor spreading on regular graphs until all nodes are informed, this raises the question whether C o B ra walks and P ush rumor spreading perform similarly in general. We answer this negatively by separating the cover time of C o B ra walks and the rumor spreading time of P ush by a super-polylogarithmic factor on a family of tree-like regular graphs.
