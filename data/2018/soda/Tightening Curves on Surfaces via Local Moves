We prove new upper and lower bounds on the number of homotopy moves required to tighten a closed curve on a compact orientable surface (with or without boundary) as much as possible. First, we prove that Î©(n2) moves are required in the worst case to tighten a contractible closed curve on a surface with non-positive Euler characteristic, where n is the number of self-intersection points. Results of Hass and Scott imply a matching 0(n2) upper bound for contractible curves on orientable surfaces. Second, we prove that any closed curve on any orientable surface can be tightened as much as possible using at most 0(n4) homotopy moves. Except for a few special cases, only naive exponential upper bounds were previously known for this problem.
