The sensitivity conjecture is one of the central open problems in Boolean complexity. A recent work of Gopalan et al. [CCC 2016] conjectured a robust analog of the sensitivity conjecture, which relates the decay of the Fourier mass of a Boolean function to moments of its sensitivity. We prove the robust sensitivity conjecture in this work with near optimal parameters.
