Certificate-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) schemes are used to authenticate the identity of distinct nodes on the Internet. Using certificates for the Internet of Things (IoT) can allow many privacy sensitive applications to be trusted over the larger Internet architecture. However, since IoT devices are typically resource limited, full sized PKI certificates are not suitable for use in the IoT domain. This work outlines our approach in compressing standards-compliant X.509 certificates so that their sizes are reduced and can be effectively used on IoT nodes. Our scheme combines the use of Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and also a scheme that compresses all data that can be implicitly inferenced within the IoT sub-network. Our scheme shows a certificate compression rate of up to ~30%, which allows effective energy reduction when using X.509-based certificates on IoT platforms.
