This paper proposes an address authentication method based on the user's location history. For address authentication, existing studies discover the user's regular locations called location of interest (LOI) from the location history by using clustering algorithms. They authenticate an address if the address is contained in one of the LOIs. However, unnecessary LOIs which are unrelated to the address may lead to false authentications of illegitimate addresses, i.e. other users' addresses or feigned addresses. The proposed method tries to reduce the authentication error rate by eliminating unnecessary LOIs with the distinguishing properties of address. In other words, only few LOIs that satisfy the properties (long duration, high density, and consistency) are kept and utilized for address authentication. Experimental results show that the proposed method decreases the authentication error rate compared with previous approaches using time-based clustering and density-based clustering.
