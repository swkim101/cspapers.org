Despite the increasing awareness of the importance of managing technical debt in software product development, systematic processes for implementing technical debt management in software production have not been readily available. In this paper we report on the development and field tests of a normative process framework that systematically incorporates steps for managing technical debt in commercial software production. The framework integrates processes required for technical debt management with existing software quality management processes prescribed by the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK), and it contributes to the further development of software-specific extensions to the PMBOK. We partnered with three commercial software product development organizations to implement the framework in real-world software production settings. All three organizations, irrespective of their varying software process maturity levels, were able to adopt the proposed framework and integrate the prescribed technical debt management processes with their existing software quality management processes. Our longitudinal observations and case-study interviews indicate that the organizations were able to accrue economic benefits from the adoption and use of the integrated framework.
