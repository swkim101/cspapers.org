Verifying the regular properties of programs has been a significant challenge. This paper tackles this challenge by presenting symbolic regular verification (SRV) that offers significant speedups over the state-of-the-art. SRV is based on dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) and enabled by novel techniques for mitigating path explosion: (1) a regular property-oriented path slicing algorithm, and (2) a synergistic combination of property-oriented path slicing and guiding. Slicing prunes redundant paths, while guiding boosts the search for counterexamples. We have implemented SRV for Java and evaluated it on 15 real-world open-source Java programs (totaling 259K lines of code). Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SRV. Compared with the state-of-the-art — pure DSE, pure guiding, and pure path slicing — SRV achieves average speedups of more than 8.4X, 8.6X, and 7X, respectively, making symbolic regular property verification significantly more practical.
