The energy consumption of mobile apps is a trending topic and researchers are actively investigating the role of coding practices on energy consumption. Recent studies suggest that design choices can conflict with energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to take into account energy consumption when evolving the design of a mobile app. In this paper, we analyze the impact of eight type of anti-patterns on a testbed of 20 android apps extracted from F-Droid. We propose EARMO, a novel anti-pattern correction approach that accounts for energy consumption when refactoring mobile anti-patterns. We evaluate EARMO using three multiobjective search-based algorithms. The obtained results show that EARMO can generate refactoring recommendations in less than a minute, and remove a median of 84 percent of anti-patterns. Moreover, EARMO extended the battery life of a mobile phone by up to 29 minutes when running in isolation a refactored multimedia app with default settings (no Wi-Fi, no location services, and minimum screen brightness). Finally, we conducted a qualitative study with developers of our studied apps, to assess the refactoring recommendations made by EARMO. Developers found 68 percent of refactorings suggested by EARMO to be very relevant.
