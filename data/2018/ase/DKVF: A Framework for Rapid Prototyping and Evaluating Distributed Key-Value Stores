We present our framework DKVF that enables one to quickly prototype and evaluate new consistency protocols for key-value stores. DKVF is designed based on the separation of concerns in creating distributed data stores. This separation of concerns allows the designers of consistency protocols to only focus on the high-level consistency protocols which gives them the opportunity to quickly deploy a consistency protocol and evaluate its performance. Moreover, the loose coupling of the different components allows us to easily change different components (e.g. storage engine) of an implementation. We demonstrate DKVF by implementing four existing protocols-eventual consistency, COPS, GentleRain and CausalSpartan– with it. The implementation of these protocols was very convenient with DKVF, as it only required to write a piece of code for the consistency component that is very close to the pseudocode of the original papers. Hence, it was possible to achieve this in just 1–2 days per protocol. DKVF also comes with a toolset that facilitates running clusters and performing experiments.
