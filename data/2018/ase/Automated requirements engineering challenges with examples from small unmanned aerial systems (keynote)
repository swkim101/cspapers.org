Requirements Engineering includes various activities aimed at discovering, analyzing, validating, evolving, and managing software and systems requirements. Many of these activities are human facing, effort intensive, and sometimes error prone. They could benefit greatly from cutting edge advances in automation. However, the software engineering community has primarily focused on automating other aspects of the development process such as testing, code analytics, and mining software respositories. As a result, advances in software analytics have had superficial impact upon advancing the state of art and practice in the field of requirements engineering. Two primary inhibitors are the lack of publicly available datasets and poorly publicized industry-relevant open requirements analytic challenges. To empower the Automated Software Engineering community to tackle open Requirements Engineering challenges, the talk will describe the rapidly evolving landscape of requirements engineering, clearly articulate open challenges, draw upon examples from an ongoing, agile, safety-critical project in the domain of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and introduce Dronology as a new community dataset.
