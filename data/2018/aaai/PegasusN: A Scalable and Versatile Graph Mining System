In this work, we propose PegasusN, a scalable and versatile graph mining system that runs on Hadoop and Spark. To handle enormous graphs, PegasusN provides and seamlessly integrates efficient algorithms for various graph mining operations: graph structure analyses, subgraph enumeration, graph generation, and graph visualization. PegasusN quickly processes extra-large graphs that other systems cannot handle.
