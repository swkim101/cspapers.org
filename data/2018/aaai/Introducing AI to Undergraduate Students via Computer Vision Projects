In this project, undergraduate students performed research on a landmark recognition task using computer vision techniques. The project focused on analyzing, designing, configuring, and testing the two core components in landmark recognition: feature detection and description. The project modeled the landmark recognition system as a tour guide for visitors to the campus and evaluated the performance in the real world circumstances. By analyzing real-world data and solving problems, studentâ€™s cognitive skills and critical thinking skills were sharpened. Their knowledge and understanding in mathematical modeling and data processing were also enhanced.
