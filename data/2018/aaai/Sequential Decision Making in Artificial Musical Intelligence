For an agent to be social with respect to humans, it needs to be able to parse and process the multitude of aspects that comprise the human cultural experience. That in itself gives rise to many fascinating learning problems. I am interested in tackling these fundamental problems from an empirical as well as a theoretical perspective. Music, as a general target domain, serves as an excellent testbed for these research ideas. Musical skills---playing music (alone or in a group), analyzing music or composing it---all involve extremely advanced knowledge representation and problem solving tools. Creating "musical agents"---agents that can interact richly with people in the music domain---is a challenge that holds the potential of advancing social agents research, and contributing important and broadly applicable AI knowledge. This belief is fueled not just by my background in computer science and artificial intelligence, but also by my deep passion for music as well as my extensive musical training. One key aspect of musical intelligence which hasnâ€™t been sufficiently studied is that of sequential decision-making. My thesis strives to answer the following question: How can a sequential decision making perspective guide us in the creation of better music agents, and social agents in general? More specifically, this thesis focuses on two aspects of musical intelligence: music recommendation and multiagent interaction in the context of music.
