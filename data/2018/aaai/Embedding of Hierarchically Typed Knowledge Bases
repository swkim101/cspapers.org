Most of these models are "typeless," namely, treating a knowledge base solely as a collection of instances without considering the types of the entities therein. In this paper, we investigate the use of entity type information for knowledge base embedding. We present a framework that augments a generic "typeless" embedding model to a typed one. The framework interprets an entity type as a constraint on the set of all entities and let these type constraints induce isomorphically a set of subsets in the embedding space. Additional cost functions are then introduced to model the fitness between these constraints and the embedding of entities and relations. A concrete example scheme of the framework is proposed. We demonstrate experimentally that this framework offers improved embedding performance over the typeless models and other typed models.
