However, most of the existing methods focus more on visual information while ignoring the synchronized audio cues. We propose three multimodal deep fusion strategies to maximize the benefits of visual-audio resonance information. The first one explores the impact on cross-modalities feature fusion from low to high order. The second establishes the visual-audio short-term dependency by sharing weights of corresponding front-end networks. The third extends the temporal dependency to long-term through sharing multimodal memory across visual and audio modalities. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our three cross-modalities fusion strategies on two benchmark datasets, including Microsoft Research Video to Text (MSRVTT) and Microsoft Video Description (MSVD). It is worth mentioning that sharing weight can coordinate visual- audio feature fusion effectively and achieve the state-of-art performance on both BELU and METEOR metrics. Furthermore, we first propose a dynamic multimodal feature fusion framework to deal with the part modalities missing case. Experimental results demonstrate that even in the audio absence mode, we can still obtain comparable results with the aid of the additional audio modality inference module.
