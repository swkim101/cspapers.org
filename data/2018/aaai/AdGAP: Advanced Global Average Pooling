The motivation behind AdGAP comes from the fact that the convolutional filters possess position information of the essential features and hence, combination of the feature maps could help us locate the class instances in an image. Our novel architecture generates promising results and unlike previous methods, the architecture is not sensitive to the size of the input image, thus promising wider application.
