Recent studies on neural relation extraction have shown great progress on this task via modeling the sentences in low-dimensional spaces, but seldom considered syntax information to model the entities. In this paper, we propose to learn syntax-aware entity embedding for neural relation extraction. First, we encode the context of entities on a dependency tree as sentence-level entity embedding based on tree-GRU. Then, we utilize both intra-sentence and inter-sentence attentions to obtain sentence set-level entity embedding over all sentences containing the focus entity pair. Finally, we combine both sentence embedding and entity embedding for relation classification. We conduct experiments on a widely used real-world dataset and the experimental results show that our model can make full use of all informative instances and achieve state-of-the-art performance of relation extraction.
