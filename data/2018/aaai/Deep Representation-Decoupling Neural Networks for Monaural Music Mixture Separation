In this paper, we study the problem of separating vocals and instruments from monaural music mixture. Existing works for monaural source separation either utilize linear and shallow models (e.g., non-negative matrix factorization), or do not explicitly address the coupling and tangling of multiple sources in original input signals, hence they do not perform satisfactorily in real-world scenarios. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for monaural music mixture separation called Deep Representation-Decoupling Neural Networks (DRDNN). DRDNN takes advantages of both traditional signal processing methods and popular deep learning models. For each input of music mixture, DRDNN converts it to a two-dimensional time-frequency spectrogram using short-time Fourier transform (STFT), followed by stacked convolutional neural networks (CNN) layers and long-short term memory (LSTM) layers to extract more condensed features. Afterwards, DRDNN utilizes a decoupling component, which consists of a group of multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), to decouple the features further into different separated sources. The design of decoupling component in DRDNN produces purified single-source signals for subsequent full-size restoration, and can significantly improve the performance of final separation. Through extensive experiments on real-world dataset, we prove that DRDNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in the task of monaural music mixture separation and reconstruction.
