Most of the existing methods are batch methods designed mainly based on the convex optimization, say, the projected gradient descent method. However, they are generally time-consuming due to that the singular value decomposition (SVD) is commonly adopted during the update, especially when the data size is very large. To overcome this challenge, we propose a stochastic algorithm called SVRG-SBB, which has the following features: (a) SVD-free via dropping convexity, with good scalability by the use of stochastic algorithm, i.e., stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG), and (b) adaptive step size choice via introducing a new stabilized Barzilai-Borwein (SBB) method as the original version for convex problems might fail for the considered stochastic non-convex optimization problem. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point at a rate O(1/T) in our setting, where T is the number of total iterations. Numerous simulations and real-world data experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm via comparing with the state-of-the-art methods, particularly, much lower computational cost with good prediction performance.
