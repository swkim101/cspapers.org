Existing approaches typically exploit label correlations globally to improve the effectiveness of label distribution learning, by assuming that the label correlations are shared by all instances. However, different instances may share different label correlations, and few correlations are globally applicable in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new label distribution learning algorithm by exploiting sample correlations locally (LDL-SCL). To encode the influence of local samples, we design a local correlation vector for each instance based on the clustered local samples. Then we predict the label distribution for an unseen instance based on the original features and the local correlation vector simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that LDL-SCL can effectively deal with the label distribution problems and perform remarkably better than the state-of-the-art LDL methods.
