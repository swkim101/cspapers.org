Recent work has shown that it is possible for two wearable devices worn by the same user to generate a common key for secure pairing by exploiting gait as a common secret. A key challenge for such device pairing lies in matching the bits of the keys generated by two independent devices despite the noisy on-board sensor measurements. We propose a novel machine learning framework that uses an autoencoder to help one device predict the sensor observations at another device and generate the key using the predicted sensor data. We prototype the proposed method and evaluate it using real subjects. Our results show that the proposed method achieves a 10% increase in bit agreement rate between two keys generated independently by two different wearable devices.
