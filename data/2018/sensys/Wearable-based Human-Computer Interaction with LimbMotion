LimbMotion is a limb tracking system which enables accurate and real-time tracking with one wearable device on the wrist/ankle of a user. By integrating inertial sensing and acoustic sensing, LimbMotion significantly reduces the search space of a moving limb, and provides accurate limb tracking for further human computer interaction (HCI). Objectives of this demo are to show how LimbMotion works and two HCI applications supported by LimbMotion.
