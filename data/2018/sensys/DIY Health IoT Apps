We demonstrate how lay users may program their own smart spaces to create IoT apps with a few clicks on their smartphone. We present our Atlas Thing Architecture and the Runtime Interactive Development Environment (RIDE) which allow users to program custom apps based on the logical and functional relationships that tie IoT things available in their smart spaces. We also demo a Health IoT scenario using personal medical devices and mobile apps as things and show how mobile users can develop, install and use IoT apps utilizing these things using RIDE.
