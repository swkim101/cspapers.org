Body-worn inertial sensors has become a convenient tool for sensing and recognizing human activities. The work presented in this poster uses Nordic Semiconductor's Thingy:52 IoT Sensor kit as the data collection device. We built a body area network with four Thingy:52 devices that collect data of the wearer. In this work, we focused only on periodic and continuous activities and experimented with walking and running.
