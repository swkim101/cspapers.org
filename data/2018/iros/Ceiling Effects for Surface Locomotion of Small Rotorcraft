Motivated by the potential of bimodal aerial and surface locomotion as an energy saving strategy for small flying robots, we investigate the effects of a flat overhang surface in the vicinity of a spinning propeller. We employ the classical momentum theory and the blade element method to describe the “ceiling effects” in regards to the generated thrust, power, and rotational speed of the propeller in terms of a normalized distance between the ceiling and the propeller. Validating experiments were performed on a benchtop setup, and the results are in agreement with the proposed models. The presence of a ceiling was found to reduce the power consumption by more than a factor of three for the same thrust force. Overall, our findings show promise, paving the way for the use of perching maneuvers by small rotorcraft to extend their missions.
