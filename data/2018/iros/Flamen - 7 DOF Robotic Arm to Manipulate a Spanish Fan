A Spanish fan is a hand held traditional fan which is used as an accessory and also by Flamenco dancers. The manipulation of the fan is quite difficult as it involves dynamic motion which includes opening, flapping and closing the fan along a pivotal point. The key points include the motion to be quick and the fan to be opened to the maximum degree possible without human intervention. A robotic arm with 7 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) is used to manipulate the autonomous motion. The fan placed on the table is localized and detected using a camera by background subtraction, masking and filtering; post which the contour of the fan is detected. The pixels obtained is then transformed into real life coordinates. The Dynamixel motors then traverses to the coordinates of the fan's position to grasp, open, flap, close and put the fan down.
