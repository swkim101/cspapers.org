This video presents a distributed trajectory generator for formation control of multi-robot systems. The desired formation is defined by its geometric parameters but the position of each robot in the formation is not predefined a priori. The contribution is the design of a distributed algorithm to compute the robots' positions with respect to a given target while maintaining a particular formation which can be reconfigured on-line. A tracking controller ensures the convergence of the robots to their desired positions.
