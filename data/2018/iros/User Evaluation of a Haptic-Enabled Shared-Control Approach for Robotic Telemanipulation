Robotic telemanipulators are already widely used in nuclear decommissioning sites for handling radioactive waste. However, currently employed systems are still extremely primitive, making the handling of these materials prohibitively slow and ineffective. As the estimated cost for the decommissioning and clean-up of nuclear sites keeps rising, it is clear that one would need faster and more effective approaches. Towards this goal, in this paper we present the user evaluation of a recently proposed haptic-enabled shared-control architecture for telemanipulation. An autonomous algorithm regulates a subset of the slave manipulator degrees of freedom (DoF) in order to help the human operator in grasping an object of interest. The human operator can then steer the manipulator along the remaining null-space directions with respect to the main task by acting on a grounded haptic interface. The haptic cues provided to the operator are designed in order to inform about the feasibility of the user's commands with respect to possible constraints of the robotic system. In this paper we compared this shared-control architecture against a classical 6-DOF teleoperation approach in a real scenario by running experiments with 10 subjects. The results clearly show that the proposed shared-control approach is a viable and effective solution for improving currently-available teleoperation systems in remote telemanipulation tasks.
