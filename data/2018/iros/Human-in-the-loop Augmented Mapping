In this paper we develop a real-time human augmented mapping system. This approach replaces the traditional offline post processing of maps by a user-friendly system allowing for online editing capabilities. A wide number of applications that acquire accurate mapping of the environment could benefit from such a solution. The proposed framework consists of two main parts: 2D map building using LIDAR, encoders, and IMU; and a user interface for human map augmentation. The first part is built over Gmapping ROS package, while the second is developed in Unity software. Realworld experiments validated the ability of our system to correct for sensor noise and various mapping errors, thus increasing the accuracy of the obtained maps without additional computational costs.
