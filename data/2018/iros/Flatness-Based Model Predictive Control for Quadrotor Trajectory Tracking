The use of model predictive control for quadro-tor applications requires balancing trajectory tracking performance and constraint satisfaction with fast computation. This paper proposes a Flatness-based Model Predictive Control (FMPC) approach that can be applied to quadrotors, and more generally, differentially flat nonlinear systems. Our proposed FMPC couples feedback model predictive control with feedforward linearization. The proposed approach has the computational advantage that, similar to linear model predictive control, it only requires solving a convex quadratic program instead of a nonlinear program. However, unlike linear model predictive control, we still account for the nonlinearity in the model through the use of an inverse term. In simulation, we demonstrate improved robustness over approaches that couple model predictive control with feedback linearization. In experiments using quadrotor vehicles, we also demonstrate improved trajectory tracking compared to classical linear and nonlinear model predictive control approaches.
