This paper focuses on numerical methods that can be used to identify hydrodynamic parameters of submerged bodies, namely added mass, linear and quadratic friction coefficients. The mechanical setup is a free decay pendulum that is equipped with an encoder. The first contribution of this paper deals with the comparison of two estimation methods: one method that fits the acceleration of the dynamical model with the acceleration obtained from derivatives of the measured angular position, and another method that fits this position with the angle obtained by numerical integration. The second contribution consists of investigating to what extent estimated added mass and friction coefficient parameters of the dynamical model match the empirical or theoretical values in the case of a spherical object. The results obtained show that the numerical integration method allows to determine the added mass with a good accuracy and a single friction coefficient could be used for the dynamic model without loosing validity.
