To make production lines more flexible, dual-arm robots are good candidates to be deployed in autonomous assembly units. In this paper, we propose a sparse kinematic control strategy, that minimizes the number of joints actuated for a coordinated task between two arms. The control strategy is based on a hierarchical sparse QP architecture. We present experimental results that highlight the capability of this architecture to produce sparser motions (for an assembly task) than those obtained with standard controllers.
