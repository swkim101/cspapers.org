The words used to describe robotic performances include a degree of ambiguity that the human brain should solve without difficulty. However, the language used in -and about- robotics seems to escape from the ordinary processing of lexical ambiguity resolution. In this paper, we argue that there is no lack of an adequate language for robotics but that the lexicon at hand is forced by our representations. We investigate the main representational issues of the notions that express robotic actions and dispositions (i.e. behaviors).
