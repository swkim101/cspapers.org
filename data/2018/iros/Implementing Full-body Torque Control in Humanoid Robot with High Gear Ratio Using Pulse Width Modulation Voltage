Most state-of-the-art torque control-based legged robots show excellent performance, exceeding that of conventional position control-based robots. Many conventional position control-based legged robots have high gear ratios, but do not have joint torque sensors. In addition, some robots cannot generate current for controlling the motor torque. To apply torque control-based walking algorithms to a position control-based humanoid robot, we proposed current control using a motor thermal model and realized joint torque control by compensating for the joint dynamics and robot dynamics. We conducted experiments to verify the performance of the Hubo2 platform developed in 2008 by applying a full-body dynamics control framework. The results confirmed the possibility of using torque control algorithms with existing position-based robots.
