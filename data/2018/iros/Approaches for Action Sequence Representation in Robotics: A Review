Robust representation of actions and its sequences for complex robotic tasks would transform robot's understanding to execute robotic tasks efficiently. The challenge is to understand action sequences for highly unstructured environments and to represent and construct action and action sequences. In this manuscript, we present a review of literature dealing with representation of action and action sequences for robot task planning and execution. The methodological review was conducted using Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore, searching the specific keywords. This manuscript gives an overview of current approaches for representing action sequences in robotics. We propose a classification of different methodologies used for action sequences representation and describe the most important aspects of the reviewed publications. This review allows the reader to understand several options that do exist in the research community, to represent and deploy such action representations in real robots.
