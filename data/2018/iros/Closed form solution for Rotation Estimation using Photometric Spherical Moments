This paper presents new schemes to estimate 3D rotation from spherical images. Unlike existing approaches, spherical moment properties are exploited to obtain a closed form solution without iteratively mimimizing a cost function. Actually, three methods using spherical moments are proposed: two of them can be classified as dense approaches, while the third one is hybrid combining geometrical features with dense ones. Experimental results using both synthetic images and acquired images using catadioptric cameras with different scenarios show the effectiveness of our approach.
