This paper presents a fabric actuator consisting of ordinary polymer fibers, conductive fibers, and twisted and coiled soft actuators (TCAs). Previous studies have developed a Spandex TCA (STCA) that is driven at a lower temperature than the conventional Nylon TCA and exhibits greater actuation strain. However, no method to drive STCAs via electrical joule-heating has been developed yet. The fabric actuator presented in this paper offers a solution to this problem by employing an STCA multiple fabrication method, a continuous fabrication method, bundling technology, and weaving technology. Two types of samples (cylindrical and planar) are fabricated and their performances are evaluated experimentally. From the actuation test according to the loads, the maximum contraction strain of 34.3% is measured. The repeatability is also verified through 200 cycles of actuation. Using a linearized model, the dynamic performance of the fabric actuator is predicted and compared with experimental results. An actual human arm size mannequin is driven by applying the fabric actuator, and angle control can be achieved with an encoder mounted on the joint. In addition, fabric actuator is weaved to sweater showing the possibility of wearable assistive robot.
