Comparing to IK (Inverse Kinematics) based motion control, joint-space motion control is more advantageous in terms of not being restricted by kinematics singularity problem. In this paper, we start with SIMBICON (Simple Biped Locomotion Control) based controller, a joint-space motion control method, extend it for enhancing walking's robustness and versatility. We propose a motion optimization method considering walking robustness, desired walking velocity and energy efficient minimization for walking motion generation. This method enables us to achieve human-like walking motion, which has stretched-knee posture and robust to large push disturbances. We also apply our proposed method to a life-sized biped robot and validate its effectiveness with push recovery and walking on unknown debris experiments.
