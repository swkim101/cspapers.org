The hardware compatibility of legged locomotion is often illustrated by Zero Moment Point (ZMP) that has been extensively studied for decades. One of the most popular models for computing the ZMP is the linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model that expresses ZMP as a linear function of the center of mass(COM) and its acceleration. In the real world, however, it may not accurately predict the true ZMP of hardware due to various reasons such as unmodeled dynamics and differences between simulation model and hardware. In this paper, we aim to improve the theoretical ZMP model by learning the real hardware dynamics from experimental data. We first optimize the motion plan using the theoretical ZMP model and collect COP data by executing the motion on a force plate. We then train a new ZMP model that maps the motion plan variable to the actual ZMP and use the learned model for finding a new hardware-compatible motion plan. Through various locomotion tasks of a quadruped, we demonstrate that motions planned for the learned ZMP model are compatible on hardware when those for the theoretical ZMP model are not. Furthermore, experiments using ZMP models with different complexities reveal that overly complex models may suffer from over-fitting even though they can potentially represent more complex, unmodeled dynamics.
