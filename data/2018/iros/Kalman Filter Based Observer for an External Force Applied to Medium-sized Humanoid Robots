External force observer for humanoid robots has been widely studied in the literature. However, most of the proposed approaches generally rely on information from six-axis force/torque sensors, which the small or medium-sized humanoid robots usually do not have. As a result, those approaches cannot be applied to this category of humanoid robots, which is widely used nowadays in education or research. In this paper, we improve the external force observer in [1] to handle the case of an external force applied in any direction and at an arbitrary point of the robot structure. The new observer is based on Kalman filter formulation and it allows the estimation of the three force components. The observer is simple to implement and can easily run in real time using the embedded processor of a medium-sized humanoid robot such as Nao or Darwin-OP. Moreover, the observer does not require any change to the robot hardware as it only uses measurements from the available force-sensing resistors (FSR) inserted under the feet of the humanoid robot and from the robot inertial measurement unit (IMU). The proposed observer was extensively validated on a Nao humanoid robot. In all conducted experiments, the observer successfully estimated the external force within a reasonable margin of error.
