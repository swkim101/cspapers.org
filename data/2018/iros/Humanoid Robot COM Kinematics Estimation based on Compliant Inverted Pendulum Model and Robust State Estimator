This work proposes a humanoid robot center of mass (COM) estimation framework based on the compliant inverted pendulum model and the robust estimator. Humanoids' limited structural stiffness and relatively long legs result in undesired flexibility, and this undesired motion hinders the state estimation. The models used in previous studies were either not suitable for estimation or too simple to express these key characteristics of humanoid robots. Here, to enhance the estimation performance, the compliant inverted pendulum model, which is developed by attaching a spring and damper to the original pendulum, is adopted. The additional elements can represent the mechanical deformation and undesired flexibility. This model can reflect the important characteristics of the humanoid robot while taking advantage of the merits of the sing-mass model. In addition, a robust state estimator that was proposed in our previous work is adopted to compensate for an estimation error caused by a modeling error. Using these two factors, an improved COM kinematics estimates could be obtained.
