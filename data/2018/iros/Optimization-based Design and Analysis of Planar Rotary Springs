This paper develops new methods to design high performance rotary series elastic actuator springs for robotics applications. The approach is based on a spring arm mathematical model that was previously introduced by the authors. The key contribution is the development of an optimization-based design method which maximizes the springs' overall torque density through optimization of the arm profile. An improved analysis algorithm allows for rapid torsional loading response simulation with possible internal contacts between the spring arms. The proposed design and analysis algorithms are validated through FEA and prototype mechanical testing.
