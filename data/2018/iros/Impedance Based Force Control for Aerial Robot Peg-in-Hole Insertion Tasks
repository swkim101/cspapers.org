This paper demonstrates the experimental validation of canonical peg-in-hole manipulation task using an aerial robot. The robot consists of a multirotor platform equipped with a dual arm multi degree of freedom manipulator. The paper discusses the introduced kinematic constraints which make sure the robot holds a bolt with both arms. We build our peg-in-hole approach using impedance control which is the foundation of compliant interaction with the environment. We utilize a finite state automaton to plan a multi stage strategy which relies on tactile perception in order to pin point the target. Finally, the whole body locomotion is considered, meaning both the degrees of freedom of multirotor base and the dual arm manipulator are considered.
