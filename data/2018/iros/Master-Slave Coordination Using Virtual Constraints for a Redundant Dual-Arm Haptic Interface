Programming robots for tasks involving force interaction is difficult, since both the knowledge of the task and the dynamics of the robots are necessary. An immersive haptic interface for task demonstration is proposed, where the operator can sense and act through the robot. This is achieved by coupling two robotic systems with virtual constraints such that they have the same coordinates in the operational space disregarding a fixed offset. Limitations caused by the singular configurations or the reach of the robots are naturally reflected to either side as haptic feedback.
