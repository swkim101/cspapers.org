As autonomous robots are increasingly being introduced in real-world environments operating for long periods of time, the difficulties of long-term mapping are attracting the attention of the robotics research community. This paper proposes a full SLAM system capable of handling the dynamics of the environment across a single or multiple mapping sessions. Using the pose graph SLAM paradigm, the system works on local maps in the form of 2D point cloud data which are updated over time to store the most up-to-date state of the environment. The core of our system is an efficient ICP-based alignment and merging procedure working on the clouds that copes with non-static entities of the environment. Furthermore, the system retains the graph complexity by removing out-dated nodes upon robust inter- and intra-session loop closure detections while graph coherency is preserved by using condensed measurements. Experiments conducted with real data from longterm SLAM datasets demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and effectiveness of our system in the management of the mapping problem during long-term robot operation.
