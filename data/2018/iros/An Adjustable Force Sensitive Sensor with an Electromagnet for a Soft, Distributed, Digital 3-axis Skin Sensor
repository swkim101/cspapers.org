Typically, the range and sensitivity of force sensors are determined during production. However, to be able to do both delicate and high-force demanding work, adjustable force sensitivity would be beneficial. The current paper proposes such a sensor by implementing a planar electromagnet above a 3-axis magnetic sensor, separated by soft foam. Furthermore, the sensor has digital output with an integrated microcontroller. The magnetic field strength with varying currents is examined in simulation, and the field changes according to displacements are investigated both in simulation and with the actual sensor. A prototype 3-axis force sensor is implemented and the relationship between the magnetic field change and the corresponding applied force is also investigated. It could be shown that the sensitivity of the sensor to displacements, as well as force, can indeed be adjusted.
