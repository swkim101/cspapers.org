3D reconstruction and surgical tool segmentation are necessary for several advanced tasks in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. These tasks include vision-based force estimation, surgical guidance, and medical image registration where pre-operative data (CT or MRI scan image slices) are overlaid on patient anatomy in real-time during surgery [1] to name a few. In this work, two main strategies were considered: (1) initialize with surgical tool segmentation from 2D images, then proceed to local 3D reconstruction near the tool-tissue interaction region by projecting the segmented result into 3D space, and (2) initialize with 3D reconstruction of the entire surgical task space, followed by surgical tool segmentation from within the 3D reconstructed model. Both methods were implemented on the Raven II surgical robot system, and accuracy and time complexity for both methods were comparatively analyzed while considering various task parameters. Finally, based on the results of this work, guidelines for selecting reconstruction and segmentation strategies and procedure for particular situations are outlined in Section V.
