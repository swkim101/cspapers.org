This paper investigates the straight path following problem for a class of underactuated bio-inspired snake robots on ground with unknown and varied friction coefficients. Existing works usually design control input requiring the exact values of these friction coefficients, which however rely on the specific operating terrain and may not always be known a priori. By virtue of backstepping technique, we present a novel adaptive controller that can compensate for unknown and varied friction coefficients in real-time. Moreover, it is proved via LaSalle-Yoshizawa theorem that the path following errors converge to zero asymptotically and all the parameter estimates are bounded. Simulations and experiments on an 8-link snake robot are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.
