We assume that an intuitive means for the specification, re-use, modification and transfer of synchronized motions-both regarding the two arms of a dual-arm robotic system, as well as regarding the coordination of a user and a robot-is key in interactive and collaborative settings as they are currently targeted for industrial applications. We show, how our knowledge based approach to end-user programming of synchronized motions and other generalizable, robot-agnostic skills can support such specification of coordinated actions between two robot arms and explain how that could be extended to include coordination with a human user. We describe the underlying ontologies and possibilities to populate those with an interface for intuitive programming, and show the generality of our approach through a task transfer between different kinematics (different robots), where the user is supported through underlying reasoning about the fulfillment of certain parameters or constraints for the involved skills.
