This paper first presents a formula to predict the largest balance disturbance from which a legged robot can recover without taking a step. It then presents an actuator design criterion derived from this formula that maximizes the robot's ability to recover. In this study, it is assumed that the robot is using a single major joint (e.g, a hip joint) to perform its balance recovery movement, and that the actuator consists of an electric motor and reduction gear. It is also assumed that the robot's support polygon is sufficiently small that it can be approximated as a point, and that the balance recovery motion is essentially planar, so that a 2-D analysis remains valid in 3-D. Finally, it is assumed that, for the purpose of studying balance recovery motion, the robot can be approximated by a reaction wheel pendulum. The theory has been tested experimentally on a robot designed to be good at balancing, and was found to agree closely with experimental results.
