Imitating expert demonstration is a powerful mechanism for learning to perform tasks from raw sensory observations. The current dominant paradigm in learning from demonstration (LfD) [3,16,19,20] requires the expert to either manually move the robot joints (i.e., kinesthetic teaching) or teleoperate the robot to execute the desired task. The expert typically provides multiple demonstrations of a task at training time, and this generates data in the form of observation-action pairs from the agent's point of view. The agent then distills this data into a policy for performing the task of interest. Such a heavily supervised approach, where it is necessary to provide demonstrations by controlling the robot, is incredibly tedious for the human expert. Moreover, for every new task that the robot needs to execute, the expert is required to provide a new set of demonstrations.
