We study the low-level problem of predicting pixel intensit ies after subpixel image translations. This is a basic subroutine for image warping and super-resolution, and it has a critical influ e ce on the accuracy of correlation-based subpixel image matching . Rather than using traditional frequency-space filtering theory, w e take an empirical approach, finding optimal subpixel interpolatio n filters by direct numerical optimization over a large training set o f examples. The training set is generated by subsampling larger im ages at different translations, using subsamplers that mimic th e spatial response functions of real pixels. We argue that this gives r ealistic results, and design filters of various different paramet ric forms under traditional and robust prediction error metrics. We s ystematically study the performance of the resulting filters, pay ing particular attention to the influence of the underlying image sa mpling regime and to the effects of aliasing (“jaggies”). We summar ize the results of this study and give practical advice for obtainin g subpixel accuracy.
