We present a framework for learning disentangled and interpretable jointly continuous and discrete representations in an unsupervised manner. By augmenting the continuous latent distribution of variational autoencoders with a relaxed discrete distribution and controlling the amount of information encoded in each latent unit, we show how continuous and categorical factors of variation can be discovered automatically from data. The learned model also contains an inference network which can infer quantities such as angle and width of objects from image data in a completely unsupervised manner. Our experiments show that the framework disentangles continuous and discrete generative factors on various datasets, including disentangling digit type from stroke thickness, angle and width on MNIST, chair type from azimuth and width on the Chairs dataset and age from azimuth on CelebA.
