The abundant information in graphs helps us to learn more expressive node representations. Different nodes in the neighborhood have different importance to the central node. Thus, average weight aggregation in most Graph Neural Networks would fail to model such difference. GAT-based models introduce the attention mechanism to solve this problem, but they ignore the rich structural information and may suffer from the problem of over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose Graph Neural Networks with STructural Adaptive Receptive fields (STAR-GNN), which adaptively construct a receptive field for each node with structural information and further achieve better aggregation of information. Firstly, we model local structural distribution based on anonymous random walks, followed by using the structural information to construct receptive fields guided with mutual information. Then, as the generated receptive fields are irregular, we design a sub-graph aggregator to boost node representations and theoretically prove that it has the ability to capture the complex structures in receptive fields. Experimental results demonstrate the power of STAR-GNN in learning structural receptive fields adaptively and encoding more informative structural characteristics in real-world networks.
