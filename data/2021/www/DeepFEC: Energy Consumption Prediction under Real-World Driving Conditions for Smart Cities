The status of air pollution is serious all over the world. Analysing and predicting vehicle energy consumption becomes a major concern. Vehicle energy consumption depends not only on speed but also on a number of external factors such as road topology, traffic, driving style, etc. Obtaining the cost for each link (i.e., link energy consumption) in road networks plays a key role in energy-optimal route planning process. This paper presents a novel framework that identifies vehicle/driving environment-dependent factors to predict energy consumption over a road network based on historical consumption data for different vehicle types. We design a deep-learning-based structure, called DeepFEC, to forecast accurate energy consumption in each and every road in a city based on real traffic conditions. A residual neural network and recurrent neural network are employed to model the spatial and temporal closeness, respectively. Static vehicle data reflecting vehicle type, vehicle weight, engine configuration and displacement are also learned. The outputs of these neural networks are dynamically aggregated to improve the spatially correlated time series data forecasting. Extensive experiments conducted on a diverse fleet consisting of 264 gasoline vehicles, 92 Hybrid Electric Vehicles, and 27 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles/Electric Vehicles drove in Michigan road network, show that our proposed deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prediction algorithms. To make the results reproductible, the code, the used data and details of the experimental setup are made available online at https://github.com/ElmiSay/DeepFEC.
