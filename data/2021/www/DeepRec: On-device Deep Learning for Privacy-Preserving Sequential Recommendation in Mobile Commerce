Sequential recommendation techniques are considered to be a promising way of providing better user experience in mobile commerce by learning sequential interests within user historical interaction behaviors. However, the recently increasing focus on privacy concerns, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), can significantly affect the deployment of state-of-the-art sequential recommendation techniques, because user behavior data are no longer allowed to be arbitrarily used without the userâ€™s explicit permission. To address the issue, this paper proposes DeepRec, an on-device deep learning framework of mining interaction behaviors for sequential recommendation without sending any raw data or intermediate results out of the device, preserving user privacy maximally. DeepRec constructs a global model using data collected before GDPR and fine-tunes a personal model continuously on individual mobile devices using data collected after GDPR. DeepRec employs the model pruning and embedding sparsity techniques to reduce the computation and network overhead, making the model training process practical on computation-constraint mobile devices. Evaluation results show that DeepRec can achieve comparable recommendation accuracy to existing centralized recommendation approaches with small computation overhead and up to 10x reduction in network overhead.
