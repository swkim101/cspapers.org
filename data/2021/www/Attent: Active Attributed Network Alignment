Network alignment finds node correspondences across multiple networks, where the alignment accuracy is of crucial importance because of its profound impact on downstream applications. The vast majority of existing works focus on how to best utilize the topology and attribute information of the input networks as well as the anchor links when available. Nonetheless, it has not been well studied on how to boost the alignment performance through actively obtaining high-quality and informative anchor links, with a few exceptions. The sparse literature on active network alignment introduces the human in the loop to label some seed node correspondence (i.e., anchor links), which are informative from the perspective of querying the most uncertain node given few potential matchings. However, the direct influence of the intrinsic network attribute information on the alignment results has largely remained unknown. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and propose an active network alignment method (Attent) to identify the best nodes to query. The key idea of the proposed method is to leverage effective and efficient influence functions defined over the alignment solution to evaluate the goodness of the candidate nodes for query. Our proposed query strategy bears three distinct advantages, including (1) effectiveness, being able to accurately quantify the influence of the candidate nodes on the alignment results; (2) efficiency, scaling linearly with 15 − 17 × speed-up over the straight-forward implementation without any quality loss; (3) generality, consistently improving alignment performance of a variety of network alignment algorithms.
