In this paper, we introduce a novel side-channel attack for eavesdropping sound using an electro-optical sensor. We show how small vibrations of a hanging bulb (in response to sound hitting its surface), can be exploited by eavesdroppers to recover sound. We evaluate our method's performance in a realistic setup and show that our method can be used by eavesdroppers to recover songs from a target room containing the hanging light bulb.
