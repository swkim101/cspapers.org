The growing popularity of applications featuring Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) raises serious concerns regarding the use of such a game-changing technology inside sensitive physical spaces, e.g., memorials, hospitals, museums, etc., such that the safety and privacy of users is preserved. To address such concerns, we present our ongoing work for mediating the way MAR Content, e.g., digital objects rendered on top of a video stream, is generated, distributed, and consumed by applications. We introduce a theoretical model, a supporting framework, as well as SpaceMediator, a proof-of-concept application implementing our approach.
