The dependencies across different layers are an important property in multiplex networks and a few methods have been proposed to learn the dependencies in various ways. When capturing the dependencies across different layers, some of them assumed the structure among layers following consistent connectivity to force two nodes with a link in one layer tend to have links in other layers, some introduced a common vector to model the shared information across all layers. However, the correlations among layers in multiplex networks are diverse, which go beyond the connectivity consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel Modeling Correlations for Multiplex network Embedding (MCME) framework to learn the robust node representations for each layer. It can deal with complex correlations with a common structure, layer similarity and node heterogeneity through a unified framework in multiplex networks. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets and the results demonstrate that our proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
