The fairness issue is very important in deploying machine learning models as algorithms widely used in human society can be easily in discrimination. Researchers have studied disparity on tabular data a lot and proposed many methods to relieve bias. However, studies towards unfairness in graph are still at early stage while graph data that often represent connections among people in real-world applications can easily give rise to fairness issues and thus should be attached to great importance. Fair representation learning is one of the most effective methods to relieve bias, which aims to generate hidden representations of input data while obfuscating sensitive information. In graph setting, learning fair representations of graph (also called fair graph embeddings) is effective to solve graph unfairness problems. However, most existing works of fair graph embeddings only study fairness in a coarse granularity (i.e., group fairness), but overlook individual fairness. In this paper, we study fair graph representations from different levels. Specifically, we consider both group fairness and individual fairness on graph. To debias graph embeddings, we propose FairGAE, a fair graph auto-encoder model, to derive unbiased graph embeddings based on the tailor-designed fair Graph Convolution Network (GCN) layers. Then, to achieve multi-level fairness, we design a Wasserstein distance based regularizer to learn the optimal transport for fairer embeddings. To overcome the efficiency concern, we further bring up Sinkhorn divergence as the approximations of Wasserstein cost for computation. Finally, we apply the learned unbiased embeddings into the node classification task and conduct extensive experiments on two real-world graph datasets to demonstrate the improved performances of our approach.
