Receptive field-based segmentation models represent features in receptive fields having weak perception for thin semantics in thin structures segmentation, due to the challenges in small local size and large global variation. High-frequency (HiFe) components have strong thin perception ability and is stable for global variation, but its weak adaptability limits its direct application. We propose a HiFe priori rule which enables the network to adaptively extract and fuse HiFe components, enhancing the thin semantics and making the network naturally prefer thin structures for their segmentation. We further propose High-Frequency Semantics Enhancement Network (HiFeNet) based on our HiFe priori rule, boosting the SOTA methods in thin structures segmentation: 1) Our Deep High Frequency (DHiFe) block learns to extract task-dependent HiFe components and adds them to feature maps, achieving great perception of thin structures. 2) Our Latent Residual Denoising (LRD) block progressively weakens task-independent features via hierarchical residuals and learns to fuse HiFe components back to feature maps, further enhancing the thin semantics and weakening the interference of global variation. Extensive experiments on the retinal vessel [1], [2], [3] and Massachusetts road [4] segmentation datasets show great superiority of our HiFeNet.
