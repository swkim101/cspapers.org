Multivariate time series (MTS) prediction is ubiquitous in real-world fields, but MTS data often contains missing values. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using end-to-end models to handle MTS with missing values. To generate features for prediction, existing methods either merge all input dimensions of MTS or tackle each input dimension independently. However, both approaches are hard to perform well because the former usually produce many unreliable features and the latter lacks correlated information. In this paper, we propose a Learning Individual Features (LIFE) framework, which provides a new paradigm for MTS prediction with missing values. LIFE generates reliable features for prediction by using the correlated dimensions as auxiliary information and suppressing the interference from uncorrelated dimensions with missing values. Experiments on two real-world data sets verify the superiority of LIFE to existing state-of-the-art models. The full version of this work can refer to arXiv (2109.14844).
