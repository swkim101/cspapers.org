Rapid and accurate prediction of user preferences is the ultimate goal of todayâ€™s recommender systems. More and more researchers pay attention to multi-behavior recommender systems which utilize the auxiliary types of user-item interaction data, such as page view and add-to-cart to help estimate user preferences. Recently, graph-based methods were proposed to showcase an advanced capability in representation learning and capturing collaborative signals. However, we argue that these methods ignore the intrinsic difference between the two types of nodes in the bipartite graph and aggregate information from neighboring nodes with the same functions. Besides, these models do not fully explore the collaborative signals implied by the meta-path across different types of behavior, which causes a huge loss of the potential semantic information across behaviors. To address the above limitations, we present a unified graph model named SaGCN (short for Semantic-aware Graph Convolutional Networks). Specifically, we construct separate user-user and item-item graphs by meta-path, and apply separate aggregation and transformation functions to propagate user and item information. To perform better semantic propagation, we design a relation composition function and a semantic propagation architecture for heterogeneous collaborative filtering signals learning. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that SaGCN outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art methods in multi-behavior scenarios.
