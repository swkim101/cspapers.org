Generating flow fields (such as pressure and velocity fields) in 3D space is a fundamental task in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), with applications across a vast spectrum of science and engineering problems. An important class of fluid flow problems in CFD is multi-phase flow, where dispersed solid particles are present in the fluid flow. Despite recent developments in deep learning (DL) for CFD applications, current state-of-the-art is still unable to model 3D flow fields, especially in multi-phase flow settings. It is with this goal that we introduce PhyFlow, a novel physics-guided deep learning architecture for modeling 3D multi-phase fluid flows, designed to mimic the popular projection method for solving fluid flows in CFD simulations. We demonstrate that PhyFlow generates high quality flow fields and yields a 49.61% improvement over other state-of-the-art baselines. We also test the quality of PhyFlow based fields by employing them in downstream tasks like particle drag force prediction and demonstrate state-of-the-art results, improving upon the previous best models by 9.89%. Finally, we demonstrate the consistency of PhyFlow predictions with known underlying physics governing equations. Our source code and data are available online *.*tinyurl.com/mjkcrsdw
