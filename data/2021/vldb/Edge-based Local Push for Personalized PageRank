 Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a popular node proximity metric in graph mining and network research. A single-source PPR (SSPPR) query asks for the PPR value of each node on the graph. Due to its importance and wide applications, decades of efforts have been devoted to the efficient processing of SSPPR queries. Among existing algorithms,
 LocalPush
 is a fundamental method for SSPPR queries and serves as a cornerstone for subsequent algorithms. In
 LocalPush
 , a
 push
 operation is a crucial primitive operation, which distributes the probability at a node
 u
 to ALL
 u
 's neighbors via the corresponding edges. Although this
 push
 operation works well on
 unweighted
 graphs, unfortunately, it can be rather inefficient on
 weighted
 graphs. In particular, on
 unbalanced
 weighted graphs where only a few of these edges take the majority of the total weight among them, the
 push
 operation would have to distribute "insignificant" probabilities along those edges which just take the minor weights, resulting in expensive overhead.
 
 
 To resolve this issue, in this paper, we propose the
 EdgePush
 algorithm, a novel method for computing SSPPR queries on weighted graphs.
 EdgePush
 decomposes the aforementioned push operations in
 edge-based push
 , allowing the algorithm to operate at the edge level granularity. As a result, it can flexibly distribute the probabilities according to edge weights. Furthermore, our
 EdgePush
 allows a fine-grained termination threshold for each individual edge, leading to a superior complexity over
 LocalPush.
 Notably, we prove that
 EdgePush
 improves the theoretical query cost of
 LocalPush
 by an order of up to
 O
 (
 n
 ) when the graph's weights are
 unbalanced.
 Our experimental results demonstrate that
 EdgePush
 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of query efficiency on large motif-based and real-world weighted graphs.
