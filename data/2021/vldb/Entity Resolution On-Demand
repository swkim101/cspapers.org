 Entity Resolution (ER) aims to identify and merge records that refer to the same real-world entity. ER is typically employed as an expensive cleaning step on the entire data before consuming it. Yet, determining which entities are useful once cleaned depends solely on the user's application, which may need only a fraction of them. For instance, when dealing with Web data, we would like to be able to filter the entities of interest gathered from multiple sources without cleaning the entire, continuously-growing data. Similarly, when querying data lakes, we want to transform data on-demand and return the results in a timely manner---a fundamental requirement of ELT (
 Extract-Load-Transform
 ) pipelines.
 
 
 We propose
 BrewER
 , a framework to evaluate SQL SP queries on dirty data while progressively returning results as if they were issued on cleaned data.
 BrewER
 tries to focus the cleaning effort on one entity at a time, following an ORDER BY predicate. Thus, it inherently supports
 top-k
 and stop-and-resume execution. For a wide range of applications, a significant amount of resources can be saved. We exhaustively evaluate and show the efficacy of
 BrewER
 on four real-world datasets.
