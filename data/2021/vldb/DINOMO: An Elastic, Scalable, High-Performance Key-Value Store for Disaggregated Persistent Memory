We present Dinomo, a novel key-value store for disaggregated persistent memory (DPM). Dinomo is the first key-value store for DPM that simultaneously achieves high common-case performance, scalability, and lightweight online reconfiguration. We observe that previously proposed key-value stores for DPM had architectural limitations that prevent them from achieving all three goals simultaneously. Dinomo uses a novel combination of techniques such as ownership partitioning, disaggregated adaptive caching, selective replication, and lock-free and log-free indexing to achieve these goals. Compared to a state-of-the-art DPM key-value store, Dinomo achieves at least 3.8X better throughput at scale on various workloads and higher scalability, while providing fast reconfiguration.
