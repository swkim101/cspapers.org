Graph embedding aims at learning a vector-based representation of vertices that incorporates the structure of the graph. This representation then enables inference of graph properties. Existing graph embedding techniques, however, do not scale well to large graphs. While several techniques to scale graph embedding using compute clusters have been proposed, they require continuous communication between the compute nodes and cannot handle node failure. We therefore propose a framework for scalable and robust graph embedding based on the MapReduce model, which can distribute any existing embedding technique. Our method splits a graph into subgraphs to learn their embeddings in isolation and subsequently reconciles the embedding spaces derived for the subgraphs. We realize this idea through a novel distributed graph decomposition algorithm. In addition, we show how to implement our framework in Spark to enable efficient learning of effective embeddings. Experimental results illustrate that our approach scales well, while largely maintaining the embedding quality.
