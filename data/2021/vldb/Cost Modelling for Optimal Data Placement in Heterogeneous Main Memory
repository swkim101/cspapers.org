The cost of DRAM contributes significantly to the operating costs of in-memory database management systems (IMDBMS). Persistent memory (PMEM) is an alternative type of byte-addressable memory that offers --- in addition to persistence --- higher capacities than DRAM at a lower price with the disadvantage of increased latencies and reduced bandwidth. This paper evaluates PMEM as a cheaper alternative to DRAM for storing table base data, which can make up a significant fraction of an IMDBMS' total memory footprint. Using a prototype implementation in the SAP HANA IMDBMS, we find that placing all table data in PMEM can reduce query performance in analytical benchmarks by more than a factor of two, while transactional workloads are less affected. To quantify the performance impact of placing individual data structures in PMEM, we propose a cost model based on a lightweight workload characterization. Using this model, we show how to place data pareto-optimally in the heterogeneous memory. Our evaluation demonstrates the accuracy of the model and shows that it is possible to place more than 75% of table data in PMEM while keeping performance within 10% of the DRAM baseline for two analytical benchmarks.
