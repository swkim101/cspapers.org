 Correlated time series (CTS) forecasting plays an essential role in many cyber-physical systems, where multiple sensors emit time series that capture interconnected processes. Solutions based on deep learning that deliver state-of-the-art CTS forecasting performance employ a variety of spatio-temporal (ST) blocks that are able to model temporal dependencies and spatial correlations among time series. However, two challenges remain. First, ST-blocks are designed manually, which is time consuming and costly. Second, existing forecasting models simply stack the same ST-blocks multiple times, which limits the model potential. To address these challenges, we propose
 AutoCTS
 that is able to automatically identify highly competitive ST-blocks as well as forecasting models with heterogeneous ST-blocks connected using diverse topologies, as opposed to the same ST-blocks connected using simple stacking. Specifically, we design both a micro and a macro search space to model possible architectures of ST-blocks and the connections among heterogeneous ST-blocks, and we provide a search strategy that is able to jointly explore the search spaces to identify optimal forecasting models. Extensive experiments on eight commonly used CTS forecasting benchmark datasets justify our design choices and demonstrate that
 AutoCTS
 is capable of automatically discovering forecasting models that outperform state-of-the-art human-designed models.
