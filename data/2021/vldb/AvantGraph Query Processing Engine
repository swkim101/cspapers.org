 We demonstrate AvantGraph, a graph query processing engine developed by the Database group at TU Eindhoven. Designed for efficient processing of
 both
 subgraph matching and navigational graph queries, AvantGraph encompasses innovation in three key areas: the planner, the cardinality estimator, and the execution engine. We present demonstration scenarios covering a wide range of workloads across diverse domains which (1) provides deep insights into the core challenges of complex graph query processing and (2) showcases corresponding critical optimizations via "under-the-hood" operational insights of AvantGraph's key components.
