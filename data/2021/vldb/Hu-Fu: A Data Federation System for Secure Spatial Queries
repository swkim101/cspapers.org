The increasing concerns on data security limit the sharing of data distributedly stored at multiple data owners and impede the scale of spatial queries over big urban data. In response, data federation systems have emerged to perform secure queries across multiple data owners leveraging secure multi-party computation. However, existing systems are designed for relational data. They are highly inefficient on spatial queries and limited in usability. In this demonstration, we introduce Hu-Fu, the first data federation system for secure spatial queries with high efficiency and usability. Hu-Fu is designed from the perspectives of the query user and the data owner for high usability and decomposes a spatial query into as many plaintext operators and as few secure operators as possible for high efficiency. We demonstrate the deployment and usage of Hu-Fu via cross-company taxi-calling, a popular smart city application.
