We introduce DuckDB-Wasm, a WebAssembly version of the database system DuckDB, to provide fast analytical processing for the Web. DuckDB-Wasm evaluates SQL queries asynchronously in web workers, supports efficient user-defined functions written in JavaScript, and features a browser-agnostic filesystem that reads local and remote data in pages. DuckDB-Wasm outperforms previous data processing libraries for the Web in the TPC-H benchmark at multiple scale factors. We demonstrate the capabilities of an analytical database in the browser using an interactive SQL shell.
