 In-memory databases (IMDBs) have been the backbone of modern systems that demand high throughput and low latency. Because of the cost and volatility of DRAM, IMDBs become incompetent when dealing with workloads that require large data volume and strict durability. The emergence of non-volatile memory (NVM) brings new opportunities for IMDBs to tackle this situation. However, it is non-trivial to build an NVM-based IMDB, due to performance degradation, NVM programming complexity, and other challenges. In this paper, we present
 Tair-PMem
 , an NVM-based enterprise-strength database atop Redis, the most popular IMDB.
 Tair-PMem
 adopts a well-controlled data layout and a
 log-as-user-data
 design to mitigate NVM overheads. It eases the NVM programming complexity by providing a hybrid memory programming toolkit. To better leverage the enterprise-strength features and implementations from Redis,
 Tair-PMem
 retrofits it in a less intrusive way to achieve full compatibility and stability, while retaining its advanced features. With all of the above techniques elaborately implemented,
 Tair-PMem
 satisfies full durability, high throughput, and low latency at the same time.
 Tair-PMem
 has now been publicly available as a cloud service on Alibaba Cloud. To the best of our knowledge,
 Tair-PMem
 is the first cloud service that makes good use of the persistence capability of NVM.
