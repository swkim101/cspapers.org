A database service is required to meet the consistency, performance, and availability goals of modern applications serving a global user-base. Configuring a database deployed across multiple regions such that it fulfills these goals requires significant expertise. In this paper, we describe how CockroachDB makes this easy for developers by providing a high-level declarative syntax that allows expressing data access locality and availability goals through SQL statements. CockroachDB also enables many types of queries on the multiregion database to perform as well as they would in a single-region deployment, due to enhancements to the SQL optimizer, transaction, and replication layers. This paper showcases these features with a comprehensive demonstration scenario tracking a ride-sharing company's journey as they expand their application globally.
