 Entity resolution (ER) is a core data integration problem that identifies pairs of data instances referring to the same real-world entities, and the state-of-the-art results of ER are achieved by deep learning (DL) based approaches. However, DL-based approaches typically require a large amount of labeled training data
 (i.e.
 , matching and non-matching pairs), which incurs substantial manual labeling efforts. In this paper, we introduce
 DADER
 , a hands-off deep ER system through domain adaptation.
 DADER
 utilizes multiple well-labeled source ER datasets to train a DL-based ER model for a new target ER dataset that does not have any labels or with only a few labels. To address the key challenge of domain shift,
 DADER
 judiciously selects labeled entity pairs from the source and then aligns distributions of the source and the target by using six popular domain adaptation strategies.
 DADER
 can also harness the users to gather a few labels for further improvement. We have built
 DADER
 as an open-sourced Python Library with intuitive APIs and demonstrated its utility on supporting hands-off ER in real-world scenarios.
