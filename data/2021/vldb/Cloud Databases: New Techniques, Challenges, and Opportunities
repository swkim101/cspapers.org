As database vendors are increasingly moving towards the cloud data service, i.e., databases as a service (DBaaS), cloud databases have become prevalent. Compared with the early cloud-hosted databases, the new generation of cloud databases, also known as cloud-native databases, seek for higher elasticity and lower cost by developing new techniques, e.g., compute-storage disaggregation and the log is the database. To better harness the power of these cloud databases, it is important to study and compare the pros and cons of their key techniques. In this tutorial, we offer a comprehensive survey of cloud-native databases. Based on various system architectures, we introduce a taxonomy for the state-of-the-art cloud-native OLTP databases and OLAP databases, respectively. We then take a deep dive into their key techniques regarding storage management, transaction processing, analytical processing, data replication, serverless computing, database recovery, and security. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and opportunities.
