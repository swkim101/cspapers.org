 Sketching is a common approach to visually query time series data. However, a recent study reported that sketching a pattern for querying is "often ineffective on its own" in practice due to lack of "representative objects" to facilitate
 bottom-up search.
 In this demonstration, we present a novel
 data-driven
 sketch-based visual query interface (VQI) construction system called SENSOR to alleviate this challenge. Given a time series dataset, SENSOR automatically constructs its VQI by populating different components from the underlying data. Specifically, it discovers and exposes a set of representative objects in the form of
 VST-aware shapelets
 to facilitate query formulation. Such data-driven construction has several potential benefits such as empowering efficient
 top-down
 and
 bottom-up
 search and portability of the interface across different application domains and sources.
