Deep neural networks (DNNs) have grown exponentially in size over the past decade, leaving only those who have massive datacenter-based resources with the ability to develop and train such models. One of the main challenges for the long tail of researchers who might have only limited resources (e.g., a single multi-GPU server) is limited GPU memory capacity compared to model size. The problem is so acute that the memory requirement of training massive DNN models can often exceed the aggregate capacity of all available GPUs on a single server; this problem only gets worse with the trend of ever-growing model sizes. Current solutions that rely on virtualizing GPU memory (by swapping to/from CPU memory) incur excessive swapping overhead. In this paper, we present a new training framework, Harmony, and advocate rethinking how DNN frameworks schedule computation and move data to push the boundaries of training massive models efficiently on a single commodity server. Across various massive DNN models, Harmony is able to reduce swap load by up to two orders of magnitude and obtain a training throughput speedup of up to 7.6x over highly optimized baselines with virtualized memory.
