 Similarity search finds similar objects for a given query object based on a certain similarity metric. Similarity search in metric spaces has attracted increasing attention, as the metric space can accommodate any type of data and support flexible distance metrics. However, a metric space only models a single data type with a specific similarity metric. In contrast, a multi-metric space combines multiple metric spaces to simultaneously model a variety of data types and a collection of associated similarity metrics. Thus, a multi-metric space is capable of performing similarity search over any combination of metric spaces. Many studies focus on indexing a single metric space, while only a few aims at indexing multi-metric space to accelerate similarity search. In this paper, we propose DESIRE, an efficient dynamic cluster-based forest index for similarity search in multi-metric spaces. DESIRE first selects high-quality centers to cluster objects into compact regions, and then employs B
 +
 -trees to effectively index distances between centers and corresponding objects. To support dynamic scenarios, efficient update strategies are developed. Further, we provide filtering techniques to accelerate similarity queries in multi-metric spaces. Extensive experiments on four real datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and scalability of our proposed DESIRE compared with the state-of-the-art multi-metric space indexes.
