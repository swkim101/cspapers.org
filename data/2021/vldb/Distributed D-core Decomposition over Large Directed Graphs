 Given a directed graph
 G
 and integers
 k
 and
 l
 , a D-core is the maximal subgraph
 H
 âŠ†
 G
 such that for every vertex of
 H
 , its in-degree and out-degree are no smaller than
 k
 and
 l
 , respectively. For a directed graph
 G
 , the problem of D-core decomposition aims to compute the non-empty D-cores for all possible values of
 k
 and
 l.
 In the literature, several
 peeling-based
 algorithms have been proposed to handle D-core decomposition. However, the peeling-based algorithms that work in a sequential fashion and require global graph information during processing are mainly designed for
 centralized
 settings, which cannot handle large-scale graphs efficiently in distributed settings. Motivated by this, we study the
 distributed
 D-core decomposition problem in this paper. We start by defining a concept called
 anchored coreness
 , based on which we propose a new H-index-based algorithm for distributed D-core decomposition. Furthermore, we devise a novel concept, namely
 skyline coreness
 , and show that the D-core decomposition problem is equivalent to the computation of skyline corenesses for all vertices. We design an efficient D-index to compute the skyline corenesses distributedly. We implement the proposed algorithms under both vertex-centric and block-centric distributed graph processing frameworks. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the algorithm and message complexities. Extensive experiments on large real-world graphs with billions of edges demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in terms of both the running time and communication overhead.
