Persistent memory (PM) based indexing techniques have been proposed to build fast yet persistent indexes that sit on the memory bus. Over the past decade, numerous techniques have been proposed with various assumptions and different properties (e.g., some of them were proposed before real PM became available), making it hard for researchers and practitioners to gain a comprehensive understanding of the area.
 In this tutorial, we give a comprehensive overview of PM indexing techniques, covering both range and hash indexes. We contrast the designs proposed before and after real PM became available, summarize the common and useful design techniques, and discuss potential future challenges and opportunities in this area.
