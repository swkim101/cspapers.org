In autonomous driving, 3D object detection is es-sential as it provides basic knowledge about the environment. However, as deep learning based 3D detection methods are usually computation intensive, it is challenging to support realtime 3D object detection on edge-computing devices in selfdriving cars with limited computation and memory resources. To facilitate this, we propose a compiler-aware pruning search framework, to achieve real-time inference of 3D object detection on the resource-limited mobile devices. Specifically, a generator is applied to sample better pruning proposals in the search space based on current proposals with their performance, and an evaluator is adopted to evaluate the sampled pruning proposal performance. To accelerate the search, the evaluator employs Bayesian optimization with an ensemble of neural predictors. We demonstrate in experiments that for the first time, the pruning search framework can achieve real-time 3D object detection on mobile (Samsung Galaxy S20 phone) with state-of-the-art detection performance.
