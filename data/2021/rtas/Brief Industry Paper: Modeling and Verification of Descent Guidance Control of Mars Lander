We give an introduction to the MARS toolchain for formal modeling and verification of hybrid systems. It consists of translators from Simulink/Stateflow models to Hybrid Communicating Sequential Processes (HCSP), and tools for simulation, code generation, and deductive verification of an HCSP model. We apply the toolchain to model the descent guidance control phase of the recently launched Tianwen I mars lander, and verify that it correctly controls the velocity of the lander.
