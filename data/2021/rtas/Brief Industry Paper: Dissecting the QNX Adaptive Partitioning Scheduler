The QNX operating system has emerged as a promising candidate as a base operating system for upcoming domain or vehicle integration computers in centralized automotive E/E. In this work, we look deeper in the Adaptive Partitioning Scheduler offered by QNX with the aim of assessing its suitability in providing temporal isolation and guaranteed execution behavior to different applications. With APS, QNX has introduced budget-based scheduling into a mainstream commercial OS and hence deserves merit. However we also found certain drawbacks in the APS scheduler and in order to mitigate the problems caused by them, we propose some guidelines for system designers to configure their systems efficiently.
