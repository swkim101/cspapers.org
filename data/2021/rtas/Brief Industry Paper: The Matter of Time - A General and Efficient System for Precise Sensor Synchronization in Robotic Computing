Time synchronization is a critical task in robotic computing such as autonomous driving. In the past few years, as we developed advanced robotic applications, our synchronization system has evolved as well. In this paper, we first introduce the time synchronization problem and explain the challenges of time synchronization, especially in robotic workloads. Summarizing these challenges, we then present a general hardware synchronization system for robotic computing, which delivers high synchronization accuracy while maintaining low energy and resource consumption. The proposed hardware synchronization system is a key building block in our future robotic products.
