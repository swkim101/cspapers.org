Correctly specifying system requirement verification strategies plays an important role in Real-time embedded and safety-critical systems development. Traditionally, industries are using document-based/textual artefacts to capture system verification strategies in a way that is highly reliant on efficient communications between system requirement engineers and system verification engineers during systems development iterations. This paper describes a Model-Based System Verification Strategy specification framework and Tools used in Rolls-Royce. The contribution of this framework is 1. improving information reusability; 2. reduced risk of system verification and requirement inconsistency and redundancy 3. improved correlation between system requirements and verification artefacts by sharing the same system models 4. automated support for transformation from document-based system verification to model-based verification.
