With the emergence of open data, governments [19, 25], Kaggle [13], OpenML [26], and organizations [2, 20] have started making data available on the web. This data represents an opportunity for Artificial Intelligence (AI) practitioners to accomplish their tasks including but not limited to improving the performance of models in Machine Learning or predicting insights about the future in Scenario Planning. However with the proliferation of available data, finding the most relevant one is time-consuming and cumbersome. Practitioners tend to spend considerable time looking for data to enrich their existing datasets to accomplish their tasks. For instance, in Deep Learning, engineers need a lot of data to train their models [27]. Moreover, they face several problems such as increasing the size of their datasets with similar data or including more features that can contribute to better results [3, 8, 27]. These problems emerge because data lakes are schema-agnostic repositories [30].
