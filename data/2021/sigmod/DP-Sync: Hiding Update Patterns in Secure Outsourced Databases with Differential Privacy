In this paper, we consider privacy-preserving update strategies for secure outsourced growing databases. Such databases allow appendonly data updates on the outsourced data structure while analysis is ongoing. Despite a plethora of solutions to securely outsource database computation, existing techniques do not consider the information that can be leaked via update patterns. To address this problem, we design a novel secure outsourced database framework for growing data, DP-Sync, which interoperate with a large class of existing encrypted databases and supports efficient updates while providing differentially-private guarantees for any single update. We demonstrate DP-Sync's practical feasibility in terms of performance and accuracy with extensive empirical evaluations on real world datasets.
