Real-time outlier detection from a data stream has become increasingly important in the current hyperconnected world. This paper focuses on an important yet unaddressed challenge in continuous outlier detection: the multiplicity and dynamicity of queries. This challenge arises from various contexts of outliers evolving over time, but the state-of-the-art algorithms cannot handle the challenge effectively, as they can only process a fixed set of outlier detection queries for each data point separately. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, abbreviated as MDUAL, based on a new idea called duality-based unified processing. The underlying rationale is to exploit the duality of data and queries so that a group of similar data points are processed together by a group of similar queries incrementally. Two main techniques embodying the idea, data-query grouping and prioritized group processing, are employed. Comprehensive experiments showed that MDUAL runs 216 to 221 times faster while consuming 11 to 13 times less memory than the state-of-the-art algorithms through its efficient and effective handling of the multiplicity-dynamicity challenge.
