How will we work, live, and thrive in the post-pandemic future? The rapid mushrooming of online job markets has been transforming the definition of work and workplaces. After the pandemic, as we "cope with the new normal", the future world of work may change forever and become predominantly virtual. This makes an unprecedented pool of talent available at our beck and calls to work on "gigs" that disband when the job is over; this also is the time of destabilization and changing nature of job security. As scientists, we have a big responsibility and a tremendous opportunity in shaping the Future of Work (FoW) post pandemic, by designing effective platforms that support productive employment, mitigate social costs, and provide an effective and safe learning environment. A research agenda for FoW must mobilize the participation of various scientific, regulatory and miscellaneous stakeholders [10]. We will ask the questions: what is the role of Data Management (DM) in shaping research on FoW? Is now a ripe time to get Economics, Labor Theory, Psychology of Work and AI to help put DM research and technology at the center of research on FoW? Are we at all interested? The panelists will debate two complementary views: A pessimistic view on whether FoW will tend to see humans as machines, robots, or low-level agents and use them in the service of broader AI goals vs. a more optimistic view, where AI and Social Science will help DM to develop technologies that empower humans for future workforce and workplaces.
