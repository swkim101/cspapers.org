Graphs are increasingly being used to model information about entities, their properties, and relationships between entities. Examples include relationships between customers, their product purchases, and inter-relationships between products. Many of these graphs are not static, and operate in dynamic data environments. Large-scale knowledge bases such as DBpedia, Yago, Wikidata, and Amazon product graphs operate in such dynamic environments, where Entities in these temporal graphs are constantly changing. Having accurate and complete information is critical for downstream decision making and fact checking. Data dependencies help us to preserve accuracy of the data and have been well studied for relational data and static graphs. However, the need for FDs is also evident for temporal graphs since they specify the semantic of the data to detect inconsistencies.
