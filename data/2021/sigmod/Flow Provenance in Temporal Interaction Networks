In temporal interaction networks, such as financial transaction networks, vertices model entities which exchange quantities (e.g., money) over time. We study the problem of identifying the origin of the quantities that flow into the vertices of the network over time. We consider various models of flow relay, which are related to different application scenarios and develop corresponding techniques for flow provenance.
