In this paper, we propose the Data Flow Interface (DFI) as a way to make it easier for data processing systems to exploit high-speed networks without the need to deal with the complexity of RDMA. By lifting the level of abstraction, DFI factors out much of the complexity of network communication and makes it easier for developers to declaratively express how data should be efficiently routed to accomplish a given distributed data processing task. As we show in our experiments, DFI is able to support a wide variety of data-centric applications with high performance at a low complexity for the applications.
