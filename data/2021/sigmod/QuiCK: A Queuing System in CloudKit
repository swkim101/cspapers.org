We present QuiCK, a queuing system built for managing asynchronous tasks in CloudKit, Apple's storage backend service. QuiCK stores queued messages along with user data in CloudKit, and supports CloudKit's tenancy model including isolation, fair resource allocation, observability, and tenant migration. QuiCK is built on the FoundationDB Record Layer, an open source transactional DBMS. It employs massive two-level sharding, with tens of billions of queues on the first level (separately storing the queued items for each user of every CloudKit app), and hundreds of queues on a second level (one per FoundationDB cluster used by CloudKit). Our evaluation demonstrates that QuiCK scales linearly with additional consumer resources, effectively avoids contention, provides fairness across CloudKit tenants, and executes deferred tasks with low latency.
