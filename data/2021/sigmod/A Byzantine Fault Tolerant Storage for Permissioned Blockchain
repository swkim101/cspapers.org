The full-replication data storage mechanism, as commonly utilized in existing blockchains, suffers from poor scalability, since it requires every node to preserve a complete copy of the whole block data locally to tolerant potential Byzantine failures. In a hostile environment, the malicious node may discard or tamper data deliberately. Thus, existing distributed storage method, which partitions data into multiple parts and distributes them over all nodes, cannot suit for blockchains. This demonstration showcases BFT-Store, a novel distributed storage engine for blockchains to break full-replication by integrating erasure coding with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol. This demonstration will (\romannumeral1) allow audience members to see how BFT-Store partitions block data over all nodes to reduce the storage occupation of system, and (\romannumeral2) allow audience members to see how BFT-Store recovers blocks under distributed scenario even with Byzantine failure.
