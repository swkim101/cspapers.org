Conflict researchers face many challenges, including (1) how to model conflicts, (2) how to measure them, (3) how to manage their spatio-temporal character, and (4) how to handle a potential abundance of information and explanation. In this paper, we describe an ecosystem of tools designed for use by subject matter experts that addresses these challenges. Three case studies show workflows that are facilitated by this ecosystem.
