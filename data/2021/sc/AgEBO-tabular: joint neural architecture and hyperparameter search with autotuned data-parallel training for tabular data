Developing high-performing predictive models for large tabular data sets is a challenging task. Neural architecture search (NAS) is an AutoML approach that generates and evaluates multiple neural networks with different architectures concurrently to automatically discover an high performing model. A key issue in NAS, particularly for large data sets, is the large computation time required to evaluate each generated architecture. While data-parallel training has the potential to address this issue, a straightforward approach can result in significant loss of accuracy. To that end, we develop AgEBO-Tabular, which combines Aging Evolution (AE) to search over neural architectures and asynchronous Bayesian optimization (BO) to search over hyperparameters to adapt data-parallel training. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on two large predictive modeling tabular data sets from the Exascale Computing Project-CANcer Distributed Learning Environment (ECP-CANDLE).
