We employ our recently developed explicit 2nd-order charge-conservative symplectic electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) scheme in the cylindrical mesh to simulate the whole-volume magnetic confinement toroidal plasmas on the new Sunway supercomputer. From a large-scale simulation of magneticized toroidal plasma with 111.3 trillion particles and 25.7 billion grids, we have obtained a sustained performance exceeding 201.1 PFLOP/s (double precision) with the fastest iteration step achieving 298.2 PFLOP/s (double precision). For the first time, unprecedented high resolution evolution of 6D electromagnetic fully kinetic plasmas based on 2D equilibrium profiles from Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) and designed operation state of China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) are presented, and edge micro-instabilities can be investigated directly. This shows the possibility to study crucial problems and phenomena in the magnetic confinement toroidal plasma directly using the symplectic electromagnetic fully kinetic PIC method on world's leading supercomputers.
