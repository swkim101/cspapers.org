This tutorial presents state-of-the-art research on causal inference from network data in the presence of interference. We start by motivating research in this area with real-world applications, such as measuring influence in social networks and market experimentation. We discuss the challenges of applying existing causal inference techniques designed for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data to relational data, some of the solutions that currently exist and the gaps and opportunities for future research. We present existing network experiment designs for measuring different possible effects of interest. Then we focus on causal inference from observational data, its representation, identification, and estimation. We conclude with research on causal discovery in networks.
