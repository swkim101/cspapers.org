Fraud transactions have been the major threats to the healthy development of e-commerce platforms, which not only damage the user experience but also disrupt the orderly operation of the market. User behavioral data is widely used to detect fraud transactions, and recent works show that accurate modeling of user intentions in behavioral sequences can propel further improvements on the performances. However, most existing methods treat each transaction as an independent data instance without considering the transaction-level interactions accessed by transaction attributes, e.g., information on remark, logistics, payment, device and etc., which may fail to achieve satisfactory results in more complex scenarios. In this paper, a novel heterogeneous transaction-intention network is devised to leverage the cross-interaction information over transactions and intentions, which consists of two types of nodes, namely transaction and intention nodes, and two types of edges, i.e., transaction-intention and transaction-transaction edges. Then we propose a graph neural method coined IHGAT(Intention-aware Heterogeneous Graph ATtention networks) that not only perceives sequence-like intentions, but also encodes the relationship among transactions. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alibaba platform show that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both offline and online modes.
