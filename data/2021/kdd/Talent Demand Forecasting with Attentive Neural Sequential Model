To cope with the fast-evolving business trend, it becomes critical for companies to continuously review their talent recruitment strategies by the timely forecast of talent demand in recruitment market. While many efforts have been made on recruitment market analysis, due to the sparsity of fine-grained talent demand time series and the complex temporal correlation of the recruitment market, there is still no effective approach for fine-grained talent demand forecast, which can quantitatively model the dynamics of the recruitment market. To this end, in this paper, we propose a data-driven neural sequential approach, namely Talent Demand Attention Network (TDAN), for forecasting fine-grained talent demand in the recruitment market. Specifically, we first propose to augment the univariate time series of talent demand at multiple grained levels and extract intrinsic attributes of both companies and job positions with matrix factorization techniques. Then, we design a Mixed Input Attention module to capture company trends and industry trends to alleviate the sparsity of fine-grained talent demand. Meanwhile, we design a Relation Temporal Attention module for modeling the complex temporal correlation that changes with the company and position. Finally, extensive experiments on a real-world recruitment dataset clearly validate the effectiveness of our approach for fine-grained talent demand forecast, as well as its interpretability for modeling recruitment trends. In particular, TDAN has been deployed as an important functional component of intelligent recruitment system of cooperative partner.
