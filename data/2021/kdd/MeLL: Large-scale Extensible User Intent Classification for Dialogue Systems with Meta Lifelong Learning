User intent detection is vital for understanding their demands in dialogue systems. Although the User Intent Classification (UIC) task has been widely studied, for large-scale industrial applications, the task is still challenging. This is because user inputs in distinct domains may have different text distributions and target intent sets. When the underlying application evolves, new UIC tasks continuously emerge in a large quantity. Hence, it is crucial to develop a framework for large-scale extensible UIC that continuously fits new tasks and avoids catastrophic forgetting with an acceptable parameter growth rate. In this paper, we introduce the Meta Lifelong Learning (MeLL) framework to address this task. In MeLL, a BERT-based text encoder is employed to learn robust text representations across tasks, which is slowly updated for lifelong learning. We design global and local memory networks to capture the cross-task prototype representations of different classes, treated as the meta-learner quickly adapted to different tasks. Additionally, the Least Recently Used replacement policy is applied to manage the global memory such that the model size does not explode through time. Finally, each UIC task has its own task-specific output layer, with the attentive summarization of various features. We have conducted extensive experiments on both open-source and real industry datasets. Results show that MeLL improves the performance compared with strong baselines and also reduces the number of total parameters. We have also deployed MeLL on a real-world e-commerce dialogue system AliMe and observed significant improvements in terms of both F1 and the resources usage.
