Recent emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning have been promising enormous economic and societal benefits. While it is desirable to deploy these technologies to Internet-of-Things (IoT) infrastructures in many applications such as medical, energy, transportation, and industrial automation systems, such deployments present daunting challenges in performance, efficiency, and dependability of scaling-up IoT infrastructure, due to the ever-increasing number of edge devices, ever-increasing levels of device and system heterogeneity, and more stringent requirements of reliability, robustness, and security in mission-critical settings. This position paper elaborates the needs for a cross-layer and full hardware/software stack solution for the design and deployment of scalable, secure, and smart mission-critical IoT systems from four different perspectives and research fields. We present a review of recent studies on such issues and identify the potential challenges and gaps, based on which we highlight some important research directions and future works that can be conducted to tackle such challenges.
