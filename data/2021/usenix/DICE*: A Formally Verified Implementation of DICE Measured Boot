Measured boot is an important class of boot protocols that ensure that each
layer of firmware and software in a device's chain of trust is measured, and the
measurements are reliably recorded for subsequent verification. This paper
presents DICE*, a formal specification as well as a formally
verified implementation of
DICE, an industry standard measured boot protocol. DICE* is
proved to be functionally correct, memory-safe, and resistant to timing- and
cache-based side-channels. A key component of DICE*
is a verified certificate creation library for a fragment of
X.509. We have integrated DICE* into the boot firmware of an
STM32H753ZI micro-controller. Our evaluation shows that
using a fully verified implementation has minimal to no effect
on the code size and boot time when compared to an
existing unverified implementation.
