Cache memories form a core topic in computer organization, computer architecture, and operating systems courses that is fundamentally important for understanding the source of and how to mitigate memory latencies in programs. This topic is difficult to teach due to the significant amount of terminology and interacting design parameters and policies. Simulators have been used as a valuable pedagogical tool for visualizing the changes in cache state due to memory accesses; for educational purposes, there are three varieties: command-line, GUI, and online. Command-line simulators tend to have limited visual output and require recompilation. GUI simulators are more visual but require downloading and installation. Online simulators are easily accessible but have the fewest features. We introduce the UW CSE351 Cache Simulator, an interactive, web-based tool that lets users observe the processes and study the fundamental concepts and policies of caching. It is implemented in p5.js, a JavaScript library, and is based on CAMERA, but improves upon the functionality and usability in a number of ways, including web access, a single interface instead of multiple workbenches, the ability to change cache policies (e.g., write and replacement), and a navigable access history. Attendees will be provided a handout with a feature list, references to other cache simulators/visualizers for educational purposes, and example student activities and exercises that use the UW CSE351 Cache Simulator.
