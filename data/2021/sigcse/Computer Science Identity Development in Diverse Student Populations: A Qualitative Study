This qualitative analysis explores the development of Computer Science (CS) identity of university students majoring in CS and students participating in a novel CS minor geared toward students who have traditionally been underrepresented in the field. We examine student perceptions of their CS identity at two critical junctures: pre-CS exposure (initial interest in CS), and during early CS exposure (performance and competence). Findings demonstrate the different paths to CS identity that the groups take, and highlight the importance of the CS educational environment in efforts to diversify the field.
