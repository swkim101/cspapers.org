Programming students often show a reduced level of self-regulation of learning (SRL), which is known to impact their academic success. Interventions can be designed to assist in stimulating SRL, but achieving it is a challenging process for educational stakeholders. In this work, we propose a guideline that aims to support the construction of interventions to foster SRL competence in programming education. The guideline was built upon the collected evidence from a systematic literature review that identified features used to aid effective SRL interventions in the context of programming education. Fifteen studies were analyzed, and the results show the feasibility of several features to support programming learning and SRL development.
