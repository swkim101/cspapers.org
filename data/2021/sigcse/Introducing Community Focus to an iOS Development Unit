Over the past decade we have taught an iOS development unit as an elective. In 2018 this was made core for a particular cohort of students, requiring a shift in focus for the unit towards self-directed learning in order to allow students to progress at their own pace when they had access to a Mac. Part of the self-learning focus involved taking advantage of the strong iOS developer community and providing scaffolded activities for students to practice being part of a developer community. Activities introduced to the unit included reviewing and thinking critically about educational blog posts and video tutorials. More advanced students could create their own blog post or video, and these were shared at the end of semester with all students for feedback. Students who took the option to create their own app were also required to give a presentation to their lab class at the end of semester. Creating an expert profile by creating or writing a blog and speaking at conferences is sought after by software engineering employers and is credited by many developers as crucial for their career. In this talk I will describe how introducing these activities inspired more collaboration within the cohort and fostered a sense of community.
