A key challenge to a data science program is how to tailor its curriculum to accommodate the needs and interests of students with diverse backgrounds. To address this challenge, we propose Proj4X, a model for diversifying the topics and structures of course projects based on student background and interests. Our study shows that the model can greatly foster the collaboration among the students and motivate them in acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills for solving a great variety of real-world problems ranging from COVID-19, CO2 emission, to wildlife diversity.
