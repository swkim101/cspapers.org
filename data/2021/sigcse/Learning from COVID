The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented and agile global shift in the ways that we educate, and in the ways that students consume their learning activities. This necessary paradigm shift has allowed many educators to take a critical look at their teaching styles, and to use technology in innovative ways to create the best experience for their students. Computing is a subject which traditionally, focuses on experiential, in-person activities such as labs, groupwork, and tutorials. COVID-19 has forced educators to reconsider the use of time and catalyzed overnight innovation. Some of these new practices are ones that would be valuable to learn from and carry forward into our post-COVID teaching. This BoF will provide a platform for discussion of what the post-COVID academic landscape might look like, and how we can use lessons learned during this educational shift to improve our practice.
