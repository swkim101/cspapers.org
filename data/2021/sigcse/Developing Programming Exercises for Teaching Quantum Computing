Quantum computing harnesses quantum laws of nature to enable new types of algorithms, not feasible on traditional computers, that may lead to breakthroughs in crucial areas like materials science and chemistry. There is a rapidly growing demand for a quantum workforce educated in the basics of quantum computing, supported by government programs like National Quantum Initiative and regional coalitions and hubs that bring together research institutions, universities, and companies and startups in quantum computing industry. Quantum programming education plays an important role in training the quantum workforce. Learning materials and graded assignments that focus on quantum software engineering are crucial for a modern quantum computing curriculum. This demo shows a variety of programming exercises and assignments that can be used in an introductory course on quantum computing. The materials use Microsoft Quantum Development Kit, an open-source cross-platform toolkit for developing quantum applications using its domain-specific programming language Q#. They cover different aspects of quantum software development, from learning the basic concepts of quantum computing and expressing them in a quantum programming language to implementing basic quantum algorithms to using specialized tools for evaluating and validating quantum programs to running them on quantum hardware using Azure Quantum. In this demo I will also summarize my experience using these assignments in university courses.
