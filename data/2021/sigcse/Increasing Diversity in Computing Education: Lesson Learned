It is recognized that diversity of perspectives results in solutions that serve a broad base. This is critical to the area of computing, which has applications to many areas including science, humanities, finance, as well as foundational work to advance the field of computing. Cultivating an environment that values and promotes diversity, however, is not an easy task. This is especially the case in higher education, with a focus on undergraduate and graduate computing education. In this talk, I will discuss lessons learned from the following CMD-IT programs: University Award, FLIP Alliance, and Academic Careers Workshops. The focus will be on effective strategies and challenges that require community engagement.
