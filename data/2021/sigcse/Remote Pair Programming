Pair programming is routinely used in industry and taught in face-to-face programming classes. Research indicates that it improves self-confidence and students' programming, communication and team working skills. We investigate the technology, barriers, and soft-skill benefits for distance-learning students who pair program with a remote partner online. In one study, students watched two tutors pair programming and then performed a pair programming task remotely with a student partner. Students felt significantly more positive with the latter compared to the former. As universities strive to provide a good student experience during a pandemic, these findings highlight the value of active remote pair programming using standard online communication tools.
