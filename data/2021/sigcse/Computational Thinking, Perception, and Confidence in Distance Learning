One of the key factors for measuring success in distance learning is student interaction with learning materials. Remote instruction has gained substantial traction with the advent of online education, and this attention has increased in the presence of global pandemics. The asynchronous nature of remote learning has deteriorated the quality of education for learners, which calls for the design of novel interactive techniques to promote student engagement. We study the impact of traditional learning tools such as textbooks and videos in contrast with interactive learning media in computational and algorithmic thinking, and investigate students' perception of learning and actual learning comprehension in higher education.
