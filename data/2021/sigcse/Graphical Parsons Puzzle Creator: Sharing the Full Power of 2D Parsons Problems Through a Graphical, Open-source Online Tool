Parsons problems ask students to unscramble lines of code by dragging and dropping them. Du, Luxton-Reilly, and Denny (2020) summarized Parsons problems benefits as being able to (1) "test programming concepts, be it syntax or logic, separately," (2) provide immediate feedback, (3) improve student engagement, and (4) reduce cognitive load. However, one major challenge of implementing Parsons problems is the need to code and host each question. While previous tools have attempted more user-friendly, graphical Parsons creators and even host the resulting problem sets (such as the Parsonizer), they do not leverage the full power of the most ubiquitous Parsons implementation (http://js-parsons.github.io/documentation/) which allows teachers to check resulting variable values and run unit tests. This demo provides an in-depth tutorial on using Codio's open-source graphical interface to generate Parsons problems (https://codio.github.io/parsons-puzzle-ui/) and shows teachers how to host the resulting problem sets on Github for free (https://github.com/codio-content/hosting-parsons-on-github-template). We are actively seeking feedback on how to make this project more usable for educators. 1 Du, Y., Luxton-Reilly, A., & Denny, P. (2020, February). A Review of Research on Parsons Problems.
