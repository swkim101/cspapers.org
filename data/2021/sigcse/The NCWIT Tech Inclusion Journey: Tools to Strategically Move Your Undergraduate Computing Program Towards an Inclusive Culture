In this online workshop, participants will actively explore the new NCWIT Tech Inclusion Journey for Undergraduate Programs? (TIJ-UP), a tool developed by the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) to assist change leader teams with building the inclusive culture needed to attract and retain a more diverse range of students to their undergraduate computing programs [4]. The goal of the session is to empower participants to take the TIJ-UP back to their departments and use it effectively and efficiently. This workshop is appropriate for any post-secondary computing program faculty or staff member working on broadening participation in computing. It is especially useful for department leadership and those developing departmental NSF BPC plans.
