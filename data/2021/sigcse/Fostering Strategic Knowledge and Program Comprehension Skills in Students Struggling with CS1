In order to support students struggling with learning to program, we designed new learning material, around two basic principles from recent research on introductory programming education: propose program comprehension tasks[4] beside writing tasks, and teaching strategic programming knowledge explicitly[5]. Such material may be of interest for high school teachers and academics teaching programming to novices. It was prepared and used in the context of a peer tutoring initiative targeted at undergraduate students of our CS degree program. We look for feedback and possible collaborators from other institutions, in order to carry out a methodologically sound investigation to measure the quality and effectiveness of the instructional material.
