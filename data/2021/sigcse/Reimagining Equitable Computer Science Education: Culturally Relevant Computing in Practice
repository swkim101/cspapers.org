Now more than ever, computer science teaching needs to reflect the interests and passions of the young people it serves. This is particularly true for students in Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities. This panel of thought leaders will offer perspectives and valuable information grounded in research and theoretical literature that cultivate more meaningful, culturally relevant practices in K-12 CS Education. Participants will walk away with insights about the importance of this issue, the literature base, and practical applications for creating equitable CS classrooms and being advocates for positive change in CS classrooms and school communities.
