This poster examines learning to program from three different angles or colour-tinted glasses. These somehow overlapping angles are (1) learning a new language, using principles of second language acquisition, (2) mastering a skill, based on skill acquisition theory and (3) solving problems in a range of contexts, thus frequently requiring both near and far transfer of programming strategies. The goal of this project is to identify effective practice strategies that support multiple perspectives of learning. We approach this goal by exploring any commonalities between these three angles that can have a positive effect on CS1 learning. This analysis has already identified a common factor: the need for repetition and variation in practice. Next steps are to evaluate the diversity in current coding practice and find ways to support more variation.
