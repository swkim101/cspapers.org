As per our observation, Challenge-Based Learning (CBL), despite its excellent outcomes in various scenarios, is insufficient to cover the breadth of topics required by foundational courses. The other challenges faced by CBL are students' lack of background, mismatch of students' course expectations, and conflicting institutional policy requirements. The suggested method in this work combines the strengths of CBL with the traditional methods and can be implemented within a typical 16-week semester course.
