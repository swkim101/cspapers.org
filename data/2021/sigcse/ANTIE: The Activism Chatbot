Nationwide attention towards the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has motivated many individuals to seek resources related to racial equity activism education. Heightened awareness of racially motivated police brutality has highlighted the realities of systemic racism in the United States' institutions and policies. It has also spurred a growing interest in online platforms offering relevant educational resources, thus demonstrating a need for applications specializing in education around BLM and its platform of anti-racism, police brutality, and equity. This research's purpose is to develop a tool that specializes in directing users who may be unsure how to begin educating themselves to relevant resources. We developed ANTIE, the activism chatbot, using the IBM Watson Assistant framework due to its capability of simulating human-like conversations. We further increased the potential for high levels of user engagement by including fun language and emojis. Overall, our project presents ANTIE in beta. The chatbot currently promotes BLM education by providing voting information, relevant news articles, terminology definitions, media recommendations, a directory of local Black-owned businesses, and other resources. We conducted pilot testing with six participants; however, we plan to gather more results via deployment to a larger audience. Our next steps are to evaluate and improve ANTIE by surveying users' levels of engagement and knowledge about racial equity activism after interacting with the chatbot.
