This lightning talk describes the curriculum design approach developed and used to create Artificial Intelligence (AI) curriculum units for a wide range of high school and college students. We describe our design considerations, beginning with developing a student's AI Identity. We have identified four key pillars to focus on when building curricular materials to help develop students? AI identity: AI understanding, using an ethics and societal impact lens, community building, and leadership development. To carry out these four pillars, we use six pedagogical building blocks to design quality curriculum materials. These building blocks include: utilizing active learning and universal design for learning principles, developing students' data literacy and AI impact analysis skills, and exposing students to diverse job descriptions, applications, and role models within the field of AI. These building blocks ensure that, though our curricular materials are developed for different audiences with differing levels of experience with AI or coding, we are able to standardize a high level of pedagogical quality across all materials. These pillars and building blocks have been developed through literature review and discussion with AI/CS researchers and professionals working in AI. In this talk, we will show how these curricula were implemented in three different settings: (1) a pilot collegiate-level workshop, (2) an intensive multi-week high school summer program, and (3) a free online platform openly available to high school teachers and students.
