This study focuses on the effectiveness of parent communication and engagement in an out-of-school (OST) STEM program for Black and Latina middle school girls. Through analysis of email open rates, a post-program survey, and attendance records, we found that our communication was successful in reaching parents, despite a drop in parent participation in online events during the pandemic. Our results suggest that communication efforts should be consistent, personalized, and inclusive. For CS educators interested in engaging families, we propose that a multi-layered communication approach is required to maintain connection with parents, especially during unpredictable circumstances.
