Despite the demand for Computer Science (CS) related jobs that women in computing can join, there has been a decline in the number of women earning a bachelor's degree in the United States from 27% in 1997 to 19% in 2016. To reduce this gap, promote gender diversity in computing and retain students, a mentorship program was created within a computing program in a university with high research activity in the southeastern US. In this program, women undergraduate CS students are paired with corporate mentors for career guidance and support. This study focuses on understanding students' experiences, including transfer students, when participating in this mentorship program. The women transfer students' perspectives are especially critical as there are a limited number of studies highlighting their experiences, which may vary from traditional women students. In spring 2020, we implemented an IRB-approved phenomenology study. We conducted semi-structured interviews with five women undergraduate CS students, among which four were transfer students. The inductive analysis of the data shows that the mentorship program impacted students' personal as well as professional spaces. Within each of these spaces, students are impacted by the program, their mentors, and their peers in the program. The program impacts are presented here.
