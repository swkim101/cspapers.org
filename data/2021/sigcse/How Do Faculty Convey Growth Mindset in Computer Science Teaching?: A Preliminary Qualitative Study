How Do Faculty Convey Growth Mindset in Computer Science Teaching? A Preliminary Qualitative Study Sarah Hug, CERC Contact: hug@colorado.edu Establishing a growth mindset in academic learning is known to influence student outcomes, yet little is known about how faculty communicate their growth mindset beliefs, or how these beliefs translate into classroom practices. Studies of a 'growth mindset pedagogy' exist in K12 learning environments but few have studied how faculty convey messages of malleable intelligence through their teaching. Interviews related to faculty practices were held electronically in April of 2020 via telephone and Zoom, were recorded, and transcribed. All of the data were coded with an eye towards fixed and growth mindset, no matter the direct content of the question being asked. For example, a statement that related to how a faculty member supports struggling students could be coded 'fixed mindset-computing is not for everyone' if the response indicates the instructor might suggest a change in major. Alternatively, if a faculty member stated they would recommend additional practice for the student who was struggling, this would be coded with 'growth mindset- practice and effort.' This pilot study was an initial attempt to understand and document how faculty and instructors' descriptions of their teaching ascribed to two different mindsets in one case, that of a fixed mindset, in which students' intelligence is static, and in the other case that of a growth mindset, in which students can learn with increased effort.
