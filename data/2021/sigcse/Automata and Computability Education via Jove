This demo presents Jove, a new framework that brings the hands-on experience of teaching Automata and Computability through the popular medium of Jupyter notebooks. Jove requires no installation: it can be run straight out of its site https://github.com/ganeshutah/Jove.git by launching a chosen notebook on Google's Colab service. Students can create machines (DFA, Turing machines, etc.) in a simple markdown language, which are then translated into well-laid-out diagrams and animated for the provided user inputs. Jove's extensible animation controls build on Jupyter widgets and include interactive demos of NFA Epsilon-closure, Turing machines that perform tape updates, colored state transitions, etc. Composable commands easily achieve the construction of large machines, allowing the conversion of Regular Expressions to NFA, DFA, and minimal DFA. Python loops can administer tests on student-built machines; more advanced commands help establish formal equivalences of machines. Jove helps introduce Formal Methods through property-checking on automata, Binary Decision Diagrams, and Boolean SAT. The Jove website offers an entire semester of guided assignments (template notebooks) and videos. This demo will introduce Jove through examples that attendees can run merely by having access to a browser.
