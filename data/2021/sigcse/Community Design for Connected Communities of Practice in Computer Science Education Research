In 2017 a project was started to form a connected community of practice (CCOP) of projects funded to conduct computer science education research through a research practice partnership methodology. In this poster, organizers from that CCOP detail strategies to encourage ongoing exchange and collaboration in the community of researchers. Strategies began with offering resources broadly useful to all projects in an early phase of their RPP work. Over time, through surveying participants, a more theme-based strategy to appeal to subsets of the community was employed. The poster explores the themes used in the third year of the project and share attendance and engagement data. Generalizable recommendations for encouraging shared data gathering goals and resource curation are offered for similar communities of practice devoted to researching computer science education, and ideas on how organizers can measure the success of such communities are shared.
