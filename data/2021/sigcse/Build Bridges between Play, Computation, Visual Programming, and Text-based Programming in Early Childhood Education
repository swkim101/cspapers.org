In this poster, we focus on a learning path that can smoothly connect the unplugged activities with the plugged programming ones. Our approach is to provide young children with visual programming and text-based programming materials that are directly associated with the computational logic in some selected children's games or literature stories. We demonstrate this combo-design idea with examples of role-play, Scratch programming, and Python code. Our method could be adapted to any suitable children's activities in different school settings.
