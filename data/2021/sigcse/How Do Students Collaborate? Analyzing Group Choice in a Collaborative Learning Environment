Collaborative learning has been effective and widely adopted in Computer Science education. Existing studies have controlled for group sizes by assigning members to determine the optimal collaboration environment, with some focusing on a peer-programming environment and others observing a wider range of sizes and tasks. We analyzed collaboration trends through an observational study of 189 students in a large upper-level Computer Science algorithms course, which uses a less-constrained collaborative setting. In the course, the collaboration policy encourages students to choose their own groups for each assignment, up to four other students, offering insight into how groups evolve in size and membership when students are given the freedom to self-select. Since each student is required to submit their own individual work, we collected information about the grade and self-reported collaborators of each research participant for nine assignments, including written and coding homework. Our results show that any collaboration improved individual performance on average. For programming assignments, groups of size four were optimal. Across both written and programming assignments, larger groups performed better, including chains of collaboration greater than the course policy allowed. However, sizes 4-5 performed best within the bounds of the policy. We also demonstrate that factors impacting collaboration include homework difficulty, time of grade release, students' relative performance with respect to the class, as well as the homework type.
