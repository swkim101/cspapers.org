Broadening participation in computing among underrepresented groups is important for not only increasing the workforce in computer science careers but also for ensuring that a broad range of stakeholders can contribute to technology development. However, stereotypes and stereotype threat represent a major barrier to underrepresented groups engaging with computer science education. To investigate alternative paths into computational work that sidestep the pressures of stereotypes, we interviewed 22 people working on computational projects in transformative fandom, a community centered on media remix and critique. Our participants--primarily women, people of color, and/or LGBTQ+ people--described a set of stereotypes about computing that prevented them from seeing their own highly technical work as computational. However, participants also described projects that not only taught them computing skills but also opened up alternative pathways for involvement in computer science. We draw on these findings to provide recommendations for how educators and professionals might break down stereotypes and incorrect expectations to increase underrepresented groups? involvement and confidence in computer science.
