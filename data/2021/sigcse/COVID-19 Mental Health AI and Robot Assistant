COVID-19 is putting our mental health at risk since it has been proven stressful for plenty of people. Fear and anxiety about a new disease or death of a percentage of a population can be overwhelming for adults and the young generation. Moreover, self-quarantine or isolation can be stressful for individuals as well. Therapists are not available around the clock to follow up with their patients' mental health issues. This project proposes Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) and AI chatbots that can assist people with COVID-19 anxiety. SARs and chatbots have been proven useful for treating the anxiety problem, we will explore how SARs and chatbots can be more efficient to assist COVID-19 anxiety patients. In this project, we have designed Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) and AI chatbots to help people in coping with their mental stress or anxiety. SARs and AI chatbots can provide specific therapy and counseling assistance, such as Cognitive Behavioral, and Immersion Therapy Assistance to specific groups of people, including nursing home adults or the young generation who may be at risk or suffering from COVID-19 anxiety.
