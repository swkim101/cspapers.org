The goal of the session is to help attendees who are committed to diversity and inclusion learn to talk about different dimensions of identity (e.g., race, class, gender, sex, sexuality, etc.). The landscape of terms is always changing and we want SIGCSE attendees to feel more comfortable using current language to talk about issues related to diversity and inclusion. This special session will include eight short videos, individual reflection, and a Q&A with presenters. This is an expansion of a special session held at the NCWIT Summit in 2019; it was well received and we hope to offer it to the larger SIGCSE audience. The format also lends itself to attendees sharing the videos and discussions with their colleagues after SIGCSE, which are available at http://ncwit.org/intersectionality-videos
