Although they might initially think otherwise, students can make positive societal impacts through their programming skills, even as early as their introductory programming courses. This paper describes a culminating first-year experience where student programming teams are paired with clients majoring in a doctor of pharmacy program to develop software applications in support of the clients' community-focused educational outreach activities on the hazards involving the use of electronic cigarettes. In the process, the programming students are exposed to various concepts beyond the expected coverage of technical competencies, focusing on ways to deliver meaningful value to others from an entrepreneurial mindset perspective. Positive feedback and data gathered from student surveys, course evaluations, alumni emails, and client comments indicates that, through this service-learning focused term project, programming students learn valuable software development and personal communication skills that will carry them beyond this course and into their professional lives.
