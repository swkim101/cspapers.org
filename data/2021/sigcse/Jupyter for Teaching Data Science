A recent evolution of cloud-based tools creates an easy and powerful way for students to access the industry standard data science tools from within a browser window. Jupyter notebooks were originally developed for sharing of scientific results and reproducible open science. However, when delivered through a cloud-based server, they have huge benefits for teaching, including removing the need to install any software locally or require any specific machine to be used by students. UC Berkeley has extensive experience teaching via Jupyter, including the popular introductory Data 8 course, small Data Science Modules in non- Data Science classes, and advanced work in the Data 100 and Data 102 ( Machine Learning) classes. There is a library of OER curricular materials to share between institutions. In addition, Multiple languages and interfaces can be served, from Jupyter in multiple languages, Rstudio, and even a Linux desktop, as well as auto-grading approaches. We are interested to share experiences across institutions utilizing this approach. The use of teaching Jupyterhubs to date, both for introductory to Data Science courses, as well as more advanced topics is growing rapidly. We would like to have a conversation about how to use Jupyterhubs and teaching Jupyter notebooks from a variety of instructors and institutions. We are also interested in how to provide these types of resources to additional educational settings who may be more resource constrained.
