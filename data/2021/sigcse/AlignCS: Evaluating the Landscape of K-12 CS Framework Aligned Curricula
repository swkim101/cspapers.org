Computer science education has witnessed an explosion in curriculum options available for K12 teachers and students to engage with in the last 5 years. At the same time, a team of community members worked for a year to produce the K-12 CS Framework, a list of grade-appropriate CS concepts for inclusion in the academic preparation of all students in grades K-12 in the United States. With a rapidly expanding content pool, the CS Education community must be able to identify gaps in content provided to achieve high quality. In this poster we present a landscape of curriculum from the CSforALL curriculum portal and the relative alignments to concepts and grade bands given in the K-12 CS Framework. Through discussion of these data we hope to highlight areas where future curriculum may be needed, and where current curriculum offerings have focused. Data presented in this poster will look at curricula concentrations both by grade band, and by framework concept area including computing systems, networks and the internet, data and analysis, algorithms and programming, and impacts of computing.
