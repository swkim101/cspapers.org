With many Universities and Institutions moving toward online learning during the pandemic, content delivery and assessment become a new challenge for many educators. It comes as no surprise that many tools aimed at delivering computer-based assessments have become popular and are fields of active research. Members of the ACE Lab at UC Berkeley are creating question generators for computer science classes on a platform called PrairieLearn, to generate different randomized variants of questions. This poster discusses our team's approach to question variant categorization, which we believe would be useful metadata for other educators reusing our questions or generating their own.
