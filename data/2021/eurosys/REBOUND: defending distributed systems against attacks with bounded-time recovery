This paper shows how to use bounded-time recovery (BTR) to defend distributed systems against non-crash faults and attacks. Unlike many existing fault-tolerance techniques, BTR does not attempt to completely mask all symptoms of a fault; instead, it ensures that the system returns to the correct behavior within a bounded amount of time. This weaker guarantee is sufficient, e.g., for many cyber-physical systems, where physical properties - such as inertia and thermal capacity - prevent quick state changes and thus limit the damage that can result from a brief period of undefined behavior. We present an algorithm called REBOUND that can provide BTR for the Byzantine fault model. REBOUND works by detecting faults and then reconfiguring the system to exclude the faulty nodes. This supports very fine-grained responses to faults: for instance, the system can move or replace existing tasks, or drop less critical tasks entirely to conserve resources. REBOUND can take useful actions even when a majority of the nodes is compromised, and it requires less redundancy than full fault-tolerance.
