There is a need to summarize bug reports as they can become long due to many comments from conversations between developers and various DevOps tools. Although automated approaches to bug report summarization have been developed, we believe they aim at the wrong target - getting as close as possible to a gold-standard summary. Instead, researchers should create automated bug report annotation approaches that allow project members to create summaries based on their task-specific information needs. We present such an approach.
