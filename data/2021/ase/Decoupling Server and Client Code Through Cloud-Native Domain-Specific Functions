Simple domain-specific graphical languages and libraries can empower a variety of users to create application behavior and logic. However, it remains challenging to produce and maintain a heterogeneous set of client applications based on these descriptions, as each client typically requires the developers to both understand and embed the domain-specific logic. This is because application logic must be encoded to some extent in both the server and client sides.In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, which allows the specification of application logic to reside solely on the cloud. In our system, reusable application components are assembled on the cloud in different logical chains and the client is solely concerned with how data is displayed and gathered from users. In this way, the chaining of requests and responses is done by the cloud and the client side has no knowledge of the application logic. This means that the experts in the domain build modular cloud components, arrange them in logical chains, generate a simple user interface, and later leave it to client-side developers to customize the presentation.
