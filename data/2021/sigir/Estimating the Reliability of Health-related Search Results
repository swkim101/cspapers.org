Determining reliability of online data is a challenge that has recently received increasing attention. In particular, unreliable health-related content has become pervasive during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main objective of this Ph.D. thesis is to study how end-users judge the correctness and credibility of online content and provide them with a series of tools to assist them in assessing content reliability. To that end, we need to determine which sources of evidence may help to better assess the reliability of health-related online content, and how to combine them learning. Finally, I will also study which presentation aspects might help end-users to better assess reliability since previous research has proved that the format and layout of the information items, combined with user-based biases, influence their final assessments.
