Millions of trademarks were registered last year in China, and thousands of applications are submitted daily. A trademark must be unique in the category it belongs to. Therefore, each new trademark application needs to be checked against all the existing ones in its category. A trademark can be a text string (characters, words or phrases), a figure (symbol or design), or both. In this study, we focus on the textual trademark in Chinese, and propose a model for finding similar trademarks for a given one. This neural network model exploits the semantic, phonetic and visual similarities between two textual trademarks. We evaluated our model based on a dataset that were built from the real trademark application data. Our evaluation shows that the proposed model outperforms other approaches.
