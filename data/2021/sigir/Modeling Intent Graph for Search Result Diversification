Search result diversification aims to offer diverse documents that cover as many intents as possible. Most existing implicit diversification approaches model diversity through the similarity of document representation, which is indirect and unnatural. To handle the diversity more precisely, we measure the similarity of documents by their similarity of the intent coverage. Specifically, we build a classifier to judge whether two different documents contain the same intent based on the document's content. Then we construct an intent graph to present the complicated relationship of documents and the query. On the intent graph, documents are connected if they are similar, while the query and the document are gradually connected based on the document selection result. Then we employ graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to update the representation of the query and each document by aggregating its neighbors. By this means, we can obtain the context-aware query representation and the intent-aware document representations through the dynamic intent graph during the document selection process. Furthermore, these representations and intent graph features are fused into diversity features. Combined with the traditional relevance features, we obtain the final ranking score that balances the relevance and the diversity. Experimental results show that this implicit diversification model significantly outperforms all existing implicit diversification methods, and it can even beat the state-of-the-art explicit models.
