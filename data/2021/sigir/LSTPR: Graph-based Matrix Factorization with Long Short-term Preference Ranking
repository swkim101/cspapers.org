Considering the temporal order of user-item interactions for recommendation forms a novel class of recommendation algorithms in recent years, among which sequential recommendation models are the most popular approaches. Although, theoretically, such fine-grained modeling should be beneficial to the recommendation performance, these sequential models in practice greatly suffer from the issue of data sparsity as there are a huge number of combinations for item sequences. To address the issue, we propose LSTPR, a graph-based matrix factorization model that incorporates both high-order graph information and long short-term user preferences into the modeling process. LSTPR explicitly distinguishes long-term and short-term user preferences and enriches the sparse interactions via random surfing on the user-item graph. Experiments on three recommendation datasets with temporal user-item information demonstrate that the proposed LSTPR model achieves significantly better performance than the seven baseline methods.
