Medical triage chatbot is widely used in pre-diagnosis by asking symptom and medical history-related questions. Information collected from patients through an online chatbot system is often incomplete and imprecise, and thus it's essentially hard to achieve precise triaging. In this paper, we propose Multi-relational Hyperbolic Diagnosis Predictor (MHDP) --- a novel multi-relational hyperbolic graph neural network-based approach, to build a disease predictive model. More specifically, in MHDP, we generate a heterogeneous graph consisting of symptoms, patients, and diagnoses nodes, and then derive node representations by aggregating neighborhood information recursively in the hyperbolic space. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed MHDP approach surpasses state-of-the-art baselines.
