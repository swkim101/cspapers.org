Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in many applications (e.g. recommender systems). Recently deep learning based models have been proposed and successfully applied for CTR prediction by focusing on feature interaction or user interest based on the item-to-item relevance between user behaviors and candidate item. However, these existing models neglect the user-to-user relevance between the target user and those who like the candidate item, which can reflect the preference of target user. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep User Match Network (DUMN) which measures the user-to-user relevance for CTR prediction. Specifically, in DUMN, we design a User Representation Layer to learn a unified user representation which contains user latent interest based on user behaviors. Then, User Match Layer is designed to measure the user-to-user relevance by matching the target user and those who have interacted with candidate item and modeling their similarities in user representation space. Extensive experimental results on three public real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of DUMN compared with state-of-the-art methods.
