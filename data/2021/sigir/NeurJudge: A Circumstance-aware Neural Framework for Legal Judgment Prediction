Legal Judgment Prediction is a fundamental task in legal intelligence of the civil law system, which aims to automatically predict the judgment results of multiple subtasks, such as charge, law article, and term of penalty prediction. Existing studies mainly focus on the impact of the entire fact description on all subtasks. They ignore the practical judicial scenario, where judges adopt circumstances of crime (i.e., various parts of the fact) to decide judgment results. To this end, in this paper, we propose a circumstance-aware legal judgment prediction framework (i.e., NeurJudge) by exploring circumstances of crime. Specifically, NeurJudge utilizes the results of intermediate subtasks to separate the fact description into different circumstances and exploits them to make the predictions of other subtasks. In addition, considering the popularity of confusing verdicts (i.e., charges and law articles), we further extend NeurJudge to a more comprehensive framework which is denoted by NeurJudge+. Particularly, NeurJudge+ utilizes a label embedding method to incorporate the semantics of labels (i.e., charges and law articles) into facts to generate more expressive fact representations for confusing verdicts problems. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks.
