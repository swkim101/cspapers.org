Probability Ranking Principle (PRP)[31], which assumes that each document has a unique and independent probability to satisfy a particular information need, is one of the fundamental principles for ranking. Traditionally, heuristic ranking features and well-known learning-to-rank approaches have been designed by following the PRP principle. Recently, neural IR models, which adopt deep learning to enhance the ranking performances, also obey the PRP principle. Though it has been widely used for nearly five decades, in-depth analysis shows that PRP is not an optimal principle for ranking, due to its independent assumption that each document should be independent of the rest candidates. Counter examples include pseudo relevance feedback[24], interactive information retrieval[46], search result diversification[10] etc. To solve the problem, researchers recently proposed to model the dependencies among the documents during the designing of ranking models. A number of ranking models have been proposed and state-of-the-art ranking performances have been achieved. This tutorial aims to give a comprehensive survey on these recently developed ranking models that go beyond the PRP principle. The tutorial tries to categorize these models based on their intrinsic assumptions: assuming that the documents are independent, sequentially dependent, or globally dependent. In this way, we expect the researchers focusing on ranking in search and recommendation can have a novel angle of view on the designing of ranking models, and therefore can stimulate new ideas on developing novel ranking models.
