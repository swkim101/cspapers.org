The use of simulation techniques is not foreign to information retrieval. In the past, simulation has been employed, for example, for constructing test collections and for model performance prediction and analysis in a broad array of information access scenarios. Nevertheless, a standardized methodology for performance evaluation via simulation has not yet been developed. The goal of this workshop is to create a forum for researchers and practitioners to promote methodology development and more widespread use of simulation for evaluation by: (1) identifying problem settings and application scenarios; (2) sharing tools, techniques, and experiences; (3) characterizing potentials and limitations; and (4) developing a research agenda.
