Information retrieval plays a crucial role in the patent domain. With the success of deep learning (DL) in other domains, patent practitioners and researchers are increasingly developing DL-based approaches to support experts in the patenting process or to automate processes for patent analysis. AI-enhanced information retrieval systems can improve patent search but also require lots of annotated data. When working with patent data, particular challenges arise that call for adaption and novel approaches of general IR and AI methods. with this workshop series we want to establish a two-way communication channel between industry and academia from relevant fields in information retrieval, such as natural language processing (NLP), text and data mining (TDM), and semantic technologies (ST), in order to explore and transfer new knowledge, methods and technologies for the benefit of industrial applications as well as support interdisciplinary research in applied sciences forthe intellectual property (IP) and neighbouring domains.
