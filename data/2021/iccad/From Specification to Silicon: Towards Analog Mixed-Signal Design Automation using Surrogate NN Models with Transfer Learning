We propose a complete analog mixed-signal circuit design flow from specification to silicon with minimum human-in-the-loop interaction, and verify the flow in a 12nm FinFET CMOS process. The flow consists of three key elements: neural network (NN) modeling of the parameterized circuit component, a search algorithm based on NN models to determine its sizing, and layout automation. To reduce the required training data for NN model creation, we utilize transfer learning to improve the NN accuracy from a relatively small amount of post-layout/silicon data. To prove the concept, we use a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) as a test vehicle and demonstrate that our design methodology can accurately model the circuit and generate designs with a wide range of specifications. We show that circuit sizing based on the transfer learned NN model from silicon measurement data yields the most accurate results.
