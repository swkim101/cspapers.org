Functional ECO is an essential solution in the VLSI design flow. The technique is to realize the functional changes with a minimal patch netlist in the gate-level netlist. As the increasing of the design complexity, functional ECO becomes more and more difficult to generate a minimal patch. ICCAD 2021 CAD contest calls for a feasible and efficient ECO algorithm with behavioral change guidance. More than ordinary functional ECO problems, the RTL designs are provided. Contestants can utilize the behavioral change in RTL designs to minimize the patch for G1.
