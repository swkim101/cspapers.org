Logic locking aims to prevent intellectual property (IP) piracy and unauthorized overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs). However, initial logic locking techniques were vulnerable to the Boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based attacks. In response, researchers proposed various SAT-resistant locking techniques such as point function-based locking and symmetric interconnection (SAT-hard) obfuscation. We focus on the latter since point function-based locking suffers from various structural vulnerabilities. The SAT-hard logic locking technique, InterLock [1], achieves a unified logic and routing obfuscation that thwarts state-of-the-art attacks on logic locking. In this work, we propose a novel link prediction-based attack, UNTANGLE, that successfully breaks InterLock in an oracle-less setting without having access to an activated IC (oracle). Since InterLock hides selected timing paths in key-controlled routing blocks, UNTANGLE reveals the gates and interconnections hidden in the routing blocks upon formulating this task as a link prediction problem. The intuition behind our approach is that ICs contain a large amount of repetition and reuse cores. Hence, UNTANGLE can infer the hidden timing paths by learning the composition of gates in the observed locked netlist or a circuit library leveraging graph neural networks. We show that circuits withstanding SAT-based and other attacks can be unlocked in seconds with 100% precision using UNTANGLE in an oracle-less setting. UNTANGLE is a generic attack platform (which we also open source [2]) that applies to multiplexer (MUX)-based obfuscation, as demonstrated through our experiments on ISCAS-85 and ITC-99 benchmarks locked using InterLock and random MUX-based locking.
