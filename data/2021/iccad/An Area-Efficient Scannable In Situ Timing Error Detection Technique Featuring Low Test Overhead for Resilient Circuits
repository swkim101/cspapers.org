Timing error detection is a key technique for resilient circuits to explore the timing margins, yet it hinders the scan shift operations and increases the excessive test overhead. In this paper, we propose an area-efficient scannable in situ timing error detection technique consisting of a lightweight scannable error-detection cell and propagation logics, featuring low design-for-test effort and test overhead. The proposed error-detection cell fully reuses its main and shadow latches to construct the latch-based error-detection structure in normal mode, or the flip-flop-based datapath in scan mode. Therefore, it not only offers the time-borrowing ability to lower the correction overheads, but also supports the scan shift operations and detection logic tests. Besides, the dependency of error signal generation on the critical path sensitization is eliminated by configuring input and clock signals of error propagation logics, and thereby the detection and propagation logic can be tested easily. Benefiting from the technique, a set of test methods is presented with lower test pattern scales and test cycle overheads. As compared with previous works, the proposed cell saves at least 30.5% area overhead. Besides, experimental results across several benchmark circuits show that 116x of test patterns, 232x of static test cycles, and 26x of at-speed test cycles are saved on average, proving the effectiveness of the proposed technique for the design-for-test requirement.
