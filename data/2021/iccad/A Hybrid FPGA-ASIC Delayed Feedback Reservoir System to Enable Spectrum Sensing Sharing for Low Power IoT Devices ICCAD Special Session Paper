The delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) network is a delay-dynamic architecture that incorporates time in its training and inference. This quality enables DFR networks to proficiently model time series in a scalable architecture with only one nonlinear neuron. Previous studies have highlighted the accuracy and energy efficiency of DFR networks in ASIC implementations; however, these approaches are limited by hardcoded weights and static reservoir architectures. In this work, we introduce a hybrid FPGA-ASIC DFR system that combines the flexibility of a FPGA platform with the energy efficiency of an ASIC. To be specific, the FPGA allows for dynamic reconfiguration and training of the readout weights during runtime, while the ASIC provides an analog activation function for the single neuron. The accuracy and energy consumption of the introduced system is demonstrated for the applications of NARMA10 as well as MIMO spectrum sensing which is a critical component of dynamic spectrum sharing/access for 5G/beyond-5G systems. Results showcase the potential to enable on-board intelligence for future wireless systems, especially for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in low-power environments.
