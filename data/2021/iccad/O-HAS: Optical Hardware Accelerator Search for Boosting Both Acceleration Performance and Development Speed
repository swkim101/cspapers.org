The recent breakthroughs and prohibitive complexities of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have excited extensive interest in domain specific DNN accelerators, among which optical DNN accelerators are particularly promising thanks to their unprecedented potential of achieving superior performance-per-watt. However, the development of optical DNN accelerators is much slower than that of electrical DNN accelerators. One key challenge is that while many techniques have been developed to facilitate the development of electrical DNN accelerators, techniques that support or expedite optical DNN accelerator design remain much less explored, limiting both the achievable performance and the innovation development of optical DNN accelerators. To this end, we develop the first-of-its-kind framework dubbed O-HAS, which for the first time demonstrates automated Optical Hardware Accelerator Search for boosting both the acceleration efficiency and development speed of optical DNN accelerators. Specifically, our O-HAS consists of two integrated enablers: (1) an O-Cost Predictor, which can accurately yet efficiently predict an optical accelerator's energy and latency based on the DNN model parameters and the optical accelerator design; and (2) an O-Search Engine, which can automatically explore the large design space of optical DNN accelerators and identify the optimal accelerators (i.e., the micro-architectures and algorithm-to-accelerator mapping methods) in order to maximize the target acceleration efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies consistently validate the effectiveness of both our O-Cost Predictor and O-Search Engine as well as the excellent efficiency of O-HAS generated optical accelerators.
