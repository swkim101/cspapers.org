Autonomous driving in a pedestrian zone is a challenging task. Technische Universitaet Kaiserslautern (TUK) is currently researching autonomous driving on the university campus for elderly or disabled people. This paper presents a novel campus dataset from the TUK campus, recorded over the span of one year for an autonomous bus project. John Deereâ€™s Gator X855D is used for the work which is equipped with an inertial GPS navigation system, stereo cameras, monocular camera, and lidar sensors. For pedestrian safety during autonomous driving, the sensors are attached to capture the view of all four directions. Each sensor is calibrated with respect to the rear axle center of the vehicle and the intrinsic/extrinsic calibration values are provided. Moreover, the loop closure is performed in every data sequence. Several pose estimation and deep learning techniques are implemented to validate the provided data. The dataset is publicly available4.
