This paper reports a novel optical localization method, including both the hardware design and algorithm design, to track mobile Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The method relies on a circle-shaped blinking LED marker installed on the UAV and uses a single Dynamic Vision Sensing (DVS) camera to sense the temporal difference of the video streams. A temporal-filtering algorithm processes the video stream and detects the target marker by filtering out the background image. The triangulation-based spatial localization algorithm captures the trace of the target with the help of the prior knowledge of the physical size of the marker. The proposed system was evaluated in flight tests and compared with ground truth data provided by a motion capture system. The proposed system provides a simple and accurate localization solution for UAV tracking with a low computing overhead.
