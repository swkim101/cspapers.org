Bladed tools such as jigsaws are common tools for wood workers on job-sites and in workshops, but do not currently have sufficient autonomous hardware or path planning algorithms to enable automation. Here we present a system of an autonomous robot and a path planning algorithm for automating jigsaw operations. The robot can drill holes, insert the jigsaw, and cut plywood. Our algorithm converts complex shapes into paths for the jigsaw, drill holes, and traversal movements for the robot. The algorithm decomposes input shapes into cuttable sections and determines possible locations for drilling entry holes for inserting the blade. We cast the drill hole problem as a set coverage problem with a trade-off between number of holes and cutting distance. We characterize the algorithm on a series of shapes and determined the algorithm found valid solutions. We executed an example on the robot to demonstrate the end-to-end system.
