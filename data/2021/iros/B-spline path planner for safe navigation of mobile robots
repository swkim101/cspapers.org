We propose a 2D path planning algorithm in a non-convex workspace defined as a sequence of connected convex polytopes. The reference path is parameterized as a B-spline curve, which is guaranteed to entirely remain within the workspace by exploiting the local convexity property and by formulating linear constraints on the control points of the B-spline. The novelties of the paper lie in the use of the equivalent BÃ©zier representation of the B-spline curve, which significantly reduces the conservatism in the local convexity bound and in the integration of these constraints into a convex quadratic optimization problem, which minimizes the curve length. The algorithm is successfully validated in both simulations and experiments, by providing obstacle-free reference paths on real occupancy grid maps obtained from the laser scan data of a mobile robot platform.
