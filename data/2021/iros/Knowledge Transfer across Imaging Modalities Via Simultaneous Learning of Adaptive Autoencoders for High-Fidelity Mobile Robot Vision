Enabling mobile robots for solving challenging and diverse shape, texture, and motion related tasks with high fidelity vision requires the integration of novel multimodal imaging sensors and advanced fusion techniques. However, it is associated with high cost, power, hardware modification, and computing requirements which limit its scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel Simultaneously Learned Auto Encoder Domain Adaptation (SAEDA)-based transfer learning technique to empower noisy sensing with advanced sensor suite capabilities. In this regard, SAEDA trains both source and target auto-encoders together on a single graph to obtain the domain invariant feature space between the source and target domains on simultaneously collected data. Then, it uses the domain invariant feature space to transfer knowledge between different signal modalities. The evaluation has been done on two collected datasets (LiDAR and Radar) and one existing dataset (LiDAR, Radar and Video) which provides a significant improvement in quadruped robot-based classification (home floor and human activity recognition) and regression (surface roughness estimation) problems. We also integrate our sensor suite and SAEDA framework on two real-time systems (vacuum cleaning and Mini-Cheetah quadruped robots) for studying the feasibility and usability.
