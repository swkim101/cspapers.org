In this paper, we aim to recognize function points of category-agnostic objects and perform object manipulation. To recognize function points of various shapes, it is necessary to train with a large amount of training data. Also, it is necessary to take into account not only visual information but also physics and interaction between objects. To solve these problems, we are working on the automatic generation of training data by detecting function points from a physical simulation. In the proposed system, we add simulation with target task operation and goal state, which allows a robot to acquire the target function point recognizer. We also use GAN to generate various random shapes and render them with random domains, and train Deep Neural Networks on these data. These enable the robot to recognize function points of unseen objects in the real world and realize manipulation.
