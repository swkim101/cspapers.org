Traditional imitation learning provides a set of methods and algorithms to learn a reward function or policy from expert demonstrations. Learning from demonstration has been shown to be advantageous for navigation tasks as it allows for machine learning non-experts to quickly provide information needed to learn complex traversal behaviors. However, a minimal set of demonstrations is unlikely to capture all relevant information needed to achieve the desired behavior in every possible future operational environment. Due to distributional shift among environments, a robot may encounter features that were rarely or never observed during training for which the appropriate reward value is uncertain, leading to undesired outcomes. This paper proposes a Bayesian technique which quantifies uncertainty over the weights of a linear reward function given a dataset of minimal human demonstrations to operate safely in dynamic environments. This uncertainty is quantified and incorporated into a risk averse set of weights used to generate cost maps for planning. Experiments in a 3-D environment with a simulated robot show that our proposed algorithm enables a robot to avoid dangerous terrain completely in two out of three test scenarios and accumulates a lower amount of risk than related approaches in all scenarios without requiring any additional demonstrations.
