Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have been widely applied for robotic manipulations via sim-to-real transfer, typically with proprioceptive and visual information. However, the incorporation of tactile sensing into RL for contact-rich tasks lacks investigation. In this paper, we model a tactile sensor in simulation and study the effects of its feedback in RL-based robotic control via a zero-shot sim-to-real approach with domain randomization. We demonstrate that learning and controlling with feedback from tactile sensor arrays at the gripper, both in simulation and reality, can enhance grasping stability, which leads to a significant improvement in robotic manipulation performance for a door opening task. In real-world experiments, the door open angle was increased by 45% on average for transferred policies with tactile sensing over those without it.
