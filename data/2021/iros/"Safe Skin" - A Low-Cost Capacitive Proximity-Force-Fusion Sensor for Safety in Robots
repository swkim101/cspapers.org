This paper presents the design and evaluation of the low-cost capacitive proximity-force-fusion sensor "safe skin", which can measure simultaneously the proximity of humans as well as the contact force. It was designed such that the force and proximity sensing functions can work concurrently without interfering with each other. Moreover, active shielding, on-chip digitization and ground isolation are implemented for the sensor to minimize the influence from stray capacitance and electromagnetic interference (EMI) from the environment, which ensures that the sensor has a high system robustness for industrial applications. The prototype version has the capability of detecting a grounded human hand sized object from a distance of 400 mm. Moreover, forces in the range of 5 to 40 N can be measured, with 43.7% hysteresis and 6.7% nonlinearity. Due to its sensing characteristics, when used on a robot, the sensor could be used to ensure the safety of nearby humans in the future. The sensor could also potentially be used as an interface for human-robot interaction (HRI).
