Model-free reinforcement learning has become a viable approach for vision-based robot control. However, sample complexity and adaptability to domain shifts remain persistent challenges when operating in high-dimensional observation spaces (images, LiDAR), such as those that are involved in autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework by which a policy’s observations are augmented with robust attention representations in the latent space to guide the agent’s attention during training. Our method encodes local and global descriptors of the augmented state representations into a compact latent vector, and scene dynamics are approximated by a recurrent network that processes the latent vectors in sequence. We outline two approaches for constructing attention maps; a supervised pipeline leveraging semantic segmentation networks, and an unsupervised pipeline relying only on classical image processing techniques. We conduct our experiments in simulation and test the learned policy against varying seasonal effects and weather conditions. Our design decisions are supported in a series of ablation studies. The results demonstrate that our state augmentation method both improves learning efficiency and encourages robust domain adaptation when compared to common end-to-end frameworks and methods that learn directly from intermediate representations.
