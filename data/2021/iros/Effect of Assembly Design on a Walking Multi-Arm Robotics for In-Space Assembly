Robotic In-space assembly (ISA) is the next step to building larger and more permanent structures in orbit. Robotic ISA offers a unique opportunity for engineers to design the robotic system and the structure at the same time. ISA structures can be optimized to minimize weight or the number of pieces but these decisions have large impacts on the complexity of the robotic system. This impact goes beyond just defining the length and number of joints for the robotic system; the assembly process itself will drive the robot design. Robot trajectories will result in the forces and torques being applied to individual truss pieces and to the whole assembly itself, which are driven by the assembly plan. This study focuses on some of the design concerns of a robotic ISA system; specifically focusing on a walking robotic as it assembles a linear truss.
