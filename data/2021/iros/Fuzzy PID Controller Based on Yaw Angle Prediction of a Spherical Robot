In this paper, a fuzzy PID controller based on yaw angle prediction is applied to design an attitude controller for a spherical rolling robot. The robot consists of a 2-DOF pendulum located inside a spherical shell with freedom to rotate about the transversal and longitudinal axis. The proposed controller allows the robot to autonomously change its parameters to adapt to different environments based on current state. The past researches on the motion of spherical robots mostly focused on simulation or ideal experimental environment. But in this paper, a physical system is built and experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and adaptability of the controller.
