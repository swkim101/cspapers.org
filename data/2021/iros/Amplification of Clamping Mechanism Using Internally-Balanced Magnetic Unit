Machines tend to use powerful actuators and large gearboxes to bear large loads, which are inconvenient in terms of responsiveness as they affect the duration of operations. Thus, to compensate the force to grasp an object, we propose a clamping mechanism implementing the internally-balanced magnetic unit (IB Magnet) as a force amplifier, which is a mechanism able to switch attached and detached states of a permanent magnet with an external force considerably smaller than its original attractive force. To realize the bi-parting constitution of fingers, a new compensation method using conical coil springs was designed to provide both precision and miniaturization. Relative to the constitution with a single motored screw, the prototype gripper for proof of concept successfully amplified the grasping force at most to 292.2% assisted by the magnetic attraction, while keeping the increase in power consumption of a DC motor only by 11.8%, making the force-energy efficiency 2.6 times larger. Thus, it was verified that the proposed gripper enables the use of actuators and current supplies that require less power.
