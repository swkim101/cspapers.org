We consider the problem of generating a fixed path for a mobile observer in a polygonal environment that can maintain a line-of-sight with an unpredictable target. In contrast to purely off-line or on-line techniques, we propose a hierarchical tracking strategy in which an off-line path generation technique based on a RRT is coupled with an online feedback-control technique to generate trajectories for the mobile observer.
