Multi-agent path finding in formation has many potential real-world applications like mobile warehouse robotics. However, previous multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods hardly take formation into consideration. Further-more, they are usually centralized planners and require the whole state of the environment. Other decentralized partially observable approaches to MAPF are reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, these RL methods encounter difficulties when learning path finding and formation problems at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized partially observable RL algorithm that uses a hierarchical structure to decompose the multi-objective task into unrelated ones. It also calculates a theoretical weight that makes each tasks reward has equal influence on the final RL value function. Additionally, we introduce a communication method that helps agents cooperate with each other. Experiments in simulation show that our method outperforms other end-to-end RL methods and our method can naturally scale to large world sizes where centralized planner struggles. We also deploy and validate our method in a real-world scenario.
