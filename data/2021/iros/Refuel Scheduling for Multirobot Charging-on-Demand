In this paper, we consider the refuel scheduling problem for a team of ground robots deployed in "aislelike" environments wherein the robots are constrained to move along rows. In order to maintain a minimum service rate or throughput for the ground robots, we investigate the problem of scheduling a team of mobile charging stations deployed to replace the batteries on-board the ground robots without any interruption in their task. We propose two scheduling schemes for the mobile chargers to serve the ground robots for long-term service, and derive the parameters associated with the system required for persistent uninterrupted operation.
