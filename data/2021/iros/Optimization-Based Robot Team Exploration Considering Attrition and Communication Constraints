Exploring robots may fail due to environmental hazards. Thus, robots need to account for the possibility of failure to plan the best exploration paths. Optimizing expected utility enables robots to find plans that balance achievable reward with the inherent risks of exploration. Moreover, when robots rendezvous and communicate to exchange observations, they increase the probability that at least one robot is able to return with the map. Optimal exploration is NP-hard, so we apply a constraint-based approach to enable highly-engineered solution techniques. We model exploration under the possibility of robot failure and communication constraints as an integer, linear program and a generalization of the Vehicle Routing Problem. Empirically, we show that for several scenarios, this formulation produces paths within 50% of a theoretical optimum and achieves twice as much reward as a baseline greedy approach.
