Rotating a grasped object about all three spatial axes is challenging, because kinematically redundant robot hands require complex control schemes for within-hand rotations, and simple parallel grippers require inefficient whole arm motions. We present a novel 3-finger robot hand design inspired by a spherical parallel mechanism that achieves these rotations with just 3 actuators. The hand is designed such that at every hand-object configuration, the object pose moves along a sphere with a fixed center, which is determined by the intersection of the fingersâ€™ revolute axes and is independent of the object shape, pose, and the initial grasp configuration. We optimize the hand based on 3-RRS spherical manipulator to maximize both its rotational workspace size and manipulation motion quality. From these parameters, we implement and experimentally evaluate the hand design through grasping tests, manipulation characterization, and real-world task scenarios, which show that the hand is able to grasp a variety of object geometries and accomplish precise single and multi-DOF rotations about a fixed point. We believe this design can remarkably improve robustness and simplify control for dexterous within-hand rotations, which finds utility in augmenting the capabilities of low-DOF robot arms without an active wrist.
