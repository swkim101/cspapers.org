A formulation of the area defense and surveillance problem for one intruder and one defense and surveillance robot and its corresponding solution using control barrier functions is presented. The defense robot must follow the intruder as it moves through a rectangular region in the plane, ensuring that the position of the intruder is also within a rectangular region attached to the surveillance robot. The proposed reactive and closed-form control laws depend on the positions of the robots, their maximum speeds, and the size of the rectangular regions. We show the application and effectiveness of our results in experiments with real robots.
