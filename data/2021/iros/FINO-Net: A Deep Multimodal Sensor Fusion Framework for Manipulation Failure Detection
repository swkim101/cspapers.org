We need robots more aware of the unintended outcomes of their actions for ensuring safety. This can be achieved by an onboard failure detection system to monitor and detect such cases. Onboard failure detection is challenging with a limited set of onboard sensor setup due to the limitations of sensing capabilities of each sensor. To alleviate these challenges, we propose FINO-Net, a novel multimodal sensor fusion based deep neural network to detect and identify manipulation failures. We also introduce FAILURE, a multimodal dataset, containing 229 real-world manipulation data recorded with a Baxter robot. Our network combines RGB, depth and audio readings to effectively detect failures. Results indicate that fusing RGB with depth and audio modalities significantly improves the performance. FINO-Net achieves %98.60 detection accuracy on our novel dataset. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ardai/fino-net.
