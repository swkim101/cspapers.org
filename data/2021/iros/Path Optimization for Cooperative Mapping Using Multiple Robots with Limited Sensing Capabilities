This study addresses the problem of path optimization for conducting a mapping mission using a multi-robot system with limited sensing capability, which aims to ensure efficient mapping with emphasis on the cooperative aspect of the mission. To achieve the cooperative mapping, a new path planning algorithm is proposed which can take advantage of the multi-robot system while dealing with the lack of observability due to the nature of bearing-only or range-only sensing. The Fisher information matrix is used to estimate the mapping uncertainty affected by the robotsâ€™ geometric configuration. Also, a simple method to predict the convergence rate of the uncertainty over a short time horizon is presented for efficient path planning. The performance of the proposed algorithm is shown through simulations and compared with other path planning algorithms.
