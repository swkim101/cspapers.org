Physical human-robot interactions (pHRI) are less efficient and communicative than human-human interactions, and a key reason is a lack of informative sense of touch in robotic systems. Interpreting human touch gestures is a nuanced, challenging task with extreme gaps between human and robot capability. Among prior works that demonstrate human touch recognition capability, differences in sensors, gesture classes, feature sets, and classification algorithms yield a conglomerate of non-transferable results and a glaring lack of a standard. To address this gap, this work presents 1) four proposed touch gesture classes that cover an important subset of the gesture characteristics identified in the literature, 2) the collection of an extensive force dataset on a common pHRI robotic arm with only its internal wrist force-torque sensor, and 3) an exhaustive performance comparison of combinations of feature sets and classification algorithms on this dataset. We demonstrate high classification accuracies among our proposed gesture definitions on a test set, emphasizing that neural network classifiers on the raw data outperform other combinations of feature sets and algorithms.
