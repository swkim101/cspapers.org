The problem of graph alignment is to find corresponding nodes between a pair of graphs. Past work has treated the problem in a monolithic fashion, with the graph as input and the alignment as output, offering limited opportunities to adapt the algorithm to task requirements or input graph characteristics. Recently, node embedding techniques are utilized for graph alignment. In this paper, we study two state-of-the-art graph alignment algorithms utilizing node representations, CONE-Align and GRASP, and describe them in terms of an overarching modular framework. In a targeted experimental study, we exploit this modularity to develop enhanced algorithm variants that are more effective in the alignment task.
