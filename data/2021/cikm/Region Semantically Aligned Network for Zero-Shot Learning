Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes based on the knowledge of seen classes. Previous methods focused on learning direct embeddings from global features to the semantic space in hope of knowledge transfer from seen classes to unseen classes. However, an unseen class shares local visual features with a set of seen classes and leveraging global visual features makes the knowledge transfer ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose a Region Semantically Aligned Network (RSAN), which maps local features of unseen classes to their semantic attributes. Instead of using global features which are obtained by an average pooling layer after an image encoder, we directly utilize the output of the image encoder which maintains local information of the image. Concretely, we obtain each attribute from a specific region of the output and exploit these attributes for recognition. As a result, the knowledge of seen classes can be successfully transferred to unseen classes in a region-bases manner. In addition, we regularize the image encoder through attribute regression with a semantic knowledge to extract robust and attribute-related visual features. Experiments on several standard ZSL datasets reveal the benefit of the proposed RSAN method, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
