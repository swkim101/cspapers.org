Anchor graphs are a popular tool used in label prediction of sparsely labeled data. In anchor graphs, labels of labeled data are propagated to unlabeled data via anchor points; anchor points are the centers of k-means clusters. Anchor graph-based label prediction determines local weights between data points and anchor points by exploiting Nesterov's method to obtain the graph's adjacency matrix, and it inverts a matrix obtained from the adjacency matrix to predict labels., however, incurs high computation cost since (1) Nesterov's method is applied to all closest anchor points to compute local weights, and (2) the computation cost of the inversion matrix is cubic in the number of anchor points. We propose an approach that can efficiently perform anchor graph-based label prediction because of its two key advances: (1) it prunes unnecessary anchor points so they are not passed to Nesterov's method, and (2) it applies the conjugate gradient method in computing labels of data points to avoid matrix inversion. In addition, we propose to exploit basis vectors computed by SVD as anchor points to improve label prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the previous approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy.
