Explainable classification is essential to high-impact settings where practitioners requireevidence to support their decisions. However, state-of-the-art deep learning models lack transparency in how they make their predictions. One increasingly popular solution is attribution-based explainability, which finds the impact of input features on the model's predictions. While this is popular for computer vision, little has been done to explain deep time series classifiers.In this work, we study this problem and propose PERT, a novel perturbation-based explainability method designed to explain deep classifiers' decisions on time series. PERT extends beyond recent perturbation methods to generate a saliency map that assigns importance values to the timesteps of the instance-of-interest. First, PERT uses a novel Prioritized Replacement Selector to learn which alternative time series from a larger dataset are most useful to perform this perturbation. Second, PERT mixes the instance with the replacements using a Guided Perturbation Strategy, which learns to what degree each timestep can be perturbed without altering the classifier's final prediction. These two steps jointly learn to identify the fewest and most impactful timesteps that explain the classifier's prediction. We evaluate PERT using three metrics on nine popular datasets with two black-box models. We find that PERT consistently outperforms all five state-of-the-art methods. Using a case study, we also demonstrate that PERT succeeds in finding the relevant regions of the input time series.
