Human mobility recovery is of great importance for a wide range of location-based services. However, recovering human mobility is not trivial because of three challenges: 1) complex transition patterns among locations; 2) multi-level periodicity and shifting periodicity of human mobility; 3) sparsity of the collected trajectory data. In this paper, we propose PeriodicMove, a neural attention model based on graph neural network for human mobility recovery from lengthy and sparse trajectories. In PeriodicMove, we first construct a directed graph for each trajectory and capture complex location transition patterns using graph neural network. Then, we design two attention mechanisms which capture multi-level periodicity and shifting periodicity of human mobility respectively. Finally, a spatial-aware loss function is proposed to incorporate spatial proximity into the model optimization, which alleviates the data sparsity problem. We perform extensive experiments and the evaluation results demonstrate that PeriodicMove yields significant improvements over the competitors on two representative real-life mobility datasets. In addition, by providing high-quality mobility data, our model can benefit a variety of mobility-oriented downstream applications.
