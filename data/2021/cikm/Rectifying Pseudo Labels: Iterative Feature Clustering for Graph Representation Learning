Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are powerful representation learning methods for non-Euclidean data. Compared with the Euclidean data, labeling the non-Euclidean data is more expensive. Meanwhile, most existing GCNs only utilize few labeled data but ignore most of the unlabeled data. To address this issue, we design a novel end-to-end Iterative Feature Clustering Graph Convolutional Networks (IFC-GCN) that enhances the standard GCN with an Iterative Feature Clustering (IFC) module. The proposed IFC module constrains node features iteratively based on the predicted pseudo labels and feature clustering. Further, we design an EM-like framework for IFC-GCN training, which improves the network performance by rectifying the pseudo labels and the node features alternately. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposed IFC module can effectively modify the node features. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that IFC-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the semi-supervised node classification task.
