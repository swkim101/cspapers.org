Private information can either take the form of key phrases that are explicitly contained in the text or be implicit. For example, demographic information about the author of a text can be predicted with above-chance accuracy from linguistic cues in the text itself. Letting alone its explicitness, some of the private information correlates with the output labels and therefore can be learned by a neural network. In such a case, there is a tradeoff between the utility of the representation (measured by the accuracy of the classification network) and its privacy. This problem is inherently a multi-objective problem because these two objectives may conflict, necessitating a trade-off. Thus, we explicitly cast this problem as multi-objective optimization (MOO) with the overall objective of finding a Pareto stationary solution. We, therefore, propose a multiple-gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) that enables the efficient application of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm [10] using the line search. Experimental results on sentiment analysis and part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that MGDA produces higher-performing models than most recent proxy objective approaches, and performs as well as single objective baselines.
