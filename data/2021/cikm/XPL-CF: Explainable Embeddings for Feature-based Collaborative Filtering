Collaborative filtering (CF) methods are making an impact on our daily lives in a wide range of applications, including recommender systems and personalization. Latent factor methods, e.g., matrix factorization (MF), have been the state-of-the-art in CF, however they lack interpretability and do not provide a straightforward explanation for their predictions. Explainability is gaining momentum in recommender systems for accountability, and because a good explanation can swing an undecided user. Most recent explainable recommendation methods require auxiliary data such as review text or item content on top of item ratings. In this paper, we address the case where no additional data are available and propose augmenting the classical MF framework for CF with a prior that encodes each user's embedding as a sparse linear combination of item embeddings, and vice versa for each item embedding. Our XPL-CF approach automatically reveals these user-item relationships, which underpin the latent factors and explain how the resulting recommendations are formed. We showcase the effectiveness of XPL-CF on real data from various application domains. We also evaluate the explainability of the user-item relationship obtained from XPL-CF through numeric evaluation and case study examples.
