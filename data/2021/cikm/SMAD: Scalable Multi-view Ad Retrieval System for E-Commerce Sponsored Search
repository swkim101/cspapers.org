Ad retrieval in sponsored search aims to understand user search intentions (user queries) and retrieves a set of ads inferred as being relevant to the queries. Due to the huge amount of search traffic and multiple views of relevance (such as co-clicking, co-bidding or textual similar), it is highly desirable but remain challenging to achieve a large-scale, multi-view matching between queries and ads, particularly in industrial settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable multi-view ad retrieval engine SMAD that we developed and deployed at Taobao, the largest e-commerce platform in China. We construct a multi-relation query-item-ad graph capturing different views of query-ad relevance, which is of large scale and with complex structure. Since in e-commerce platform, the queries and products are organized into a category tree, to deal with the large scale of the graph, we propose a category constrained graph sampling and partition method to enable distributed parallel offline training. To tackle the complex multi-view structure, we propose a multi-view parallel deep neural network (DNN) model to combine the information from different views in a principled way. According to offline experiments and online A/B tests, our framework significantly outperforms baselines in terms of relevance, coverage, and revenue.
