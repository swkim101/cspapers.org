Node classification is an important yet challenging task in various network applications, and many effective methods have been developed for a single network. While for cross-network scenarios, neither single network embedding nor traditional domain adaptation can directly solve the task. Existing approaches have been proposed to combine network embedding and domain adaptation for cross-network node classification. However, they only focus on domain-invariant features, ignoring the individual features of each network, and they only utilize 1-hop neighborhood information (local consistency), ignoring the global consistency information. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel model, Adversarial Separation Network(ASN), to learn effective node representations between source and target networks. We explicitly separate domain-private and domain-shared information. Two domain-private encoders are employed to extract the domain-specific features in each network and a shared encoder is employed to extract the domain-invariant shared features across networks. Moreover, in each encoder, we combine local and global consistency to capture network topology information more comprehensively. ASN integrates deep network embedding with adversarial domain adaptation to reduce the distribution discrepancy across domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-network node classification tasks compared with existing algorithms.
