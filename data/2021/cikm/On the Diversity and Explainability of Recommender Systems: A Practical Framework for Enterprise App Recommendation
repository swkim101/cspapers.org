This paper introduces an enterprise app recommendation problem with a new "to-business'' use case, which aims to assist a sales team acting as the bridge connecting the applications and developers with the customers who apply these apps to solve their business problems. Our recommender system is an assistant to the sales team, helping recommend relevant apps to the customers for their businesses and increasing the likelihood of improving sales revenue. Besides recommendation accuracy, recommendation diversity and explainability are even more crucial since they provide more exposure opportunities for app developers and improve the transparency and trustworthiness of the recommender system. To allow the sales team to explore unpopular but relevant apps and understand why such apps are recommended, we propose a novel framework for improving aggregate recommendation diversity and generating recommendation explanations, which supports a wide variety of models for improving recommendation accuracy. The model in our framework is simple yet effective, which can be trained in an end-to-end manner and deployed as a recommendation service easily. Furthermore, our framework can also apply to other generic recommender systems for improving diversity and generating explanations. Experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and solution.
