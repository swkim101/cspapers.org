Label-Constraint Reachability query (LCR) which extracts of reachability information from large edge-labeled graphs, has attracted tremendous interest. Various LCR algorithms have been proposed to solve this fundamental query, which has a wide range of applications in social networks, biological networks, economic networks, etc. In this paper, we implement the state-of-the-art P2H+ algorithm as well as functions to analyze the effectiveness. Moreover, our Dynamic LCR Query (DLQ) system also supports dynamic updates with the 2-hop labeling method. In this demonstration, we present the DLQ system for Label-Constrained Reachability Queries that utilize the 2-hop labeling algorithm with dynamic graph maintenance.
