With the rise of social media users and the general shift of communication from traditional media to online platforms, the spread of harmful content (e.g., hate speech, misinformation, fake news) has been exacerbated. Harmful content in the form of hate speech causes a person distress or harm, having a negative impact on the individual mental health, with even more detrimental effects on the psychology of children and teenagers. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution with real-time capabilities to detect harmful content in real-time and mitigate its spread over the network. Our main contribution is Sparse Shield, a novel method that out-scales existing state-of-the-art methods for network immunization. We also propose a novel architecture for harmful speech mitigation that maximizes the impact of immunization. Our solution aims to identify a set of users for which to move harmful content at the bottom of the user feed, rather than censoring users. By immunizing certain network nodes in this manner, we minimize the negative impact on the network and minimize the interference with and limitation of individual freedoms: the information is not hidden but rather not as easy to reach without an explicit search. Our analysis is based on graphs built on real-world data collected from Twitter; these graphs reflect real user behavior. We perform extensive scalability experiments to prove the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art network immunization techniques. We also perform extensive experiments to showcase that Sparse Shield outperforms existing techniques on the task of harmful speech mitigation on a real-world dataset.
