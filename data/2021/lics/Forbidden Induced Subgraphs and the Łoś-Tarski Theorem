Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a class of finite and infinite graphs that is closed under induced subgraphs. The well-known Łoś–Tarski Theorem from classical model theory implies that $\mathcal{C}$ is definable in first-order logic (FO) by a sentence φ if and only if $\mathcal{C}$ has a finite set of forbidden induced finite subgraphs. It provides a powerful tool to show nontrivial characterizations of graphs of small vertex cover, of bounded tree-depth, of bounded shrub-depth, etc. in terms of forbidden induced finite subgraphs. Furthermore, by the Completeness Theorem, we can compute from φ the corresponding forbidden induced subgraphs. Our results (a) and (b) show that this machinery fails on finite graphs.(a)There is a class of finite graphs that is definable in FO and closed under induced subgraphs but has no finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs.(b)Even if we only consider classes $\mathcal{C}$ of finite graphs that can be characterized by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs such a characterization cannot be computed from an FO-sentence φ that defines $\mathcal{C}$ and the size of the characterization cannot be bounded by f(|φ|) for any computable function f.Besides their importance in graph theory, our results also significantly strengthen similar known theorems for arbitrary structures.
