Relational Hoare logics (RHL) provide rules for reasoning about relations between programs. Several RHLs include a rule we call sequential product that infers a relational correctness judgment from judgments of ordinary Hoare logic (HL). Other rules embody sensible patterns of reasoning and have been found useful in practice, but sequential product is relatively complete on its own (with HL). As a more satisfactory way to evaluate RHLs, a notion of alignment completeness is introduced, in terms of the inductive assertion method and product automata. Alignment completeness results are given to account for several different sets of rules. The notion may serve to guide the design of RHLs and relational verifiers for richer programming languages and alignment patterns.
