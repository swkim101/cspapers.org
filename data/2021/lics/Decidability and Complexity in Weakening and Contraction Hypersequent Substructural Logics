We establish decidability for the infinitely many axiomatic extensions of the commutative Full Lambek logic with weakening FLew (i.e. IMALLW) that have a cut-free hypersequent proof calculus. Specifically: every analytic structural rule extension of HFLew. Decidability for the corresponding extensions of its contraction counterpart FLec was established recently but their computational complexity was left unanswered. In the second part of this paper, we introduce just enough on length functions for well-quasi-orderings and the fast-growing complexity classes to obtain complexity upper bounds for both the weakening and contraction extensions. A specific instance of this result yields the first complexity bound for the prominent fuzzy logic MTL (monoidal t-norm based logic) providing an answer to a longstanding open problem.
