Emerging mobile applications involving distributed control and sensing call for accurate time synchronization over wireless links.
This paper systematically studies the performance of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) in today's Wi-Fi networks. We investigate both software and hardware PTP implementations.
Our study uncovers the root causes of software PTP synchronization errors. We show that with fine-tuned system configurations and an online calibration procedure, software PTP can achieve reasonable accuracy with off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices. Hardware PTP requires a PTP hardware timestamper clock not contained in Wi-Fi NICs. We propose a method to make use of the hardware TSF counter to emulate the PTP clock. Rigorous tests traversing various conditions show that both software and hardware PTP implementations can achieve a 1-Âµs level of accuracy in today's Wi-Fi networks.
