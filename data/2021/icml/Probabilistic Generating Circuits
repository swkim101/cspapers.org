Probabilistic generating circuits (PGCs) are economical representations of multivariate probability generating polynomials (PGPs). They unify and extend decomposable probabilistic circuits and de-terminantal point processes, admitting tractable computation of marginal probabilities. However, the need for addition and multiplication of high-degree polynomials incurs a signiﬁcant additional factor in the complexity of inference. Here, we give a new inference algorithm that eliminates this extra factor. Speciﬁcally, we show that it sufﬁces to keep track of the highest degree coefﬁcients of the computed polynomials, rendering the al-gorithm linear in the circuit size. In addition, we show that determinant-based circuits need not be expanded to division-free circuits, but can be handled by division-based fast algorithms. While these advances enhance the appeal of PGCs, we also discover an obstacle to learning them from data: it is NP-hard to recognize whether a given PGC encodes a PGP. We discuss the implications of our ambivalent ﬁndings and sketch a method, in which learning is restricted to PGCs that are composed of moderate-size subcircuits.
