Although model-based and model-free approaches to learning the control of systems have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks, generalization to task variations is still lacking. Recent results suggest that generalization for standard architectures improves only after obtaining exhaustive amounts of data. We give evidence that generalization capabilities are in many cases bottlenecked by the inability to generalize on the combinatorial aspects of the problem. Furthermore, we show that for a certain subclass of the MDP framework, this can be alleviated by neuro-algorithmic architectures. Many control problems require long-term planning that is hard to solve generically with neural networks alone. We introduce a neuro-algorithmic policy architecture consisting of a neural network and an embedded time-dependent shortest path solver. These policies can be trained end-to-end by blackbox differentiation. We show that this type of architecture generalizes well to unseen variations in the environment already after seeing a few examples.
