Distributed learning has become a hot research topic, due to its wide application in cluster-based large-scale learning, federated learning, edge computing and so on. Most distributed learning methods assume no error and attack on the workers. However, many unexpected cases, such as communication error and even malicious attack, may happen in real applications. Hence, Byzantine learning (BL), which refers to distributed learning with attack or error, has recently attracted much attention. Most existing BL methods are synchronous, which will result in slow convergence when there exist heterogeneous workers. Furthermore, in some applications like federated learning and edge computing, synchronization cannot even be performed most of the time due to the online workers (clients or edge servers). Hence, asynchronous BL (ABL) is more general and practical than synchronous BL (SBL). To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two ABL methods. One of them cannot resist malicious attack. The other needs to store some training instances on the server, which has the privacy leak problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called buffered asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (BASGD), for BL. BASGD is an asynchronous method. Furthermore, BASGD has no need to store any training instances on the server, and hence can preserve privacy in ABL. BASGD is theoretically proved to have the ability of resisting against error and malicious attack. Moreover, BASGD has a similar theoretical convergence rate to that of vanilla asynchronous SGD (ASGD), with an extra constant variance. Empirical results show that BASGD can significantly outperform vanilla ASGD and other ABL baselines, when there exists error or attack on workers.
