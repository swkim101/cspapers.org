This paper studies two variants of the best arm identiﬁcation (BAI) problem under the streaming model, where we have a stream of n arms with reward distributions supported on [0 , 1] with unknown means. The arms in the stream are arriving one by one, and the algorithm cannot access an arm unless it is stored in a limited size memory. We ﬁrst study the streaming ε - top - k arms identiﬁ-cation problem, which asks for k arms whose reward means are lower than that of the k -th best arm by at most ε with probability at least 1 − δ . For general ε ∈ (0 , 1) , the existing solu-tion for this problem assumes k = 1 and achieves the optimal sample complexity O ( nε 2 log 1 δ ) using O (log ∗ ( n )) 1 memory and a single pass of the stream. We propose an algorithm that works for any k and achieves the optimal sample complexity O ( nε 2 log kδ ) using a single-arm memory and a single pass of the stream. Second, we study the streaming BAI problem, where the objective is to identify the arm with the maximum reward mean with at least 1 − δ probability, using a single-arm memory and as few passes of the input stream as possible. We present a single-arm-memory algorithm that achieves a near instance-dependent optimal sample complexity within O (log ∆ − 1 2 ) passes, where ∆ 2 is the gap between the mean of the best arm and that of the second best arm.
