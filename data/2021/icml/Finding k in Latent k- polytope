The recently introduced Latent k − Polytope( LkP ) encompasses several stochastic Mixed Member-ship models including Topic Models. The problem of ﬁnding k , the number of extreme points of LkP , is a fundamental challenge and includes several important open problems such as determination of number of components in Ad-mixtures. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing Interpolative Convex Rank( ICR ) of a matrix deﬁned as the minimum number of its columns whose convex hull is within Hausdorff distance ε of the convex hull of all columns. The ﬁrst important contribution of this paper is to show that under standard assumptions k equals the ICR of a subset smoothed data matrix deﬁned from Data generated from an LkP . The second important contribution of the paper is a polynomial time al-gorithm for ﬁnding k under standard assumptions. An immediate corollary is the ﬁrst polynomial time algorithm for ﬁnding the inner dimension in Non-negative matrix factorisation(NMF) with assumptions which are qualitatively different than existing ones such as Separability .
