Predictor combination is the problem of improving a task predictor using predictors of other tasks when the forms of individual predictors are unknown. Previous work approached this problem by nonparametrically assessing predictor relationships based on their joint evaluations on a shared sample. This limits their application to cases where all predictors are defined on the same task category, e.g. all predictors estimate attributes of shoes. We present a new predictor combination algorithm that overcomes this limitation. Our algorithm aligns the heterogeneous domains of different predictors in a shared latent space to facilitate comparisons of predictors independently of the domains on which they are originally defined. We facilitate this by a new data alignment scheme that matches data distributions across task categories. Based on visual attribute ranking experiments on datasets that span diverse task categories (e.g. shoes and animals), we demonstrate that our approach often significantly improves the performances of the initial predictors.
