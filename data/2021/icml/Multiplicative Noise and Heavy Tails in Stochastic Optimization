Here, we shall discuss existing theory concerning the random linear recurrence relation Wk`1 “ AkWk ` Bk that arises in (5). Because pAk, Bkq for each k “ 0, 1, 2, . . . is independent and identically distributed, we let pA,Bq “ pA0, B0q, noting that pA,Bq D “ pAk, Bkq for all k. First, we state conditions under which (5) yields an ergodic Markov chain. For clarity, we recall the definition of ergodicity in Markov chains (Meyn & Tweedie, 2012, Theorem 13.0.1 and 16.2.1). Definition 1 (Ergodicity and Geometric Ergodicity). A Markov chain tWkuk“0 on R is ergodic if there exists a unique invariant probability measure (a stationary distribution) π such that for any x P R,
