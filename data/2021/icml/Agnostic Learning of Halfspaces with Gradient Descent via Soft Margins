We analyze the properties of gradient descent on convex surrogates for the zero-one loss for the agnostic learning of linear halfspaces. If $\mathsf{OPT}$ is the best classification error achieved by a halfspace, by appealing to the notion of soft margins we are able to show that gradient descent finds halfspaces with classification error $\tilde O(\mathsf{OPT}^{1/2}) + \varepsilon$ in $\mathrm{poly}(d,1/\varepsilon)$ time and sample complexity for a broad class of distributions that includes log-concave isotropic distributions as a subclass. Along the way we answer a question recently posed by Ji et al. (2020) on how the tail behavior of a loss function can affect sample complexity and runtime guarantees for gradient descent.
