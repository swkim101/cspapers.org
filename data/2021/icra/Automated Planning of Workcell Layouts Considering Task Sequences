The initial design of a robotic workcell layout has a large impact on the feasibility and performance of the intended robotic tasks. We define this layout design as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem that aims to optimize the placement of workcell components by minimizing the distance traveled between task sequences while maximizing the robotâ€™s manipulability. Suitable constraints guarantee the reachability as well as the absence of collisions. We solve this optimization problem via a genetic algorithm, and demonstrate it in three scenarios for a dual-arm robotic system that assembles product variants out of aluminum profiles.
