Real-time semantic segmentation is a challenging task as both accuracy and inference speed need to be considered simultaneously. In real-world applications, it is usually achieved by deploying a deep neural network in modern GPU device. However, most of the work focused on real-time semantic segmentation is designed by significantly reducing computation complexity and model size. There are other factors that have a significant impact on inference speed are overlooked, especially when the network is running in modern GPU device. In this paper, we focus on designing a GPU-efficient network as backbone for real-time semantic segmentation. Dense connectivity can preserve and accumulate feature maps of multiple receptive fields and is therefore ideal for semantic segmentation. Therefore, we design a GPU-efficient network (DenseENet) with dense connectivity. The proposed DenseENet shows an obvious advantage in balancing accuracy and inference speed in modern GPU device. Specifically, on Cityscapes test set, DenseENet with a simple FCN decoder achieves 75.2% mIoU with 83.6 FPS for an input of 1024 × 2048 resolution and 73.6% mIoU with 132 FPS for an input of 768 × 1536 resolution on a single GTX 1080Ti card.
