Robots deployed in airports, malls, and stadiums today require expert oversight, pre-provided maps, and infrastructure. These systems are engineered to their specific deployment spaces and rely heavily on geometric maps for motion planning. In this work we consider a robot with only local-sensing and present a navigation strategy that uses signs and homotopy classes to fuel planning. We prove that in the worst-case, this strategy still maintains the probabilistic completeness that sampling based motion planners provide. Furthermore, we experimentally show that this exploration strategy results in 100% goal completion in real airport floor plans, and demonstrate how the robotâ€™s sensing capabilities affects efficiency. We also show the effect of the environment variables, such as total number of obstacles, and density of obstacles, on navigation.
