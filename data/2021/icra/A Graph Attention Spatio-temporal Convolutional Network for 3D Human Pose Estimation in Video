Spatio-temporal information is key to resolve occlusion and depth ambiguity in 3D human pose estimation. Previous methods have focused on either temporal contexts or local-to-global architectures that embed fixed-length spatiotemporal information. To date, there have not been effective proposals to simultaneously and flexibly capture varying spatiotemporal sequences and effectively achieves real-time 3D human pose estimation. In this work, we improve the learning of kinematic constraints in the human skeleton: posture, local kinematic connections, and symmetry by modeling local and global spatial information via attention mechanisms. To adapt to single- and multi-frame estimation, the dilated temporal model is employed to process varying skeleton sequences. Also, importantly, we carefully design the interleaving of spatial semantics with temporal dependencies to achieve a synergistic effect. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective graph attention spatio-temporal convolutional network (GAST-Net) that comprises of interleaved temporal convolutional and graph attention blocks. Experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) and YouTube videos demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates depth ambiguity and self-occlusion, generalizes to half upper body estimation, and achieves competitive performance on 2D-to-3D video pose estimation.
