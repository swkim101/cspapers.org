Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) are a well-known tool for encoding robotic motions. Their popularity stems from invariance properties in time and space, the ability to describe complex coordinated motions in multiple degrees of freedom with a relatively small number of parameters, and the linearity in the parameters that describe the motion. The latter allows easily fitting a DMP to motions e.g. demonstrated by a human. DMPs are at their core second order autonomous differential equations. However, feedforward controls of robots with flexible joints are known to require reference trajectories up to the fourth derivative of position. Consequently, classical DMPs are mechanically not compatible with flexible joint robots. In this paper, we propose an extension of DMPs by introducing FlexDMPs. This concept retains the structural properties and benefits of classical DMPs but generates trajectories up to the fourth derivative that can theoretically be tracked ideally (i.e. with zero tracking error) by flexible joint robots. The concept is demonstrated on a high fidelity simulation model of an industrial robot and in experimental results on a collaborative manipulator.
