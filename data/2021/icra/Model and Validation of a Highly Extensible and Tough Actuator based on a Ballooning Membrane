Soft robots are known for their ability to comply and having superior extensibility. However, one of the limitations of most of these robots is that they can stand only a limited amount of load before buckling, and they feature a non-negligible initial height. Hybrid soft-rigid actuators seem to offer a trade-off between compliance and the amount of load they can withstand, but only a few simple models have been proposed to describe the behavior of these actuators. In this paper, we propose a design, model and experimental validation of a soft actuator based on stackable Hyperelastic Ballooning Membranes (HBMA). This actuator shows an extensibility higher than 179%, as well as an ability to stand more than 20 times its own weight at a pressure as low as 35 kPa. Two models, giving the dynamic behavior of the HBMA in terms of displacement and pressure, have been derived from different hyperelastic models (Neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin) and compared in terms of accuracy and robustness. Finally, an example of a hybrid soft-rigid continuum ballooning robot built with HBMAs is presented and characterized experimentally.
