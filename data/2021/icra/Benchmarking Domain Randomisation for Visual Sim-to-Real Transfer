Domain randomisation is a very popular method for visual sim-to-real transfer in robotics, due to its simplicity and ability to achieve transfer without any real-world images at all. Nonetheless, a number of design choices must be made to achieve optimal transfer. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking study on these different choices, with two key experiments evaluated on a real-world object pose estimation task. First, we study the rendering quality, and nd that a small number of high-quality images is superior to a large number of low-quality images. Second, we study the type of randomisation, and nd that both distractors and textures are important for generalisation to novel environments.
