Autonomous ground vehicles have improved greatly over the past decades, but they still have their limitations when it comes to off-road environments. There is still a need for planning techniques that effectively handle physical interactions between a vehicle and its surroundings. We present a method of modifying a standard path planning algorithm to address these problems by incorporating a learned model to account for complexities that would be too hard to address manually. The model predicts how well a vehicle will be able to follow a potential plan in a given environment. These predictions are then used to assign costs to their associated paths, where the path predicted to be the most feasible will be output as the final path. This results in a planner that doesn't rely solely on engineered features to evaluate traversability of obstacles, and can also choose a better path based on an understanding of its own capability that it has learned from previous interactions. This modification was integrated into the Hybrid A* algorithm and experimental results demonstrated an improvement of 14.29% over the original version on a physical platform.
