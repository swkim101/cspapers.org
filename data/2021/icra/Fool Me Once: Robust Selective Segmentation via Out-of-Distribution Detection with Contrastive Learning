In this work, a neural network is trained to simultaneously perform segmentation and pixel-wise Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection, such that the segmentation of unknown regions of scenes can be rejected. This is made possible by leveraging an OoD dataset with a novel contrastive objective and data augmentation scheme. By including unknown classes in the training data, a more robust feature representation is learned with known classes represented distinctly from those unknown. In comparison, when presented with unknown classes or conditions, many current approaches for segmentation frequently exhibit high confidence in their inaccurate segmentations and cannot be trusted in many operational environments. We validate our system on a real-world dataset of unusual driving scenes, and show that by selectively segmenting scenes based on what is predicted as OoD, we can increase the segmentation accuracy by an IoU of 0.2 with respect to alternative techniques.
