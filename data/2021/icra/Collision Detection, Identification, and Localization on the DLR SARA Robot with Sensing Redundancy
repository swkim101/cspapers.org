Physical human-robot interaction is known to be a crucial aspect in modern lightweight robotics. Herein, the estimation of external interactions is essential for the effective and safe collaboration. In this work, an extended momentum-based disturbance observer is presented which includes the sensing redundancy related to additional force-torque measurements. The observer eliminates the need for acceleration measurements/estimates and it is able to accurately reconstruct multiple simultaneous contact locations. Moreover, it provides uncoupled, configuration-independent, and singularity-free estimates of the external forces. The performance of the approach is experimentally validated on the SARA robot, the new generation of DLR lightweight robots, involving high resolution force-torque sensors in a redundant arrangement.
