Haptic guidance can improve accuracy and dexterity during the teleoperation of a robot, but only if the model of the task used to provide the assistance is accurate. In medical robotics, the registration of a task from pre-operative planning from medical images to the robotâ€™s task-space can be erroneous. Additionally, the deformability of the environment can require online correction of a planned task. Therefore, we propose a method to update the geometry and the registration of a pathfollowing task online. This model is simultaneously used to physically guide the user during the teleoperation. Experimental results obtained on a haptic interface show the validity of the approach for a simulated 2D task.
