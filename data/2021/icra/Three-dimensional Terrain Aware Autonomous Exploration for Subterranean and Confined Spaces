Despite the advances in autonomous navigation and motion planning, there are still several challenges to overcome, especially for confined or underground spaces. Confined scenarios present challenges such as lack of global or accurate external localization, uneven and slippery terrains, and multilevel stages. Exploring and mapping unknown unstructured environments is a fundamental step into the safe and efficient accomplishment of real-world tasks such as search and rescue missions or the autonomous inspection of dangerous areas. This paper proposes a novel three-dimensional autonomous exploration method for ground robots that considers the terrain traversability combined with the frontier expected information gain as a metric for the next best frontier selection in GPS-denied, confined spaces. Safe paths for navigation and frontier extraction are calculated iteratively from multiple 3D map representations such as octrees and meshes. Results in realistic simulated underground scenarios from the DARPA subterranean challenge demonstrate the technique's feasibility, achieving a more reliable and faster exploration rate over competing approaches.
