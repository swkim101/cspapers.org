This paper proposes a coupled tendon-driven waist joint for humanoid robots. The waist joint was designed as a 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) structure to simulate the motion of a human waist. The power transmission was designed by adopting a 3-motor 3-DOF (3M3D) coupled tendon-driven mechanism, so that the torque on the joints was multiplied. We derived the torque transmission formula and the rotation angle formula of the 3M3D tendon-driven structures and designed the waist joint by adopting an appropriate structure according to their features. To evaluate the accuracy and load capacity of the waist joint, we performed a rotational accuracy experiment and a maximum torque experiment. The experiment results showed that the maximum error of joint rotation was below 1Â°, and the maximum torque of the pitch, roll, and yaw rotations were 87[Nm], 53[Nm], and 22.2[Nm], respectively.
