Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been demonstrated to provide promising results in several challenging decision making and control tasks. However, the required inference costs of deep neural networks (DNNs) could prevent DRL from being applied to mobile robots which cannot afford high energy-consuming computations. To enable DRL methods to be affordable in such energy-limited platforms, we propose an asymmetric architecture that reduces the overall inference costs via switching between a computationally expensive policy and an economic one. The experimental results evaluated on a number of representative benchmark suites for robotic control tasks demonstrate that our method is able to reduce the inference costs while retaining the agentâ€™s overall performance.
