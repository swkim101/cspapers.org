We propose a combination of Model Predictive Control and Lexicographic Programming to address complex scenarios with conflicting goals related to various aspects of comfort and safety of passengers in a transit bus, generating different deceleration profiles depending on the speed of the bus and distance to obstacles, validated in experiments with a standard transit bus equipped with self-driving capabilities.
