Steerable needles that are able to follow curvilinear trajectories and steer around anatomical obstacles are a promising solution for many interventional procedures. In the lung, these needles can be deployed from the tip of a conventional bronchoscope to reach lung lesions for diagnosis. The reach of such a device depends on several design parameters including the bronchoscope diameter, the angle of the piercing device relative to the medial axis of the airway, and the needle’s minimum radius of curvature while steering. Assessing the effect of these parameters on the overall system’s clinical utility is important in informing future design choices and understanding the capabilities and limitations of the system. In this paper, we analyze the effect of various settings for these three robot parameters on the percentage of the lung that the robot can reach. We combine Monte Carlo random sampling of piercing configurations with a Rapidly-exploring Random Trees based steerable needle motion planner in simulated human lung environments to asymptotically accurately estimate the volume of sites in the lung reachable by the robot. We highlight the importance of each parameter on the overall system’s reachable workspace in an effort to motivate future device innovation and highlight design trade-offs.
