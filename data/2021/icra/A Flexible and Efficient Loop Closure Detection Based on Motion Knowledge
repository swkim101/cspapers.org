Loop closure detection (LCD) is an essential module for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which can correct accumulated errors after long-term explorations. The widely used bag-of-words (BoW) model can not satisfy well the requirements of both low time consumption and high accuracy for a mobile platform. In this paper, we propose a novel LCD algorithm based on motion knowledge. We give a flexible and efficient detection strategy and also give flexible and efficient combinations of a global binary feature extracted by convolutional neural network (CNN) and a hand-crafted local binary feature. We take a continuous motion model, grid-based motion statistics (GMS) and motion states as motion knowledge. Furthermore, we fuse the proposed LCD with a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system to correct localization errors by a pose graph optimization. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art LCD algorithms on typical datasets have been carried out, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves quite high recall rates and quite high speed at 100% precision. Moreover, experimental results from VIO further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
