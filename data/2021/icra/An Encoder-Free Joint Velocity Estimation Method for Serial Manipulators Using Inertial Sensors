This paper focuses on developing a real-time and flexible velocity estimation approach for serial revolute manipulator using only one inertial measurement unit (IMU) mounted on each link side of the manipulator. Particularly, the proposed approach has no requirement for the installation position and orientation of the IMU, which improves the flexibility of the implementation procedure. A joint velocity model is established based on the proposed principle of constructing coordinate system according to the robotic geometric information. The general solutions are derived in detail, thereby the proposed algorithm can be generalized into any other robots with the same geometric configuration. With the method, the joint rotational velocity measurements of static and dynamic robotic motion are provided compared to encoders. Experimental results based on the six degrees of freedom (DOF) collaborative manipulator have validated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed method has the benefits of low cost and flexibility, which could work as a redundant velocity monitor criterion to provide assistant joint velocity measurements.
