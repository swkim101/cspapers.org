This paper presents a hierarchical motion planning approach that can provide real-time parking plans for autonomous vehicles with limited memory. Through combining a high-level route planner that searches for collision-free routes given traffic and obstacle information and a low level motion planner that considers vehicle dynamics, our approach generates smooth trajectories with reasonable parking behaviors rapidly with very low memory consumption. This hierarchical approach allows for online path repairing and replanning when newly detected obstacles that were not indicated on the offline map obstruct the original planned trajectory. It employs a fast clearance checking procedure to obtain a practical indicator of repairability as well as heuristic guidance for rapid trajectory repairing, and utilizes the high-level route planner to conduct real-time replanning when trajectory repairing is deemed to be difficult. Performance analysis on parking tasks in simulation environments demonstrates the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of both trajectory quality and planning time.
