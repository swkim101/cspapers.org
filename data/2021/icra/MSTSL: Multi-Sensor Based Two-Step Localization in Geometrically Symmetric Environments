Symmetric environment is one of the most intractable and challenging scenarios for mobile robots to accomplish global localization tasks, due to the highly similar geometrical structures and insufficient distinctive features. Existing localization solutions in such scenarios either depend on pre-deployed infrastructures which are expensive, inflexible, and hard to maintain; or rely on single sensor-based methods whose initialization module is incapable to provide enough unique information. Thus, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Sensor based Two-Step Localization framework named MSTSL, which addresses the problem of mobile robot global localization in geometrically symmetric environments by utilizing the measured magnetic field, 2-D LiDAR, and wheel odometry information. The proposed system mainly consists of two steps: 1) Magnetic Field-based Initialization, and 2) LiDAR-based Localization. Based on the pre-built magnetic field database, multiple initial hypotheses poses can firstly be determined by the proposed two-stage initialization algorithm. Then, utilizing the obtained multiple initial hypotheses, the robot can be localized more accurately by LiDAR-based localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the practical utility and accuracy of the proposed system over the alternative approaches in real-world scenarios.
