Stable walking in real-world environments is a challenging task for humanoid robots, especially when considering the dynamic disturbances, e.g., caused by external perturbations that may be encountered during locomotion. The varying nature of disturbance necessitates high adaptability. In this paper, we propose an enhanced Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) approach for robust and adaptable walking â€“ we term it versatile locomotion, by limiting both the Center of Pressure (CoP) and Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) movements. Due to utilization of the Nonlinear Inverted Pendulum plus Flywheel model, the robot is endowed with the capabilities of CoP manipulation (if equipped with finitesized feet), step location adjustment, upper body rotation, and vertical height variation. Considering the feasibility constraints, especially the usage of relaxed CoP constraints, the NMPC scheme is established as a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming problem, which is solved efficiently by Sequential Quadratic Programming with enhanced solvability. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to recruit optimal hybrid strategies in order to realize versatile locomotion, for the robot with finite-sized or point feet.
