Conventional coverage path planning algorithms are mainly based on the zigzag and spiral patterns or their combinations. The traversal order is limited by the linear or inside-outside manner. We propose a new set of coverage patterns induced from geometric folding operations, called the geometric folding pattern, to make coverage paths with more flexible traversal order. We study the modeling and parameterization of the geometric folding patterns. Then, a sampling operator is introduced. Based on the computational tools, we demonstrate the application of the proposed patterns in designing coverage paths. We show that the simple geometric folding patterns are flexible and controllable, which enables more choices for the coverage path planning problem.
