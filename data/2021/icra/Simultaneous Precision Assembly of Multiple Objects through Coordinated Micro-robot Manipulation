Simultaneous assembly of multiple objects is a key technology to form solid connections among objects to get compact structures in precision assembly and micro-assembly. Dramatically different from traditional assembly of two objects, the interaction among multiple objects is more complicated on analysis and control. During simultaneous assembly of multiple objects, there are multiple mutually effected contact surfaces, and multiple force sensors are needed to perceive the interaction status. In this paper, a coordinated micro-robot manipulation strategy is proposed for simultaneous assembly problem, which is based on microscopic vision and force information. Taking simultaneous assembly of three objects as an instance, the proposed method is well articulated, including calibration of assembly system, force analysis for each contacting surface, and insertion control strategy for assembly process. The proposed method is applicable also to case with more objects. Experiment results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method.
