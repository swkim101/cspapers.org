Learning from Demonstration (LfD) enables novice users to teach robots new skills. However, many LfD methods do not facilitate skill maintenance and adaptation. Changes in task requirements or in the environment often reveal the lack of resiliency and adaptability in the skill model. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARC-LfD: an Augmented Reality (AR) interface for constrained Learning from Demonstration that allows users to maintain, update, and adapt learned skills. This is accomplished through in-situ visualizations of learned skills and constraint-based editing of existing skills without requiring further demonstration. We describe the existing algorithmic basis for this system as well as our Augmented Reality interface and the novel capabilities it provides. Finally, we provide three case studies that demonstrate how ARC-LfD enables users to adapt to changes in the environment or task which require a skill to be altered after initial teaching has taken place.
