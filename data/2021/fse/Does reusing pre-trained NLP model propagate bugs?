In this digital era, the textual content has become a seemingly ubiquitous part of our life. Natural Language Processing (NLP) empowers machines to comprehend the intricacies of textual data and eases human-computer interaction. Advancement in language modeling, continual learning, availability of a large amount of linguistic data, and large-scale computational power have made it feasible to train models for downstream tasks related to text analysis, including safety-critical ones, e.g., medical, airlines, etc. Compared to other deep learning (DL) models, NLP-based models are widely reused for various tasks. However, the reuse of pre-trained models in a new setting is still a complex task due to the limitations of the training dataset, model structure, specification, usage, etc. With this motivation, we study BERT, a vastly used language model (LM), from the direction of reusing in the code. We mined 80 posts from Stack Overflow related to BERT and found 4 types of bugs observed in clientsâ€™ code. Our results show that 13.75% are fairness, 28.75% are parameter, 15% are token, and 16.25% are version-related bugs.
