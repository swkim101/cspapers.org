Software is a core component of smart ecosystems, large ’system communities’ that emerge from the composition of autonomous, independent, and highly heterogeneous systems, like smart cities, smart grids, smart buildings. The systems that comprise smart ecosystems are not centrally owned, and mutually interact both explicitly and implicitly, leading to unavoidable contradictions and failures. The distinctive characteristics of smart ecosystems challenge software engineers with problems never addressed so far. In this paper we discuss the big challenge of defining a new concept of ’dependability’ and new approaches to reveal smart ecosystem failures.
