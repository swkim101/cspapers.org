We report here the reuse of theoretical insights from deep learning literature, used in a recent TSE '21 paper by Yedida & Menzies. The artifact replicated is the lower bound on the number of piecewise linear regions in the decision boundary of a feedforward neural network with ReLU activations, as studied by Montufar et al. We document the reuse of Theorem 4 from Montufar et al. by Yedida & Menzies.
