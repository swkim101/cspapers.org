Testing and other unsound analyses are developer-friendly but cannot give guarantees that programs are free of bugs. Verification and other extant sound approaches can give guarantees but often require too much effort for everyday developers. In this work, we describe our efforts to make verification more accessible for developers by using specialized pluggable typecheckers---a relatively accessible verification technology---to solve complex problems that previously required more complex and harder-to-use verification approaches.
