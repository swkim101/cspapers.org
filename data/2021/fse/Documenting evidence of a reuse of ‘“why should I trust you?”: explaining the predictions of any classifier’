We report here the following example of reuse. LIME is a local instance-based explanation generation framework that was originally proposed by Ribeiro et al. in their paper "'Why Should I Trust You?': Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier". The framework was reused by Peng et al. in their paper "Defect Reduction Planning (using TimeLIME)". The paper used the original implementation of LIME as one of the core components in the proposed framework.
