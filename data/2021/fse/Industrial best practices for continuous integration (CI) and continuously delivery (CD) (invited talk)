Industrial best practices for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuously Delivery (CD) are constantly evolving, and the state of the art is advancing quickly across the industry.

I will discuss how these systems are being optimized to reduce human and machine resources required to qualify software releases and reduce the risk of latent defects.
