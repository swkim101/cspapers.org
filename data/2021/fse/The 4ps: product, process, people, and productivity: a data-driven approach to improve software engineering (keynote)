In this talk I will provide a broad overview on developer productivity and dive deep into specific analysis related to how product, process and the people impact productivity. I will use examples from industry on effort estimation and defect prediction in product, distributed development in process and the ramp up of new employees in the people category. The talk will also cover interventions via tools and process changes and their impact and discuss future challenges. This talk will be based on previously published work.
