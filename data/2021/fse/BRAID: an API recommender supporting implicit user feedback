Efficient application programming interface (API) recommendation is one of the most desired features of modern integrated development environments. A multitude of API recommendation approaches have been proposed. However, most of the currently available API recommenders do not support the effective integration of user feedback into the recommendation loop. In this paper, we present BRAID (Boosting RecommendAtion with Implicit FeeDback), a tool which leverages user feedback, and employs learning-to-rank and active learning techniques to boost recommendation performance. The implementation is based on the VSCode plugin architecture, which provides an integrated user interface. Essentially, BRAID is a general framework which can accommodate existing query-based API recommendation approaches as components. Comparative experiments with strong baselines demonstrate the efficacy of the tool. A video demonstrating the usage of BRAID can be found at https://youtu.be/naD0guvl8sE.
