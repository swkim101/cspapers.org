Human personality has been identified as a predictor of robot acceptance in the human–robot interaction (HRI) literature. Despite this, the HRI literature has provided mixed support for this assertion. To better understand the relationship between human personality and robot acceptance, this paper conducts a meta-analysis of 26 studies. Results found a positive relationship between human personality and robot acceptance. However, this relationship varied greatly by the specific personality trait along with the study sample’s age, gender diversity, task, and global region. This meta-analysis also identified gaps in the literature. Namely, additional studies are needed that investigate both the big five personality traits and other personality traits, examine a more diverse age range, and utilize samples from previously unexamined regions of the globe.
