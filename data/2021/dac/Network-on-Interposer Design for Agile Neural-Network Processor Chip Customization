Chiplet based multi-die integration has been thought as a key enabler of the agile chip development flow. For 2.5D based multi-die system, Network on Interposer plays an essential role in the performance and the development cost of the chips. This work proposed a reusable NoI design for agile AI chip customization. The proposed NoI design can self-adapt to the inter-die communication patterns of various neural network applications, so the produced interposers can be reused across different AI chip specifications. Experimental results show the proposed NoI design brings 42.7%$\sim$79.5% of total data communication latency reduction in different scenarios, and it also decreased the area overhead by 26.4%.
