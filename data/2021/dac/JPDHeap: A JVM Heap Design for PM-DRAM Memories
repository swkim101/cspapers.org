Real-world e-commerce systems need large cache capacities. Persistent memory (PM) can be employed to enlarge JVMs’ cache capacities, meanwhile they incur heavy write slowdowns and garbage collection overheads. This paper proposes JPDheap, a JVM heap design for PM-DRAM memories. A JPDheap is composed of a standard Java heap on DRAM and another heap on PM. The core insight is to separate heap objects and store them on DRAM or PM, allowing objects to be accessed much more efficiently. Our evaluation shows that JPDheap outperforms state-of-the-art heap designs by up to 115.96% in increasing applications’ throughput and by up to 87.03% in decreasing the average latency.
