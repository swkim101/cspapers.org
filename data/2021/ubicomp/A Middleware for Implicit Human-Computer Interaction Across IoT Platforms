The Internet of Things is increasingly becoming a part of our daily life. With popular task automation or IoT platforms such as If This Then That (IFTTT), users are able to define rules to enable interactions between smart devices in their environment and thereby improve their daily lives. However, rules authored by users on these popular task automation or IoT platforms are often tied to the platform or even to the specific devices for which they have been configured, implying a vendor lock-in for users. Therefore, switching to a different task automation or IoT platform or the introduction of new devices might demand for a re-creation of the rules that are specific to the new platform and devices. In order to address this problem, we need human-computer interaction that works across IoT platforms, in particular with the proliferation of IoT services in domains such as smart health where a userâ€™s quality of life might depend on an uninterrupted service offered by a platform. In this paper, we propose an architecture to enable implicit human-computer interaction across IoT platforms by introducing the necessary concepts providing users ownership and control over their IoT data and rules.
