We present various views on the future use of augmented reality in public spaces. The views address enhanced walking, social activity, appropriation of public spaces, and futuristic social aspects of future outdoor augmented reality. Although we often refer to handheld augmented reality, the focus is on more natural ways of experiencing augmented reality. That is, not using a device at all (projection or mirror-based augmented reality) or using optical see-through smart eyewear such as smart glasses or lenses that allow the experience of ever-present vision and audio-based augmented reality.
