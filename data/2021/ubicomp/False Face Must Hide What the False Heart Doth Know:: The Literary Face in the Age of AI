This position paper examines a range of technological and algorithmic issues through the lens of literary and cultural theory about the face, in particular the ways in which emotion, expression and gesture are conveyed in literary texts. In doing this, it canvasses some of the primary aims and theoretical contexts of a new ARC project, Literature and the Face: A Critical History, which draws on literary, philosophical and visual traditions to generate comprehensive new knowledge about changing textual discourse about the face.
