Emotion detection research has gained significant attention across different scientific disciplines, including Human-Computer Interaction and Ubiquitous Computing. In this work, we provide an overview of challenges that researchers and designers face when designing and deploying emotion detection systems. We discuss these challenges in the context of an online video conferencing tool we designed to detect emotions from facial expressions. Finally, we propose ideas on how to better design emotion inference systems and how to provide visual feedback on emotions.
