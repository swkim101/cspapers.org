Sensor-based human activity recognition technology has been used for estimating human action based on the sensor data. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to render the human activity on a screen instead of classifying the activity among the activity labels. We could built this mockup of a simulator, combining our previous translation tool between signals [2] with the motion rendering systems [3]. We faced two problems which decrease the simulation ability a lot. We proposed two algorithms to increase the performance of this simulator in this preliminary work.
