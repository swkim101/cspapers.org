Recent years have shown an emergence of ubiquitous technologies that aim to monitor a personâ€™s health in their day to day. However, albeit focused at a real world setting and technically able, most research is still limited in its real-world coverage, suitability, and adoption. In this workshop, we will focus on the challenges of real world health monitoring deployments to produce forward-looking insights that can shape the way researchers and practitioners think about health monitoring, in platforms and systems that account for the complex environments where they are bound to be used.
