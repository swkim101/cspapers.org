Free-living assessment and remote monitoring is important for healthcare researchers. Moving research beyond the laboratory provides habitual environments for remote assessment that allows research to remain agile even when facing uncontrollable external factors e.g., the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Emergent technologies have the potential to make this form of assessment feasible by providing accessible and affordable mechanisms for conducting free-living research. This paper presents findings from a study that was halted due to the pandemic, but this work highlighted a series of challenges that may present themselves to researchers conducting similar work. By transparently reporting the challenges and solutions rather than just methods, it is hoped that the lessons learned from this study could provide researchers with greater awareness in future studies.
