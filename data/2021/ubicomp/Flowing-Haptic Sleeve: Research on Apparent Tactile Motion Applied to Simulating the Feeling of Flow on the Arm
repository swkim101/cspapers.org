Human-computer interaction, VR and other fields have raised higher requirements on haptic feedback. Due to good expressiveness, low cost and low technical complexity, the current researchers focused on applying the principle of apparent tactile motion to generate linear or pattern tactile motion feedback. However, there still exist limitations because these applications cannot restore the high-fidelity tactile experience that can characterize the tactile texture and fail to take the matching of real application scenarios into account. Flowing-Haptic-Sleeve was developed to combine apparent tactile motion and tactile texture to generate a situation-based high-fidelity sense of flow on the arms. This research adopted a multi-factor experiment design and conducted psychophysical experiments on tactile stimulus with 11 participants to explore the feasibility and control space of generating such tactile motion feedback. The results are useful to complement current researches on apparent tactile motion by integrating tactile motion with tactile texture.
