Gambling addiction is marked by compulsive gambling behaviors despite negative consequences in patients’ financial and social well-being. We conducted a needs assessment study and identified current difficulties to self-monitor gambling behaviors using existing technology solutions, as well as the gap to incorporate family supports in the system design. We then proposed a preliminary system design to make the information sharing among patients and family members possible by designing easy-to-use interfaces for self-reporting that allow patients’ positive interpretations, facilitating micro-sharing for family members to bring in early supports, and incorporating treatment teams knowledge of gambling addiction to interpret collected data.
