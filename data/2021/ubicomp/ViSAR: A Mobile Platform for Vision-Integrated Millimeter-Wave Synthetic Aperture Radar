The ubiquity of millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology could bring through-obstruction imaging to portable, mobile systems. Existing through-obstruction imaging systems rely on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technique, but emulating the SAR principle on handheld devices has been challenging. We propose ViSAR, a portable platform that integrates an optical camera and mmWave radar to emulate the SAR principle and enable through-obstruction 3D imaging. ViSAR synchronizes the devices at the software-level and uses the Time Domain Backprojection algorithm to generate vision-augmented mmWave images. We have experimentally evaluated ViSAR by imaging several indoor objects.
