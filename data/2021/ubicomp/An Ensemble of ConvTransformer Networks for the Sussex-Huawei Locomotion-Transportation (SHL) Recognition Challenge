The task of the SHL recognition challenge 2021 is to recognize eight modes of locomotion-transportation based on radio sequential data collected by smartphones. These data includes GPS reception, GPS location, WiFi reception and GSM cell tower scans. In this challenge, our team (Transformers) presents a recognition scheme. First, a deep model (ConvTransformer) composed of convolutional and Transformer subnets is proposed. The convolutional subnet captures local features, and the Transformer subnet constructs long-term dependencies. Then, the ConvTransformer network is used to recognize different locomotion and transportation modes through location data. Finally, since the still and subway categories are easily confused, our team uses another ConvTransformer network to further classify them through cells and location data. Through cross validation techniques on the training dataset, our proposed scheme achieved a F1 score of 0.6838 on the validation dataset.
