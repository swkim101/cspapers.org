This study explores the effectiveness of our “planning backward from the goals” technology in helping users achieve their goals, such as going to bed an hour earlier to ensure sufficient sleep, for attaining healthy lifestyles. This is achieved by encouraging them to work backwards from their end goals and change or rearrange prior activities. Our technology enables users to complete the goal-related prior activities in good order so as to achieve the goal naturally. We implemented our algorithm in a prototype system that enables users to receive advice on improving sleep habits; a four-week within-subject experiment was conducted with ten participants. The results indicate that our technology is effective in helping participants achieve their goals.
