Cycling can contribute to improvements of user’s physical and mental health, and can also bring positive impacts on the environment. However, many riders do not necessarily have a full understanding of safe bicycle riding. Existing sensing technology and mobile systems have demonstrated assistive features for car driving, and this motivates us to design a mobile application to feedback cyclist’s bicycle riding. In this paper, we present the current progress of our mobile system to perform vision-based scene analysis tailored toward the detection of potentially dangerous cycling.
