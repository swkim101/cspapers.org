The prevalence of smart eyewear, particularly in the form of eye glasses, has continuously increased. In this paper, we explore instrumenting a pair of glasses with Capacitive Sensing (CapSense) technology. We conducted three studies, in which we (1) explore a suitable CapSense setup for rapid prototyping; (2) reveal the potential of detecting facial and head gestures with a CapSense glasses prototype; and (3) investigate the technical feasibility of using a passive electric field sensing. Instead of training a low-dimensional gesture set that works across different users (e.g., eye winks), we selected a set of 12 facial and head related gestures, which we classified by relying on user-dependent machine learning models.
