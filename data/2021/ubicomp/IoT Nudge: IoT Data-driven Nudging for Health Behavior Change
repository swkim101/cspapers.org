This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT)-based concept called “IoT Nudge”, which aims to induce continuous healthful behavior changes through interactions between human users and IoT devices, including smart sensors and actuators. More specifically, IoT Nudge systems aim to establish self-reflection loops in which our daily behaviors are reflected in the IoT devices around us. The changes in the presentations of those IoT devices promote self-awareness and provide us with opportunities to improve our lifestyle habits. To reconfigure poor behavior into good behavior, the IoT Nudge provides three functions: (1) automatic tracking of a user’s lifestyle habits using IoT sensors, (2) playfully reframing the user’s daily activities into other more healthful representations based on analogies, and (3) delivering real-time ambient feedback through reframed representations from IoT actuators that encourage self-reflection. Herein, we describe our conceptual model of IoT Nudge and introduce three prototype systems aimed at promoting health improvements: fit2plant, eat2pic, and brush2music.
