Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are being deployed around the globe in critical fields such as healthcare and education. In some cases, expert practitioners in these domains are being tasked with introducing or using such systems, but have little or no insight into what data these complex systems are based on, or how they are put together. In this paper, we consider an AI system from the domain practitionerâ€™s perspective and identify key roles that are involved in system deployment. We consider the differing requirements and responsibilities of each role, and identify tensions between transparency and confidentiality that need to be addressed so that domain practitioners are able to intelligently assess whether a particular AI system is appropriate for use in their domain.
