The purpose of this study is to develop a system that continuously estimates the mental state during study time using a smartwatch equipped with a heart rate sensor and supports improvement in performance through short-term actions and long-term feedback. We verified whether different mental states (e.g., degree of focus, drowsiness, and fatigue) could be sufficiently detected during the study time using heart rate-related features from the heart rate sensor of the smartwatch. Firstly, we compared the performance of evaluation having only heart rate data for a different time window. Afterwards robustness evaluation has done for the unknown usersâ€™ data. Extra Trees Classifier fed with features extracted from 10 minutes window got the highest estimation accuracy of focus, drowsiness, and fatigue. Each mental state degree could be estimated with an average F1-Score value of more than 78.8%, which states that heart rate features may be sufficient to assess a certain degree of mental state.
