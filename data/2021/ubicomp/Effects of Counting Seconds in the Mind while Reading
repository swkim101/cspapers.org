In cognitive psychology, attention and distraction are two phenomena that do not always harmonize well with each other. Nowadays, with the vast amount of information potentially available to us, it has become challenging to avoid being distracted and remain attentive when involved in an activity. In this work, we describe a way to control distraction during reading activities. We start with an experiment to measure participants’ reading behaviors, which led to further analysis of how distractions affect readers’ capabilities. We follow this with an attempt to statistically model the cognitive states using the data from our experiment. Finally, we propose two cognitive state recognition approaches (interest and distraction) in with and without distractor conditions.
