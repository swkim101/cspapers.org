The team RY presents a solution for Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) recognition challenge, which aims at differentiating eight transportation modes with mobile phone signal sensor data in this paper. This study first extracted a set of reasonable and discriminative features after data-preprocessing. Then, decision tree bagging, random forest, lightGBM are trained separately as basic models, whose predictions are integrated and afterward smoothed. The method gets 0.65 accuracy score on validation dataset.
