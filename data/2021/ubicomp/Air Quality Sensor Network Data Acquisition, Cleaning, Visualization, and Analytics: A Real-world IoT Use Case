Monitoring and analyzing air quality is of primary importance to encourage more sustainable lifestyles and plan corrective actions. This paper presents the design and end-to-end implementation1 of a real-world urban air quality data collection and analytics use case which is a part of the TRAFAIR (Understanding Traffic Flows to Improve Air Quality) European project [1, 2]. This implementation is related to the project work done in Modena city, Italy, starting from distributed low-cost multi-sensor IoT devices installation, LoRa network setup, data collection at LoRa server database, ML-based anomaly measurement detection plus cleaning, sensor calibration, central control and visualization using designed SenseBoard [3].
