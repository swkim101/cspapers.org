Self-tracking technologies are a dominant tool employed in Human-computer Interaction (HCI) in the realm of mental health research. The majority of these tools serve as mechanisms for self-reflection in individuals with affective disorders and are often used to inform medical treatment provided by caregivers. Mood tracking, in particular, has the potential to be expanded into other explorations beyond mere trend-lines of affective states; behaviors such as emotion reappraisal and repression could be measured and influenced as a means of improving user mental health outcomes. As self-tracking technologies face numerous challenges in the motivation and engagement of persons with mental illnesses, this position paper forwards an alternative approach demonstrated through “TENOR,” an acoustic mood-tracking application designed to increase user involvement through music creation and emotional recall.
