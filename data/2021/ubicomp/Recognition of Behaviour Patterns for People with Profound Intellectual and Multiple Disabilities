People with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) are hard to understand because they are not capable of symbolic communication. Artificial intelligence can play a key role in recognizing behavior patterns with which they express themselves. It can thus assist new caregivers that are not familiar with a PIMD person. Within the INSENSION project, we developed a behavior pattern recognition approach that classifies a personâ€™s inner states and communication attempts based on his/her facial expressions, gestures, vocalizations, and physiological signals.
