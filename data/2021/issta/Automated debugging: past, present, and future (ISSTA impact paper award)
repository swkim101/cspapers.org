The paper titled “Are Automated Debugging Techniques Actually Helping Programmers?” was published in the proceedings of the International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) in 2011, and has been selected to receive the ISSTA 2021 Impact Paper Award. The paper investigated, through two user studies, how developers used and benefited from popular automated debugging techniques. The results of the studies provided (1) evidence that several assumptions made by automated debugging techniques did not hold in practice and (2) insights on limitations of existing approaches and how these limitations could be addressed. In this talk, we revisit the original paper and the work that led to it. We then assess the impact of that research by reviewing how the area of automated debugging has evolved since the paper was published. Finally, we conclude the talk by reflecting on the current state of the art in this area and discussing open issues and potential directions for future work.
