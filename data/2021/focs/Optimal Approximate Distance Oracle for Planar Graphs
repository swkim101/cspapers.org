A (<tex>$1+\epsilon$</tex>) -approximate distance oracle of an edge-weighted graph is a data structure that returns an approximate shortest path distance between any two query vertices up to a (<tex>$1+\epsilon$</tex>) factor. Thorup (FOCS 2001, JACM 2004) and Klein (SODA 2002) independently constructed a (<tex>$1+\epsilon$</tex>) -approximate distance oracle with <tex>$O(n\log n)$</tex> space, measured in number of words, and <tex>$O(1)$</tex> query time when <tex>$G$</tex> is an undirected planar graph with <tex>$n$</tex> vertices and <tex>$\epsilon$</tex> is a fixed constant. Many follow-up works gave (<tex>$1+\epsilon$</tex>) -approximate distance oracles with various trade-offs between space and query time. However, improving <tex>$O(n\log n)$</tex> space bound without sacrificing query time remains an open problem for almost two decades. In this work, we resolve this problem affirmatively by constructing a (<tex>$1+\epsilon$</tex>) approximate distance oracle with optimal <tex>$O(n)$</tex> space and <tex>$O(1)$</tex> query time for undirected planar graphs and fixed <tex>$\epsilon$</tex>. We also make substantial progress for planar digraphs with non-negative edge weights. For fixed <tex>$\epsilon > 0$</tex>, we give a (<tex>$1+\epsilon$</tex>) -approximate distance oracle with space <tex>$o(n\log(Nn))$</tex> and <tex>$O(\log\log(Nn)$</tex> query time; here <tex>$N$</tex> is the ratio between the largest and smallest positive edge weight. This improves Thorup's (FOCS 2001, JACM 2004) <tex>$O(n\log(Nn)\log n)$</tex> space bound by more than a logarithmic factor while matching the query time of his structure. This is the first improvement for planar digraphs in two decades, both in the weighted and unweighted setting.
