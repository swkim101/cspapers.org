We give an <tex>$n^{2+o(1)}$</tex>-time algorithm for finding <tex>$s-t$</tex> min-cuts for all pairs of vertices <tex>$s$</tex> and <tex>$t$</tex> in a simple, undirected graph on <tex>$n$</tex> vertices. We do so by constructing a Gomory-Hu tree (or cut equivalent tree) in the same running time, thereby improving on the recent bound of <tex>$\tilde{O}(n^{2.5})$</tex> by Abboud et al. (STOC 2021). Our running time is nearly optimal as a function of <tex>$n$</tex>.
