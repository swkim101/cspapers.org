We give an algorithm for computing exact maximum flows on graphs with <tex>$m$</tex> edges and integer capacities in the range [<tex>$1,U$</tex>] in <tex>$\tilde{O}(m^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{328}}\log U)$</tex> time.<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>We use <tex>$\tilde{O}(\cdot)$</tex> to suppress logarithmic factors in <tex>$m$</tex>. For sparse graphs with polynomially bounded integer capacities, this is the first improvement over the <tex>$\tilde{O}(m^{1.5}\log U)$</tex> time bound from [Goldberg-Rao JACM '98]. Our algorithm revolves around dynamically maintaining the augmenting electrical flows at the core of the interior point method based algorithm from [MÄ…dry JACM '16]. This entails designing data structures that, in limited settings, return edges with large electric energy in a graph undergoing resistance updates.
