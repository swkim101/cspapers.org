In 1992 Mansour proved that every size-s DNF formula is Fourier-concentrated on <tex>$s^{O(\log\log s)}$</tex> coefficients. We improve this to <tex>$s^{O(\log\log k)}$</tex> where <tex>$k$</tex> is the read number of the DNF. Since <tex>$k$</tex> is always at most <tex>$s$</tex>, our bound matches Mansour's for all DNFs and strengthens it for small-read ones. The previous best bound for read-k DNFs was <tex>$s^{O(k^{3/2})}$</tex>. For <tex>$k$</tex> up to <tex>$\tilde{\Theta}$</tex> (log log <tex>$s$</tex>), we further improve our bound to the optimal poly <tex>$(s)$</tex>; previously no such bound was known for any <tex>$k=\omega_{s}(1)$</tex>. Our techniques involve new connections between the term structure of a DNF, viewed as a set system, and its Fourier spectrum.
