Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have grown in popularity over the past decade and are now being used in safety-critical domains such as aircraft collision avoidance. This has motivated a large number of techniques for finding unsafe behavior in DNNs. In contrast, this paper tackles the problem of correcting a DNN once unsafe behavior is found. We introduce the provable repair problem, which is the problem of repairing a network N to construct a new network Nâ€² that satisfies a given specification. If the safety specification is over a finite set of points, our Provable Point Repair algorithm can find a provably minimal repair satisfying the specification, regardless of the activation functions used. For safety specifications addressing convex polytopes containing infinitely many points, our Provable Polytope Repair algorithm can find a provably minimal repair satisfying the specification for DNNs using piecewise-linear activation functions. The key insight behind both of these algorithms is the introduction of a Decoupled DNN architecture, which allows us to reduce provable repair to a linear programming problem. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our Provable Repair algorithms on a variety of challenging tasks.
