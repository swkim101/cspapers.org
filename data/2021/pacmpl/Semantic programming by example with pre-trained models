The ability to learn programs from few examples is a powerful technology with disruptive applications in many domains, as it allows users to automate repetitive tasks in an intuitive way. Existing frameworks on inductive synthesis only perform syntactic manipulations, where they rely on the syntactic structure of the given examples and not their meaning. Any semantic manipulations, such as transforming dates, have to be manually encoded by the designer of the inductive programming framework. Recent advances in large language models have shown these models to be very adept at performing semantic transformations of its input by simply providing a few examples of the task at hand. When it comes to syntactic transformations, however, these models are limited in their expressive power. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for integrating inductive synthesis with few-shot learning language models to combine the strength of these two popular technologies. In particular, the inductive synthesis is tasked with breaking down the problem in smaller subproblems, among which those that cannot be solved syntactically are passed to the language model. We formalize three semantic operators that can be integrated with inductive synthesizers. To minimize invoking expensive semantic operators during learning, we introduce a novel deferred query execution algorithm that considers the operators to be oracles during learning. We evaluate our approach in the domain of string transformations: the combination methodology can automate tasks that cannot be handled using either technologies by themselves. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach via a case study in the domain of string profiling.
