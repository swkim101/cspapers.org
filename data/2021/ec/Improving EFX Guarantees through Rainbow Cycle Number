We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods among n agents with additive valuations. Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is arguably the most compelling fairness notion in this context. However, the existence of EFX allocations has not been settled and is one of the most important problems in fair division [5]. Towards resolving this problem, many impressive results show the existence of its relaxations. In particular, [1] shows the existence of 0.618-EFX allocations, and [4] shows that EFX allocation exists if we do not allocate at most n - 1 goods. The latter result was recently improved for three agents in [2], in which the two unallocated goods are allocated through an involved procedure. Reducing the number of unallocated goods for an arbitrary number of agents is a systematic way to settle the big question.
