Voting mechanisms often exhibit a large multiplicity of equilibria. In many of these equilibria, coordination failures among voters arise where some (coalition of) voters could have induced an outcome that they all prefer to the equilibrium outcome had they agreed on a common strategy. In order to prevent these failures, we study voting mechanisms requiring that every Nash equilibrium is coalition-proof ([1]) so that, in equilibrium, no coalition of voters has some mutually beneficial deviation. The described mechanisms achieve coalitional implementation, that is they implement social choice rules in both Nash and in coalition-proof equilibria. Our approach assumes complete information and is hence well-suited for voting mechanisms for small committees. We consider a committee of n voters selecting one out of k alternatives. The main focus of the paper is on the case with k > n which is a natural environment for a small committee. The first part of the paper considers the simultaneous veto (SV) mechanisms. In each of these mechanisms, each voter has the right to select a list of alternatives to veto, and the outcome is selected randomly from the nonvetoed alternatives. Each such equilibrium admits a pure strategy equilibrium for each preference profile assuming that voters' preferences over lotteries satisfy the mild assumption of stochastic dominance. In equilibrium, no pair of voters veto the same alternative. As we show, for each specification of the veto rights, each of these mechanisms coalitionally implements a Veto by random priority rule (VRP) introduced by [6].
