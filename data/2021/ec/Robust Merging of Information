A consumer can acquire information from different review platforms before buying a product, a graduate student often seeks advice from multiple faculty members when pursuing a new project, and an investor often solicits the recommendations of different financial consultants. In all these settings, different sources of information are potentially correlated: different review platforms may include reviews from the same reviewer, opinions of faculty members in the same department are rarely independent, and different financial consultants themselves often collect information from the same data provider such as Bloomberg. However, knowledge about these underlying correlations is often very limited. In such circumstances, how can one combine and make use of multiple information sources while being robust to the hidden correlations? We study a model where an agent confronts a binary state decision problem after observing signals generated from distinct information sources (Blackwell experiments). The agent fully understands each information source in isolation but has no knowledge about the correlations between different information sources, and thus chooses a decision plan that maximizes the expected payoff with respect to the worst possible correlation. We call such a decision plan, the robustly optimal strategy.
