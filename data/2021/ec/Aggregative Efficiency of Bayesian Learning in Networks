In social-learning settings where individuals receive private signals and observe network neighbors' actions, the network structure often obstructs information aggregation. We consider sequential social learning with rational agents and Gaussian signals and ask how the efficiency of signal aggregation changes with the network. Rational actions in our model are a log-linear function of observations and admit a signal-counting interpretation of accuracy. This leads to a detailed ranking of networks for social learning based on their aggregative efficiency index. Networks where agents observe multiple neighbors but not their common predecessors confound information, and we show confounding can make learning very inefficient. In a class of networks where agents move in generations and observe the previous generation, aggregative efficiency is a simple function of network parameters: increasing in observations and decreasing in confounding. Generations after the first contribute very little additional information due to confounding, even when generations are arbitrarily large.
