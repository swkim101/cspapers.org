As current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices suffer from decoherence errors, any delay in the instruction execution of quantum control microarchitecture can lead to the loss of quantum information and incorrect computation results. Hence, it is crucial for the control microarchitecture to issue quantum operations to the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in time. As in classical microarchitecture, parallelism in quantum programs needs to be exploited for speedup. However, three challenges emerge in the quantum scenario: 1) the quantum feedback control can introduce significant pipeline stall latency; 2) timing control is required for all quantum operations; 3) QPU requires a deterministic operation supply to prevent the accumulation of quantum errors. In this paper, we propose a novel control microarchitecture design to exploit Circuit Level Parallelism (CLP) and Quantum Operation Level Parallelism (QOLP). Firstly, we develop a Multiprocessor architecture to exploit CLP, which supports dynamic scheduling of different sub-circuits. This architecture can handle parallel feedback control and minimize the potential overhead that disrupts the timing control. Secondly, we propose a Quantum Superscalar approach that exploits QOLP by efficiently executing massive quantum instructions in parallel. Both methods issue quantum operations to QPU deterministically. In the benchmark test of a Shor syndrome measurement, a six-core implementation of our proposal achieves up to 2.59 × speedup compared with a single core. For various canonical quantum computing algorithms, our superscalar approach achieves an average of 4.04 × improvement over a baseline design. Finally, We perform a simultaneous randomized benchmarking (simRB) experiment on a real QPU using the proposed microarchitecture for validation.
