Using transformers over large generated datasets, we train models to learn mathematical properties of diﬀerential systems, such as local stability, behavior at inﬁnity and controllability. We achieve near perfect prediction of qualitative characteristics, and good approximations of numerical features of the system. This demonstrates that neural networks can learn to perform complex computations, grounded in advanced theory, from examples, without built-in mathematical knowledge
