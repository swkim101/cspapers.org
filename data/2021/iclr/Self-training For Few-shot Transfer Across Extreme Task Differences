All few-shot learning techniques must be pre-trained on a large, labeled "base dataset". In problem domains where such large labeled datasets are not available for pre-training (e.g., X-ray images), one must resort to pre-training in a different "source" problem domain (e.g., ImageNet), which can be very different from the desired target task. Traditional few-shot and transfer learning techniques fail in the presence of such extreme differences between the source and target tasks. In this paper, we present a simple and effective solution to tackle this extreme domain gap: self-training a source domain representation on unlabeled data from the target domain. We show that this improves one-shot performance on the target domain by 2.9 points on average on a challenging benchmark with multiple domains.
