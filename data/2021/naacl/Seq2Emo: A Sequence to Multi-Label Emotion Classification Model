Multi-label emotion classification is an important task in NLP and is essential to many applications. In this work, we propose a sequence-to-emotion (Seq2Emo) approach, which implicitly models emotion correlations in a bi-directional decoder. Experiments on SemEvalâ€™18 and GoEmotions datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods (without using external data). In particular, Seq2Emo outperforms the binary relevance (BR) and classifier chain (CC) approaches in a fair setting.
