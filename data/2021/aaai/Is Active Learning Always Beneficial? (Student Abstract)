This study highlights the limitations of automated curriculum learning, which may not be a viable strategy for tasks in which the benefits of the chosen curriculum are not apparent until much later. Using a simple convolutional network and a two-task training regime, we show that in some cases a network is not able to derive an optimal learning strategy using only the data available during a single training run.
