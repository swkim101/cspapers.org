Convolutional neural network (CNN) models have achieved
great success in many fields. With the advent of ResNet, networks
used in practice are getting deeper and wider. However,
is each layer non-trivial in networks? To answer this
question, we trained a network on the training set, then we
replace the network convolution kernels with zeros and test
the result models on the test set. We compared experimental
results with baseline and showed that we can reach similar or
even the same performances. Although convolution kernels
are the cores of networks, we demonstrate that some of them
are trivial and regular in ResNet.
