This paper aims to bridge this gap between neuro-symbolic learning (NSL) and
graph neural networks (GNN) approaches and provide a comparative study. We
argue that the natural evolution of NSL leads to GNNs, while the logic
programming foundations of NSL can bring powerful tools to improve the way 
information is represented and pre-processed for the GNN. In order to make
this comparison, we propose HetSAGE, a GNN architecture that can efficiently
deal with the resulting heterogeneous graphs that represent typical NSL
learning problems. We show that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art on 3 NSL tasks: CORA, MUTA188 and MovieLens.
