In this paper, we focus on the Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) problem, which involves finding exhaustive and disjoint partitions of agents such that the efficiency of the entire system is optimized. We propose an efficient hybrid algorithm for optimal coalition structure generation called BOSS. When compared to the state-of-the-art, BOSS is shown to perform better by up to 33.63% on benchmark inputs. The maximum time gain by BOSS is 3392 seconds for 27 agents.
