In this work, we consider distance-based clustering of partial lexicographic
preference trees (PLP-trees), intuitive and compact graphical representations 
of user preferences over multi-valued attributes. To compute distances between 
PLP-trees, we propose a polynomial time algorithm that computes Kendall's 
Tau distance directly from the trees and show its efficacy compared to the 
brute-force algorithm. To this end, we implement several clustering methods 
(i.e., spectral clustering, affinity propagation, and agglomerative nesting) 
augmented by our distance algorithm, experiment with clustering of up to 10,000 
PLP-trees, and show the effectiveness of the clustering methods and visualizations 
of their results.
