This paper represents object instance as a terrace, where the height of terrace corresponds to object attention while the evolution of layers from peak to sea level represents the complexity in drawing the finer boundary of an object. A multitask neural network is presented to learn the terrace representation. The attention of terrace is leveraged for instance counting, and the layers provide prior for easy-to-hard pathway of progressive instance segmentation. We study the model for counting and segmentation for a variety of food instances, ranging from Chinese, Japanese to Western food. This paper presents how the terrace model deals with arbitrary shape, size, obscure boundary and occlusion of instances, where other techniques are currently short of.
