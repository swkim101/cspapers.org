The diversified top-k s-plex (DTKSP) search problem aims to find k maximal s-plexes that cover the maximum number of vertices with lower overlapping in a given graph. In this paper, we first formalize the diversified top-k s-plex search problem and prove the NP-hardness of it. Second, we proposed a local search algorithm for solving the diversified top-k s-plex search problem based on some novel ideas. Experiments on real-world massive graphs show the effectiveness of our algorithm.
