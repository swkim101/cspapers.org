Currently the unified semantic role labeling (SRL) that achieves predicate identification and argument role labeling in an end-to-end manner has received growing interests. Recent works show that leveraging the syntax knowledge significantly enhances the SRL performances. In this paper, we investigate a novel unified SRL framework based on the sequence-to-sequence architecture with double enhancement in both the encoder and decoder sides. In the encoder side, we propose a novel label-aware graph convolutional network (LA-GCN) to encode both the syntactic dependent arcs and labels into BERT-based word representations. In the decoder side, we creatively design a pointer-network-based model for detecting predicates, arguments and roles jointly. Our pointer-net decoder is able to make decisions by consulting all the input elements in a global view, and meanwhile it is syntactic-aware by incorporating the syntax information from LA-GCN. Besides, a high-order interacted attention is introduced into the decoder for leveraging previously recognized triplets to help the current decision. Empirical experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms all existing graph-based methods on the CoNLL09 and Universal Proposition Bank datasets. In-depth analysis demonstrates that our model can effectively capture the correlations between syntactic and SRL structures.
