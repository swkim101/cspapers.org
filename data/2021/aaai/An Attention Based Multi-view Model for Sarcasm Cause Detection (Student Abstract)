Sarcasm often relates to peopleâ€™s implicit discontent with certain products and policies. Existing research mainly focus on sarcasm detection, while the deep causal relationships in the full conversation remained unexplored. This paper formulates a novel research question of sarcasm cause detection, and proposes an attention based model that simultaneously captures different semantic associations as well as the inner causal logics in multi-view manner. Experiments on public Reddit dataset prove the efficacy of the proposed model.
