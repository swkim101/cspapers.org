Locating and classifying clothes, usually referred to as clothing detection, is a fundamental task in fashion analysis. Motivated by the strong structural characteristics of clothes, we pursue a detection method enhanced by clothing keypoints, which is a compact and effective representation of structures. To incorporate the keypoint cues into clothing detection, we design a simple yet effective Keypoint-Guided clothing Detector, named KGDet. Such a detector can fully utilize information provided by keypoints with the following two aspects: i) integrating local features around keypoints to benefit both classification and regression; ii) generating accurate bounding boxes from keypoints. To effectively incorporate local features , two alternative modules are proposed. One is a multi-column keypoint-encoding-based feature aggregation module; the other is a keypoint-selection-based feature aggregation module. With either of the above modules as a bridge, a cascade strategy is introduced to refine detection performance progressively. Thanks to the keypoints, our KGDet obtains superior performance on the DeepFashion2 dataset and the FLD dataset with high efficiency.
