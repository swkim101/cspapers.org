Image-based virtual try-on aims to synthesize the customer image with an in-shop clothes image to acquire seamless and natural try-on results, which have attracted increasing attentions. The main procedures of image-based virtual try-on usually consist of clothes image generation and try-on image synthesis, whereas prior arts cannot guarantee satisfying clothes results when facing large geometric changes and complex clothes patterns, which further deteriorates the afterwards try-on results. To address this issue, we propose a novel virtual try-on network based on landmark-guided shape matching (LM-VTON). Specifically, the clothes image generation progressively learns the warped clothes and refined clothes in an end-to-end manner, where we introduce a landmark-based constraint in Thin-Plate Spline (TPS) warping to inject finer deformation constraints around the clothes. The try-on process synthesizes the warped clothes with personal characteristics via a semantic indicator. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public datasets validate the superiority of the proposed method, especially for challenging cases such as large geometric changes and complex clothes patterns.
