Brain activation can reflect semantic information elicited by natural words and concepts. Increasing research has been conducted on decoding such neural activation patterns using representational semantic models. However, prior work decoding semantic meaning from neurophysiological responses has been largely limited to ECoG, fMRI, MEG, and EEG techniques, each having its own advantages and limitations. More recently, the functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as an alternative hemodynamic-based approach and possesses a number of strengths. We investigate brain decoding tasks under the help of fNIRS and empirically compare fNIRS with fMRI. Primarily, we find that: 1) like fMRI scans, activation patterns recorded from fNIRS encode rich information for discriminating concepts, but show limits on the possibility of decoding fine-grained semantic clues; 2) fNIRS decoding shows robustness across different brain regions, semantic categories and even subjects; 3) fNIRS has higher accuracy being decoded based on multi-channel patterns as compared to single-channel ones, which is in line with our intuition of the working mechanism of human brain. Our findings prove that fNIRS has the potential to promote a deep integration of NLP and cognitive neuroscience from the perspective of language understanding. We release the largest fNIRS dataset by far to facilitate future research.
