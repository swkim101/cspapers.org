Without prohibitive and laborious 3D annotations, weakly-supervised 3D human pose methods mainly employ the model regularization with geometric projection consistency or geometry estimation from multi-view images. Nevertheless, those approaches explicitly need known parameters of calibrated cameras, exhibiting a limited model generalization in various realistic scenarios. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose a Deductive Weakly-Supervised Learning (DWSL) for 3D human pose machine. Our DWSL firstly learns latent representations on depth and camera pose for 3D pose reconstruction. Since weak supervision usually causes ill-conditioned learning or inferior estimation, our DWSL introduces deductive reasoning to make an inference for the human pose from a view to another and develops a reconstruction loss to demonstrate what the model learns and infers is reliable. 
This learning by deduction strategy employs the view-transform demonstration and structural rules derived from depth, geometry and angle constraints, which improves the reliability of the model training with weak supervision. On three 3D human pose benchmarks, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed method, which achieves superior performance in comparison with state-of-the-art weak-supervised methods. Particularly, our model shows an appealing potential for learning from 2D data captured in dynamic outdoor scenes, which demonstrates promising robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios.
