A theory in first-order logic is a set of sentences. A parameterized theory is a first-order theory with some of its predicates and functions identified as parameters, together with some import statements that call other parameterized theories. A KB is then a collection of these interconnected parameterised theories, similar to how a computer program is constructed as a set of functions in a modern programming language. In this paper, we provide a translational semantics for these parameterized theories in first-order logic using the situation calculus. We also discuss their potential uses in areas such as multi-context reasoning and logical formalization of computer programs.
