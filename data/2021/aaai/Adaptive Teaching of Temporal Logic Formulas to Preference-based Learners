Machine teaching is an algorithmic framework for teaching a
target hypothesis via a sequence of examples or demonstrations.
We investigate machine teaching for temporal logic
formulasâ€”a novel and expressive hypothesis class amenable
to time-related task specifications. In the context of teaching
temporal logic formulas, an exhaustive search even for a myopic
solution takes exponential time (with respect to the time
span of the task). We propose an efficient approach for teaching
parametric linear temporal logic formulas. Concretely,
we derive a necessary condition for the minimal time length
of a demonstration to eliminate a set of hypotheses. Utilizing
this condition, we propose an efficient myopic teaching algorithm
by solving a sequence of integer programming problems.
We further show that, under two notions of teaching
complexity, the proposed algorithm has near-optimal performance.
We evaluate our algorithm extensively under different
classes of learners (i.e., learners with different preferences
over hypotheses) and interaction protocols (e.g., non-adaptive
and adaptive). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm in teaching temporal logic formulas;
in particular, we show that there are significant gains of
teaching efficacy when the teacher adapts to feedback of the
learner, or adapts to a (non-myopic) oracle.
