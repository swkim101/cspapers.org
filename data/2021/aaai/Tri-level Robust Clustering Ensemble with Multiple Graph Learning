Clustering ensemble generates a consensus clustering result by integrating multiple weak base clustering results. Although it often provides more robust results compared with single clustering methods, it still suffers from the robustness problem if it does not treat the unreliability of base results carefully. Conventional clustering ensemble methods often use all data for ensemble, while ignoring the noises or outliers on the data. Although some robust clustering ensemble methods are proposed, which extract the noises on the data, they still characterize the robustness in a single level, and thus they cannot comprehensively handle the complicated robustness problem. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a novel Tri-level Robust Clustering Ensemble (TRCE) method by transforming the clustering ensemble problem to a multiple graph learning problem. Just as its name implies, the proposed method tackles robustness problem in three levels: base
clustering level, graph level and instance level. By considering the robustness problem in a more comprehensive way, the proposed TRCE can achieve a more robust consensus clustering result. Experimental results on benchmark datasets also demonstrate it. Our method often outperforms other state-of-the-art clustering ensemble methods. Even compared with the robust ensemble methods, ours also performs better.
