The paper studies planar surface reconstruction of indoor scenes from two views with unknown camera poses. While prior approaches have successfully created object-centric reconstructions of many scenes, they fail to exploit other structures, such as planes, which are typically the dominant components of indoor scenes. In this paper, we re-construct planar surfaces from multiple views, while jointly estimating camera pose. Our experiments demonstrate that our method is able to advance the state of the art of re-construction from sparse views, on challenging scenes from Matterport3D.
