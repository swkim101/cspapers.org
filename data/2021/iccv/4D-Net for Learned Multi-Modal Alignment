We present 4D-Net, a 3D object detection approach, which utilizes 3D Point Cloud and RGB sensing information, both in time. We are able to incorporate the 4D information by performing a novel dynamic connection learning across various feature representations and levels of abstraction, as well as by observing geometric constraints. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art and strong base-lines on the Waymo Open Dataset. 4D-Net is better able to use motion cues and dense image information to detect distant objects more successfully. We will open source the code.
