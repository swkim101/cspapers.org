Geometric constraints are shown to enforce scale consistency and remedy the scale ambiguity issue in self-supervised monocular depth estimation. Meanwhile, scale-invariant losses focus on learning relative depth, leading to accurate relative depth prediction. To combine the best of both worlds, we learn scale-consistent self-supervised depth in a scale-invariant manner. Towards this goal, we present a scale-aware geometric (SAG) loss, which enforces scale consistency through point cloud alignment. Compared to prior arts, SAG loss takes relative scale into consideration during relative motion estimation, enabling more precise alignment and explicit supervision for scale inference. In addition, a novel two-stream architecture for depth estimation is designed, which disentangles scale from depth estimation and allows depth to be learned in a scale-invariant manner. The integration of SAG loss and two-stream network enables more consistent scale inference and more accurate relative depth estimation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under both scale-invariant and scale-dependent evaluation settings.
