Based on the relaxed search space, differential architecture search (DARTS) is efficient in searching for a high-performance architecture. However, the unbalanced competition among operations that have different trainable parameters causes the model collapse. Besides, the inconsistent structures in the search and retraining stages causes cross-stage evaluation to be unstable. In this paper, we call these issues as an operation gap and a structure gap in DARTS. To shrink these gaps, we propose to induce equalized and consistent optimization in differentiable architecture search (EC-DARTS). EC-DARTS decouples different operations based on their categories to optimize the operation weights so that the operation gap between them is shrinked. Besides, we introduce an induced structural transition to bridge the structure gap between the model structures in the search and retraining stages. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, on CIFAR10, we achieve a test error of 2.39%, while only 0.3 GPU days on NVIDIA TITAN V. On ImageNet, our method achieves a top-1 error of 23.6% under the mobile setting.
