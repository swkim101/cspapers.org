Recently, Cross-Modal Hamming space Retrieval (CMHR) regains ever-increasing attention, mainly benefiting from the excellent representation capability of deep neural networks. On the other hand, the vulnerability of deep networks exposes a deep cross-modal retrieval system to various safety risks (e.g., adversarial attack). However, attacking deep cross-modal Hamming retrieval remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an effective Adversarial Attack on Deep Cross-Modal Hamming Retrieval, dubbed AACH, which fools a target deep CMHR model in a black-box setting. Specifically, given a target model, we first construct its substitute model to exploit cross-modal correlations within hamming space, with which we create adversarial examples by limitedly querying from a target model. Furthermore, to enhance the efficiency of adversarial attacks, we design a triplet construction module to exploit cross-modal positive and negative instances. In this way, perturbations can be learned to fool the target model through pulling perturbed examples far away from the positive instances whereas pushing them close to the negative ones. Extensive experiments on three widely used cross-modal (image and text) retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AACH. We find that AACH can successfully attack a given target deep CMHR model with fewer interactions, and that its performance is on par with previous state-of-the-art attacks.
