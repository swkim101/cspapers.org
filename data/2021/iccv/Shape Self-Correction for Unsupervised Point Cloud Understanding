We develop a novel self-supervised learning method named Shape Self-Correction for point cloud analysis. Our method is motivated by the principle that a good shape representation should be able to find distorted parts of a shape and correct them. To learn strong shape representations in an unsupervised manner, we first design a shape-disorganizing module to destroy certain local shape parts of an object. Then the destroyed shape and the normal shape are sent into a point cloud network to get representations, which are employed to segment points that belong to distorted parts and further reconstruct them to restore the shape to normal. To perform better in these two associated pretext tasks, the network is constrained to capture useful shape features from the object, which indicates that the point cloud network encodes rich geometric and contextual information. The learned feature extractor transfers well to downstream classification and segmentation tasks. Experimental results on ModelNet, ScanNet and ShapeNetPart demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods. Our framework can be applied to a wide range of deep learning networks for point cloud analysis and we show experimentally that pre-training with our framework significantly boosts the performance of supervised models.
