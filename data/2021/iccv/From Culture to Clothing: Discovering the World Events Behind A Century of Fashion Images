Fashion is intertwined with external cultural factors, but identifying these links remains a manual process limited to only the most salient phenomena. We propose a data-driven approach to identify specific cultural factors affecting the clothes people wear. Using large-scale datasets of news articles and vintage photos spanning a century, we present a multi-modal statistical model to detect influence relationships between happenings in the world and peopleâ€™s choice of clothing. Furthermore, on two image datasets we apply our model to improve the concrete vision tasks of visual style forecasting and photo timestamping. Our work is a first step towards a computational, scalable, and easily refreshable approach to link culture to clothing.
