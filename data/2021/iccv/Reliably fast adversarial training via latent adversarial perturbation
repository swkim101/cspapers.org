While multi-step adversarial training is widely popular as an effective defense method against strong adversarial attacks, its computational cost is notoriously expensive, compared to standard training. Several single-step adversarial training methods have been proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned overhead cost; however, their performance is not sufficiently reliable depending on the optimization setting. To overcome such limitations, we deviate from the existing input-space-based adversarial training regime and propose a single-step latent adversarial training method (SLAT), which leverages the gradients of latent representation as the latent adversarial perturbation. We demonstrate that the â„“1 norm of feature gradients is implicitly regularized through the adopted latent perturbation, thereby recovering local linearity and ensuring reliable performance, compared to the existing single-step adversarial training methods. Because latent perturbation is based on the gradients of the latent representations which can be obtained for free in the process of input gradients computation, the proposed method costs roughly the same time as the fast gradient sign method. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method, despite its structural simplicity, outperforms state-of-the-art accelerated adversarial training methods.
