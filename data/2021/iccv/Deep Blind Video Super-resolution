Existing video super-resolution (SR) algorithms usually assume that the blur kernels in the degradation process are known and do not model the blur kernels in the restoration. However, this assumption does not hold for blind video SR and usually leads to over-smoothed super-resolved frames. In this paper, we propose an effective blind video SR algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our algorithm first estimates blur kernels from low-resolution (LR) input videos. Then, with the estimated blur kernels, we develop an effective image deconvolution method based on the image formation model of blind video SR to generate intermediate latent frames so that sharp image contents can be restored well. To effectively explore the information from adjacent frames, we estimate the motion fields from LR input videos, extract features from LR videos by a feature extraction network, and warp the extracted features from LR inputs based on the motion fields. Moreover, we develop an effective sharp feature exploration method which first extracts sharp features from restored intermediate latent frames and then uses a transformation operation based on the extracted sharp features and warped features from LR inputs to generate better features for HR video restoration. We formulate the proposed algorithm into an end-to-end trainable framework and show that it performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.
