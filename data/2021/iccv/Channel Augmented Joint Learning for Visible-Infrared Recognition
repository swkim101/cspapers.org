This paper introduces a powerful channel augmented joint learning strategy for the visible-infrared recognition problem. For data augmentation, most existing methods directly adopt the standard operations designed for single-modality visible images, and thus do not fully consider the imagery properties in visible to infrared matching. Our basic idea is to homogenously generate color-irrelevant images by randomly exchanging the color channels. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing augmentation operations without modifying the network, consistently improving the robustness against color variations. Incorporated with a random erasing strategy, it further greatly enriches the diversity by simulating random occlusions. For cross-modality metric learning, we design an enhanced channel-mixed learning strategy to simultaneously handle the intra-and cross-modality variations with squared difference for stronger discriminability. Besides, a channel-augmented joint learning strategy is further developed to explicitly optimize the outputs of augmented images. Extensive experiments with insightful analysis on two visible-infrared recognition tasks show that the proposed strategies consistently improve the accuracy. Without auxiliary information, it improves the state-of-the-art Rank-1/mAP by 14.59%/13.00% on the large-scale SYSU-MM01 dataset.
