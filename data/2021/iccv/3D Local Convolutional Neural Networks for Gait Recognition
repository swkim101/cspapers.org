Our 3D local convolutional networks (3D local CNN) can incorporate part-specific sequential information. Inside the novel building block, a localization module is designed to dynamically localize the local 3D volumes in a sequence with adaptive spatial and temporal scales, locations and lengths. Specifically, we utilize a block with convolution, ReLU, batch normalization, max pooling and fully connected layers as the localization module. The detailed architecture of the localization module is presented in Table 1. The output of the localization module is a set of local volumes whose locations are denoted by 8 parameters (∆x,∆y,∆t, δx, δy, δt, σ , γ). Moreover, examples of part localization in more views (18◦ to 72◦) are illustrated in Fig. 1. The colorful patches denote the localized 3D volumes for each human body part. Different 3D volumes have different spatial positions, scales and temporal lengths. The result show that given the predefined center (cx, cy, ct) of the part, the localization module is able to precisely adjust the corresponding volume with respect to each view.
