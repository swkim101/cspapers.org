Unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) remains challenging due to the lack of ground-truth labels. Existing methods often rely on estimated pseudo labels via iterative clustering and classification, and they are unfortunately highly susceptible to performance penalties incurred by the inaccurate estimated number of clusters. Alternatively, we propose the Meta Pairwise Relationship Distillation (MPRD) method to estimate the pseudo labels of sample pairs for unsupervised person Re-ID. Specifically, it consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), in which the GCN estimates the pseudo labels of sample pairs based on the current features extracted by CNN, and the CNN learns better features by involving high-fidelity positive and negative sample pairs imposed by GCN. To achieve this goal, a small amount of labeled samples are used to guide GCN training, which can distill meta knowledge to judge the difference in the neighborhood structure between positive and negative sample pairs. Extensive experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.
