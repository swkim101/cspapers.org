This paper focuses on the problem of low-rank tensor completion, the goal of which is to recover an underlying low-rank tensor from incomplete observations. Our method is motivated by the recently proposed t-product [8] based on any invertible linear transforms. First, we define the new tensor average rank under the invertible real linear trans-forms. We then propose a tensor completion model using a nonconvex surrogate to approximate the tensor average rank. This surrogate overcomes the discontinuity of the tensor average rank and alleviates the bias problem caused by the convex relaxation. Further, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed model and establish its convergence. Finally, experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority of our method.
