Developing deep neural networks to generate 3D scenes is a fundamental problem in neural synthesis with immediate applications in architectural CAD, computer graphics, as well as in generating virtual robot training environments. This task is challenging because 3D scenes exhibit diverse patterns, ranging from continuous ones, such as object sizes and the relative poses between pairs of shapes, to discrete patterns, such as occurrence and co-occurrence of objects with symmetrical relationships. This paper introduces a novel neural scene synthesis approach that can capture diverse feature patterns of 3D scenes. Our method combines the strength of both neural network-based and conventional scene synthesis approaches. We use the parametric prior distributions learned from training data, which provide uncertainties of object attributes and relative attributes, to regularize the outputs of feed-forward neural models. Moreover, instead of merely predicting a scene layout, our approach predicts an over-complete set of attributes. This methodology allows us to utilize the underlying consistency constraints among the predicted attributes to prune infeasible predictions. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods considerably. The generated 3D scenes interpolate the training data faithfully while preserving both continuous and discrete feature patterns.
