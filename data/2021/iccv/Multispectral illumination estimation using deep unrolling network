This paper examines the problem of illumination spectra estimation in multispectral images. We cast the problem into a constrained matrix factorization problem and present a method for both single-global and multiple illumination estimation in which a deep unrolling network is constructed from the alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM) optimization for solving the matrix factorization problem. To alleviate the lack of multispectral training data, we build a large multispectral reflectance image dataset for generating synthesized data and use them for training and evaluating our model. The results of simulations and real experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to outperform state-of-the-art spectral illumination estimation methods, and that it generalizes well to a wide variety of scenes and spectra.
