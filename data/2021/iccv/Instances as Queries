We present QueryInst, a new perspective for instance segmentation. QueryInst is a multi-stage end-to-end system that treats instances of interest as learnable queries, enabling query based object detectors, e.g., Sparse RCNN, to have strong instance segmentation performance. The attributes of instances such as categories, bounding boxes, instance masks, and instance association embeddings are represented by queries in a unified manner. In QueryInst, a query is shared by both detection and segmentation via dynamic convolutions and driven by parallellysupervised multi-stage learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., COCO, CityScapes, and YouTube-VIS to evaluate the effectiveness of QueryInst in object detection, instance segmentation, and video instance segmentation tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a simple end-to-end query based framework can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in various instance-level recognition tasks.
