Learning to model how the world changes as time elapses has proven a challenging problem for the computer vision community. We introduce a self-supervised approach to this problem that solves a multi-modal temporal cycle consistency objective jointly in vision and language. This objective requires a model to learn modality-agnostic functions to predict the future and past that undo each other when composed. We hypothesize that a model trained on this objective will discover long-term temporal dynamics in video. We verify this hypothesis by using the resultant visual representations and predictive models as-is to solve a variety of downstream tasks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised video prediction methods on future action anticipation, temporal image ordering, and arrow-of-time classification tasks, without training on target datasets or their labels.
