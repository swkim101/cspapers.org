The training of a deep face recognition system usually faces the interference of label noise in the training data. However, it is difficult to obtain a high-precision cleaning model to remove these noises. In this paper, we propose an adaptive label noise cleaning algorithm based on meta-learning for face recognition datasets, which can learn the distribution of the data to be cleaned and make automatic adjustments based on class differences. It first learns re-liable cleaning knowledge from well-labeled noisy data, then gradually transfers it to the target data with meta-supervision to improve performance. A threshold adapter module is also proposed to address the drift problem in transfer learning methods. Extensive experiments clean two noisy in-the-wild face recognition datasets and show the effectiveness of the proposed method to reach state-of-the-art performance on the IJB-C face recognition benchmark.
