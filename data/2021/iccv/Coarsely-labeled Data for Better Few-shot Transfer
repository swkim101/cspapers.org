Few-shot learning is based on the premise that labels are expensive, especially when they are fine-grained and require expertise. But coarse labels might be easy to acquire and thus abundant. We present a representation learning approach - PAS that allows few-shot learners to leverage coarsely-labeled data available before evaluation. Inspired by self-training, we label the additional data using a teacher trained on the base dataset and filter the teacherâ€™s prediction based on the coarse labels; a new student representation is then trained on the base dataset and the pseudo-labeled dataset. PAS is able to produce a representation that consistently and significantly outperforms the baselines in 3 different datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/cpphoo/PAS
