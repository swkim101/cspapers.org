Consider a seller seeking a selling mechanism to maximize the worst-case revenue obtained from a buyer whose valuation distribution lies in a certain ambiguity set. For a generic convex ambiguity set, we show via the minimax theorem that strong duality holds between the problem of ﬁnding the optimal robust mechanism and a minimax pricing problem where the adversary ﬁrst chooses a worst-case distribution and then the seller decides the best posted price mechanism. This observation connects prior literature that separately studies the primal (robust mechanism design) and problems related to the dual ( e
