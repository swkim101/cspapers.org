This paper reports our five-year lessons of developing and using MobileInsight, an open-source community tool to enable software-defined full-stack, runtime mobile network analytics inside our phones. We present how MobileInsight evolves from a simple monitor to a community toolset with cross-layer analytics, energy-efficient real-time user-plane analytics, and extensible user-friendly analytics at the control and user planes. These features are enabled by various novel techniques, including cross-layer state machine tracking, missing data inference, and domain-specific cross-layer sampling. Their powerfulness is exemplified with a 5-year longitudinal study of operational mobile network latency using a 6.4TB dataset with 6.1 billion over-the-air messages. We further share lessons and insights of using MobileInsight by the community, as well as our visions of MobileInsight's past, present, and future.
