The co-existence of activation sparsity and model sparsity in convolutional neural network (CNN) models makes sparsity-aware CNN hardware designs very attractive. The existing sparse CNN accelerators utilize intersection operation to search and identify the key positions of the matched entries between two sparse vectors, and hence avoid unnecessary computations. However, these state-of-the-art designs still suffer from three major architecture-level drawbacks, including 1) hardware cost for the intersection operation is high; 2) frequent stalls of computation phase due to strong data dependency between intersection and computation phases; and 3) unnecessary data transfer incurred by the explicit intersection operation.By leveraging the knowledge of the complete sparse 2-D convolution, this paper proposes two key ideas that overcome all of the three drawbacks. First, an implicit on-the-fly intersection is proposed to realize the optimal solution for intersection between one static stream and one dynamic stream, which is the case for sparse neural network inference. Second, by leveraging the global computation structure of 2-D convolution, we propose a specialized computation reordering to ensure that the activation is only transferred if necessary and only once.Based on these two key ideas, we develop GoSPA, an energy-efficient high-performance Globally Optimized SParse CNN Accelerator. GoSPA is implemented with CMOS 28nm technology. Compared with the state-of-the-art sparse CNN architecture, GoSPA achieves average 1.38×, 1.28×, 1.23×, 1.17×, 1.21× and 1.28× speedup on AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, ResNet and ResNeXt workloads, respectively. Also, GoSPA achieves 5.38×, 4.96×, 4.79×, 5.02×, 4.86× and 2.06× energy efficiency improvement on AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, ResNet and ResNeXt, respectively. In more comprehensive comparison including DRAM access, GoSPA also shows significant performance improvement over the existing designs.
