We give an explicit construction of length-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula> binary codes capable of correcting the deletion of two bits that have size <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$2^{n}/n^{4+o(1)}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. This matches up to lower order terms the existential result, based on an inefficient greedy choice of codewords, that guarantees such codes of size <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\Omega (2^{n}/n^{4})$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. Our construction is based on augmenting the classic Varshamov-Tenengolts construction of single deletion codes with additional check equations. We also give an explicit construction of binary codes of size <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\Omega (2^{n}/n^{3+o(1)})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> that can be <italic>list decoded</italic> from two deletions using lists of size two. Previously, even the existence of such codes was not clear.
