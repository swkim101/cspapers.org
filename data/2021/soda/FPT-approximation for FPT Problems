Over the past decade, many results have focused on the design of parameterized approximation algorithms for W[1]-hard problems. However, there are fundamental problems within the class FPT for which the best known algorithms have seen no progress over the course of the decade; some of them have even been proved not to admit algorithms that run in time 2 O ( k ) n O (1) under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) or ( c − (cid:15) ) k n O (1) under the Strong ETH (SETH). In this paper, we expand the study of FPT-approximation and initiate a systematic study of FPT-approximation for problems that are FPT. We design FPT-approximation algorithms for problems that are FPT, with running times that are signiﬁcantly faster than the corresponding best known FPT-algorithm, and while achieving approximation ratios that are signiﬁcantly better than what is possible in polynomial time.
