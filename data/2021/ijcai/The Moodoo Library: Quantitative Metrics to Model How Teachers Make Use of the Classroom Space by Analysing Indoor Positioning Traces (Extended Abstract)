Teachers’ spatial behaviours in the classroom can strongly influence students’ engagement, motivation and other behaviours that shape their learning. However, classroom teaching behav-iour is ephemeral, and has largely remained opaque to computational analysis. This paper presents a library called ‘Moodoo’ that can serve to automatically model how teachers make use of the classroom space by analysing indoor positioning traces. The system automatically ex-tracts spatial metrics (e.g. teacher-student ratios, frequency of visits to students’ personal spaces, presence in classroom spaces of interest, index of dispersion and entropy), mapping from the teachers’ low-level positioning data to higher-order spatial constructs.
