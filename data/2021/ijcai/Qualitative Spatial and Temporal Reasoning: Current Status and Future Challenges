Qualitative Spatial & Temporal Reasoning (QSTR)

is a major field of study in Symbolic AI that deals

with the representation and reasoning of spatio-

temporal information in an abstract, human-like

manner. We survey the current status of QSTR

from a viewpoint of reasoning approaches, and

identify certain future challenges that we think

that, once overcome, will allow the field to meet

the demands of and adapt to real-world, dynamic,

and time-critical applications of highly active areas

such as machine learning and data mining.
