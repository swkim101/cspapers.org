In most facility location research, either an efficient facility placement which minimizes the total cost or a fairer placement which minimizes the maximum cost are typically proposed. To find a solution that is both fair and efficient, we propose converting the agent costs to utilities and placing the facility/ies such that the product of utilities, also known as the Nash welfare, is maximized. We ask whether the Nash welfareâ€™s well-studied balance between fairness and efficiency also applies to the facility location setting, and what agent strategic behaviour may occur under this facility placement.
