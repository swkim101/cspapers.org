Partial label (PL) learning tackles the problem where each training instance is associated with a set of candidate labels that include both the true label and some irrelevant noise labels. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level generative model for partial label learning (MGPLL), which tackles the PL problem by learning both a label level adversarial generator and a feature level adversarial generator under a bi-directional mapping framework between the label vectors and the data samples. MGPLL uses a conditional noise label generation network to model the non-random noise labels and perform label denoising, and uses a multi-class predictor to map the training instances to the denoised label vectors, while a conditional data feature generator is used to form an inverse mapping from the denoised label vectors to data samples. Both the noise label generator and the data feature generator are learned in an adversarial manner to match the observed candidate labels and data features respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthesized and real-world partial label datasets. The proposed approach

demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance for partial label learning.
