Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been successfully used to represent 3D

shapes implicitly and compactly, by mapping 3D coordinates to the

corresponding signed distance values or occupancy values. In this paper, we

propose a novel positional encoding scheme, called Spline Positional

Encoding, to map the input coordinates to a high dimensional space before

passing them to MLPs, which help recover 3D signed distance fields with

fine-scale geometric details from unorganized 3D point clouds. We verified

the superiority of our approach over other positional encoding schemes on

tasks of 3D shape reconstruction and 3D shape space learning from input

point clouds. The efficacy of our approach extended to image reconstruction

is also demonstrated and evaluated.
