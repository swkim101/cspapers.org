Aggressive memory density scaling causes modern DRAM devices to suffer from RowHammer, a phenomenon where rapidly activating (i.e., hammering) a DRAM row can cause bit-flips in physically-nearby rows. Recent studies demonstrate that modern DDR4/LPDDR4 DRAM chips, including chips previously marketed as RowHammer-safe, are even more vulnerable to RowHammer than older DDR3 DRAM chips. Many works show that attackers can exploit RowHammer bit-flips to reliably mount system-level attacks to escalate privilege and leak private data. Therefore, it is critical to ensure RowHammersafe operation on all DRAM-based systems as they become increasingly more vulnerable to RowHammer. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation mechanisms face two major challenges. First, they incur increasingly higher performance and/or area overheads when applied to more vulnerable DRAM chips. Second, they require either closely-guarded proprietary information about the DRAM chips’ physical circuit layouts or modifications to the DRAM chip design.In this paper, we show that it is possible to efficiently and scalably prevent RowHammer bit-flips without knowledge of or modification to DRAM internals. To this end, we introduce BlockHammer, a low-cost, effective, and easy-to-adopt RowHammer mitigation mechanism that prevents all RowHammer bit-flips while overcoming the two key challenges. BlockHammer selectively throttles memory accesses that could otherwise potentially cause RowHammer bit-flips. The key idea of BlockHammer is to (1) track row activation rates using area-efficient Bloom filters, and (2) use the tracking data to ensure that no row is ever activated rapidly enough to induce RowHammer bit-flips. By guaranteeing that no DRAM row ever experiences a RowHammer-unsafe activation rate, BlockHammer (1) makes it impossible for a RowHammer bit-flip to occur and (2) greatly reduces a RowHammer attack’s impact on the performance of co-running benign applications. Our evaluations across a comprehensive range of 280 workloads show that, compared to the best of six state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation mechanisms (all of which require knowledge of or modification to DRAM internals), BlockHammer provides (1) competitive performance and energy when the system is not under a RowHammer attack and (2) significantly better performance and energy when the system is under a RowHammer attack.
