In this demo we present a battery-free smart camera that exploits aggressive power management and energy harvesting to achieve face recognition in an energy-neutral fashion. A novel hardware accelerator for Convolution Neural Networks is employed to speed up the inference of the Tiny Machine Learning algorithm. The recognized face, and not the entire image, is sent via LoRa in a sensor network-like scenario. Experimental results demonstrated the capability of the developed sensor node to start and work perpetually with only a small photovoltaic panel array.
