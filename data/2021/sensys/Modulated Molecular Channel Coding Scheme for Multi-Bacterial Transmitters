Synthetic biology has utilised engineering concepts for the rational design of biocompatible systems. Here we utilise two bacterial populations to create a modulated molecular channel coding scheme for molecular communications systems. We believe this approach can drive the development of more reliable biocompatible molecular communications systems to apply in the dairy industry.
