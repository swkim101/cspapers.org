Federated learning can be a promising solution for enabling IoT cybersecurity (i.e., anomaly detection in the IoT environment) while preserving data privacy and mitigating the high communication/storage overhead (e.g., high-frequency data from time-series sensors) of centralized over-the-cloud approaches. In this paper, to further push forward this direction with a comprehensive study in both algorithm and system design, we build FedIoT platform that contains FedDetect algorithm for on-device anomaly data detection and a system design for realistic evaluation of federated learning on IoT devices. Furthermore, the proposed FedDetect learning framework improves the performance by utilizing a local adaptive optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a cross-round learning rate scheduler. In a network of realistic IoT devices (Raspberry PI), we evaluate FedIoT platform and FedDetect algorithm in both model and system performance. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of federated learning in detecting a wider range of attack types occurred at multiple devices. The system efficiency analysis indicates that both end-to-end training time and memory cost are affordable and promising for resource-constrained IoT devices.
