Location systems and their daily use in industry and individual users have become an inseparable part of our everyday functioning. However, often they are used in the so-called intelligent buildings. Unfortunately, just like location methods operating outside buildings are precise enough to determine our location (e.g. GPS systems for drivers), the situation of locating people inside the building is different, especially when such people cannot be equipped with additional devices (e.g. a transmitter signal). Nevertheless, it is essential in communication routes, large clusters of people, such as airports, railway stations or office spaces. At the same time, determine the number of people in space and the development of services that do not require direct contact (automatic patient/client registration) in times of a possible pandemic.
