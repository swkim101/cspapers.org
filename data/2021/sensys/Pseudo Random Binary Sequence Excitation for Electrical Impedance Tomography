Minimal hardware requirements for electrical impedance tomography can enhance the method's applicability for medical tracking and diagnostic tasks in e-health. The principle of electrical tomography is that the response to electrical excitation of biological tissues provides information about the material structure. In order to reduce the required hardware, we study pseudo random binary sequence excitation patterns, instead of the standard sinusoidal excitation. We implement the measurement system in reconfigurable hardware with a mixed signal SoC. The measurements are validated using system identification in the resulting data to estimate the discrete transfer function of the system under measurement.
