We recently introduced the concept of reconfigurable Wireless Networks on Chips (r-WNoCs) for which an on-chip reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) endows the wireless on-chip propagation environment with programmability. In this work-in-progress report, we apply this idea to a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) context. Specifically, we demonstrate that using an on-chip RIS we can simultaneously shape multiple channel impulse responses (CIRs) such that they become essentially pulse-like despite rich scattering inside the chip enclosure. Pulse-like CIRs are essential to enable high-speed information exchange between different processors on the same chip with the simple on-off-keying modulation schemes envisaged for WNoCs.
