Reliable communication and synchronization for transiently-powered batteryless sensors are still open challenges. This paper presents a method to synchronize and ensure reliable communication over batteryless sensors with zero energy cost requirements. Our preliminary design combines visible light communication (VLC) and radio-frequency (RF) backscatter into a self-powered autonomous circuit. We enable energy status sharing and communication scheduling services, which provide the fundamental building blocks for future batteryless communication protocols.
