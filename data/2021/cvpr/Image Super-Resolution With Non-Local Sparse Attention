Both Non-Local (NL) operation and sparse representation are crucial for Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). In this paper, we investigate their combinations and propose a novel Non-Local Sparse Attention (NLSA) with dynamic sparse attention pattern. NLSA is designed to retain long-range modeling capability from NL operation while enjoying robustness and high-efficiency of sparse representation. Specifically, NLSA rectifies non-local attention with spherical locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that partitions the input space into hash buckets of related features. For every query signal, NLSA assigns a bucket to it and only computes attention within the bucket. The resulting sparse attention prevents the model from attending to locations that are noisy and less-informative, while reducing the computational cost from quadratic to asymptotic linear with respect to the spatial size. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of NLSA. With a few non-local sparse attention modules, our architecture, called non-local sparse network (NLSN), reaches state-of-the-art performance for SISR quantitatively and qualitatively.
