In Fig. 2, V R is the GCs set (green vertices). âˆ‘ i l(v R i ) is simply the sum of loss of these stored vertices: 10+9+10 = 29. max i l(v i , v R i+1)) describes the maximum re-forward loss. In this example, there are two local re-forwarding. Loss for the second re-forward: 6 + 7 = 13. Loss for the first re-forward is 8. For each re-forwarding, the loss of it is simply the sum of all the vertices in between. Therefore, maximal Re-forward loss is max{13, 8} = 13, and total Loss is 29 + 13 = 42.
