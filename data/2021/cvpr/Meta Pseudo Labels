We present Meta Pseudo Labels, a semi-supervised learning method that achieves a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 90.2% on ImageNet, which is 1.6% better than the existing state-of-the-art [16]. Like Pseudo Labels, Meta Pseudo Labels has a teacher network to generate pseudo labels on unlabeled data to teach a student network. However, unlike Pseudo Labels where the teacher is fixed, the teacher in Meta Pseudo Labels is constantly adapted by the feedback of the studentâ€™s performance on the labeled dataset. As a result, the teacher generates better pseudo labels to teach the student.1
