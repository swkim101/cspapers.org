This manuscript contains the supplementary materials supporting the paper entitled “The Neural Tangent Link Between CNN Denoisers and Non-Local Filters”. It provides a more detailed derivation of the formulas in the main paper. We repeat some results associated with neural tangent kernel (NTK) that already exist in the literature [5, 1, 7] for the sake of clarity and to make the document as self-contained as possible. The supplementary note is organized as follows: Section A states the main assumptions made for the derivations, discussing their implications. Section B reviews the dynamics of signal propagation in wide deep neural networks. Section C extends the analysis to backward signal propagation during backpropagation training. Section D presents a detailed derivation of the neural tangent kernel and the ﬁltering process. Section E extends the results for multiple input and output channels and Section F discusses the eﬀect of (linear) downsampling operations of the autoencoder and U-Net architectures. Section G explains the proposed Nyström method for eﬃcient ﬁltering with the neural tangent kernel. Section H details the network architectures evaluated in the experiments. Finally, additional denoising results are presented in Section I.
