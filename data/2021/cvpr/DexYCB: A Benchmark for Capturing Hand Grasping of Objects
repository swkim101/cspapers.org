We introduce DexYCB, a new dataset for capturing hand grasping of objects. We first compare DexYCB with a related one through cross-dataset evaluation. We then present a thorough benchmark of state-of-the-art approaches on three relevant tasks: 2D object and keypoint detection, 6D object pose estimation, and 3D hand pose estimation. Finally, we evaluate a new robotics-relevant task: generating safe robot grasps in human-to-robot object handover. 1
