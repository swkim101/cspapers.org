In this supplementary, we provide additional details to enable reproducibility, and additional visualizations and results to complement the main findings in the paper. In Section S2, we specify the creation of the Materials dataset. In Section S3, we detail the experimental setup for the classification robustness experiments. In Section S4, we describe the implementation and parameters used for style transfer, and we show visualizations of these methods in Section S5. In Section S6, we extend the discussion in Section 4 of the main paper by analyzing the effect of stylization strength versus robustness. In Section S7, we visualize the power spectra of stylized images and compare them to natural images. Finally, in Section S8, we frame model robustness as domain generalization and discuss how domain-invariance can affect model robustness.
