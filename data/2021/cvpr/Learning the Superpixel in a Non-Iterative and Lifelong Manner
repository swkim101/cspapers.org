Superpixel is generated by automatically clustering pixels in an image into hundreds of compact partitions, which is widely used to perceive the object contours for its excel-lent contour adherence. Although some works use the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to generate high-quality superpixel, we challenge the design principles of these net-works, specifically for their dependence on manual labels and excess computation resources, which limits their flexibility compared with the traditional unsupervised segmentation methods. We target at redefining the CNN-based superpixel segmentation as a lifelong clustering task and pro-pose an unsupervised CNN-based method called LNS-Net. The LNS-Net can learn superpixel in a non-iterative and lifelong manner without any manual labels. Specifically, a lightweight feature embedder is proposed for LNS-Net to efficiently generate the cluster-friendly features. With those features, seed nodes can be automatically assigned to cluster pixels in a non-iterative way. Additionally, our LNS-Net can adapt the sequentially lifelong learning by rescaling the gradient of weight based on both channel and spatial context to avoid overfitting. Experiments show that the proposed LNS-Net achieves significantly better performance on three benchmarks with nearly ten times lower complexity compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
