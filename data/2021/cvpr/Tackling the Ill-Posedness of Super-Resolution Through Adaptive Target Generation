The key ideas of our work are the new training scheme and the concept of the adaptive target. We chose affine transformation as a way to validate our idea since it is a simple and basic method in handling geometric deformation. There are other options such as projective transformation or a deformation field. However, as shown in Table 5 in the main paper, Tr + Rot model already shows better performance than Tr + Rot + Shear + Scale model. We infer that above a certain level of flexibility in transformation, the transformation alters the original contents in an undesirable way for SR, and we chose affine transformation for its simplicity and effectiveness. We would also like to point out that we use 7Ã— 7 patchlevel affine transformation, not a single transformation for the whole image for flexibility. We conducted additional empirical analysis on the effectiveness of the patch-level affine transformation. We gathered 10 HR patches y which are approximately mapped to the same LR patch x using corresponding kernels k as follows:
