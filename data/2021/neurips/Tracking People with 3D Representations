We present a novel approach for tracking multiple people in video. Unlike past approaches which employ 2D representations, we focus on using 3D representations of people, located in three-dimensional space. To this end, we develop a method, Human Mesh and Appearance Recovery (HMAR) which in addition to extracting the 3D geometry of the person as a SMPL mesh, also extracts appearance as a texture map on the triangles of the mesh. This serves as a 3D representation for appearance that is robust to viewpoint and pose changes. Given a video clip, we first detect bounding boxes corresponding to people, and for each one, we extract 3D appearance, pose, and location information using HMAR. These embedding vectors are then sent to a transformer, which performs spatio-temporal aggregation of the representations over the duration of the sequence. The similarity of the resulting representations is used to solve for associations that assigns each person to a tracklet. We evaluate our approach on the Posetrack, MuPoTs and AVA datasets. We find that 3D representations are more effective than 2D representations for tracking in these settings, and we obtain state-of-the-art performance.
