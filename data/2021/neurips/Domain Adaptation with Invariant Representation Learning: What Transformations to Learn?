Let there be a subset in the invariant space B ⊂ Z , and suppose that we have marginal invariance in the latent space: PS(φ(X) ∈ B) = P T (φ(X) ∈ B),∀B. Define the pre-image of B as: A = {a ∈ X : φ(a) ∈ B}. Then, we have the following equality relationships: PS(φ(X) ∈ B) = PS(X ∈ A) = P T (φ(X) ∈ B) = P T (X ∈ A), which implies that PS(X ∈ A) = P T (X ∈ A) must hold. This further implies that if there is difference in the source and target distributions in the support-overlapping region A, given by: PS(X ∈ A) 6= P T (X ∈ A), ∗These authors contributed equally to this work.
