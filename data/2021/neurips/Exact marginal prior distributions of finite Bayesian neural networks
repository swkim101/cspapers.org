Bayesian neural networks are theoretically well-understood only in the inﬁnite-width limit, where Gaussian priors over network weights yield Gaussian priors over network outputs. Recent work has suggested that ﬁnite Bayesian networks may outperform their inﬁnite counterparts, but their non-Gaussian function space priors have been characterized only though perturbative approaches. Here, we derive exact solutions for the function space priors for individual input examples of a class of ﬁnite fully-connected feedforward Bayesian neural networks. For deep linear networks, the prior has a simple expression in terms of the Meijer G -function. The prior of a ﬁnite ReLU network is a mixture of the priors of linear networks of smaller widths, corresponding to different numbers of active units in each layer. Our results unify previous descriptions of ﬁnite network priors in terms of their tail decay and large-width behavior.
