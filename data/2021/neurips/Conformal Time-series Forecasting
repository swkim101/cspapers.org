Current approaches for (multi-horizon) time-series forecasting using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) focus on issuing point estimates, which are insufﬁcient for informing decision-making in critical application domains wherein uncertainty estimates are also required. Existing methods for uncertainty quantiﬁcation in RNN-based time-series forecasts are limited as they may require signiﬁcant alterations to the underlying architecture, may be computationally complex, may be difﬁcult to calibrate, may incur high sample complexity, and may not provide theoretical validity guarantees for the issued uncertainty intervals. In this work, we extend the inductive conformal prediction framework to the time-series forecasting setup, and propose a lightweight uncertainty estimation procedure to address the above limitations. With minimal exchangeability assumptions, our approach provides uncertainty intervals with theoretical guarantees on frequentist coverage for any multi-horizon forecast predictor and any dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the conformal forecasting framework by comparing it with existing baselines on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.
