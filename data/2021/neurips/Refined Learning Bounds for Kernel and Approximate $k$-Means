Kernel k -means is one of the most popular approaches to clustering and its the-1 oretical properties have been investigated for decades. However, the existing 2 state-of-the-art risk bounds are of order O ( k/ √ n ) , which do not match with the 3 stated lower bound Ω( (cid:112) k/n ) in terms of k . In this paper, we study the statistical 4 properties of kernel k -means and Nyström-based kernel k -means, and obtain opti-5 mal clustering risk bounds, which improve the existing risk bounds. Particularly, 6 based on a reﬁned upper bound of the clustering Rademacher complexity, we ﬁrst 7 derive an optimal risk bound of rate O ( (cid:112) k/n ) for empirical risk minimizer (ERM), 8 and further extend it to general cases beyond ERM. Then, we analyze the statistical 9 effect of computational approximations of Nyström kernel k -means, and prove that 10 it achieves the same statistical accuracy as the original kernel k -means considering 11 only Ω( √ nk ) Nyström landmark points. We further relax the restriction of land-12 mark points from Ω( √ nk ) to Ω( √ n ) under a mild condition. Finally, we validate 13 the theoretical ﬁndings via numerical experiments. 14
