To deal with ambiguities in partial multi-label learning (PML), state-of-the-art methods perform disambiguation by identifying ground-truth labels directly. However, there is an essential question:“ Can the ground-truth labels be identiﬁed precisely? ". If yes, “ How can the ground-truth labels be found? ". This paper provides afﬁrmative answers to these questions. Instead of adopting hand-made heuristic strategy, we propose a novel M utual I nformation L abel I dentiﬁcation for P artial M ulti-Label L earning ( MILI-PML ), which is derived from a clear probabilistic formulation and could be easily interpreted theoretically from the mutual information perspective, as well as naturally incorporates the feature/label relevancy into consideration. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed MILI-PML.
