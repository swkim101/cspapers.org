In causal discovery, linear non-Gaussian acyclic models (LiNGAMs) have been studied extensively. While the causally sufﬁcient case is well understood, in many real applications the observed variables are not causally related. Rather, they are generated by latent variables, such as confounders and mediators, which may themselves be causally related. Existing results on the identiﬁcation of the causal structure among the latent variables often require very strong graphical assumptions. In this paper, we consider partially observed linear models with either non-Gaussian or heterogeneous errors. In that case we give two graphical conditions which are necessary for identiﬁcation of the causal structure. These conditions are closely related to sparsity of the causal edges. Together with one additional condition on the coefﬁcients, which holds generically for any graph, the two graphical conditions are also sufﬁcient for identiﬁability. These new conditions can be satisﬁed even when the number of latent variables is very large. We demonstrate the validity of our results on synthetic data.
