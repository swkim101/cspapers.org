Risk-Sensitive/Robust Control and Dynamic Games. H1-robust control has been one of the most fundamental research fields in control theory, addressing worst-case controller design for linear plants in the presence of unknown disturbances and uncertainties. Frequency-domain and time-domain/state-space formulations of theH1-robust control problem were first introduced in [34] and [35], respectively. Based on the time-domain approach, the precise equivalence relationships between controllers in the disturbance attenuation (which belongs to a class ofH1-robust control) problem, risk-sensitive linear control, and zero-sum LQ dynamic games have been studied extensively [22, 23, 24, 36, 26, 25]. Specifically, [22] first demonstrated the equivalence of the controllers between LEQG and zero-sum LQ (differential) games; [23] studied the relationship between the mixed H2/H1 design problem, a sub-problem of the H1-robust control problem, and LEQG; [24, 36] investigated the disturbance attenuation problem through a dynamic games approach, for both finiteand infinite-horizons, time-invariant and -varying, deterministic and stochastic settings. We refer the readers to [26, 25] for comprehensive studies of H1-robust control, dynamic game theory, risk-sensitive control, and also their precise interconnections.
