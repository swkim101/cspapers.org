In this paper, we consider an inverse problem in graph learning domain -- ``given the graph representations smoothed by Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), how can we reconstruct the input graph signal?"We propose Graph Deconvolutional Network (GDN) and motivate the design of GDN via a combination of inverse filters in spectral domain and de-noising layers in wavelet domain, as the inverse operation results in a high frequency amplifier and may amplify the noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several tasks including graph feature imputation and graph structure generation.
