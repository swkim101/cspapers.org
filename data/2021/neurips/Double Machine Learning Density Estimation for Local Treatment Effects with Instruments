It is common to quantify causal effects with mean values, which, however, may 1 fail to capture significant distribution differences of the outcome under different 2 treatments. We study the problem of estimating the density of the causal effect 3 of a binary treatment on a continuous outcome given a binary instrumental vari4 able in the presence of covariates. Specifically, we consider the local treatment 5 effect, which measures the effect of treatment among those who comply with the 6 assignment under the assumption of monotonicity (only the ones who were offered 7 the treatment take it). We develop two families of methods for this task, kernel8 smoothing and model-based approximations â€“ the former smoothes the density by 9 convoluting with a smooth kernel function; the latter projects the density onto a 10 finite-dimensional density class. For both approaches, we derive double/debiased 11 machine learning (DML) based estimators. We study the asymptotic convergence 12 rates of the estimators and show that they are robust to the biases in nuisance 13 function estimation. We illustrate the proposed methods on synthetic data and a 14 real dataset called 401(k). 15
