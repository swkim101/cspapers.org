Global scheduling of real time tasks with precedence constraints has received significant attention recently. Specifically, on multiprocessor systems, the directed acyclic graph (DAG) model well-represents parallelizable workloads with precedence constraints. Hence, many studies have recently been published analyzing DAG structures using decomposition and window-based analysis methods. We identified a set of schedulable DAG taskets that are hard-to-analyze using state-of-the-art window-based schedulability tests. Additionally, we observe that the window-based test solely depends on one structural feature of the DAG taskset, which raises concerns about its pessimism in many settings. In this paper, to address these concerns, for hard real-time sporadic implicit-deadline DAG tasksets, we perform LAG-based schedulability analysis, which offers a more holistic view of the taskset than the window-based analysis. We present a companion utilization-based schedulability test to the state-of-the-art, which considers additional structural features of DAGs. Our results show that by considering such features, our LAG-based test empirically dominates the state-of-the-art test on over 80% of the evaluated DAG tasksets. Moreover, combining our LAG-based test in conjunction with the window-based tests can achieve high schedulability in many cases.
