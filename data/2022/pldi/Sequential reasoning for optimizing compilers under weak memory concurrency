We formally show that sequential reasoning is adequate and sufficient for establishing soundness of various compiler optimizations under weakly consistent shared-memory concurrency. Concretely, we introduce a sequential model and show that behavioral refinement in that model entails contextual refinement in the Promising Semantics model, extended with non-atomic accesses for non-racy code. This is the first work to achieve such result for a full-fledged model with a variety of C11-style concurrency features. Central to our model is the lifting of the common data-race-freedom assumption, which allows us to validate irrelevant load introduction, a transformation that is commonly performed by compilers. As a proof of concept, we develop an optimizer for a toy concurrent language, and certify it (in Coq) while relying solely on the sequential model. We believe that the proposed approach provides useful means for compiler developers and validators, as well as a solid foundation for the development of certified optimizing compilers for weakly consistent shared-memory concurrency.
