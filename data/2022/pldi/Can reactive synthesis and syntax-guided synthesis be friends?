While reactive synthesis and syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) have seen enormous progress in recent years, combining the two approaches has remained a challenge. In this work, we present the synthesis of reactive programs from Temporal Stream Logic modulo theories (TSL-MT), a framework that unites the two approaches to synthesize a single program. In our approach, reactive synthesis and SyGuS collaborate in the synthesis process, and generate executable code that implements both reactive and data-level properties. We present a tool, temos, that combines state-of-the-art methods in reactive synthesis and SyGuS to synthesize programs from TSL-MT specifications. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach over a set of benchmarks, and present a deep case study on synthesizing a music keyboard synthesizer.
