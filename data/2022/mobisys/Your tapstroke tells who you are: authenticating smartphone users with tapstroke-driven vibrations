In this paper, we present TapAuth, a novel smartphone user authentication system that leverages vibrations generated from a user's tap inputs. TapAuth is based on the observation that the vibrations have their unique characteristic depending on the user due to differences in finger structure. Specifically, TapAuth collects audio and motion data using only built-in sensors, while users are entering PIN code. Then, it authenticates the user by verifying the validity of the code and comparing the collected data with a pre-built training dataset. Our experimental results with 20 real-world users show that TapAuth can achieve high accuracy.
