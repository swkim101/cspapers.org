This poster presents the design and implementation of SPiDR, an ultra-low-power acoustic imaging system. This imaging system produces a cross-sectional map of the field-of-view using only one speaker/microphone pair. It leverages the fact that sound's interaction with small structures can project spatially coded signals on a region at a fine granularity. We create a 3D-printed passive filter, called a stencil, that can image the scene with a single omnidirectional source and sensor. With spatially coded signal, the system receives a linear combination of the reflections from nearby objects and applies a novel power-aware depth-map reconstruction algorithm. SPiDR consumes only 10mW of power to generate a depth-map in real-world scenario with over 80% structural similarity score with the scene.
