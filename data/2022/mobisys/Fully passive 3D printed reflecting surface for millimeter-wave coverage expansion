This demonstration presents a working prototype of MilliMirror. This fully passive metasurface expands coverage blind spots of mmWave radios by reshaping and re-steering mmWave signals to any anomalous directions. The MilliMirror prototype consists of thousands of unit elements. A closed-form model is developed for efficient beam pattern synthesis. MilliMirror further explores 3D printing technology and metal deposition to achieve economical fabrication. MilliMirror prototype successfully establishes an indirect link between the WiGig transceivers, with the maximum gain over 10 dB.
