Soluble Sugar Content (SSC) of a fruit is indicative of its ripeness and is used in the fruit industry for quality control in the production chain. We present the design and implementation of SSCense, a low-cost, non-destructive system to estimate a fruit's SSC using the millimeter-wave wireless technology in 5G-and-beyond devices.
