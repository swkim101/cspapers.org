Wide-spread use of open-source software is a remarkable achievement, but also creates a tremendous responsibility. How can we collectively step up to ensure open-source software is worthy of the trust the world now expects and deserves? We cover a range of structural and security challenges and how we might address them, including our hopes for a more sustainable future.
