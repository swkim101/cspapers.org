The Information Theory concept of surprisal suggests that, in the future, the most valuable information will be the "new" information entering the cloud from the edge rather than the "prior" information that is stored and processed deeper within the cloud. This talk will discuss the implications of this relatively simple concept for future systems and networks. In particular, it will focus on the role that "near the edge" computing and storage can play in synthesizing the "new" and "old" information.
