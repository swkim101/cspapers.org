As small quantum computers are becoming available on different physical platforms, a benchmarking task known as cross-platform verification has been proposed that aims to estimate the fidelity of states prepared on two quantum computers. This task is fundamentally distributed, as no quantum communication can be performed between the two physical platforms due to hardware constraints, which prohibits a joint SWAP test. In this paper we settle the sample complexity of this task across all measurement and communication settings. The essence of the task, which we call distributed quantum inner product estimation, involves two players Alice and Bob who have k copies of unknown states ρ,σ (acting on ℂd) respectively. Their goal is to estimate Tr(ρσ) up to additive error ε∈(0,1), using local quantum operations and classical communication. In the weakest setting where only non-adaptive single-copy measurements and simultaneous message passing are allowed, we show that k=O(max{1/ε2,√d/ε}) copies suffice. This achieves a savings compared to full tomography which takes Ω(d3) copies with single-copy measurements. Surprisingly, we also show that the sample complexity must be at least Ω(max{1/ε2,√d/ε}), even in the strongest setting where adaptive multi-copy measurements and arbitrary rounds of communication are allowed. This shows that the success achieved by shadow tomography, for sample-efficiently learning the properties of a single system, cannot be generalized to the distributed setting. Furthermore, the fact that the sample complexity remains the same with single and multi-copy measurements contrasts with single system quantum property testing, which often demonstrate exponential separations in sample complexity with single and multi-copy measurements.
