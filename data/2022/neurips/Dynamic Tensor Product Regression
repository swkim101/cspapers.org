In this work, we initiate the study of \emph{Dynamic Tensor Product Regression}. One has matrices $A_1\in \mathbb{R}^{n_1\times d_1},\ldots,A_q\in \mathbb{R}^{n_q\times d_q}$ and a label vector $b\in \mathbb{R}^{n_1\ldots n_q}$, and the goal is to solve the regression problem with the design matrix $A$ being the tensor product of the matrices $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_q$ i.e. $\min_{x\in \mathbb{R}^{d_1\ldots d_q}}~\|(A_1\otimes \ldots\otimes A_q)x-b\|_2$. At each time step, one matrix $A_i$ receives a sparse change, and the goal is to maintain a sketch of the tensor product $A_1\otimes\ldots \otimes A_q$ so that the regression solution can be updated quickly. Recomputing the solution from scratch for each round is very slow and so it is important to develop algorithms which can quickly update the solution with the new design matrix. Our main result is a dynamic tree data structure where any update to a single matrix can be propagated quickly throughout the tree. We show that our data structure can be used to solve dynamic versions of not only Tensor Product Regression, but also Tensor Product Spline regression (which is a generalization of ridge regression) and for maintaining Low Rank Approximations for the tensor product.
