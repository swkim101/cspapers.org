Decentralized optimization are playing an important role in applications such as training large machine learning models, among others. Despite its superior practical performance, there has been some lack of fundamental understanding about its theoretical properties. In this work, we address the following open research question: To train an overparameterized model over a set of distributed nodes, what is the minimum communication overhead (in terms of the bits got exchanged) that the system needs to sustain, while still achieving (near) zero training loss? We show that for a class of overparameterized models where the number of parameters D is much larger than the total data samples N , the best possible communication complexity is ⌦ ( N ) , which is independent of the problem dimension D . Further, for a few speciﬁc overparameterized models (i.e., the linear regression, and certain multi-layer neural network with one wide layer), we develop a set of algorithms which uses certain linear compression followed by adaptive quantization, and show that they achieve dimension independent, near-optimal communication complexity. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that dimension independent communication complexity has been shown for distributed optimization.
