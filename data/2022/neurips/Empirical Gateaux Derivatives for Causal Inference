We study a constructive algorithm that approximates Gateaux derivatives for statistical functionals by ﬁnite differencing, with a focus on functionals that arise in causal inference. We study the setting where probability distributions are not known a priori but need to be estimated from data. These estimated distributions lead to empirical Gateaux derivatives, and we study the relationships between empirical, numerical, and analytical Gateaux derivatives. Starting with a case study of the interventional mean (average potential outcome), we delineate the relationship between the empirical Gateaux derivative (via ﬁnite differencing) and the analytical Gateaux derivative. We then derive requirements on the rates of numerical approximation in perturbation and smoothing that preserve the statistical beneﬁts of one-step adjustments, such as rate double robustness. We further study more complicated functionals such as dynamic treatment regimes and the linear-programming formulation for policy optimization in inﬁnite-horizon Markov decision processes. The ability to approximate bias adjustments in the presence of arbitrary constraints in these more complicated settings illustrates the usefulness of constructive approaches for Gateaux derivatives. We also ﬁnd that the statistical structure of the functional (rate double robustness) can permit less conservative rates for ﬁnite-difference approximation. This property, however, can be speciﬁc to particular functionals; e.g., it occurs for the average potential outcome (hence average treatment effect) but not the inﬁnite-horizon MDP policy value.
