A novel approach to rank estimation, called geometric order learning (GOL), is proposed in this paper. First, we construct an embedding space, in which the direction and distance between objects represent order and metric relations between their ranks, by enforcing two geometric constraints: the order constraint compels objects to be sorted according to their ranks, while the metric constraint makes the distance between objects reﬂect their rank difference. Then, we perform the simple k nearest neighbor ( k -NN) search in the embedding space to estimate the rank of a test object. Moreover, to assess the quality of embedding spaces for rank estimation, we propose a metric called discriminative ratio for ranking (DRR). Extensive experiments on facial age estimation, historical color image (HCI) clas-siﬁcation, and aesthetic score regression demonstrate that GOL constructs effective embedding spaces and thus yields excellent rank estimation performances.
