The HWI inequality of Otto and Villani [22] is a functional inequality relating the entropy (H), quadratic transportation cost (W), and Fisher information (I), all defined w.r.t. a suitable reference measure that has bounded curvature. In deriving the classic result, a more general version of the HWI was established in [22]—one that is particularly well suited to the application in this paper, where we consider the differences between two entropy terms. See also [23, Proposition 1.5] for a recent derivation of the generalized inequality via a different argument based on an entropic interpolation of Wasserstein geodesics. The result reads as follows: let = N (0, Id) denote the isotropic Gaussian measure on Rd with variance 2 and consider μ, ⌫ 2 P2(R) with D(⌫k ) < 1 for some > 0, then D(μk ) D(⌫k )  W2(μ, ⌫) p J(μk ) 1 2 2 W 2(μ, ⌫).
