In this paper, we propose a variational model, Iterative Structural Inference of Directed Graphs (iSIDG), to infer the existence of directed interactions from observational agentsâ€™ features over a time period in a dynamical system. First, the iterative process in our model feeds the learned interactions back to encourage our model to eliminate indirect interactions and to emphasize directional representation during learning. Second, we show that extra regularization terms in the objective function for smoothness, connectiveness
