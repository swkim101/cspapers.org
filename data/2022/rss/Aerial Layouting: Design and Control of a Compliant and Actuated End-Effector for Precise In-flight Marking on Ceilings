—Aerial robots have demonstrated impressive feats of precise control, such as dynamic flight through openings or highly complex choreographies. Despite the accuracy needed for these tasks, there are problems that require levels of precision that are challenging to achieve today. One such problem is aerial interaction. Advances in aerial robot design and control have made such contact-based tasks possible and opened up research into challenging real-world tasks, including contact-based inspection. However, while centimetre accuracy is sufficient and achievable for inspection tasks, the positioning accuracy needed for other problems, such as layouting on construction sites or general push-and-slide tasks, is millimetres. To achieve such a high precision, we propose a new aerial system composed of an aerial vehicle equipped with a novel “smart” end-effector leveraging a stability-optimized Gough-Stewart mechanism. We present its design process and features incorporating the princi-ples of compliance, multiple contact points, actuation, and self- containment. In experiments, we verify that the design choices made for our novel end-effector are necessary to obtain the desired positioning precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can reliably mark lines on ceilings with millimetre accuracy without the need for precise modeling or sophisticated control of the aerial robot.
