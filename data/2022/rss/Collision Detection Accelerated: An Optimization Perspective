Collision detection between two convex shapes is an essential feature of any physics engine or robot motion planner. It has often been tackled as a computational geometry problem, with the Gilbert, Johnson and Keerthi (GJK) algorithm being the most common approach today. In this work we leverage the fact that collision detection is fundamentally a convex optimization problem. In particular, we establish that the GJK algorithm is a specific sub-case of the well-established Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm in convex optimization. We introduce a new collision detection algorithm by adapting recent works linking Nesterov acceleration and Frank-Wolfe methods. We benchmark the proposed accelerated collision detection method on two datasets composed of strictly convex and non-strictly convex shapes. Our results show that our approach significantly reduces the number of iterations to solve collision detection problems compared to the state-of-the-art GJK algorithm, leading to up to two times faster computation times.
