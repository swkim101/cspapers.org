While real world challenges typically define visual categories with language words or phrases, most visual classification methods define categories with numerical indices. However, the language specification of the classes provides an especially useful prior for biased and noisy datasets, where it can help disambiguate what features are task-relevant. Recently, large-scale multimodal models have been shown to recognize a wide variety of high-level concepts from a language specification even without additional image training data, but they are often unable to distinguish classes for more fine-grained tasks. CNNs, in contrast, can extract subtle image features that are required for fine-grained discrimination, but will overfit to any bias or noise in datasets. Our insight is to use high-level language specification as advice for constraining the classification evidence to task-relevant features, instead of distractors. To do this, we ground task-relevant words or phrases with attention maps from a pretrained large-scale model. We then use this grounding to supervise a classifier's spatial attention away from distracting context. We show that supervising spatial attention in this way improves performance on classification tasks with biased and noisy data, including ~3 âˆ’15% worst-group accuracy improvements and ~41-45% relative improvements on fairness metrics.
