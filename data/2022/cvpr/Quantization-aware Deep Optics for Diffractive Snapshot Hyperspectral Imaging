Diffractive snapshot hyperspectral imaging based on the deep optics framework has been striving to capture the spectral images of dynamic scenes. However, existing deep optics frameworks all suffer from the mismatch between the optical hardware and the reconstruction algorithm due to the quantization operation in the diffractive optical element (DOE) fabrication, leading to the limited performance of hyperspectral imaging in practice. In this paper, we propose the quantization-aware deep optics for diffractive snapshot hyperspectral imaging. Our key observation is that common lithography techniques used in fabricating DOEs need to quantize the DOE height map to a few levels, and can freely set the height for each level. Therefore, we propose to integrate the quantization operation into the DOE height map optimization and design an adaptive mechanism to adjust the physical height of each quantization level. According to the optimization, we fabricate the quantized DOE directly and build a diffractive hyperspectral snapshot imaging system. Our method develops the deep optics framework to be more practical through the awareness of and adaptation to the quantization operation of the DOE physical structure, making the fabricated DOE and the reconstruction algorithm match each other systematically. Extensive synthetic simulation and real hardware experiments validate the superior performance of our method.
