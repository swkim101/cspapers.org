Efficient photorealistic scene capture is a challenging task. Current online reconstruction systems can operate very efficiently, but images generated from the models captured by these systems are often not photorealistic. Recent approaches based on neural volume rendering can render novel views at high fidelity, but they often require a long time to train, making them impractical for applications that require real-time scene capture. In this paper, we propose a system that can reconstruct photorealistic models of complex scenes in an efficient manner. Our system processes images online, i.e. it can obtain a good quality estimate of both the scene geometry and appearance at roughly the same rate the video is captured. To achieve the efficiency, we propose a hierarchical feature volume using VDB grids. This representation is memory efficient and allows for fast querying of the scene information. Secondly, we introduce a novel optimization technique that improves the efficiency of the bundle adjustment which allows our system to converge to the target camera poses and scene geometry much faster. Experiments on real-world scenes show that our method outperforms existing systems in terms of efficiency and capture quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that can achieve online photorealistic scene capture.
