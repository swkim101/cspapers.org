Tensor completion using multiway delay-embedding transform (MDT) (or Hankelization) suffers from the large memory requirement and high computational cost in spite of its high potentiality for the image modeling. Recent studies have shown high completion performance with a relatively small window size, but experiments with large window sizes require huge amount of memory and cannot be easily calculated. In this study, we address this serious computational issue, and propose its fast and efficient algorithm. Key techniques of the proposed method are based on two properties: (1) the signal after MDT can be diagonalized by Fourier transform, (2) an inverse MDT can be represented as a convolutional form. To use the properties, we modify MDT-Tucker [26], a method using Tucker decomposition with MDT, and introducing the fast and efficient algorithm. Our experiments show more than 100 times acceleration while maintaining high accuracy, and to realize the computation with large window size.
