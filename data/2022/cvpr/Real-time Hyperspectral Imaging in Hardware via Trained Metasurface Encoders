Hyperspectral imaging has attracted significant attention to identify spectral signatures for image classification and automated pattern recognition in computer vision. State-of-the-art implementations of snapshot hyperspectral imaging rely on bulky, non-integrated, and expensive optical elements, including lenses, spectrometers, and filters. These macroscopic components do not allow fast data processing for, e.g. real-time and high-resolution videos. This work introduces Hyplex™, a new integrated architecture addressing the limitations discussed above. Hyplex™ is a CMOS-compatible, fast hyperspectral camera that replaces bulk optics with nanoscale metasurfaces inversely designed through artificial intelligence. Hyplex™ does not require spectrometers but makes use of conventional monochrome cameras, opening up the possibility for real-time and high-resolution hyperspectral imaging at inexpensive costs. Hyplex™ exploits a model-driven optimization, which connects the physical metasurfaces layer with modern visual computing approaches based on end-to-end training. We design and implement a prototype version of Hyplex™ and compare its performance against the state-of-the-art for typical imaging tasks such as spectral reconstruction and semantic segmentation. In all benchmarks, Hyplex™ reports the smallest reconstruction error. We additionally present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest publicly available labeled hyperspectral dataset for semantic segmentation.11Dataset available on https://github.com/makamoa/hyplex.
