Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to detect objects and predict the relationships between each pair of objects. Existing SGG methods usually suffer from several issues, including 1) ambiguous object representations, as graph neural network-based message passing (GMP) modules are typically sensitive to spurious inter-node correlations, and 2) low diversity in relationship predictions due to severe class imbalance and a large number of missing annotations. To address both problems, in this paper, we propose a regu-larized unrolling network (RU-Net). We first study the relation between GMP and graph Laplacian denoising (GLD) from the perspective of the unrolling technique, determining that GMP can be formulated as a solver for GLD. Based on this observation, we propose an unrolled message passing module and introduce an fp-based graph regularization to suppress spurious connections between nodes. Second, we propose a group diversity enhancement module that pro-motes the prediction diversity of relationships via rank max-imization. Systematic experiments demonstrate that RU-Net is effective under a variety of settings and metrics. Fur-thermore, RU-Net achieves new state-of-the-arts on three popular databases: VG, VRD, and OI.
