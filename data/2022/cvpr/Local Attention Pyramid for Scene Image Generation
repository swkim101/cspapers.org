In this paper, we first investigate the class-wise visual quality imbalance problem of scene images generated by GANs. The tendency is empirically found that the class-wise visual qualities are highly correlated with the dominance of object classes in the training data in terms of their scales and appearance frequencies. Specifically, the synthesized qualities of small and less frequent object classes tend to be low. To address this, we propose a novel attention module, Local Attention Pyramid (LAP) module tailored for scene image synthesis, that encourages GANs to generate diverse object classes in a high quality by explicit spread of high attention scores to local regions, since objects in scene images are scattered over the entire images. Moreover, our LAP assigns attention scores in a multiple scale to reflect the scale diversity of various objects. The experimental evaluations on three different datasets show consistent improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Frechet Segmentation Distance (FSD) over the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we apply our LAP module to various GANs methods to demonstrate a wide applicability of our LAP module.
