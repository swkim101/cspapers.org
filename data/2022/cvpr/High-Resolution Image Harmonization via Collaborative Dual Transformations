Given a composite image, image harmonization aims to adjust the foreground to make it compatible with the background. High-resolution image harmonization is in high demand, but still remains unexplored. Conventional image harmonization methods learn global RGB-to-RGB transformation which could effortlessly scale to high resolution, but ignore diverse local context. Recent deep learning methods learn the dense pixel-to-pixel transformation which could generate harmonious outputs, but are highly constrained in low resolution. In this work, we propose a high-resolution image harmonization network with Collaborative Dual Transformation (CDTNet) to combine pixel-to-pixel transformation and RGB-to-RGB transformation coherently in an end-to-end network. Our CDTNet consists of a low-resolution generator for pixel-to-pixel transformation, a color mapping module for RGB-to-RGB transformation, and a refinement module to take advantage of both. Extensive experiments on high-resolution bench-mark dataset and our created high-resolution real composite images demonstrate that our CDTNet strikes a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness.
