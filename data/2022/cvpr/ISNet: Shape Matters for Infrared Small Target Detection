Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) refers to extracting small and dim targets from blurred backgrounds, which has a wide range of applications such as traffic management and marine rescue. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and low contrast, infrared targets are easily submerged in the background of heavy noise and clutter. How to detect the precise shape information of infrared targets remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel infrared shape network (ISNet), where Taylor finite difference (TFD) -inspired edge block and two-orientation attention aggregation (TOAA) block are devised to address this problem. Specifically, TFD-inspired edge block aggregates and enhances the comprehensive edge information from different levels, in order to improve the contrast between target and background and also lay a foundation for extracting shape information with mathematical interpretation. TOAA block calculates the lowlevel information with attention mechanism in both row and column directions and fuses it with the high-level information to capture the shape characteristic of targets and suppress noises. In addition, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 1, 000 realistic images in various target shapes, different target sizes, and rich clutter backgrounds with accurate pixel-level annotations, called IRSTD-1k. Experiments on public datasets and IRSTD-1 k demonstrate the superiority of our approach over representative state-of-the-art IRSTD methods.
