Current contrastive learning frameworks focus on leveraging a single supervisory signal to learn representations, which limits the efficacy on unseen data and downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a hierarchical multi-label representation learning framework that can leverage all available labels and preserve the hierarchical relationship between classes. We introduce novel hierarchy preserving losses, which jointly apply a hierarchical penalty to the contrastive loss, and enforce the hierarchy constraint. The loss function is data driven and automatically adapts to arbitrary multi-label structures. Experiments on several datasets show that our relationship-preserving embedding performs well on a variety of tasks and outperform the base-line supervised and self-supervised approaches.
