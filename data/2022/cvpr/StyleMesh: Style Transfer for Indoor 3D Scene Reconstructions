We apply style transfer on mesh reconstructions of indoor scenes. This enables VR applications like experiencing 3D environments painted in the style of a favorite artist. Style transfer typically operates on 2D images, making stylization of a mesh challenging. When optimized over a variety of poses, stylization patterns become stretched out and inconsistent in size. On the other hand, model-based 3D style transfer methods exist that allow stylization from a sparse set of images, but they require a network at inference time. To this end, we optimize an explicit texture for the reconstructed mesh of a scene and stylize it jointly from all available input images. Our depth- and angle-aware optimization leverages surface normal and depth data of the underlying mesh to create a uniform and consistent stylization for the whole scene. Our experiments show that our method creates sharp and detailed results for the complete scene without view-dependent artifacts. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that the proposed 3D awareness enables style transfer to be applied to the 3D domain of a mesh. Our method11https://lukashoel.github.io/stylemesh/ can be used to render a stylized mesh in real-time with traditional rendering pipelines.
