In this paper, we propose a novel sequence verification task that aims to distinguish positive video pairs performing the same action sequence from negative ones with step-level transformations but still conducting the same task. Such a challenging task resides in an open-set setting without prior action detection or segmentation that requires event-level or even frame-level annotations. To that end, we carefully reorganize two publicly available action-related datasets with step-procedure-task structure. To fully investigate the effectiveness of any method, we collect a scripted video dataset enumerating all kinds of step-level transformations in chemical experiments. Besides, a novel evaluation metric Weighted Distance Ratio is introduced to ensure equivalence for different step-level transformations during evaluation. In the end, a simple but effective baseline based on the transformer encoder with a novel sequence alignment loss is introduced to better characterize long-term dependency between steps, which outperforms other action recognition methods. Codes and data will be released1:
