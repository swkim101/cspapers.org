Fig. 1 showed the visual results of different settings for self-calibrated module Kθ. We can easily see that our method always generated stable outputs no matter how the number of convolutions. Thus we can actually use the lightweight enough architecture to instantiate it. More importantly, the self-calibrated module is just adopted in the training phase. This is to say, the architecture for Kθ will be not appeared during the inference.
