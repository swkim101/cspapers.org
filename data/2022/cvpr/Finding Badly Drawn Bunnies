As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do it justice (Fig. 1). This paper recognises this very problem and studies sketch quality measurement for the first time - letting you find these badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L$2 norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be simultaneously optimised under a neat crossentropy classification loss. GACL is lightweight with theoretic guarantees and enjoys a nice geometric interpretation to reason its success. We confirm consistent quality agreements between our GACL-induced metric and human perception through a carefully designed human study. Notably, we demonstrate three practical sketch applications enabled for the first time using our quantitative quality metric.
