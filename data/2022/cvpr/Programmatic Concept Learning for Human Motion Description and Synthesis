We introduce Programmatic Motion Concepts, a hierarchical motion representation for human actions that captures both low-level motion and high-level description as motion concepts. This representation enables human motion description, interactive editing, and controlled synthesis of novel video sequences within a single framework. We present an architecture that learns this concept representation from paired video and action sequences in a semi-supervised manner. The compactness of our representation also allows us to present a low-resource training recipe for data-efficient learning. By outperforming established baselines, especially in the small data regime, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework for multiple applications.
