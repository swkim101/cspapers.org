A practical eye authentication (EA) system targeted for edge devices needs to perform authentication and be robust to presentation attacks, all while remaining compute and latency efficient. However, existing eye-based frameworks a) perform authentication and Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) independently and b) involve significant pre-processing steps to extract the iris region. Here, we introduce a joint framework for EA and PAD using periocular images. While a deep Multitask Learning (MTL) network can perform both the tasks, MTL suffers from the forgetting effect since the training datasets for EA and PAD are disjoint. To overcome this, we propose Eye Authentication with PAD (EyePAD), a distillation-based method that trains a single network for EA and PAD while reducing the effect of forgetting. To further improve the EA performance, we introduce a novel approach called EyePAD++ that includes training an MTL network on both EA and PAD data, while distilling the ‘versatility’ of the EyePAD network through an additional distillation step. Our proposed methods outperform the SOTA in PAD and obtain near-SOTA performance in eye-to-eye verification, without any pre-processing. We also demonstrate the efficacy of EyePAD and EyePAD++ in user-to-user verification with PAD across network backbones and image quality.
