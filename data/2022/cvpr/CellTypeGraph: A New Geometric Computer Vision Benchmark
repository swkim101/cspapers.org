Label Surf: The origin is defined as the center of mass of the L1 tissue. The main axis is found by approximately determining the integument tissue symmetry axis. This is achieved by finding for each tissue in the integument (L2, L3, L4, es, nu) the respective center of mass. Then, we use least-square linear regression to find the best line interpolating the integument tissue. The second axis is found by finding the line passing through fu tissue center of mass and perpendicular to the main axis. The third axis is computed by taking the cross-product between the first and second axes.
