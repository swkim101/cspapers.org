Reference-based super-resolution(RefSR) has achieved impressive progress on the recovery of high-frequency details thanks to an additional reference high-resolution(HR) image input. Although the superiority compared with Single-Image Super-Resolution(SISR), existing RefSR methods easily result in the reference-underuse issue and the reference-misuse as shown in Fig. I. In this work, we deeply investigate the cause of the two issues and further propose a novel framework to mitigate them. Our studies find that the issues are mostly due to the improper coupled framework design of current methods. Those methods conduct the super-resolution task of the input low-resolution(LR) image and the texture transfer task from the reference image together in one module, easily introducing the interference between LR and reference features. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel framework, which decouples the two tasks of RefSR, eliminating the interference between the LR image and the reference image. The super-resolution task upsamples the LR image leveraging only the LR image itself. The texture transfer task extracts and transfers abundant textures from the reference image to the coarsely upsampled result of the super-resolution task. Extensive experiments demonstrate clear improvements in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations over state-of-the-art methods.
