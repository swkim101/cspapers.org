Previous LiDAR scene flow estimation methods, especially recurrent neural networks, usually suffer from structure distortion in challenging cases, such as sparse reflection and motion occlusions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization method based on a recurrent neural network to predict LiDAR scene flow in a weakly supervised manner. Specifically, our neural recurrent network exploits direct rigidity constraints to preserve the geometric structure of the warped source scene during an iterative alignment procedure. An error awarded optimization strategy is proposed to update the LiDAR scene flow by minimizing the point measurement error instead of reconstructing the cost volume multiple times. Trained on two autonomous driving datasets, our network outperforms recent state-of-the-art networks on lidarKITTI by a large margin. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/gtdong-ustc/LiDARSceneFlow.
