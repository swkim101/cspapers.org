To deal with the great number of untrimmed videos produced every day, we propose an efficient unsupervised action segmentation method by detecting boundaries, named action boundary detection (ABD). In particular, the proposed method has the following advantages: no training stage and low-latency inference. To detect action boundaries, we estimate the similarities across smoothed frames, which inherently have the properties of internal consistency within actions and external discrepancy across actions. Under this circumstance, we successfully transfer the boundary detection task into the change point detection based on the similarity. Then, non-maximum suppression (NMS) is conducted in local windows to select the smallest points as candidate boundaries. In addition, a clustering algorithm is followed to refine the initial proposals. Moreover, we also extend ABD to the online setting, which enables real-time action segmentation in long untrimmed videos. By evaluating on four challenging datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, thanks to the efficiency of ABD, we achieve the best trade-off between the accuracy and the inference time compared with existing unsupervised approaches.
