Identifier naming is one of the main sources of information in program comprehension, where a significant portion of software development time is spent. Previous research shows that similarity in identifier names could potentially hinder code comprehension, and subsequently code maintenance and evolution. In this paper, we present an open-source tool for assessing confusing naming combinations in Python programs. The tool which we call Namesake, flags confusing identifier naming combinations that are similar in orthography (word form), phonology (pronunciation), or semantics (meaning). Our tool extracts identifier names from the abstract syntax tree of a program, splits compound names, and evaluates the similarity of each pair in orthography, phonology, and semantics. Problematic identifier combinations are flagged to programmers along with their line numbers. In combination with existing coding style checkers, Namesake can provide programmers with an additional resource to enhance identifier naming quality. The tool can be integrated easily in DevOps pipelines for automated checking and identifier naming appraisal.
