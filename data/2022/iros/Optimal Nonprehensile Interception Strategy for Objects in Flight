Intercepting an object in flight through nonpre-hensile manipulation is a challenging problem, which is aimed at catching and stopping a flying object using little contacts without completely restraining its relative motion to the robot. This paper presents a two-stage optimal trajectory generation method to tackle this problem. At the pre-catching stage, optimal position and attitude trajectories of the robot's end-effector to approach the object are generated by a variational method. At the post-catching stage, the end-effector's trajectories are generated to optimally eliminate the translational and rotational motion of the object and a convex-MPC algorithm combined with admittance control is used to realize the trajectory tracking. A series of simulations and experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
