Advances in deep learning have resulted in steady progress in computer vision with improved accuracy on tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, thus presenting a challenge in reliable deployment. Two of the prominent tasks in 3D scene-understanding for robotics and advanced driver assistance systems are monocular depth and pose estimation, often learned together in an unsupervised manner. While studies evaluating the impact of adversarial attacks on monocular depth estimation exist, a systematic demonstration and analysis of adversarial perturbations against pose estimation are lacking. We show how additive imperceptible perturbations can not only change predictions to increase the trajectory drift but also catastrophically alter its geometry. We also study the relation between adversarial perturbations targeting monocular depth and pose estimation networks, as well as the transferability of perturbations to other networks with different architectures and losses. Our experiments show how the generated perturbations lead to notable errors in relative rotation and translation predictions and elucidate vulnerabilities of the networks.11Code can be found at https://github.com/NeurAI-Lab/mono-pose-attack.
