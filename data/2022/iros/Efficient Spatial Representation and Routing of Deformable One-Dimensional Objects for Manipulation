With the field of rigid-body robotics having matured in the last fifty years, routing, planning, and manipulation of deformable objects have recently emerged as a more untouched research area in many fields ranging from surgical robotics to industrial assembly and construction. Routing approaches for deformable objects which rely on learned implicit spatial representations (e.g., Learning-from-Demonstration methods) make them vulnerable to changes in the environment and the specific setup. On the other hand, algorithms that entirely separate the spatial representation of the deformable object from the routing and manipulation, often using a representation approach independent of planning, result in slow planning in high dimensional space. This paper proposes a novel approach to routing deformable one-dimensional objects (e.g., wires, cables, ropes, sutures, threads). This approach utilizes a compact representation for the object, allowing efficient and fast online routing. The spatial representation is based on the geometrical decomposition of the space into convex subspaces, resulting in a discrete coding of the deformable object configuration as a sequence. With such a configuration, the routing problem can be solved using a fast dynamic programming sequence matching method that calculates the next routing move. The proposed method couples the routing and efficient configuration for improved planning time. Our simulation and real experiments show the method correctly computing the next manipulation action in sub-millisecond time and accomplishing various routing and manipulation tasks.
