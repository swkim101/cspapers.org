The introduction of neuroendoscopy, microneu- rosurgery, neuronavigation, and intraoperative imaging for surgical operations has made significant improvements over other traditionally invasive surgical techniques. The integration of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-driven surgical devices with intraoperative imaging and endoscopy can enable further advancements in surgical treatments and outcomes. This work proposes the design and development of an MRI-driven endo- scope leveraging the high (3â€“7 T), external magnetic field of an MR scanner for heat-mitigated steering within the ventricular system of the brain. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of a Lorentz force-based grasper for diseased tissue manipulation and ablation. Feasibility studies show the neuroendoscope can be steered precisely within the lateral ventricle to locate a tumor using both MRI and endoscopic guidance. Results also indicate grasping forces as high as 31 mN are possible and power inputs as low as 0.69 mW can cause cancerous tissue ablation. These findings enable further developments of steerable devices using MR imaging integrated with endoscopic guidance for improved outcomes.
