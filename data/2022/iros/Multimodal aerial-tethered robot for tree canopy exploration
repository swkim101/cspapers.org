Forest canopies are the biggest habitat for terrestrial life, yet our understanding of environmental processes and biodiversity inside the canopy continues to be limited due to labour and resource intensive data collection. Existing aerial and climbing robots also struggle to access these complex environments, while animals easily navigate them using multiple means of locomotion. Following this insight we present a robot with multimodal mobility obtained by combining aerial and tethered locomotion. After the robot is deployed at the top of the tree, it can descend with the tether and maneuver around leaves and branches with its thrusters. The tether increases robustness and safety and allows for resting as well as emergency retrieval of the system. The aerial locomotion grants the system the ability to move in a conical 3D space constrained by the tether. We modelled the static system and validated the impact of design parameters on it. A simple control architecture for teleoperation is discussed and its performance is analyzed. The proposed multimodal mobility is demonstrated in preliminary outdoor tests, which show how our robot can move within the canopy while continuously monitoring the environment.
