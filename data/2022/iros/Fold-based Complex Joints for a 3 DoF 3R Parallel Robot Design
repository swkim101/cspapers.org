This contribution demonstrates the usage of fold-based joints to create a novel 3 DoF 3R(RPaR) parallel robot design. Multiple folding mechanisms are introduced, fulfilling the function of revolute, prismatic, and spherical joints. Folding mechanisms are here tested regarding their applicability in parallel kinematic robots taking advantage of beneficial properties such as increased stiffness, flat-foldability and compressed states, easy cleaning as well as lightweight designs. The designed delta robot structure is then analysed for its motion behaviour, workspace dimensions and validated by a 3D printed model. Further, scalability possibilities are presented.
