This paper presents a novel visual servoing method that controls a robotic manipulator in the configuration space as opposed to the classical vision-based control methods solely focusing on the end effector pose. We first extract the robot's shape from depth images using a skeletonization algorithm and represent it using parametric curves. We then adopt an adaptive visual servoing scheme that estimates the Jacobian online relating the changes of the curve parameters and the joint velocities. The proposed scheme does not only enable controlling a manipulator in the configuration space, but also demonstrates a better transient response while converging to the goal configuration compared to the classical adaptive visual servoing methods. We present simulations and real robot experiments that demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method and analyze its performance, robustness, and repeatability compared to the classical algorithms.
