Cleaning public areas like commercial complexes is challenging due to their sophisticated surroundings and the vast kinds of real-life dirt. Robots are required to distinguish dirts and apply corresponding cleaning strategies. In this work, we proposed an active-cleaning framework by utilizing deep-learning methods for both solid wastes detection and liquid stains segmentation. Our system consists of 4 components: a Perception module integrated with deep-learning models, a Post-processing module for projection, a Tracking module for map localization, and a Planning and Control module for cleaning strategies. Compared with classic approaches, our vision-based system significantly improves cleaning efficiency. Besides, we released the largest real-world indoor hybrid dirt cleaning dataset (HD10K) containing 10K labeled images, together with a track-level evaluation metric for better cleaning performance measurement. The proposed deep-learning based system is verified with extensive experiments on our dataset, and deployed to Gaussian Robotics's robots operating globally.
