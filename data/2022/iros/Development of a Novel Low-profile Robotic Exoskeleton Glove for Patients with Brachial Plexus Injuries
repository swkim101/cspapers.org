This paper presents the design and development of a novel, low-profile, exoskeleton robotic glove aimed for people who suffer from brachial plexus injuries to restore their lost grasping functionality. The key idea of this new glove lies in its new finger mechanism that takes advantage of the rigid coupling hybrid mechanism (RCHM) concept. This mechanism concept couples the motions of the adjacent human finger links using rigid coupling mechanisms so that the overall mechanism motion (e.g., bending, extension, etc.) could be achieved using fewer actuators. The finger mechanism utilizes the single degree of freedom case of the RCHM that uses a rack-and-pinion mechanism as the rigid coupling mechanism. This special arrangement enables to design each finger mechanism of the glove as thin as possible while maintaining mechanical robustness simultaneously. Based on this novel finger mechanism, a two-finger low-profile robotic glove was developed. Remote center of motion mechanisms were used for the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Kinematic analysis and optimization-based kinematic synthesis were conducted to determine the design parameters of the new glove. Passive abduction/adduction joints were considered to improve the grasping flexibility. A proof-of-concept prototype was built and pinch grasping experiments of various objects were conducted. The results validated the mechanism and the mechanical design of the new robotic glove and demonstrated its functionalities and capabilities in grasping objects with various shapes and weights that are used in activities of daily living (ADLs).
