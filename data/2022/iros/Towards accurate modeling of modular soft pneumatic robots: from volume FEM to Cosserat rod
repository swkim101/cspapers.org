Compared to their rigid counterparts, soft material robotic systems offer great advantages when it comes to flexibility and adaptability. Despite their advantages, modeling of soft systems is still a challenging task, due to the continuous and often highly nonlinear nature of deformation these systems exhibit. Tasks like motion planning or design optimization of soft robots require computationally cheap models of the system's behavior. In this paper we address this need by deriving operational point dependent Cosserat rod models from detailed volume finite element models (FEM). While the latter offer detailed simulations, they generally come with high computational burden that hinders them from being used in time critical model-based methods like motion planning or control. Basic Cosserat rod models promise to provide computationally efficient mechanical models of soft continuum robots. By using a detailed FE model in an offline stage to identify operational point dependent Cosserat rod models, we bring together the accuracy of volumetric FEM with the efficiency of Cosserat rod models. We apply the approach to a fiber reinforced soft pneumatic bending actuator module (SPA module) and evaluate the model's predictive capabilities for a single module as well as a two-module robot.
