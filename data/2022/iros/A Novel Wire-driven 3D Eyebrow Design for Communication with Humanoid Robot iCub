The purpose of this research is to contribute to social communication between humans and robots in scenes that have been considered difficult due to the limited facial expression capabilities of robots. In order to provide more detailed facial expressions, we designed a novel wire-driven 3D eyebrow using a soft material with a bending structure. We then demonstrated the mechanical properties of the eyebrow design and developed a prototype that could be implemented on the humanoid robot iCub to verify its operation. Lastly, we confirmed that the new design enables the production of more slight changes in facial expressions by allowing the eyebrows to change their shape at more delicate angles and continuity than the LED eyebrows of the conventional iCub.
