This paper proposes a novel approach to controlling wheel-legged quadrupedal robots using pose optimization and force-based control via quadratic programming (QP). Our method allows the robot to leverage the whole-body motion and the wheel actuation to roll over high obstacles while keeping wheel traction with the terrain. In detail, we first present linear rigid body dynamics with wheels that can be used for real-time balancing control of wheel-legged robots. We then introduce an effective pose optimization method for wheel-legged robot's locomotion over steep ramp and stair terrains. The pose optimization solves for optimal poses to enhance stability and enforce collision-free constraints at critical pose locations for rolling over high obstacles. Experimental validation of the real robot demonstrated the capability of rolling up on a 0.36 m obstacle. The robot can also successfully roll up and down multiple stairs without lifting its legs or colliding with the terrain.
