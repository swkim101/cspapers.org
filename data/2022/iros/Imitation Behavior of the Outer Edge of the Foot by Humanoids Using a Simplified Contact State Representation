There is a way to utilize humanoid robots to mimic human behavior by taking advantage of their human-like proportions. In general, motion capture is used; in this case, the posture of the body links can be taken. However, this method does not provide detailed information on the contact state, which is important for actions that involve contact with objects. In this study, we focused on the foot, which has not been paid much attention among the parts where contact and manipulation with objects are important, and developed a device to measure the contact pressure distribution at the outer edge of the sole. We proposed an index, SS-COP, which simply reflects the contact on the curved surface of the sole for this device and a robot foot with lateral force sensation and realized a behavior that imitates the foot condition of a humanoid robot by using this index.
