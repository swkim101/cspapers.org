As Liszt once said “(a virtuoso) must call up scent and blossom, and breathe the breath of life”, a virtuoso plays the piano with passion, poetry, and extraordinary technical ability. Hence, piano playing, being a task that is quintessentially human, becomes a hallmark for roboticians and artificial intelligence researchers to pursue. In this paper, we advocate an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to demonstrate how an agent can learn directly from machine-readable music score to play the piano with touch-augmented dexterous hands on a simulated piano. To achieve the desired tasks, we design useful touch- and audio-based reward functions and a series of tasks. Empirical results show that the RL agent can not only find the correct key position but also deal with the various rhythmic, volume, and fingering requirements. As a result, the agent demonstrates its effectiveness in playing simple pieces that have different musical requirements which show the potential of leveraging reinforcement learning approach for the piano playing tasks.
