Humanoid robots are versatile platforms with the potential for multiple locomotion skills. However, this contact-switched system with only two contact feet is fragile to keep balance in many scenarios. Inspired by birds combining legs and wings, we propose the novel hybrid locomotion behavior for the humanoid robots with the aid of a thruster suit. To fully leverage their agility while guaranteeing efficient computation, we combine the neural controller based on reinforcement learning to handle the complexity of the highly non-linear system and the optimization-based controller to explicitly handle the constraint conditions of the safety-critical thruster module. Our learning framework is demonstrated on several thruster-aided humanoid platforms with hybrid walking and even dynamic locomotion skills. To our best knowledge, it is the first work that, 1. demonstrates agile hybrid whole-body locomotion skills on the thruster-aided humanoid robot; 2. achieves hybrid locomotion under the reinforcement learning settings.
