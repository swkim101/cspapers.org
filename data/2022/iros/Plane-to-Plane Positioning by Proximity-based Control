In this paper, we consider a multi-sensor arrangement of proximity sensors that forms a proximity array. A general modeling methodology is considered within the framework of Sensor-based Control. It incorporates multiple sensor signals from the proximity array by giving primary emphasis on the interaction screw. To prove its effectiveness, modeling approach is applied to the task of plane-to-plane positioning. We discuss the development of two sensor-based task functions for the specific task considered. The validity of the methodology is provided using relevant experimental results.
