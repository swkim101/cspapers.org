Inspired by the traditional art of paper folding, origami, autonomous production of 3D structures from 2D sheets can be achieved by the implementation of self-folding techniques. One technique to achieve such transformation is the usage of thermo-responsive smart materials such as self-folding polymeric films, which can be controlled by heat to shrink. Achieving remote self-folding with a practical approach remains a major challenge due to the requirement for specific environments, or having to accompany electronics on origami, which limits the complexity of the origami design. In this paper, we present a wireless method to trigger the thermo-responsive self-folding process of the origami robots through magnetic induction. The proposed method is applicable for all electrically conductive materials and can wirelessly fold a mobile origami robot with a size of 32 Ã— 30 mm2. This method eliminates the need for inclusion of electronics on the origami or usage of complicated trigger methods and environmental conditions, allowing the robot to fold in a wider range of applications such as in constrained spaces.
