Industrial robots require force controllability and impact resistance to ensure safe physical interactions. An electro-hydrostaic actuator (EHA) is expected to be suitable for such applications because it has high backdrivability which improve both force controllability at contact and impact resistance. However, EHAs had been rarely used in multi-axes robotic systems. The previous works validated the force controllability of the EHA-driven robot Hydra. However, the impact resistance of an EHA-driven robot is still unclear. In order to evaluate the impact resistance of the high-power EHA-driven robot, we developed high-pressure EHAs employing ceramics as rigid material to reduce internal leakage, and developed the EHA-driven 6-DOF robot arm Hydracer as the platform for the evaluation. This paper describes the mechanism of Hydracer especially on the base 3-DOF mechanism, and conducts the backdrivability measurement and the impact resistance evaluation.
