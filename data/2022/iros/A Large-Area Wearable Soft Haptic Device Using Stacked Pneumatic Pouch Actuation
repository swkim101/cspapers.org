While haptics research has traditionally focused on the fingertips and hands, other locations on the body provide large areas of skin that could be utilized to relay large-area haptic sensations. Researchers have thus developed wearable devices that use distributed vibrotactile actuators and distributed pneumatic force displays, but these methods have limitations. In prior work, we presented a novel actuation technique involving stacking pneumatic pouches and evaluated the actuator output. In this work, we developed a wearable haptic device using this actuation technique and evaluated how the actuator output is perceived. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to evaluate users' perception thresholds, ability to localize, and ability to detect differences in contact area and compare their perception using the stacked pneumatic pouch actuation to traditional single-layer pouch actuation. We also used our device with stacked pneumatic actuation in a demonstration of a haptic hug that replicates the dynamics, pressure profile, and mapping to the human back, showcasing how this actuation technique can be used to create novel haptic stimuli.
