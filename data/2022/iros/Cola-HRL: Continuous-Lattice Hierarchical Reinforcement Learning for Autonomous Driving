Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising performance in autonomous driving applications in recent years. The early end-to-end RL method is usually unexplainable and fails to generate stable actions, while the hierarchical RL (HRL) method can tackle the above issues by dividing complex problems into multiple sub-tasks. Prior HRL works either select discrete driving behaviors with continuous control commands, or generate expected goals for the low-level controller. However, they typically have strong scenario dependence or fail to generate goals with good quality. To address the above challenges, we propose a Continuous-Lattice Hierarchical RL (Cola-HRL) method for autonomous driving tasks to make high-quality decisions in various scenarios. We utilize the continuous-lattice module to generate reasonable goals, ensuring temporal and spatial reachability. Then, we train and evaluate our method under different traffic scenarios based on real-world High Definition maps. Experimental results show our method can handle multiple scenarios. In addition, our method also demonstrates better performance and driving behaviors compared to existing RL methods.
