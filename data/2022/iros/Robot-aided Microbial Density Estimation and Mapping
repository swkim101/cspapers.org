Estimating the microbial infestation profile of an area is essential for an effective cleaning process. However, current methods used to inspect the microbial infestation within a spatial region are manual and laborious. For large regions that require automated cleaning, conventional methods of microbial examination are not practical. We propose a novel robot-aided microbial density estimation and mapping framework using an in-house developed biosensor payload onboard a mobile robot. The biosensor estimates the degree of microbial infestation in Relative Light Units (RLU) using the natural bio-luminescence reaction. The global distribution of microbial infestation is approximated through the Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Nearest Neighbour (NN) interpolation algorithms. The proposed method is implemented on an in-house developed mobile robot called Beluga. The framework's validation and usefulness are demonstrated quantitatively through real-world experiment trials.
