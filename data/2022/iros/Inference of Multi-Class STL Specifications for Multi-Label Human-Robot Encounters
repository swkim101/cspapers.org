This paper is interested in formalizing human trajectories in human-robot encounters. Inspired by robot navigation tasks in human-crowded environments, we consider the case where a human and a robot walk towards each other, and where humans have to avoid colliding with the incoming robot. Further, humans may describe different be-haviors, ranging from being in a hurry/minimizing completion time to maximizing safety. We propose a decision tree-based algorithm to extract STL formulae from multi-label data. Our inference algorithm learns STL specifications from data containing multiple classes, where instances can be labelled by one or many classes. We base our evaluation on a dataset of trajectories collected through an online study reproducing human-robot encounters.
