Considering realistic characteristics of acoustic localization methods is crucial for roboticists when developing guidance and control algorithms for small and agile underwater robots. Current simulators either rely purely on geometric distancing, i.e. do not consider dynamic effects such as robot motion during acoustic signal propagation, or they are too complex for usage by non-communication experts and, thus, vulnerable to misconfiguration. We propose an open ROS-based framework that extends existing robot simulators (e. g. Gazebo) by simulating the effects of realistic acoustic ranging for underwater robot localization. Thus, our simulator enables realistic real-time analysis and evaluation of guidance, navigation, and control algorithms in software in-the-loop systems. For this purpose, we incorporate and encapsulate the non-trivial characteristics of acoustic communication and ranging such as robot motion during signal propagation, packet reception failure, and modem timings. This ensures the applicability of the tool by roboticists who are typically non-experts in acoustic communication and guarantees accurate and realistic simulation results. We demonstrate the functionality and performance of our framework and validate it on real-world experimental data on the example of a two-way ranging method. Our open-source release includes well-defined interfaces and parameters as well as a tutorial. This targets other roboticists who can either use our framework directly or easily adapt it to their individual setup, e. g., by adding further acoustic-ranging protocols.
