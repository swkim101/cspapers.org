We propose DeepFusion, a modular multi-modal architecture to fuse lidars, cameras and radars in different combinations for 3D object detection. Specialized feature extractors take advantage of each modality and can be exchanged easily, making the approach simple and flexible. Extracted features are transformed into bird's-eye-view as a common representation for fusion. Spatial and semantic alignment is performed prior to fusing modalities in the feature space. Finally, a detection head exploits rich multi-modal features for improved 3D detection performance. Experimental results for lidar-camera, lidar-camera-radar and camera-radar fusion show the flexibility and effectiveness of our fusion approach. In the process, we study the largely unexplored task of faraway car detection up to 225 meters, showing the benefits of our lidar-camera fusion. Furthermore, we investigate the required density of lidar points for 3D object detection and illustrate implications at the example of robustness against adverse weather conditions. Moreover, ablation studies on our camera-radar fusion highlight the importance of accurate depth estimation.
