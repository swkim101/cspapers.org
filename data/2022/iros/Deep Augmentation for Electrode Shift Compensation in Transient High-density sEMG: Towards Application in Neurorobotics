Going beyond the traditional sparse multichannel peripheral human-machine interface that has been used widely in neurorobotics, high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) has shown significant potential for decoding upper-limb motor control. We have recently proposed heterogeneous temporal dilation of LSTM in a deep neural network architecture for a large number of gestures (>60), securing spatial resolution and fast convergence. However, several fundamental questions remain unanswered. One problem targeted explicitly in this paper is the issue of “electrode shift,” which can happen specifically for high-density systems and during doffing and donning the sensor grid. Another real-world problem is the question of transient versus plateau classification, which connects to the temporal resolution of neural interfaces and seamless control. In this paper, for the first time, we implement gesture prediction on the transient phase of HD-sEMG data while robustifying the human-machine interface decoder to electrode shift. For this, we propose the concept of deep data augmentation for transient HD-sEMG. We show that without using the proposed augmentation, a slight shift of 10mm may drop the decoder’s performance to as low as 20%. Combining the proposed data augmentation with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we recovered the performance to 84.6% while securing a high spatiotemporal resolution, robustifying to the electrode shift, and getting closer to large-scale adoption by the end-users, enhancing resiliency.
