We present a biologically inspired approach for path planning with dynamic obstacle avoidance. Path plan-ning is performed in a condensed configuration space of a robot generated by self-organizing neural networks (SONN). The robot itself and static as well as dynamic obstacles are mapped from the Cartesian task to the configuration space by precomputed kinematics. The condensed space represents a cognitive map of the environment, which is inspired by place cells and the concept of cognitive maps in mammalian brains. Generation of training data as well as the evaluation are performed on a real industrial robot accompanied by simulations. To evaluate reactive collision-free online planning within a changing environment, a demonstrator was realized. Then, a comparative study regarding sample-based planners was carried out. The robot is able to operate in dynamically changing environments and re-plan its motion trajectories within impressing 0.02 seconds, which proofs the real-time capability of our concept.
