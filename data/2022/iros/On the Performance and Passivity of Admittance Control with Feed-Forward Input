This paper analyzes the effect of control param-eters of feed-forward and inner loop velocity controller in an admittance control scheme on the performance and passivity. The interaction force, inertia, and damping compensation were considered as the feed-forward input. Sufficient conditions and guidelines for each parameter were provided to enable the implementation of a wide range of desired admittance satis-fying passivity. The proposed guidelines were verified through experiments.
