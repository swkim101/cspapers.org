Context information is important for instance segmentation on point clouds. Existing methods either only use local surroundings by stacking multiple convolution layers or use non-local methods to model long-range interactions. However, they usually directly operate on points which is an unstructured and low-level representation and is highly dependent on context. To address this issue, we propose an effective framework named Implicit-Part Context Aggregation (IPCA), which adopts implicit parts as an intermediate representation and achieves context aggregation through message passing along the implicit part graph. Specifically, we first organize unstructured points into geometrically consistent implicit parts and construct the implicit part graph according to the geometric adjacency. Then, an initial part embedding is extracted using the proposed Implicit Part Network (IPN) which can aggregate point features and capture the intrinsic geometric shape of the part. We further refine the part embedding by a graph reasoning module named Context Aggregation Network (CAN), which helps to make a more precise prediction by well exploiting the context information. Instance proposals are then generated by grouping implicit parts. Finally, we propose an additional step to attribute the entire instance proposal to a Semantic Criterion Net (SCN) to infer the semantics of the instance. The purpose is to correct the semantic prediction errors caused by not knowing the boundary and overall shape of the object in the previous steps. Extensive experiments on two large datasets, ScanNet and 3RScan, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. To our knowledge, it yields the highest performance on the ScanNet test benchmark and its AP@50 is 9.5 points higher than the baseline. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaodongww/IPCA
