This paper proposes a new regularization technique for reinforcement learning (RL) towards making policy and value functions smooth and stable. RL is known for the instability of the learning process and the sensitivity of the acquired policy to noise. Several methods have been proposed to resolve these problems, and in summary, the smoothness of policy and value functions learned mainly in RL contributes to these problems. However, if these functions are extremely smooth, their expressiveness would be lost, resulting in not obtaining the global optimal solution. This paper therefore considers RL under local Lipschitz continuity constraint, so-called L2C2. By designing the spatio-temporal locally compact space for L2C2 from the state transition at each time step, the moderate smoothness can be achieved without loss of expressiveness. Numerical noisy simulations verified that the proposed L2C2 outperforms the task performance while smoothing out the robot action generated from the learned policy.
