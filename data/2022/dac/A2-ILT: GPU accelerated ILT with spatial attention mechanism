Inverse lithography technology (ILT) is one of the promising resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) in modern design-for-manufacturing closure, however, it suffers from huge computational overhead and unaffordable mask writing time. In this paper, we propose A2-ILT, a GPU-accelerated ILT framework with spatial attention mechanism. Based on the previous GPU-accelerated ILT flow, we significantly improve the ILT quality by introducing spatial attention map and on-the-fly mask rectilinearization, and strengthen the robustness by Reinforcement-Learning deployment. Experimental results show that, comparing to the state-of-the-art solutions, A2-ILT achieves 5.06% and 11.60% reduction in printing error and process variation band with a lower mask complexity and superior runtime performance.
