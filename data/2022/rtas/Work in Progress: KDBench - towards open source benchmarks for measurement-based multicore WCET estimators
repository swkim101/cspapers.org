The real-time systems community is facing the lack of benchmarks adapted to measurement-based worst-case execution time (WCET) estimators. We provide in this paper first steps towards such benchmarks by proposing them for single core microcontrollers, while we leave as future work the migration to multicore microcontrollers. The considered benchmarks are the programs of an open source drone autopilot. We conclude the paper by underlining the main difficulties of such migration.
