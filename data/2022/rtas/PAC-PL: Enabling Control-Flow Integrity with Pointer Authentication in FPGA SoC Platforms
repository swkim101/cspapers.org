Control-flow integrity (CFI) is an effective technique to enhance the security of software systems. Processor designers recently started to provide hardware-based support to efficiently implement CFI, such as the pointer authentication (PA) feature provided by ARM starting from ARMv8.3-A processor architectures. These CFI mechanisms are also accompanied by support in the mainline codebase of popular compilers (such as GCC and LLVM) and the Linux operating system. As such, they are expected to establish as widespread security mechanisms. Nevertheless, many commercial chips still do not support hardware-assisted CFI, even some of the ones that just entered the market. This paper presents PAC-PL, a solution to enable hardware-assisted CFI on heterogeneous platforms that include a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) fabric, such as the Xilinx Ultrascale+ and Versal. PAC-PL comes with compiler-and OS-level support, is compatible with ARMâ€™s PA, and enables advanced key management and attack detection strategies. A timing analysis for PAC-PL is also presented. PAC-PL was experimentally evaluated with state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of run-time overhead, memory footprint, and FPGA resource consumption, resulting in a practical solution for implementing CFI.
