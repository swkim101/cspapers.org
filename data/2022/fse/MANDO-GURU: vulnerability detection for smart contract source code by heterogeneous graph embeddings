Smart contracts are increasingly used with blockchain systems for high-value applications. It is highly desired to ensure the quality of smart contract source code before they are deployed. This paper proposes a new deep learning-based tool, MANDO-GURU, that aims to accurately detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts at both coarse-grained contract-level and fine-grained line-level. Using a combination of control-flow graphs and call graphs of Solidity code, we design new heterogeneous graph attention neural networks to encode more structural and potentially semantic relations among different types of nodes and edges of such graphs and use the encoded embeddings of the graphs and nodes to detect vulnerabilities. Our validation of real-world smart contract datasets shows that MANDO-GURU can significantly improve many other vulnerability detection techniques by up to 24% in terms of the F1-score at the contract level, depending on vulnerability types. It is the first learning-based tool for Ethereum smart contracts that identify vulnerabilities at the line level and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based techniques by up to 63.4%. Our tool is publicly available at https://github.com/MANDO-Project/ge-sc-machine. A test version is currently deployed at http://mandoguru.com, and a demo video of our tool is available at http://mandoguru.com/demo-video.
