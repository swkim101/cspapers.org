Statistical fault localization aims at detecting execution features that correlate with failures, such as whether individual lines are part of the execution. We introduce SFLKit, an out-of-the-box workbench for statistical fault localization. The framework provides straightforward access to the fundamental concepts of statistical fault localization. It supports five predicate types, four coverage-inspired spectra, like lines, and 44 similarity coefficients, e.g., TARANTULA or OCHIAI, for statistical program analysis. SFLKit separates the execution of tests from the analysis of the results and is therefore independent of the used testing framework. It leverages program instrumentation to enable the logging of events and derives the predicates and spectra from these logs. This instrumentation allows for introducing multiple programming languages and the extension of new concepts in statistical fault localization. Currently, SFLKit supports the instrumentation of Python programs. It is highly configurable, requiring only the logging of the required events.
