Failure studies are important in revealing the root causes, behaviors, and life cycle of defects in software systems. These studies either focus on understanding the characteristics of defects in specific classes of systems, or the characteristics of a specific type of defect in the systems it manifests in. Failure studies have influenced various software engineering research directions, especially in the area of software evolution, defect detection, and program repair. In this paper, we reflect on the conduct of failure studies in software engineering. We reviewed a sample of 52 failure study papers. We identified several recurring problems in these studies, some of which hinder the ability of software engineering community to trust or replicate the results. Based on our findings, we suggest future research directions, including identifying and analyzing failure causal chains, standardizing the conduct of failure studies, and tool support for faster defect analysis.
