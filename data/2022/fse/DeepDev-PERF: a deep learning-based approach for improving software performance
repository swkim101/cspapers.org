Improving software performance is an important yet challenging part of the software development cycle. Today, the majority of performance inefficiencies are identified and patched by performance experts. Recent advancements in deep learning approaches and the wide-spread availability of open-source data creates a great opportunity to automate the identification and patching of performance problems. In this paper, we present DeepDev-PERF, a transformer-based approach to suggest performance improvements for C# applications. We pretrain DeepDev-PERF on English and Source code corpora, followed by finetuning for the task of generating performance improvement patches for C# applications. Our evaluation shows that our model can generate the same performance improvement suggestion as the developer fix in â€„53
