We introduce WikiDoMiner â€“ a tool for automatically generating domain-specific corpora by crawling Wikipedia. WikiDoMiner helps requirements engineers create an external knowledge resource that is specific to the underlying domain of a given requirements specification (RS). Being able to build such a resource is important since domain-specific datasets are scarce. WikiDoMiner generates a corpus by first extracting a set of domain-specific keywords from a given RS, and then querying Wikipedia for these keywords. The output of WikiDoMiner is a set of Wikipedia articles relevant to the domain of the input RS. Mining Wikipedia for domain-specific knowledge can be beneficial for multiple requirements engineering tasks, e.g., ambiguity handling, requirements classification, and question answering. WikiDoMiner is publicly available on Zenodo under an open-source license (https: //doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6672682)
