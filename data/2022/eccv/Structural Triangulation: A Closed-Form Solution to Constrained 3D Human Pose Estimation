If all bone vectors are fixed, then constraints in Eq. (18) are already satisfied, the only problem need to be considered is how to solve Eq. (17) without constraints. Since w′ i,k is treated as constant, the problem is a trivial unconstrained quadratic optimization problem. The conclusion is obviously correct, and now we want to provide the analytical expressions of Q and p by detailed inductions. Before starting, we need to first regulate some notations of camera parameters. For the k camera, use Rk ∈ R3×3 and tk ∈ R to represent the rotation and translation, and Kk ∈ R3×3 for the intrinsic matrix. Then the projection matrix is:
