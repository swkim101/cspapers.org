Recent studies have shown that detectors based on deep models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, even in the black-box scenario where the attacker cannot access the model information. Most existing attack methods aim to minimize the true positive rate, which often shows poor attack performance, as another sub-optimal bounding box may be detected around the attacked bounding box to be the new true positive one. To settle this challenge, we propose to minimize the true positive rate and maximize the false positive rate, which can encourage more false positive objects to block the generation of new true positive bounding boxes. It is modeled as a multi-objective optimization (MOP) problem, of which the generic algorithm can search the Pareto-optimal. However, our task has more than two million decision variables, leading to low searching efficiency. Thus, we extend the standard Genetic Algorithm with Random Subset selection and Divide-and-Conquer, called GARSDC, which significantly improves the efficiency. Moreover, to alleviate the sensitivity to population quality in generic algorithms, we generate a gradient-prior initial population, utilizing the transferability between different detectors with similar backbones. Compared with the state-of-art attack methods, GARSDC decreases by an average 12.0 in the mAP and queries by about 1000 times in extensive experiments.
