. Modeling the dynamics of people walking is a problem of long-standing interest in computer vision. Many previous works involving pedestrian trajectory prediction define a particular set of individual ac-tions to implicitly model group actions. In this paper, we present a novel architecture named GP-Graph which has collective group representations for effective pedestrian trajectory prediction in crowded environments, and is compatible with all types of existing approaches. A key idea of GP-Graph is to model both individual-wise and group-wise relations as graph representations. To do this, GP-Graph first learns to assign each pedestrian into the most likely behavior group. Using this assignment information, GP-Graph then forms both intra- and inter-group interactions as graphs, accounting for human-human relations within a group and group-group relations, respectively. To be specific, for the intra-group interaction, we mask pedestrian graph edges out of an associated group. We also propose group pooling&unpooling operations to represent a group with multiple pedestrians as one graph node. Lastly, GP-Graph infers a probability map for socially-acceptable future trajectories from the integrated features of both group interactions. Moreover, we introduce a group-level latent vector sampling to ensure collective inferences over a set of possible future trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our architecture, which demonstrates consistent performance improvements with publicly available benchmarks.
