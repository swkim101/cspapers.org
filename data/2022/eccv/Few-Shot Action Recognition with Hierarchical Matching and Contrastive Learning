Paper ID 4804 This document provides supplementary material that has been omitted from the main paper due to space limitations. Section. 1 provides more implementation details about our model. Section. 2 presents the performance comparison under different setups from 1-shot to 5-shot and the computational cost comparison between previous works and ours. Section. 3 shows the additional ablation of different clip and patch number we select in temporal and spatial matching. Section. 4 provides the detailed description of the multi-scale strategy to represent patches and clips.
