To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SIA, we conduct quantitative results on the DFDC dataset [3]. DFDC is a large-scale deepfake datasets that contains 1133 real videos and 4080 fake videos with several manipulated methods. The results in Tab.1 show that our method achieves SOTA performance compared with recently face forgery detection methods. Specifically, our method outperforms the Multi-Attentional method by around 3% in terms of ACC, which demonstrate the self-information can provide more guidance for attention mechanism and the effectiveness of the design of dual attention scheme.
