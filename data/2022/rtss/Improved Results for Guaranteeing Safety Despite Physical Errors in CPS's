A recent paper declares a ‘physical error’ to have occurred in an autonomous mobile CPS if it fails to pinpoint its location to within an acceptable degree of accuracy, and proposes an innovative approach for dealing with such physical errors without compromising safety properties. We further generalize the proposed approach to enhance its applicability to a wider range of conditions than is currently possible. We also show that some schedulability analysis that was derived in this recent paper for this approach is too optimistic, and present a fix to get rid of unwarranted optimism.
