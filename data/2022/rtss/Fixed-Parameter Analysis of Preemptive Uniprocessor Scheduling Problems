The algorithmic technique of fixed-parameter analysis of computationally intractable problems seeks to obtain a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of the intractability, with a view to identifying conditions under which the problem becomes tractable. We apply fixed-parameter analysis to the fixed-priority and EDF scheduling of recurrent (periodic and sporadic) task systems upon preemptive uniprocessor platforms.
