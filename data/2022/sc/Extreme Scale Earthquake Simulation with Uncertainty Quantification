We develop a stochastic finite element method with ultra-large degrees of freedom that discretize probabilistic and physical spaces using unstructured second-order tetrahedral elements with double precision using a mixed-precision implicit iterative solver that scales to the full Fugaku system and enables fast Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). The developed solver designed to attain high performance on a variety of CPU/GPU-based supercomputers enabled solving 37 trillion degrees-of-freedom problem with 19.8% peak FP64 performance on full Fugaku (89.8 PFLOPS) with 87.7% weak scaling efficiency, corresponding to 224-fold speedup over the state of the art solver running on full Summit. This method, which has shown its effectiveness via solving huge (32-trillion degrees-of-freedom) practical problems, is expected to be a breakthrough in damage mitigation, and is expected to facilitate the scientific understanding of earthquake phenomena and have a ripple effect on other fields that similarly require UQ.
