This paper introduces Out of Hypervisor (OoH), a new virtualization research axis. Instead of emulating full virtual hardware inside a VM to support a hypervisor, the OoH principle is to individually expose current hypervisor-oriented hardware virtualization features to the guest OS. This way, guest's processes could also take benefit from those features. We illustrate OoH with Intel PML (Page Modification Logging), a feature that allows efficient dirty page tracking to improve VM live migration. Because dirty page tracking is at the heart of many essential tasks including process checkpointing (e.g., CRIU) and concurrent garbage collection (e.g, Boehm GC), OoH exposes PML to accelerate these tasks in the guest. We present two OoH solutions namely Shadow PML (SPML) and Extended PML (EPML) that we integrated into CRIU and Boehm GC. Evaluation results showed that EPML speeds up CRIU checkpointing by about 13 x and Boehm garbage collection by up to 6x compared to SPML, /proc, and userfaultfd while reducing their overhead on monitored applications by about 16 x.
