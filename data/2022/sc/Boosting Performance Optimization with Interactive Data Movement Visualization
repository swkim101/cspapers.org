Optimizing application performance in today's hardware architecture landscape is an important, but increasingly complex task, often requiring detailed performance analyses. In particular, data movement and reuse play a crucial role in optimization and are often hard to improve without detailed program inspection. Performance visualizations can assist in the diagnosis of performance problems, but generally rely on data gathered through lengthy program executions. In this paper, we present a performance visualization geared towards analyzing data movement and reuse to inform impactful optimization decisions, without requiring program execution. We propose an approach that combines static dataflow analysis with parameterized program simulations to analyze both global data movement and fine-grained data access and reuse behavior, and visualize insights in-situ on the program representation. Case studies analyzing and optimizing real-world applications demonstrate our tool's effectiveness in guiding optimization decisions and making the performance tuning process more interactive.
