We present ReCapture, a system that leverages AR-based guidance to help users capture time-lapse data with hand-held mobile devices. ReCapture works by repeatedly guiding users back to the precise location of previously captured images so they can record time-lapse videos one frame at a time without leaving their camera in the scene. Building on previous work in computational re-photography, we combine three different guidance modes to enable parallel hand-held time-lapse capture in general settings. We demonstrate the versatility of our system on a wide variety of subjects and scenes captured over a year of development and regular use, and explore different visualizations of unstructured hand-held time-lapse data.
