User studies play a critical role in human subject research, including human-computer interaction. Virtual reality (VR) researchers tend to conduct user studies in-person at their laboratory, where participants experiment with novel equipment to complete tasks in a simulated environment, which is often new to many. However, due to social distancing requirements in recent years, VR research has been disrupted by preventing participants from attending in-person laboratory studies. On the other hand, affordable head-mounted displays are becoming common, enabling access to VR experiences and interactions outside traditional research settings. Recent research has shown that unsupervised remote user studies can yield reliable results, however, the setup of experiment software designed for remote studies can be technically complex and convoluted. We present a novel open-source Unity toolkit, RemoteLab, designed to facilitate the preparation of remote experiments by providing a set of tools that synchronize experiment state across multiple computers, record and collect data from various multimedia sources, and replay the accumulated data for analysis. This toolkit facilitates VR researchers to conduct remote experiments when in-person experiments are not feasible or increase the sampling variety of a target population and reach participants that otherwise would not be able to attend in-person.
