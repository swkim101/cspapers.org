We present HingeCore, a novel type of laser-cut 3D structure made from sandwich materials, such as foamcore. The key design element behind HingeCore is what we call a finger hinge, which we produce by laser-cutting foamcore “half-way”. The primary benefit of finger hinges is that they allow for very fast assembly, as they allow models to be assembled by folding and because folded hinges stay put at the intended angle, based on the friction between fingers alone, which eliminates the need for glue or tabs. Finger hinges are also highly robust, with some 5mm foamcore models withstanding 62kg. We present HingeCoreMaker, a stand-alone software tool that automatically converts 3D models to HingeCore layouts, as well as an integration into a 3D modeling tool for laser cutting (Kyub [7]). We have used HingeCoreMaker to fabricate design objects, including speakers, lamps, and a life-size bust, as well as structural objects, such as functional furniture. In our user study, participants assembled HingeCore layouts 2.9x faster than layouts generated using the state-of-the-art for plate-based assembly (Roadkill [1]).
