Even if UAVs undoubtedly had a profound effect on the visual inspection capabilities of transmission lines, rolling robots, especially for bundled configurations, will still play an extensive role in the maintenance of these strategic assets. As such, LineRanger is among the most efficient and capable wheeled platform, that can travel at an average speed of 8 km/h. In this paper, LineRanger mechanical design insights are shared, unfolding how strictly mechanical solutions deals with ease of obstacle crossing, ease of installation procedure without requiring any linemen to access the high voltage environment area, and ease of deployment of dedicated, custom-made sensors onto the line component of interest. This novel robotic platform is now being deployed onto Hydro-Quebec power grid network, performing high value applications.
