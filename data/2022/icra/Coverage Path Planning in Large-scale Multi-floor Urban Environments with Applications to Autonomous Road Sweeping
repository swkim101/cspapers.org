Coverage Path Planning is the work horse of contemporary service task automation, powering autonomous floor cleaning robots and lawn mowers in households and office sites. While steady progress has been made on indoor cleaning and outdoor mowing, these environments are small and with simple geometry compared to general urban environments such as city parking garages, highway bridges or city crossings. To pave the way for autonomous road sweeping robots to operate in such difficult and complex environments, a benchmark suite with three large-scale 3D environments representative of this task is presented. On this benchmark we evaluate a new Coverage Path Planning method in comparison with previous well performing algorithms, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method. Part of the success, for all evaluated algorithms, is the usage of automated domain adaptation by in-the-loop parameter optimization using Bayesian Optimization. Apart from improving the performance, tedious and bias-prone manual tuning is made obsolete, which makes the evaluation more robust and the results even stronger.
