Robots performing close physical interaction with humans would require a continuously variable transmission to operate in the region around the peak efficiency or peak power of the driving system. Conventional continuously variable transmission (CVT) has shown advantages in energy-efficient driving systems. However, these CVT designs are heavy and large for robotic applications. This paper presents a passively adaptable toroidal-CVT (pat-CVT) that is coupled with a twisted string actuator (TSA). The proposed combination of pat-CVT with TSA expands the operation range of TSA and mimics the torque-speed characteristics of artificial muscles. The contributions of the proposed system are as follows: 1) It has a high transmission ratio (4.6:1) compared to the level of existing CVT, and compact design; 2) We propose a structure that increases the power transmission efficiency by reducing slip rate during rotation through the application of soft material on the input/output disk and roller surfaces of the CVT; 3) Relations between the external load and the transmission ratio can be determined by selecting the spring in the system to optimize the motor operating conditions over the entire range of loads. We show theoretical modeling of pat-CVT with TSA and characterization of the transmission ratio, energy efficiency, and force-velocity curve.
