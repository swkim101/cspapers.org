We present a planning framework for min-imising the deterministic worst-case error in sparse Gaus-sian process (GP) regression. We first derive a univer-sal worst-case error bound for sparse GP regression with bounded noise using interpolation theory on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). By exploiting the conditional inde-pendence (CI) assumption central to sparse GP regression, we show that the worst-case error minimisation can be achieved by solving a posterior entropy minimisation problem. In turn, the posterior entropy minimisation problem is solved using a Gaussian belief space planning algorithm. We corroborate the proposed worst-case error bound in a simple 1D example, and test the planning framework in simulation for a 2D vehicle in a complex flow field. Our results demonstrate that the proposed posterior entropy minimisation approach is effective in minimising deterministic error, and outperforms the conventional measurement entropy maximisation formulation when the inducing points are fixed.
