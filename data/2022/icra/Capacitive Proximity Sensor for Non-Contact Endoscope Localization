The promising automation of flexible surgical instruments and robots is impeded by the lack of sensory means, which allow for sensing of an instrument's position to the surrounding tissue. This work presents a novel sensory method utilizing capacitive proximity sensing to derive a relative localization of a flexible instrument inside a hollow organ. The method is evaluated by exemplary integration of a sensor in a commercial gastroendoscope and accuracy analysis using a high precision robot. The results show an accuracy of distance sensing from a medical phantom's center of 2%. The method is also evaluated for the irregularly shaped surrounding of ex-vivo tissue in a dynamic scenario. This promising approach holds potential for transfer to clinical scenarios and for further development towards pose estimation of flexible surgical robots and shape sensing of a minimally invasive environment.
