In recent years, an increasing number of research works have been focusing on the manipulation by aerial robots. Previous works using aerial robots with robotic arms have two problems: underactuation and external disturbances. We propose the fully-actuated control method and motion strategy using contact with the environment to solve these problems, along with the mechanical approach required. First, each propeller's 1 degree-of-freedom (DoF) thrust vectoring units are applied to enable fully-actuated flight control. In order to obtain the desired thrust and vectoring angle inputs for aerial manipulation satisfying hardware limits, we developed a fully-actuated control method using non-linear optimization. Second, we propose a manipulation motion strategy that treats the multilink robot body as a fixed manipulator by making contact with the environment. The contact mechanism attached to the link end is developed to maintain contact and resist external disturbances. In a real machine experiment, the robot successfully opened the door while in contact with the wall, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed methods.
