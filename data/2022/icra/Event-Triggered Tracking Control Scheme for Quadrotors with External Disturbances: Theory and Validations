This article studies the tracking control of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) under time-varying external disturbances. An event-triggered sliding mode control (SMC) strategy is proposed by introducing a new triggering condition form of desired trajectory, quadrotor position, and velocity. In the sense of Lyapunov theory, the stability of the entire closed-loop control system is analyzed, and it is proved that the tracking error is adjusted to an adjustable set around zero. We show that the Zeno phenomenon can be avoided; that is, a positive minimum inter-event time is assured. One of the salient features of the proposed strategy is that it can reduce the update frequency of the control efforts, thereby ensuring desirable tracking performance under limited communication bandwidth. Comparative simulation and experimental results are provided to show the efficacy of our framework.
