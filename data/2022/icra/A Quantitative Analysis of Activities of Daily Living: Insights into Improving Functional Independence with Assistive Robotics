Wheelchair-mounted robotic manipulators have the potential to help the elderly and individuals living with disabilities carry out their activities of daily living (ADLs) independently. Robotics researchers focus on assistive tasks from the perspective of various control schemes and motion types, whereas, health research focuses on clinical assessment and rehabilitation, arguably leaving important differences between the two domains. In particular, there have been many studies on which activities are relevant to functional independence, but little is known quantitatively about the frequencies of ADLs that are typically carried out in everyday life. Understanding what activities are frequently carried out during the day can help guide the development and prioritization of robotic technology for in-home assistive robotic deployment. Robotics and health care communities have differing terms and taxonomies for representing tasks and motions; we aim to ameliorate taxonomic differences by consolidating quantitative task data with prior results from subjective task priority surveys. This study targets lifelogging databases, where we compute (i) daily activity task frequency from long-term low sampling frequency video and Internet of Things sensor data, and (ii) short term arm and hand movement data from video data of domestic tasks. In this work, we aim to provide deeper insights and meaningful guidelines to focus research and future developments in the field of assistive robotic manipulation that support the needs and performance requirements of the target population.
