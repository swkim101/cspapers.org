Collision risk and smoothness are the most important factors in global path planning. Currently, planning methods that reduce global path collision risk and improve its smoothness through numerical optimization have achieved good results. However, these methods cannot always optimize the path. The reason is all points on the path are considered as decision variables, which leads to the high dimensionality of the defined optimization problem. Therefore, we propose a novel global path optimization method. The method characterizes the path as a parametric curve and then optimizes the curve's parameters with a defined objective function, which successfully reduces the dimension of optimization problem. The proposed method is compared with baseline and state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show the path optimized by our method is not only optimal in collision risk, but also in efficiency and smoothness. Furthermore, the proposed method is also implemented and tested in both simulation and real robots.
