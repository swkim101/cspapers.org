Instance-aware segmentation of unseen objects is essential for a robotic system in an unstructured environment. Although previous works achieved encouraging results, they were limited to segmenting the only visible regions of unseen objects. For robotic manipulation in a cluttered scene, amodal perception is required to handle the occluded objects behind others. This paper addresses Unseen Object Amodal Instance Segmentation (UOAIS) to detect 1) visible masks, 2) amodal masks, and 3) occlusions on unseen object instances. For this, we propose a Hierarchical Occlusion Modeling (HOM) scheme designed to reason about the occlusion by assigning a hierarchy to a feature fusion and prediction order. We evaluated our method on three benchmarks (tabletop, indoors, and bin environments) and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.
