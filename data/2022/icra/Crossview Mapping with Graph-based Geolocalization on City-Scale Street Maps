3D environment mapping has been actively stud-ied recently with the development of autonomous driving and augmented reality. Although many image-based methods are proposed due to their convenience and flexibility compared to other complex sensors, few works focus on fixing the inherent scale ambiguity of image-based methods and registering the reconstructed structure to the real-world 3D map, which is very important for autonomous driving. This paper presents a low-cost mapping solution that is able to refine and align the monocular reconstructed point cloud given a public street map. Specifically, we first find the association between the street map and the reconstructed point cloud structure by a novel graph-based geolocalization method. Then, optimized with the corresponding relationship, the map accuracy is significantly improved. The rich environment information can also be associated with the point cloud by the geographical location. Experiments show that our geolocalization algorithm can locate the scene on a gigantic city-scale map (173.46 km2) in two minutes and support 3D map reconstruction with absolute scale and rich environmental information from Internet videos.
