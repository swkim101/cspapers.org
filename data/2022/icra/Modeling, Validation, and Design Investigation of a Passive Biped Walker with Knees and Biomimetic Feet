This paper studies a passive biped walker with knees and biomimetic feet and its behavior, as a function of key parameters. The model includes a continuous dynamic representation of the knee joint's interaction with a viscoelastic kneecap, as well as a complete kinematic description of feet that are designed to mimic the human rollover shape. First, the analytical model is derived and studied numerically for its passive walking capabilities. Then, the model is verified through independent simulations in a different platform. Finally, to increase the efficiency of its passive gaits and to map out its walking capabilities, the model is investigated parametrically. The methods used as well as the results obtained can offer significant assistance in the field of designing passivity-based biomimetic walking robots and prosthetic devices.
