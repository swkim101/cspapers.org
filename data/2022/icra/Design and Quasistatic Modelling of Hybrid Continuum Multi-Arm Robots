Continuum surgical robots can navigate anatomical pathways to reach pathological locations deep inside the human body. Their flexibility, however, generally comes with reduced dexterity at their tip and limited workspace. Building on recent work on eccentric tube robots, this paper proposes a new continuum robot architecture and theoretical framework that combines the flexibility of push/pull actuated snake robots and the dexterity offered by concentric tube robotic end-effectors. We designed and present a prototype system as a proof-of-concept, and developed a tailored quasistatic mechanics-based model that describes the shape and end-effector's pose for this new type robotic architecture. The model can accommodate an arbitrary number of arms placed eccentrically with respect to the backbone's neutral axis. Our experiments show that the error between model and experiment is on average 3.56% of the manipulator's overall length. This is in agreement with state of the art models of single type continuum architecture.
