In this work, we focus on multi-step manipulation tasks that involve long-horizon planning and considers progress reversal. Such tasks interlace high-level reasoning that consists of the expected states that can be attained to achieve an overall task and low-level reasoning that decides what actions will yield these states. We propose a sample efficient Previous Action Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Network (PAC-RoManNet) to learn the action-value functions and predict manipulation action candidates from visual observation of the scene and action-value predictions of the previous action. We define a Task Progress based Gaussian (TPG) reward function that computes the reward based on actions that lead to successful motion primitives and progress towards the overall task goal. To balance the ratio of exploration/exploitation, we introduce a Loss Adjusted Exploration (LAE) policy that determines actions from the action candidates according to the Boltzmann distribution of loss estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training PAC-RoManNet to learn several challenging multi-step robotic manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success rate and action efficiency. The ablation studies show that TPG and LAE are especially beneficial for tasks like multiple block stacking. Additional experiments on Ravens-10 benchmark tasks suggest good generalizability of the proposed PAC-RoManNet.
