Robot grasping and manipulation allow robots to interact with their environments and execute a plethora of complex tasks that require increased dexterity (e.g., open a door, push buttons, collect and transpose objects, etc.). Collecting data of such activities is of paramount importance as it allows roboticists to create new methods and models that will facilitate the execution of sophisticated tasks. In this paper, we propose new wearable, lightweight, low-cost human machine interfaces that improve the efficiency of the data collection process for both robotic grasping and manipulation by offering intuitive and simplified control of the employed robotic grippers and hands. In particular, two different types of interfaces are proposed: i) a handle-based forearm stabilized interface that uses a waist-linkage system to provide weight support for bulky and heavy robotic end-effectors and ii) a palm-mounted interface that can accommodate smaller and lightweight grippers and hands, offering more agility in the control and positioning of these devices. Both interfaces are equipped with appropriate sliders, joysticks, and buttons that facilitate the control of the multiple degrees of freedom of the employed end-effectors and appropriate cameras that allow for object detection, identification, and object pose estimation.
