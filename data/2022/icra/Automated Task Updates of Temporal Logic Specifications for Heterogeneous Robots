Given a heterogeneous group of robots executing a complex task represented in Linear Temporal Logic, and a new set of tasks for the group, we define the task update problem and propose a framework for automatically updating individual robot tasks given their respective existing tasks and capabilities. Our heuristic, token-based, conflict resolution task allocation algorithm generates a near-optimal assignment for the new task. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach through simulations of multi-robot tasks.
