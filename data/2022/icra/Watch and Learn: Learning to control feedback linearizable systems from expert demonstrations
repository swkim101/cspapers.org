In this paper, we revisit the problem of learning a stabilizing controller from a finite number of demonstrations by an expert. By focusing on feedback linearizable systems, we show how to combine expert demonstrations into a stabilizing controller, provided that demonstrations are sufficiently long and there are at least $n+1$ of them, where $n$ is the number of states of the system being controlled. The results are experimentally demonstrated on a CrazyFlie 2.0 quadrotor.
