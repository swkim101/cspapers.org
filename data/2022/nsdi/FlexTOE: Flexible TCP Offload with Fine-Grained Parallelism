FlexTOE is a flexible, yet high-performance TCP offload engine (TOE) to SmartNICs. FlexTOE eliminates almost all host data-path TCP processing and is fully customizable. FlexTOE interoperates well with other TCP stacks, is robust under adverse network conditions, and supports POSIX sockets. FlexTOE focuses on data-path offload of established connections, avoiding complex control logic and packet buffering in the NIC. FlexTOE leverages fine-grained parallelization of the TCP data-path and segment reordering for high performance on wimpy SmartNIC architectures, while remaining flexible via a modular design. We compare FlexTOE on an Agilio-CX40 to host TCP stacks Linux and TAS, and to the Chelsio Terminator TOE. We find that Memcached scales up to 38% better on FlexTOE versus TAS, while saving up to 81% host CPU cycles versus Chelsio. FlexTOE provides competitive performance for RPCs, even with wimpy SmartNICs. FlexTOE cuts 99.99th-percentile RPC RTT by 3.2$\times$ and 50% versus Chelsio and TAS, respectively. FlexTOE's data-path parallelism generalizes across hardware architectures, improving single connection RPC throughput up to 2.4$\times$ on x86 and 4$\times$ on BlueField. FlexTOE supports C and XDP programs written in eBPF. It allows us to implement popular data center transport features, such as TCP tracing, packet filtering and capture, VLAN stripping, flow classification, firewalling, and connection splicing.
