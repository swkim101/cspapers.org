The Domain Name System (DNS) has intricate features that interact in subtle ways. Bugs in DNS implementations can lead to incorrect or implementation-dependent behavior, security vulnerabilities, and more. We introduce the first approach for finding RFC compliance errors in DNS nameserver implementations, via automatic test generation. Our SCALE (Small-scope Constraint-driven Automated Logical Execution) approach jointly generates zone files and corresponding queries to cover RFC behaviors specified by an executable model of DNS resolution. We have built a tool called F ERRET basedon this approachandapplieditto test8 open-source DNS implementations, including popular implementations such as B IND , P OWER D NS , K NOT , and N SD . F ERRET generated over 13.5K test cases, of which 62% resulted in some difference among implementations. We identified and reported 30 new unique bugs from these failed test cases, including at least one bug in every implementation, of which 20 have already been fixed. Many of these bugs existed in even the most popular DNS implementations, including a critical vulnerability in B IND that attackers could easily exploit to crash DNS resolvers and nameservers remotely.
