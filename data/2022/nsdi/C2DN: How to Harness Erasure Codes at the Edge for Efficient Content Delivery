Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) deliver much of the world’s web and video content to users from thousands of clusters deployed at the “edges” of the Internet. Maintain-ing consistent performance in this large distributed system is challenging. Through analysis of month-long logs from over 2000 clusters of a large CDN, we study the patterns of server unavailability. For a CDN with no redundancy, each server unavailability causes a sudden loss in performance as the objects previously cached on that server are not accessible, which leads to a miss ratio spike. The state-of-the-art mitigation technique used by large CDNs is to replicate objects across multiple servers within a cluster. We ﬁnd that although replication reduces miss ratio spikes, spikes remain a performance challenge. We present C2DN, the ﬁrst CDN design that achieves a lower miss ratio, higher availability, higher resource efﬁciency, and close-to-perfect write load balancing. The core of our design is to introduce erasure coding into the CDN architecture and use the parity chunks to re-balance the write load across servers. We implement C2DN on top of open-source production software and demonstrate that compared to replication-based CDNs, C2DN obtains 11% lower byte miss ratio, eliminates unavailability-induced miss ratio spikes, and reduces write load imbalance by 99%.
