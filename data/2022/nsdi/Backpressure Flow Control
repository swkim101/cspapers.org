Incast happens in data center networks (DCNs) when many senders simultaneously send flows to one receiver. Incast occurs frequently and compromises flow performance severely. However, widely deployed end-to-end congestion control (CC) protocols are inefficient at handling incast, as they rely on delayed congestion signals and can not isolate incast flows. Recently, researchers have favored per-hop flow control protocols since they could achieve fast reaction and incast isolation. Nevertheless, these impressive advantages are impractical because of hardware resource limitations.In this paper, we present a new per-hop flow control protocol dBFC (Destination-based Backpressure Flow Control), which achieves these advantages within limited hardware resources. Our key insight is that the number of destinations reached by queued packets in a port is minuscule. dBFC is compatible with existing CC protocols. We use large-scale NS3 simulations to evaluate dBFC. In our evaluation, compared with deployed CC protocols and the state-of-the-art per-hop flow control protocol, dBFC reduces the maximum buffer occupancy by 5 − 23× and thus provides up to 21× lower flow completion time of small flows in limited hardware resources.
