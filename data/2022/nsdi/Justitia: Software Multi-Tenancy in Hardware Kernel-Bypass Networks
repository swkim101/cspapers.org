Kernel-bypass networking (KBN) is becoming the new norm in modern datacenters. While hardware-based KBN ofﬂoads all dataplane tasks to specialized NICs to achieve better latency and CPU efﬁciency than software-based KBN, it also takes away the operator’s control over network sharing policies. Providing policy support in multi-tenant hardware KBN brings unique challenges – namely, preserving ultra-low latency and low CPU cost, ﬁnding a well-deﬁned point of mediation, and rethinking trafﬁc shapers. We present Justitia to address these challenges with three key design as-pects: (i) Split Connection with message-level shaping, (ii) sender-based resource mediation together with receiver-side updates, and (iii) passive latency monitoring. Using a latency target as its knob, Justitia enables multi-tenancy policies such as predictable latencies and fair/weighted resource sharing. Our evaluation shows Justitia can effectively isolate latency-sensitive applications at the cost of slightly decreased utilization and ensure that throughput and bandwidth of the rest are not unfairly penalized.
