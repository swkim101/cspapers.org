There is a growing interest in exploiting ambient light for wireless communication. This new research area has two key advantages: it utilizes a free portion of the spectrum and does not require modiﬁcations of the lighting infrastructure. Most existing designs, however, rely on a single type of optical surface at the transmitter: liquid crystal shutters (LCs). LCs have two inherent limitations, they cut the optical power in half, which affects the range; and they have slow time re-sponses, which affects the data rate. We take a step back to provide a new perspective for ambient light communication with two novel contributions. First, we propose an optical model to understand the fundamental limits and opportunities of ambient light communication. Second, based on the insights of our analystical model, we build a novel platform, dubbed PhotoLink, that exploits a different type of optical surface: digital micro-mirror devices (DMDs). Considering the same scenario in terms of surface area and ambient light conditions, we benchmark the performance of PhotoLink using two types of receivers, one optimized for LCs and the other for DMDs. In both cases, PhotoLink outperforms the data rate of equivalent LC-transmitters by factors of 30 and 80: 30 kbps & 80 kbps vs. 1 kbps, while consuming less than 50 mW. Even when compared to a more sophisticated multi-cell LC platform, which has a surface area that is 500 times bigger than ours, PhotoLink’s data rate is 10-fold: 80 kbps vs. 8 kbps. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst work providing an optical model for ambient light communication and breaking the 10 kbps barrier for these types of links.
