Rewiring of molecular interactions under different conditions causes different phenotypic responses. Differential Network Analysis (also indicated as DNA) aims to investigate the rewiring of gene and protein networks. DNA algorithms combine statistical learning and graph theory to explore the changes in the interaction patterns starting from experimental observation. Despite there exist many methods to model rewiring in networks, we propose to use age and gender factors to guide rewiring algorithms. We present a novel differential network analysis method that consider the differential expression of genes by means of sex and gender attributes. We hypothesise that the expression of genes may be represented by using a non-gaussian process. We quantify changes in nonparametric correlations between gene pairs and changes in expression levels for individual genes. We apply our method to identify the differential networks between males and females in public expression datasets related to mellitus diabetes in liver tissue. Results show that this method can find biologically relevant differential networks.
