In recent years we have seen a handful of work on inference algorithms over non-stationary data streams. Given their flexibility, Bayesian non-parametric models are a good candidate for these scenarios. However, reliable streaming inference under the concept drift phenomenon is still an open problem for these models. In this work, we propose a variational inference algorithm for Dirichlet process mixture models. Our proposal deals with the concept drift by including an exponential forgetting over the prior global parameters. Our algorithm allows to adapt the learned model to the concept drifts automatically. We perform experiments in both synthetic and real data, showing that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art variational methods in density estimation, clustering and parameter tracking.
