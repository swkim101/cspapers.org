It is universally acknowledged that the prediction of the stock movement is a thorny issue of the time-series prediction tasks. Often high-frequency stock behavior in the financial market is a prerequisite for investors to make effective investment strategies. Besides, the existing solution to the traditional stock movement prediction is generally converted into a classification task, which affects the practicability of the model. In this paper, we propose a Kernel-based Hybrid Interpretable Transformer(KHIT) model, which combines with a novel loss function to cope with the prediction task of non-stationary stock markets. Specifically, inspired by the Donchian price channels theory, we propose an adaptive renormalization kernel function that converts the original binary classification task (Rise or Fall) into the time-series prediction. Furthermore, we design a multi-order differential sequence loss function to identify the movement of high-frequency stock in future multi-scale periods. Finally, based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory and Transformer structure, we introduce the tensor decomposition and interpretable attention mechanism for improving the discrimination to the multi-types factors and the interpretability of our model. To be the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to achieve the high-frequency stock movement prediction task rather than classification. Experimental results show our proposed model outperforms several competitive methods in stock movement prediction on two non-stationary datasets.
