Deep learning has brought significant breakthroughs in sequential recommendation (SR) for capturing dynamic user interests. A series of recent research revealed that models with more parameters usually achieve optimal performance for SR tasks, inevitably resulting in great challenges for deploying them in real systems. Following the simple assumption that light networks might already suffice for certain users, in this work, we propose CANet, a conceptually simple yet very scalable framework for assigning adaptive network architecture in an input-dependent manner to reduce unnecessary computation. The core idea of CANet is to route the input user behaviors with a light-weighted router module. Specifically, we first construct the routing space with various submodels parameterized in terms of multiple model dimensions such as the number of layers, hidden size and embedding size. To avoid extra storage overhead of the routing space, we employ a weight-slicing schema to maintain all the submodels in exactly one network. Furthermore, we leverage several solutions to solve the discrete optimization issues caused by the router module. Thanks to them, CANet could adaptively adjust its network architecture for each input in an end-to-end manner, in which the user preference can be effectively captured. To evaluate our work, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that CANet reduces computation by 55 ~ 65% while preserving the accuracy of the original model.
