The doctoral work summarized here is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for social good. The successful implementation would contribute towards low-cost, faster monitoring of road conditions across different nations, resulting in safer roads for everyone. Additionally, the study provides recommendations for re-using the road image data and the Deep Learning models released by any country for detecting road damage in other countries.
