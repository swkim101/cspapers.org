Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms automate the task of finding optimal deep learning architectures given an initial search space of possible operations. Developing these search spaces is usually a manual affair with pre-optimized search spaces being more efficient, rather than searching from scratch. In this paper we present a new framework called Neural Architecture Type System (NeuralArTS) that categorizes the infinite set of network operations in a structured type system. We further demonstrate how NeuralArTS can be applied to convolutional layers and propose several future directions.
