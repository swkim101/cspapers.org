Fashion is the form we express ourselves to the world and has grown into one of the largest industries in the world. Despite the significant evolvement of the fashion industry over the past decades, it is still a great challenge to respond to the diverse preferences of a large number of different consumers in time and accurately. To deal with the problem, we present an innovative demonstration of a trend-driven fashion design system using deep generative modeling, which enables automatic fashion design and editing based on trend reports. Our system consists of three components, including trend-driven fashion design, interactive fashion editing, and popularity estimation. The system offers a unified framework for the mass production of fashion designs that conform to the trend, which helps businesses better respond to market demands.
