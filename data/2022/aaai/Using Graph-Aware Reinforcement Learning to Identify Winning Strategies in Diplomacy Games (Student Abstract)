This abstract proposes an approach towards goal-oriented modeling of the detection and modeling complex social phenomena in multiparty discourse in an online political strategy game.
We developed a two-tier approach that first encodes sociolinguistic behavior as linguistic features then use reinforcement learning to estimate the advantage afforded to any player. 
In the first tier, sociolinguistic behavior, such as Friendship and Reasoning, that speakers use to influence others are encoded as linguistic features to identify the persuasive strategies applied by each player in simultaneous two-party dialogues. In the second tier, a reinforcement learning approach is used to estimate a graph-aware reward function to quantify the advantage afforded to each player based on their standing in this multiparty setup. We apply this technique to the game Diplomacy, using a dataset comprising of over 15,000 messages exchanged between 78 users. Our graph-aware approach shows robust performance compared to a context-agnostic setup.
