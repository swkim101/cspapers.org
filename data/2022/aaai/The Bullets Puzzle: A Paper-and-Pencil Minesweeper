In this paper, we introduce a technique for AI generation of the Bullets puzzle, a paper-and-pencil variant of Minesweeper. Whereas traditional Minesweeper can be lost due to the need to guess mine or non-mine positions, our puzzle is fully deducible from a minimal clue set. Puzzle generation is based on analysis and optimization of solutions from a human-like reasoning engine that classifies types of deductions. Additionally, we provide insights to subjective puzzle quality, minimal clue sampling trade-offs, and optimal bullet density.
