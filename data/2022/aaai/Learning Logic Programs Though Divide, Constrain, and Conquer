We introduce an inductive logic programming approach that combines classical divide-and-conquer search with modern constraint-driven search. Our anytime approach can learn optimal, recursive, and large programs and supports predicate invention. Our experiments on three domains (classification, inductive general game playing, and program synthesis) show that our approach can increase predictive accuracies and reduce learning times.
