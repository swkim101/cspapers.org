Within the field of face recognition (FR), it is widely accepted that the key objective is to optimize the entire feature space in the training process and acquire robust feature representations. However, most real-world FR systems tend to operate at a pre-defined False Accept Rate (FAR), and the corresponding True Accept Rate (TAR) represents the performance of the FR systems, which indicates that the optimization on the pre-defined FAR is more meaningful and important in the practical evaluation process. In this paper, we call the predefined FAR as Anchor FAR, and we argue that the existing FR loss functions cannot guarantee the optimal TAR under the Anchor FAR, which impedes further improvements of FR systems. To this end, we propose AnchorFace to bridge the aforementioned gap between the training and practical evaluation process for FR. Given the Anchor FAR, AnchorFace can boost the performance of FR systems by directly optimizing
the non-differentiable FR evaluation metrics. Specifically, in AnchorFace, we first calculate the similarities of the positive and negative pairs based on both the features of the current batch and the stored features in the maintained online-updating set. Then, we generate the differentiable TAR loss and FAR loss using a soften strategy. Our AnchorFace can be readily integrated into most existing FR loss functions, and extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AnchorFace.
