Provenance is metadata about the origin, history, or derivation of something; in computer science, provenance usually describes some informational artifact, such as a dataset, an executable program, a news article, or a chart or graph in a scientific publication. Notably, provenance is closely related to issues of explanation, accountability, transparency and ethics. Indeed, these and related issues are the subject of extensive investigation in multiple areas of research such as Scientific Workflows, Databases, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. TaPP, the international workshop on Theory and Practice of Provenance, is widely considered to be the premier venue dedicated to provenance. In 2022, it is held for the first time in conjunction with ACM SIGMOD.
