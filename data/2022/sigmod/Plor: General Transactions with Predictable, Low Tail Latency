We present pessimistic locking and optimistic reading (PLOR), a hybrid concurrency control protocol for in-memory transaction systems that delivers high throughput and low tail latency. PLOR is especially designed for high-contention workloads: for high throughput, transactions are allowed to access records without being blocked by lock conflicts in the read phase; for low tail latency, conflict detection is delayed to the commit phase, where old transactions are always committed first using the timestamps in the lock. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach under a variety of setups (e.g., stored-procedures, interactive mode, and persistent logging, etc.). Experiments show that PLOR delivers close or comparable throughput to that of Silo and TicToc in stored-procedures, while reducing 99.9th percentile latency by 8.8x to 14.5x. In the interactive processing mode, PLOR even achieves up to 2x higher throughput.
