Within the rapidly expanding Internet of Things (IoT), growing amounts of spatially referenced data are being generated. Due to the dynamic, decentralized, and heterogeneous nature of the IoT, spatial IoT data (SID) quality has attracted considerable attention in academia and industry. How to invent and use technologies for managing spatial data quality and exploiting low-quality spatial data are key challenges in the IoT. In this tutorial, we highlight the SID consumption requirements in applications and offer an overview of spatial data quality in the IoT setting. In addition, we review pertinent technologies for quality management and low-quality data exploitation, and we identify trends and future directions for quality-aware SID management and utilization. The tutorial aims to not only help researchers and practitioners to better comprehend SID quality challenges and solutions, but also offer insights that may enable innovative research and applications.
