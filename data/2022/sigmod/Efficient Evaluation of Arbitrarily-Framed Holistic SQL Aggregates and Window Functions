Window functions became part of the SQL standard in SQL:2003 and are widely used for data analytics: Percentiles, rankings, moving averages, running sums and local maxima are all expressed as window functions in SQL. Yet, the features offered by SQL's window functions lack composability: Framing is only available for distributive and algebraic aggregate functions, but not for holistic aggregates like percentiles and window functions like ranks. The SQL standard explicitly disallows holistic aggregates from being framed and thereby severely limits data analysts. This paper proposes to remove this restriction, thereby making window functions fully composable. The newly gained composability allows for more complex aggregates which are tricky to evaluate. The lack of subquadratic, parallel algorithms to evaluate framed holistic aggregates is probably the main objection against adding truly composable window functionality to the SQL standard. As such, this paper shows how to efficiently evaluate all window and aggregate functions from SQL:2011, except for DENSE_RANK, in combination with arbitrary window frames. This includes framed distinct aggregates, framed value functions, framed percentiles and framed ranks.
