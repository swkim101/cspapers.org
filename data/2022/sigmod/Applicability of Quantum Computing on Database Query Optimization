We evaluate the applicability of quantum computing on two fundamental query optimization problems, join order optimization and multi query optimization (MQO). We analyze the problem dimensions that can be solved on current gate-based quantum systems and quantum annealers, the two currently commercially available architectures. First, we evaluate the use of gate-based systems on MQO, previously solved with quantum annealing. We show that, contrary to classical computing, a different architecture requires involved adaptations. We moreover propose a multi-step reformulation for join ordering problems to make them solvable on current quantum systems. Finally, we systematically evaluate our contributions for gate-based quantum systems and quantum annealers. Doing so, we identify the scope of current limitations, as well as the future potential of quantum computing technologies for database systems.
