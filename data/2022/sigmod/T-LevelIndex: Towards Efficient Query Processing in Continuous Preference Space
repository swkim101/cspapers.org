Top-k related queries in continuous preference space (e.g., k-shortlist preference query kSPR, uncertain top-k query UTK, output-size specified utility-based query ORU) have numerous applications but are expensive to process. Existing algorithms process each query via specialized optimizations, which are difficult to generalize. In this work, we propose a novel and general index structure T-LevelIndex, which can be used to process various queries in continuous preference space efficiently. We devise efficient approaches to build the T-LevelIndex by fully exploiting the properties of continuous preference space. We conduct extensive experimental studies on both real- and synthetic- benchmarks. The results show that (i) our proposed index building approaches have low costs in terms of both space and time, and (ii) T-LevelIndex significantly outperforms specialized solutions for processing a spectrum of queries in continuous preference space, and the speedup can be two to three orders of magnitude.
