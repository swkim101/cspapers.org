1 PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION We study the problem of parallelizing link-cut trees. Link-cut trees are used to solve the dynamic tree problem [7]. The problem is that of maintaining a forest, i.e., a collection of vertex-disjoint rooted trees, which is subject to edge insertions (links) and deletions (cuts). This problem serves as a foundation in important areas, such as network flow algorithms [7], static and dynamic graph algorithms [4], and computational geometry [2]. The supported operations are:
