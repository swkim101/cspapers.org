Interest in data systems education is increasing, especially with the rise in demand for well trained and re-trained data scientists. The database and the computing education research communities have complementary perspectives and experiences to share with each other. The DataEd workshop is organized as a dedicated venue for these communities to come together to share findings, to cross-pollinate perspectives and methods, and to shed light on opportunities for mutual progress in data systems education. In the DataEd workshop, we will present and discuss data management systems education experiences and research via keynotes, an industry panel discussion, and paper and poster presentations.
