HILDA brings together researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and results on human-data interaction. It explores how data management and analysis can be made more effective when taking into account the people who design and build these processes as well as those who are impacted by their results. We are trying to change things up a bit for HILDA 2022. There are now several good venues for the kind of work that HILDA has traditionally attracted. We plan to focus this year's workshop on early-stage research that is promising and exciting. A core part of this plan is that every paper gets a mentor. In this summary, we describe the workshop, its main areas of focus and our review and mentorship plan.
