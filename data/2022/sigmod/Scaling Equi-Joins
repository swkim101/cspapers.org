This paper proposes Adaptive-Multistage-Join (AM-Join) for scalable and fast equi-joins in distributed shared-nothing architectures. AM-Join utilizes (a) Tree-Join, a novel algorithm that scales well when the joined tables share hot keys, and (b) Broadcast-Join, the fastest-known when joining keys that are hot in only one table. Unlike the state-of-the-art algorithms, AM-Join (a) holistically solves the join-key skew problem by achieving load balancing throughout the join execution, and (b) supports all outer-join variants without record deduplication or custom table partitioning. For the best AM-Join outer-join performance, we propose Index-Broadcast-Join (IB-Join) for Small-Large outer-joins, where one table fits in memory and the other is orders of magnitude larger. IB-Join improves on the state-of-the-art outer-join algorithms. The proposed algorithms can be adopted in any shared-nothing architecture. We implemented a MapReduce version using Spark. Our evaluation shows the proposed algorithms execute significantly faster and scale to more skewed and orders-of-magnitude bigger tables when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.
