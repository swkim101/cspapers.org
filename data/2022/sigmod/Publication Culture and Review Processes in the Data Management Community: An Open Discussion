The Data Management community has explored many options in recent years to improve our publication culture and review processes, ranging from innovative journal-conference hybrids that decouple publication from presentation, incorporating journal-style reviewing for conference-style papers, requesting code reproducibility and code/data availability, multiple submission deadlines in a year, new categories of papers, informal shepherding processes, guidelines for diversity and inclusion, automated COI check, and so on. This panel seeks to examine our many experiments, comparing them with other CS disciplines, and help determine (i) have our experiments worked? (ii) what has their impact been? and (iii) can we do better?
