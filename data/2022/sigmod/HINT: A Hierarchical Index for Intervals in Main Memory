Indexing intervals is a fundamental problem, finding a wide range of applications, most notably in temporal and uncertain databases. In this paper, we propose HINT, a novel and efficient in-memory index for intervals, with a focus on interval overlap queries, which are a basic component of many search and analysis tasks. HINT applies a hierarchical partitioning approach, which assigns each interval to at most two partitions per level and has controlled space requirements. We reduce the information stored at each partition to the absolutely necessary by dividing the intervals in it based on whether they begin inside or before the partition boundaries. In addition, our index includes storage optimization techniques for the effective handling of data sparsity and skewness. Experimental results on real and synthetic interval sets of different characteristics show that HINT is typically one order of magnitude faster than existing interval indexing methods.
