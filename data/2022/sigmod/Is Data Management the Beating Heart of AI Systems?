The era of artificially intelligent systems is here, and the breadth and speed of the change has been breathtaking. Less than a decade ago, Google did not use AI or machine learning in its products. Today, we interact with a wide range of AI-powered systems when we search the web, write an email, watch a video, or make a purchase. AI has spread beyond the web as well, we use it every time we touch phones, open our laptops, turn on our television, enter (or request) a car, and many more interactions. What's perhaps more remarkable than the ubiquity of these systems is how they operate: they optimize a small number of machine learning architectures on increasingly vast and diverse quantities of data. As a result, data management is at the heart of this new breed of systems. This talk explores the idea that the next phase of AI systems might have historic parallels with the growth of relational data management. In this talk, I survey some of the exciting recent developments that have affected my own work in industry and research building systems to support AI applications. My main message is that it is an incredibly exciting time for researchers and industrial practitioners from the data management community to bring their expertise to the next generation of AI systems.
