Voice assistants rely on keyword spotting (KWS) to process vocal commands issued by humans: commands are prepended with a keyword, such as "Alexa" or "Ok Google," which must be spotted to activate the voice assistant. Typically, keyword spotting is two-fold: an on-device model first identifies the keyword, then the resulting voice sample triggers a second on-cloud model which verifies and processes the activation. In this work, we explore the significant privacy and security concerns that this raises under two threat models. First, our experiments demonstrate that accidental activations result in up to a minute of speech recording being uploaded to the cloud. Second, we verify that adversaries can systematically trigger misactivations through adversarial examples, which exposes the integrity and availability of services connected to the voice assistant. We propose EKOS (Ensemble for KeywOrd Spotting) which leverages the semantics of the KWS task to defend against both accidental and adversarial activations.  EKOS incorporates spatial redundancy from the acoustic environment at training and inference time to minimize distribution drifts responsible for accidental activations. It also exploits a physical property of speech---its redundancy at different harmonics---to deploy an ensemble of models trained on different harmonics and provably force the adversary to modify more of the frequency spectrum to obtain adversarial examples. Our evaluation shows that EKOS increases the cost of adversarial activations, while preserving the natural accuracy. We validate the performance of EKOS with over-the-air experiments on commodity devices and commercial voice assistants; we find that EKOS improves the precision of the KWS task in non-adversarial settings.
