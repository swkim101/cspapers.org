Smart home devices, such as security cameras, are equipped with visual sensors, either for monitoring or improving user experience. Due to the sensitivity of the home environment, their visual sensing capabilities cause privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we design and implement the CamShield, a companion device to guarantee the privacy of smart security cameras, even if the whole camera system is fully compromised. At a high level, the CamShield is a shielding case that works by attaching it to the front of the security camera to blind it. Then, it uses its own camera for visual recording. The videos are first protected according to user-specified policies, and then transmitted to the security camera and hence to the Internet through a Visible Light Communication (VLC) channel. It ensures that only the authorized entities have full access to the protected videos. Since the CamShield is physically isolated from the shielded security camera and the Internet, it naturally resists many known attacks and can operate as it is expected to.
