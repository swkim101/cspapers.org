When a human activity requires a lot of expertise and very specialized
cognitive skills that are poorly understood by the general population, it
is often considered `an art.' Different activities in the security domain
have fallen in this category, such as exploitation, hacking, and the main
focus of this paper: binary reverse engineering (RE).
However, while experts in many areas (ranging from chess players to
computer programmers) have been studied by scientists to understand their
mental models and capture what is special about their behavior, the `art'
of understanding binary code and solving reverse engineering puzzles
remains to date a black box.
In this paper, we present a measurement of the different strategies adopted by
expert and beginner reverse engineers while approaching the analysis of x86
(dis)assembly code, a typical static RE task. We do that by performing an
exploratory analysis of data collected over 16,325 minutes of RE activity
of two unknown binaries from 72 participants with different experience
levels: 39 novices and 33 experts.
