The mainstream adoption of blockchains led to the preparation of many decentralized applications and web platforms, including Web 3.0, a peer-to-peer internet with no single authority. The data stored in blockchain can be considered as big data -- massive-volume, dynamic, and heterogeneous. Due to highly connected structure, graph-based modeling is an optimal tool to analyze the data stored in blockchains. Recently, several research works performed graph analysis on the publicly available blockchain data to reveal insights into its business transactions and for critical downstream tasks, e.g., cryptocurrency price prediction, phishing scams and counterfeit token detection. In this tutorial, we discuss relevant literature on blockchain data structures, storage, categories, data extraction and graphs construction, graph mining, topological data analysis, and machine learning methods used, target applications, and the new insights revealed by them, aiming towards providing a clear view of unified graph-data models for UTXO and account-based blockchains. We also emphasize future research directions.
