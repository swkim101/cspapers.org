Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item for the current session, which consists of several clicked items in a short period by an anonymous user. Most of the sequential modeling approaches to SBR are focusing on adopting advanced Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and these methods require increasingly longer training times. Existing studies have shown that some traditional SBR methods can outperform some DNN-based sequential models, however, few studies have attempted to investigate the effectiveness of traditional methods in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel and concise SBR model inspired by the basic concept of autocorrelation in the Stochastic Process. Autocorrelation measures the correlation of a process at different moments. Therefore, it is natural to use it to model the correlation of clicked item sequences at different time shifts. Specifically, we use Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) to compute the autocorrelation and combine it with several linear transformations to enhance the session representation. By this means, our proposed method can learn better session preferences and is more efficient than most DNN-based models. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both effectiveness and efficiency.
