Graph pooling plays a vital role in learning graph embeddings. Due to the lack of label information, unsupervised graph pooling has received much attention, primarily via mutual information (MI). However, most existing MI-based pooling methods only preserve node features while overlooking the hierarchical substructural information. In this paper, we propose SMIP, a novel unsupervised hierarchical graph pooling method based on substructure-sensitive MI maximization. SMIP reconstructs a hard-style substructure encoder based on cluster-based pooling paradigm, and trains it with two substructure-sensitive MI-based objectives, i.e., node-substructure MI and node-node MI. The node-substructure MI guides to transfer maximum node feature information into corresponded substructures and the node-node MI guarantees a more accurate node allocation. Moreover, to avoid extra computation of augmented graphs and prevent noise information during MI estimation, we propose a local-scope contrastive MI estimation method, making SMIP more potent in capturing intrinsic features of the input graph. Experiments on six benchmark graph classification datasets demonstrate that our hierarchical deep learning approach outperforms all state-of-the-art unsupervised GNN-based methods and even surpasses the performance of nine supervised ones. Generalization study shows that the proposed substructure-sensitive MI objective can be successfully embedded into other cluster-based pooling methods to improve their performance.
