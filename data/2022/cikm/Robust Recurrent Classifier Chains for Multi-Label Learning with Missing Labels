Recurrent Classifier Chains (RCCs) are a leading approach for multi-label classification as they directly model the interdependencies between classes. Unfortunately, existing RCCs assume that every training instance is completely labeled with all its ground truth classes. In practice often only a subset of an instance's labels are annotated, while the annotations for other classes aremissing. RCCs fail in this missing label scenario, predicting many false negatives and potentially missing important classes. In this work, we propose Robust-RCC, the first strategy for tackling this open problem of RCCs failing formulti-label missing-label data. Robust-RCC is a new type of deep recurrent classifier chain empowered to model inter-class relationships essential for predicting thecomplete label set most likely to match the ground truth. The key to Robust-RCC is the design of the Multi Incomplete Label Risk (MILR) function, which we prove to be equal in expectation to the true risk of the ground truth full label set despite being computed from incompletely labeled data. Our experimental study demonstrates that Robust-RCC consistently beats six state-of-of-the-art methods by as much as 30% in predicting the true labels.
