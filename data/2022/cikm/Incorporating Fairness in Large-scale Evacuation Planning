Evacuation planning is an essential part of disaster management where the goal is to relocate people in a safe and orderly manner. Existing research has shown that such problems are hard to approximate and current methods are difficult to scale to real-life applications. We introduce a notion of fairness and two related objectives while studying evacuation planning, namely: minimizing maximum inconvenience and minimizing average inconvenience. We show that both problems are not just NP-hard to solve exactly, but in fact are NP-hard to approximate. On the positive side, we present a heuristic optimization method MIP-LNS, based on the well-known Large Neighborhood Search framework, that can find good approximate solutions in reasonable amount of time. We also consider a multi-objective problem where the goal is to minimize both objectives and solve it using MIP-LNS. We use real-world road network and population data from Harris County in Houston, Texas (a region that needed large-scale evacuations in the past), and apply MIP-LNS to calculate evacuation plans for the area. We compare the quality of the plans in terms of evacuation efficiency and fairness. We find that the solutions to the multi-objective problem are superior in both of these aspects. We also perform statistical tests to show that the solutions are significantly different.
