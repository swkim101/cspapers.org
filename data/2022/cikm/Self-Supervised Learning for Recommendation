Recommender systems are playing an increasingly critical role to alleviate information overload and satisfy users' information seeking requirements in a wide spectrum of online platforms. However, the ubiquity of data sparsity and noise notably limits the representation capacity of existing recommender systems to learn high-quality user (item) embeddings. Inspired by recent advances of self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques, SSL-based representation learning models benefit a variety of recommendation domains. Such methods have achieved new levels of performance while reducing the dependence on observed supervision labels in diverse recommendation tasks. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a systemic review of state-of-the-art SSL-based recommender systems. To be specific, we summarize and categorize existing work of SSL-based recommender systems in terms of recommendation scenarios. For each type of recommendation task, the corresponding challenges and methods will be presented in a comprehensive way. Finally, some future directions and open questions will be raised to inspire more investigation on this important research line.
