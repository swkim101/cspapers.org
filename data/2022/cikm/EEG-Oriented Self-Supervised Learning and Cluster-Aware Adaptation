Recently, deep learning-based electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis and decoding have gained widespread attention to monitor a user's clinical condition or identify his/her intention/emotion. Nevertheless, the existing methods mostly model EEG signals with limited viewpoints or restricted concerns about the characteristics of the EEG signals, thus suffering from representing complex spatio-spectro-temporal patterns as well as inter-subject variability. In this work, we propose novel EEG-oriented self-supervised learning methods to discover complex and diverse patterns of spatio-spectral characteristics and spatio-temporal dynamics. Combined with the proposed self-supervised representation learning, we also devise a feature normalization strategy to resolve an inter-subject variability problem via clustering. We demonstrated the validity of the proposed framework on three publicly available datasets by comparing with state-of-the-art methods.
