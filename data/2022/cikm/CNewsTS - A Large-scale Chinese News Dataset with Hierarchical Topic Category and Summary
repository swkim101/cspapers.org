In this paper, we present a large Chinese news article dataset with 4.4 million articles. These articles are obtained from different news channels and sources. They are labeled with multi-level topic categories, and some of them also have summaries. This is the first Chinese news dataset that has both hierarchical topic labels and article full texts. And it is also the largest Chinese news topic dataset. We describe the data collection, annotation and quality evaluation process. The basic statistics of the dataset, comparison with other datasets and benchmark experiments are also presented.
