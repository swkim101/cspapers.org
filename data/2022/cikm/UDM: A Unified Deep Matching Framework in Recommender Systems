Due to the large-scale users and items, industrial recommender systems usually consist of two stages, the matching stage and the ranking stage. The matching stage is responsible for retrieving a small fraction of relevant items from the large-scale item pool which are further selected by the ranking stage. Most of the existing deep learning-based matching models focus on the problem of modeling user interest representation by using inner product between user representation and item representation to obtain the user-to-item relevance. However, the item-to-item relevance between user interacted item and target item is not considered in the deep matching models which is computationally prohibitive for large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose a unified deep matching framework called UDM for the matching stage to mitigate this issue. UDM can model the user-to-item relevance and item-to-item relevance simultaneously with the help of an interest extraction module and interest interaction module, respectively. Specifically, the interest extraction module is used as the main network to extract users' multiple interests with multiple vectors based on users' behavior sequences, while the interest interaction module is used as an auxiliary network to supervise the learning of the interest extraction module, which can model the interaction between user interacted items and target item. In the experiments conducted on two public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset, UDM achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art models. Moreover, UDM has been deployed in the operational system of Alibaba. Online A/B testing results further reveal the effectiveness of UDM. To the best of our knowledge, UDM is the first deep matching framework which combines the user-to-item relevance modeling and item-to-item relevance modeling in the same model.
