With the tremendous success of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), they have been widely applied to recommender systems and have shown promising performance. However, most GCN-based methods rigorously stick to a common GCN learning paradigm and suffer from two limitations: (1) the limited scalability due to the high computational cost and slow training convergence; (2) the notorious over-smoothing issue which reduces performance as stacking graph convolution layers. We argue that the above limitations are due to the lack of a deep understanding of GCN-based methods. To this end, we first investigate what design makes GCN effective for recommendation. By simplifying LightGCN, we show the close connection between GCN-based and low-rank methods such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Matrix Factorization (MF), where stacking graph convolution layers is to learn a low-rank representation by emphasizing (suppressing) components with larger (smaller) singular values. Based on this observation, we replace the core design of GCN-based methods with a flexible truncated SVD and propose a simplified GCN learning paradigm dubbed SVD-GCN, which only exploits K-largest singular vectors for recommendation. To alleviate the over-smoothing issue, we propose a renormalization trick to adjust the singular value gap, resulting in significant improvement. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed SVD-GCN not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts but also achieves over 100x and 10x speedups over LightGCN and MF, respectively.
