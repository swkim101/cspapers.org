Microblogging platforms such as Twitter, receive massive messages during crisis events. Real-time insights are crucial for emergency response. Hence, there is a need to develop faithful tools for efficiently digesting information. In this paper, we present CrisICSum, a platform for classification and summarization of crisis events. The objective of CrisICSum is to classify user posts during disaster events into different humanitarian classes (i.e., damage, affected people, etc.) and generate summaries of class-level messages. Unlike existing systems, CrisICSum employs an interpretable by design backend classifier. It can generate explanations for output decisions. Besides, the platform allows user feedback on both classification and summarization phases. CrisICSum is designed and run as an easily integrated web application. Backend models are interchangeable. The system can assist users and human organizations in improving response efforts during disaster situations. CrisICSum is available at https://crisicsum.l3s.uni-hannover.de
