Contextual information in search sessions is important for capturing users' search intents. Various approaches have been proposed to model user behavior sequences to improve document ranking in a session. Typically, training samples of (search context, document) pairs are sampled randomly in each training epoch. In reality, the difficulty to understand user's search intent and to judge document's relevance varies greatly from one search context to another. Mixing up training samples of different difficulties may confuse the model's optimization process. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning framework for context-aware document ranking, in which the ranking model learns matching signals between the search context and the candidate document in an easy-to-hard manner. In so doing, we aim to guide the model gradually toward a global optimum. To leverage both positive and negative examples, two curricula are designed. Experiments on two real query log datasets show that our proposed framework can improve the performance of several existing methods significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of curriculum learning for context-aware document ranking.
