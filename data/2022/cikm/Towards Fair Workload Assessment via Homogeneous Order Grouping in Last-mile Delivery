The popularity of e-commerce has promoted the rapid development of the logistics industry in recent years. As an important step in logistics, last-mile delivery from delivery stations to customers' addresses is now mainly finished by couriers, which requires accurate workload assessment based on actual efforts. However, the state-of-the-practice assessment methods neglect a vital factor that orders with the same customer's address (i.e., Homogeneous orders) can be delivered in a group (i.e., in a single trip) or separately (i.e., in multiple trips). It would cause unfair assessment among couriers if following the same rule. Thus, grouping homogeneous order accurately in the workload assessment is significant for achieving fair courier's workload assessment. To this end, we design, implement, and deploy a nationwide homogeneous order grouping system called FHOG for improving the accuracy of homogeneous order grouping in last-mile delivery for fair courier's workload assessment. FHOG utilizes the courier's reporting behavior for order inspection, collection, and delivery to identify homogeneous orders in the delivery station simultaneously for homogeneous order grouping. Compared with the state-of-the-practice method, our evaluation shows FHOG can effectively reduce order amounts with the higher and lower assessed courier's workload. We further deploy FHOG online in 8336 delivery stations to provide homogeneous order grouping service for more than 120 thousand couriers and 12 million daily orders. The results of the two surveys show that the couriers' acceptance rate is improved by 67% with FHOG after the promotion.
