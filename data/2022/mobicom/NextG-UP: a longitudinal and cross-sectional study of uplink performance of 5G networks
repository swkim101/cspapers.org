5G networks are being deployed rapidly across the world and have opened door to many uplink-oriented, bandwidth- intensive applications such as Augmented Reality and Con- nected Autonomous Vehicles. However, the roll-out is still in the early phase and the nature of deployment also varies across different geographic regions of theworld. In this demo, we present NextG-UP, an Android-based tool designed to help understand the performance and evolution of 5G net- works around the world. The crowd-sourcing mobile app collects various cellular network metrics and runs a short uplink throughput/latency test.
