We present a demonstration of an enhanced Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth system named HiToF, which can expose high-resolution textures from captured depth maps. By design, a ToF camera can easily capture the depth maps of a scene while largely omitting the corresponding texture information, which is often critical for the performance of many depth applications. HiToF is developed to address this issue by generating enhanced depth maps with high-resolution textures. The key idea is to manipulate the phase components used in the measurement of time-of-flight for the received IR light. In this demo, we showcase our implementation using off-the-shelf ToF cameras and engage audience with an interactive experience in various scenarios, which illustrates the system's effectiveness in improving the performance of ToF cameras in depth applications.
