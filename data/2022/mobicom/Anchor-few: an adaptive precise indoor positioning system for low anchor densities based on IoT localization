This paper designs and implements an adaptive precise indoor positioning system, called Anchor-Few, for low anchor densities through Internet of Things (IoT) localization. Anchor Few exploits the IoT localization device, iBeacon, to provide accurate indoor positioning using only one or two anchors as three anchors are unavailable for triangulation. To the best of our knowledge, Anchor-Few is the first system that can provide the following features. First, the localization environments can be automatically classified based on the number of different iBeacon signals received by mobile devices, current moving direction, and historical location information. Second, it can use the distances from iBeacon nodes and previous user locations to detect whether the user is moving or not and determine the current moving direction. Third, in the environment covered by only one iBeacon node, a more accurate position than that using existing methods can be derived through the iBeacon position, distance from the iBeacon, and current moving direction. Finally, for environments covered by two iBeacon nodes, multiple iBeacon information and the user's historical locations can be cooperatively used for accurate position estimation. An Android-based prototype with deployed iBeacon nodes is implemented to verify the feasibility and correctness of our Anchor-Few system, which can achieve high localization accuracy while keeping anchor densities low.
