Network traffic data facilitates understanding the Internet of Things (IoT) behaviors and improving IoT service quality in the real world. However, large-scale IoT traffic data is rarely accessible, and privacy issues also impede realistic data sharing even with anonymous personal identifiable information. Researchers propose to generate synthetic IoT traffic but fail to cover the multiple services provided by widespread real-world IoT devices. In this work, we take the first step to generate large-scale IoT traffic via a knowledge-enhanced generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which introduces both the semantic knowledge (e.g., location and environment information) and the network structure knowledge for various IoT devices via a knowledge graph. We use a condition mechanism to incorporate the knowledge and device category for IoT traffic generation. Then, we adopt LSTM and a self-attention mechanism to capture the temporal correlation in the traffic series. Extensive experiment results show that the synthetic IoT traffic datasets generated by our proposed model outperform state-of-art baselines in terms of data fidelity and applications. Moreover, our proposed model is able to generate realistic data by only training on small real datasets with knowledge enhanced.
