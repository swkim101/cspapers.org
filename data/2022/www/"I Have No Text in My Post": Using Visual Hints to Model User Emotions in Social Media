As an emotion plays an important role in people’s everyday lives and is often mirrored in their social media use, extensive research has been conducted to characterize and model emotions from social media data. However, prior research has not sufficiently considered trends of social media use—the increasing use of images and the decreasing use of text—nor identified the features of images in social media that are likely to be different from those in non-social media. Our study aims to fill this gap by (1) considering the notion of visual hints that depict contextual information of images, (2) presenting their characteristics in positive or negative emotions, and (3) demonstrating their effectiveness in emotion prediction modeling through an in-depth analysis of their relationship with the text in the same posts. The results of our experiments showed that our visual hint-based model achieved 20% improvement in emotion prediction, compared with the baseline. In particular, the performance of our model was comparable with that of the text-based model, highlighting not only a strong relationship between visual hints of the image and emotion, but also the potential of using only images for emotion prediction which well reflects current and future trends of social media use.
