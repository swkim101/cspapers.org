Myriads of web applications in the Big Data era demand an effective measure of similarity based on billion-scale network structures, e.g., collaborative filtering. Recently, CoSimRank has been devised as a promising graph-theoretic similarity model, which iteratively captures the notion that “two distinct nodes are evaluated as similar if they are connected with similar nodes”. However, the existing CoSimRank model for assessing similarities may either yield unsatisfactory results or rather cost-inhibitive, rendering it impractical in massive graphs. In this paper, we propose CoSimHeat, a novel scalable graph-theoretic similarity model based on heat diffusion. Specifically, we first formulate CoSimHeat model by taking advantage of heat diffusion to emulate the activities of similarity propagations on the Web. Then, we show that the similarities produced by CoSimHeat are more satisfactory than those from CoSimRank families since CoSimHeat fulfils four axioms that an ideal similarity model should satisfy while circumventing the “dead-loop” problem of CoSimRank. Next, we propose a fast algorithm to substantially accelerate CoSimHeat computations on billion-sized graphs, with guarantees of accuracy. Our experiments on various datasets validate that CoSimHeat achieves higher accuracy and is order-of-magnitude faster than state-of-the-art competitors.
