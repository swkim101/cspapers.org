Recommender system is playing an increasingly important role in online news platforms nowadays. Recently, there is a growing demand for applying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to news recommendation aiming to maximize long-term and/or non-differentiable objectives. However, without an interactive simulated environment, it is extremely costly to develop powerful RL agents for news recommendation. In this paper, we build a user simulator, namely MINDSim, for news recommendation. Targeting at new user generation and corresponding behavior simulation, we first construct a hidden space for users using a generative adversarial network, so that new users can be generated by sampling from this hidden space. To capture complex and fast user interest drifts over time, we adopt an encoder-decoder architecture, which takes the clicked news during the simulation as input and outputs the new user interests for the next period of time. Finally, we build the MINDSim simulator using MIcrosoft News Dataset (MIND), and extensive experimental results on this large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that MINDSim can simulate the behaviors of real users with high quality.
