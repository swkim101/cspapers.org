There is an inherent lack of knowledge and technology to test a quantum program properly. In this paper, building on the definition of syntactically equivalent quantum gates, we describe our efforts in developing a tool, coined QMutPy, leveraging the well-known open-source mutation tool MutPy. We further discuss the design and implementation of QMutPy, and the usage of a novel set of mutation operators that generate mutants for qubit measurements and gates. To evaluate QMutPy’s performance, we conducted a preliminary study on 11 real quantum programs written in the IBM’s Qiskit library. QMutPy has proven to be an effective quantum mutation tool, providing insight into the current state of quantum tests. QMutPy is publicly available at https://github.com/danielfobooss/mutpy.
