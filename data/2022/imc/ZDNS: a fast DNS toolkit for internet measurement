Active DNS measurement is fundamental to understanding and improving the DNS ecosystem. However, the absence of an extensible, high-performance, and easy-to-use DNS toolkit has limited both the reproducibility and coverage of DNS research. In this paper, we introduce ZDNS, a modular and open-source active DNS measurement framework optimized for large-scale research studies of DNS on the public Internet. We describe ZDNS's architecture, evaluate its performance, and present two case studies that highlight how the tool can be used to shed light on the operational complexities of DNS. We hope that ZDNS will enable researchers to better---and in a more reproducible manner---understand Internet behavior.
