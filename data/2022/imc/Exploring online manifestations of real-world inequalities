Socioeconomic gaps, particularly income inequality, affect crime and public opinion. Although official data sources can identify these patterns of income-based social disparity, a fundamental question remains: Can similar social inequalities be found using abundant online user activity? We explore two sub-questions. (i) How does a neighbourhood's income affect crime discussion in a geographical neighbourhood? (ii) Can user-generated data predict a neighbourhood's income? To answer these questions, we collect 2.5 million Nextdoor posts from 67608 USA and UK neighbourhoods between November 2020 and September 2021. We use official USA and UK data sources for crime and income information.
