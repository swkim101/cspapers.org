The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the emergence of networked applications as essential platforms for critical services, including those in education, healthcare, and government. In this context, there is renewed interest in understanding the availability of reliable, high-quality Internet connections in local community institutions, particularly those serving groups that have been historically marginalized. While previous work has focused on residential [4, 7] connections---and shown they are often underprovisioned for historically marginalized populations [6]---little is known about the reliability of networks serving schools, hospitals, and other non-residential infrastructure. An essential group of such networks serve anchor institutions: "place-based, mission-driven entities such as hospitals, universities, and government agencies that leverage their economic power alongside their human and intellectual resources to improve the long-term health and social welfare of their communities." [3] Access to digital information at such institutions (anchor institutional networks, or AIN) is an essential requirement for citizens to effectively participate in education, and access services in healthcare, community and government.
