We conduct the first systematic study of the effectiveness of Web Audio API-based browser fingerprinting mechanisms and present new insights. First, we show that audio fingerprinting vectors, unlike other prior vectors, reveal an apparent fickleness with some users' browsers giving away differing fingerprints in repeated attempts. However, we show that it is possible to devise a graph-based analysis mechanism to collectively consider all the different fingerprints left by users' browsers and thus craft a highly stable fingerprinting mechanism. Next, we investigate the diversity of audio fingerprints and compare this with prior fingerprinting techniques. Our results show that audio fingerprints are much less diverse than other vectors with only 95 distinct fingerprints among 2093 users. At the same time, further analysis shows that web audio fingerprinting can potentially bring considerable additive value to existing fingerprinting mechanisms. For instance, our results show that the addition of web audio fingerprinting causes a 9.6% increase in entropy when compared to using Canvas fingerprinting alone. We also show that our results contradict the current security and privacy recommendations provided by W3C regarding audio fingerprinting.
