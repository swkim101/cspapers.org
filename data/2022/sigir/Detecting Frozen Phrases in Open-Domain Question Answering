There is essential information in the underlying structure of words and phrases in natural language questions, and this structure has been extensively studied. In this paper, we study one particular structure, referred to as frozen phrases, that is highly expected to transfer as a whole from questions to answer passages. Frozen phrases, if detected, can be helpful in open-domain Question Answering (QA) where identifying the localized context of a given input question is crucial. An interesting question is if frozen phrases can be accurately detected. We cast the problem as a sequence-labeling task and create synthetic data from existing QA datasets to train a model. We further plug this model into a sparse retriever that is made aware of the detected phrases. Our experiments reveal that detecting frozen phrases whose presence in answer documents are highly plausible yields significant improvements in retrievals as well as in the end-to-end accuracy of open-domain QA models.
