Real-world web applications such as Amazon and Netflix often provide services in multiple countries and regions (i.e., markets) around the world. Generally, different markets share similar item sets while containing different amounts of interaction data. Some markets are data-scarce and others are data-rich and leveraging those data from similar and data-rich auxiliary markets could enhance the data-scarce markets. In this paper, we explore multi-market recommendation (MMR), and propose a novel model called M$^3$Rec to improve all markets recommendation simultaneously. Since items play the role to bridge different markets, we argue that mining the similarities among items is the key point of MMR. Our M^3Rec preprocess two global item similarities: intra- and inter- market similarities. Specifically, we first learn the second-order intra-market similarity by adopting linear models with closed-form solutions, and then capture the high-order inter-market similarity by the random walk. Afterward, we incorporate the global item similarities for each local market. We conduct extensive experiments on five public available markets and compare with several state-of-the-art methods. Detailed experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
