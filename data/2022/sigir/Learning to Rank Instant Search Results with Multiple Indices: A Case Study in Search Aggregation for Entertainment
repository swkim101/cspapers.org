At Xfinity, an instant search system provides a variety of results for a given query from different sources. For each keystroke, new results are rendered on screen to the user, which could contain movies, television series, sporting events, music videos, news clips, person pages, and other result types. Users are also able to use the Xfinity Voice Remote to submit longer queries, some of which are more open-ended. Examples of queries include incomplete words which match multiple results through lexical matching (i.e., "ali"), topical searches ("vampire movies"), and more specific longer searches ("Movies with Adam Sandler"). Since results can be based on lexical matches, semantic matches, item-to-item similarity matches, or a variety of business logic driven sources, a key challenge is how to combine results into a single list. To accomplish this, we propose merging the lists via a Learning to Rank (LTR) neural model which takes into account the search query. This combined list can be personalized via a second LTR neural model with knowledge of the user's search history and metadata of the programs. Because instant search is under-represented in the literature, we present our learnings from research to aid other practitioners.
