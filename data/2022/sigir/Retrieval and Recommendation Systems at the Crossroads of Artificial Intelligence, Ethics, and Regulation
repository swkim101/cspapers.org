This tutorial aims at providing its audience an interdisciplinary overview about the topics of fairness and non-discrimination, diversity, and transparency of AI systems, tailored to the research fields of information retrieval and recommender systems. By means of this tutorial, we would like to equip the mostly technical audience of SIGIR with the necessary understanding of the ethical implications of their research and development on the one hand, and of recent political and legal regulations that address the aforementioned challenges on the other hand.
