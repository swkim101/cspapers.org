In the last few years, open-domain question answering (ODQA) has advanced rapidly due to the development of deep learning techniques and the availability of large-scale QA datasets. However, the current datasets are essentially designed for synchronic document collections (e.g., Wikipedia). Temporal news collections such as long-term news archives spanning decades are rarely used in training the models despite they are quite valuable for our society. To foster the research in the field of ODQA on such historical collections, we present ArchivalQA, a large question answering dataset consisting of 532,444 question-answer pairs which is designed for temporal news QA. We divide our dataset into four subparts based on the question difficulty levels and the containment of temporal expressions, which we believe are useful for training and testing ODQA systems characterized by different strengths and abilities. The novel QA dataset-constructing framework that we introduce can be also applied to generate high-quality, non-ambiguous questions over other types of temporal document collections.
