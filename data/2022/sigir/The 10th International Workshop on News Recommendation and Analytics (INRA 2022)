A rapidly changing news ecosystem presents new challenges to research, media organizations, consumers, and societies. The 10th edition of the International Workshop on News Recommendation and Analytics (INRA) serves to exchange ideas and discuss recent trends, technological advancements, and open problems concerning news. We welcome contributions in scientific articles, demonstrations, and ideas. We strive to bring together researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers to address crucial challenges. The workshop provides an opportunity to learn about recent research and interactively discuss technical and interdisciplinary aspects related to news. Topics of interest include information access systems for news, advances in natural language processing, multi-modality, mis- and disinformation, trust and user experiences, and personalization.
