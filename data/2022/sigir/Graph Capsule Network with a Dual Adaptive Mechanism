While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been extended to various fields of artificial intelligence with their powerful representation capabilities, recent studies have revealed that their ability to capture the part-whole structure of the graph is limited. Furthermore, though many GCNs variants have been proposed and obtained state-of-the-art results, they face the situation that much early information may be lost during the graph convolution step. To this end, we innovatively present an Graph Capsule Network with a Dual Adaptive Mechanism (DA-GCN) to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, this powerful mechanism is a dual-adaptive mechanism to capture the part-whole structure of the graph. One is an adaptive node interaction module to explore the potential relationship between interactive nodes. The other is an adaptive attention-based graph dynamic routing to select appropriate graph capsules, so that only favorable graph capsules are gathered and redundant graph capsules are restrained for better capturing the whole structure between graphs. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm has achieved the most advanced or competitive results on all datasets.
