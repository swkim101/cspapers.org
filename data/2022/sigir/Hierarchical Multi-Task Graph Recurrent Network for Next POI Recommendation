Learning which Point-of-Interest (POI) a user will visit next is a challenging task for personalized recommender systems due to the large search space of possible POIs in the region. A recurring problem among existing works that makes it difficult to learn and perform well is the sparsity of the User-POI matrix. In this paper, we propose our Hierarchical Multi-Task Graph Recurrent Network (HMT-GRN) approach, which alleviates the data sparsity problem by learning different User-Region matrices of lower sparsities in a multi-task setting. We then perform a Hierarchical Beam Search (HBS) on the different region and POI distributions to hierarchically reduce the search space with increasing spatial granularity and predict the next POI. Our HBS provides efficiency gains by reducing the search space, resulting in speedups of 5 to 7 times over an exhaustive approach. In addition, we also propose a novel selectivity layer to predict if the next POI has been visited before by the user to balance between personalization and exploration. Experimental results on two real-world Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) datasets show that our model significantly outperforms baseline and the state-of-the-art methods.
