Conversational recommendation system aims to recommend appropriate items to user by directly asking preference on attributes or recommending item list. However, most of existing methods only employ the flat item and attribute relationship, and ignore the hierarchical relationship connected by the similar user which can provide more comprehensive information. And these methods usually use the user accepted attributes to represent the conversational history and ignore the hierarchical information of sequential transition in the historical turns. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Information-aware Conversational Recommender (HICR) to model the two types of hierarchical information to boost the performance of CRS. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed model.
