A data lake is a repository for massive raw and heterogeneous data, which includes multiple data models with different data schemas and query interfaces. Keyword search can extract valuable information for users without the knowledge of underlying schemas and query languages. However, conventional keyword searches are restricted to a certain data model and cannot easily adapt to a data lake. In this paper, we study a novel keyword search. To achieve high accuracy and efficiency, we introduce canonical graphs and then integrate semantically related vertices based on vertex representations. A matching entity based keyword search algorithm is presented to find answers across multiple data sources. Finally, extensive experimental study shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution.
