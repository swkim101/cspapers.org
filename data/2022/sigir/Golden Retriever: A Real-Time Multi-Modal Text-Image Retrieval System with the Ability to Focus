In this work, we present the Golden Retriever, a system leveraging state-of-the-art visio-linguistic models (VLMs) for real-time text-image retrieval. The unique feature of our system is that it can focus on words contained in the textual query, i.e., locate and high-light them within retrieved images. An efficient two-stage process implements real-time capability and the ability to focus. Therefore, we first drastically reduce the number of images processed by a VLM. Then, in the second stage, we rank the images and highlight the focussed word using the outputs of a VLM. Further, we introduce a new and efficient algorithm based on the idea of TF-IDF to retrieve images for short textual queries. One of multiple use cases where we employ the Golden Retriever is a language learner scenario, where visual cues for "difficult" words within sentences are provided to improve a user's reading comprehension. However, since the backend is completely decoupled from the frontend, the system can be integrated into any other application where images must be retrieved fast. We demonstrate the Golden Retriever with screenshots of a minimalistic user interface.
