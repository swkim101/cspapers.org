Existing methods usually identify causal relations between events at the mention-level, which takes each event mention pair as a separate input. As a result, they either suffer from conflicts among causal relations predicted separately or require a set of additional constraints to resolve such conflicts. We propose to study this task in a more realistic setting, where event-level causality identification can be made. The advantage is two folds: 1) with modeling different mentions of an event as a single unit, no more conflicts among predicted results, without any extra constraints; 2) with the use of diverse knowledge sources (e.g., co-occurrence and coreference relations), a rich graph-based event structure can be induced from the document for supporting event-level causal inference. Graph convolutional network is used to encode such structural information, which aims to capture the local and non-local dependencies among nodes. Results show that our model achieves the best performance under both mention- and event-level settings, outperforming a number of strong baselines by at least 2.8% on F1 score.
