Data sparsity is a long-standing problem in recommender systems. To alleviate it, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has attracted a surge of interests, which utilizes the rich user-item interaction information from the related source domain to improve the performance on the sparse target domain. Recent CDR approaches pay attention to aggregating the source domain information to generate better user representations for the target domain. However, they focus on designing more powerful interaction encoders to learn both domains simultaneously, but fail to model different user preferences of different domains. Particularly, domain-specific preferences of the source domain usually provide useless information to enhance the performance in the target domain, and directly aggregating the domain-shared and domain-specific information together maybe hurts target domain performance. This work considers a key challenge of CDR: How do we transfer shared information across domains? Grounded in the information theory, we propose DisenCDR, a novel model to disentangle the domain-shared and domain-specific information. To reach our goal, we propose two mutual-information-based disentanglement regularizers. Specifically, an exclusive regularizer aims to enforce the user domain-shared representations and domain-specific representations encoding exclusive information. An information regularizer is to encourage the user domain-shared representations encoding predictive information for both domains. Based on them, we further derive a tractable bound of our disentanglement objective to learn desirable disentangled representations. Extensive experiments show that DisenCDR achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on four real-world datasets.
