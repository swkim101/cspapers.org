Due to the cost and design complexity associated with advanced technology nodes, it is difficult for traditional monolithic System-on-Chip to follow the Mooreâ€™s Law, which means the economic benefits have been weakened. Semiconductor industries are looking for advanced packages to improve the economic advantages. Since the multi-chiplet architecture supporting heterogeneous integration has the robust re-usability and effective cost reduction, chiplet integration has become the mainstream of advanced packages. Nowadays, the number of mounted chiplets in a package is continuously increasing with the requirement of high system performance. However, the large area caused by the increasing of chiplets leads to the serious reliability issues, including warpage and bump stress, which worsens the yield and cost. The multi-package architecture, which can distribute chiplets to multiple packages and use less area of each package, is a popular alternative to enhance the reliability and reduce the cost in advanced packages. However, the primary challenge of the multi-package architecture lies in the tradeoff between the inter-package costs, i.e., the interconnection among packages, and the intra-package costs, i.e., the reliability caused by warpage and bump stress. Therefore, a co-design methodology is indispensable to optimize multiple packages simultaneously to improve the quality of the whole system. To tackle this challenge, we adopt mathematical programming methods in the multi-package co-design problem regarding the nature of the synergistic optimization of multiple packages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to solve the multi-package co-design problem.
