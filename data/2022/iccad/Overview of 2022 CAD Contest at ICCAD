The "CAD Contest at ICCAD" is a challenging, multi-month, research and development competition, focusing on advanced, real-world problems in the field of electronic design automation (EDA). Since 2012, the contest has been publishing many sophisticated circuit design problems, from system-level design to physical design, together with industrial benchmarks and solution evaluators. Contestants can participate in one or more problems provided by EDA/IC industry. The winners will be awarded at an ICCAD special session dedicated to this contest. Every year, the contest attracts more than a hundred teams, fosters productive industry-academia collaborations, and leads to hundreds of publications in top-tier conferences and journals. The 2022 CAD Contest has 166 teams from all over the world. Moreover, the problems of this year cover state-of-the-art EDA research trends such as circuit security, 3D-IC, and design space exploration from well-known EDA/IC companies. We believe the contest keeps enhancing impact and boosting EDA researches.
