Cyclic logic locking is a new type of SAT-resistant techniques in hardware security. Recently, LOOPLock 2.0 was proposed, which is a cyclic logic locking method creating cycles deliberately in the locked circuit to resist SAT Attack, CycSAT, BeSAT, and Removal Attack simultaneously. The key idea of LOOPLock 2.0 is that the resultant circuit is still cyclic no matter the key vector is correct or not. This property refuses attackers and demonstrates its success on defending against attackers. In this paper, we propose an unlocking approach to LOOPLock 2.0 based on structure analysis and SAT solvers. Specifically, we identify and remove non-combinational cycles in the locked circuit before running SAT solvers. The experimental results show that the proposed unlocking approach is promising.
