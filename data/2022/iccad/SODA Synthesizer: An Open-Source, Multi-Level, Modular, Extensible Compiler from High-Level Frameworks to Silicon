The SODA Synthesizer is an open-source, modular, end-to-end hardware compiler framework. The SODA frontend, developed in MLIR, performs system-level design, code partitioning, and high-level optimizations to prepare the specifications for the hardware synthesis. The backend is based on a state-of-the-art high-level synthesis tool and generates the final hardware design. The backend can interface with logic synthesis tools for field programmable gate arrays or with commercial and open-source logic synthesis tools for application-specific integrated circuits. We discuss the opportunities and challenges in integrating with commercial and open-source tools both at the frontend and backend, and highlight the role that an end-to-end compiler framework like SODA can play in an open-source hardware design ecosystem.
