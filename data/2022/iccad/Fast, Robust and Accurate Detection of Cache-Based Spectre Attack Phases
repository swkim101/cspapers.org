Modern processors achieve high performance and efficiency by employing techniques such as speculative execution and sharing resources such as caches. However, recent attacks like Spectre and Meltdown exploit the speculative execution of modern processors to leak sensitive information from the system. Many mitigation strategies have been proposed to restrict the speculative execution of processors and protect potential side-channels. Currently, these techniques have shown a significant performance overhead. A solution that can detect memory leaks before the attacker has a chance to exploit them would allow the processor to reduce the performance overhead by enabling protections only when the system is at risk.In this paper, we propose a mechanism to detect speculative execution attacks that use caches as a side-channel. In this detector we track the phases of a successful attack and raise an alert before the attacker gets a chance to recover sensitive information. We accomplish this through monitoring the microarchitectural changes in the core and caches, and detect the memory locations that can be potential memory data leaks. We achieve 100% accuracy and negligible false positive rate in detecting Spectre attacks and evasive versions of Spectre that the state-of-the-art detectors are unable to detect. Our detector has no performance overhead with negligible power and area overheads.
