In modern heterogeneous integration technologies, chips with different processes and functionality are integrated into a package with high interconnection density and large I/O counts. Integrating multiple chips into a package may suffer from severe warpage problems caused by the mismatch in coefficients of thermal expansion between different manufacturing materials, leading to deformation and malfunction in the manufactured package. The industry is eager to find a solution for warpage optimization. This paper proposes the first warpage-aware floorplanning algorithm for heterogeneous integration. We first present an efficient qualitative warpage model for a multi-chip package structure based on Suhirâ€™s solution, more suitable for optimization than the time-consuming finite element analysis. Based on the transitive closure graph floorplan representation, we then propose three perturbations for simulated annealing to optimize the warpage more directly and can thus speed up the process. Finally, we develop a force-directed detailed floorplanning algorithm to further refine the solutions by utilizing the dead spaces. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our warpage model and algorithm.
