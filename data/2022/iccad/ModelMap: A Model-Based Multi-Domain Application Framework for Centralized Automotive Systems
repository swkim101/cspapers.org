This paper presents ModelMap, a model-based multi-domain application development framework for DriveOS, our in-house centralized vehicle management software system. DriveOS runs on multicore x86 machines and uses hardware virtualization to host isolated RTOS and Linux guest OS sandboxes. In this work, we design Simulink interfaces for model-based vehicle control function development across multiple sandboxed domains in DriveOS. ModelMap provides abstractions to: (1) automatically generate periodic tasks bound to threads in different OS domains, (2) establish cross-domain synchronous and asynchronous communication interfaces, and (3) handle USB-based CAN I/O in Simulink. We introduce the concept of a nested binary, for the deployment of ELF binary executable code in different sandboxed domains. We demonstrate ModelMap using a combination of synthetic benchmarks, and experiments with Simulink models of a CAN Gateway and HVAC service running on an electric car. ModelMap eases the development of applications, which are shown to achieve industry-target performance using a multicore hardware platform in DriveOS.
