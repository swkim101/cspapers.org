As the demand for semiconductor products increases and the integrated circuits (IC) processes become more and more complex, wafer failure pattern classification is gaining more attention from manufacturers and researchers to improve yield. To further cope with the real-world scenario that there are only very limited labeled data and without any unlabeled data in the early manufacturing stage of new products, this work proposes an efficient human-like staged learning framework for wafer failure pattern classification named WaferHSL. Inspired by humanâ€™s knowledge acquisition process, a mutually reinforcing task fusion scheme is designed for guiding the deep learning model to simultaneously establish the knowledge of spatial relationships, geometry properties and semantics. Furthermore, a progressive stage controller is deployed to partition and control the learning process, so as to enable human-like progressive advancement in the model. Experimental results show that with only 10% labeled samples and no unlabeled samples, WaferHSL can achieve better results than previous SOTA methods trained with 60% labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples, while the improvement is even more significant when using the same size of labeled training set.
