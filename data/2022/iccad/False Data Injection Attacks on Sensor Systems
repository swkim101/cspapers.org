False data injection attacks on sensor systems are an emerging threat to cyberphysical systems, creating significant risks to all application domains and, importantly, to critical infrastructures. Cyberphysical systems are process-dependent leading to differing false data injection attacks that target disruption of the specific processes (plants). We present a taxonomy of false data injection attacks, using a general model for cyberphysical systems, showing that global and continuous attacks are extremely powerful. In order to detect false data injection attacks, we describe three methods that can be employed to enable effective monitoring and detection of false data injection attacks during plant operation. Considering that sensor failures have equivalent effects to relative false data injection attacks, the methods are effective for sensor fault detection as well.
