This paper introduces a scalable algorithmic framework (HyperEF) for spectral coarsening (decomposition) of large-scale hypergraphs by exploiting hyperedge effective resistances. Motivated by the latest theoretical framework for low-resistance-diameter decomposition of simple graphs, HyperEF aims at decomposing large hypergraphs into multiple node clusters with only a few inter-cluster hyperedges. The key component in HyperEF is a nearly-linear time algorithm for estimating hyperedge effective resistances, which allows incorporating the latest diffusion-based non-linear quadratic operators defined on hypergraphs. To achieve good runtime scalability, HyperEF searches within the Krylov subspace (or approximate eigensubspace) for identifying the nearly-optimal vectors for approximating the hyperedge effective resistances. In addition, a node weight propagation scheme for multilevel spectral hypergraph decomposition has been introduced for achieving even greater node coarsening ratios. When compared with state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioning (clustering) methods, extensive experiment results on real-world VLSI designs show that HyperEF can more effectively coarsen (decompose) hypergraphs without losing key structural (spectral) properties of the original hypergraphs, while achieving over 70× runtime speedups over hMetis and 20× speedups over HyperSF.
