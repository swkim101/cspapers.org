Tremor is a common symptom among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients at all stages. To measure tremor, we utilized IMU sensing data from the wrists while PD patients were drawing. With 30 patients' IMU sensing data obtained from standard tremor rating scale activities, we conducted data analysis for identifying any tremor episodes and extracting tremor amplitude. In this demo, we demonstrate that our preliminary analysis and results show the potential of measuring kinetic tremors effectively using these methods.
