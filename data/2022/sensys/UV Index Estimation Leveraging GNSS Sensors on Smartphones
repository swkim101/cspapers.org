Monitoring the amount of UV irradiance to which individuals are exposed and ensuring that every individual receives the optimal amount has been the subject of extensive research. In previous research, the UV index was estimated using cell phone cameras, light sensors on smartphones, or wearable UV sensors. We propose a method for estimating the UV index using the widespread global navigation satellite system (GNSS) sensors available on smart-phones. In contrast to approaches that require the sensor to be exposed continuously to the irradiance, this method, which leverages GNSS sensors, has the potential advantage of enabling UV index measurement simply by carrying the phone as usual. As a first step in measuring the index using GNSS sensors, GNSS data were collected from cell phones placed at three locations in a single area; the OpenUV API was utilized as a baseline. The proposed method achieved a mean absolute error of 0.1523, which significantly outperformed the baseline.
