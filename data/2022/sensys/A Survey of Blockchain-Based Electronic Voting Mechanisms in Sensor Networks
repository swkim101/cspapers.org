Electronic voting technology has the ability to accelerate the counting of ballots, reduce the cost of voting, and offer convenience for remote voters. Meanwhile, the efficiency of voting can be improved. Immutability, verifiability, and distribution are the main features blockchain can provide. Building an electronic voting system based on the blockchain can help to mitigate the security issues such as single-point failure and data manipulation. However, some blockchain systems are not feasible in the environment of sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis of blockchain-based electronic voting systems from the perspective of blockchain type, cryptography techniques, counting method, and security requirements. We also identify a possible new direction for the design of blockchain-based electronic voting systems for the reference of future research.
