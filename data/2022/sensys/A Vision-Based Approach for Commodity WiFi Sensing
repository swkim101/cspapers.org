The ubiquitous WiFi signals provide us the opportunity to sense human activities and the physical environment. In this work, we take a layered approach to design a vision-based method for commodity WiFi sensing. Specifically, the next-generation WiFi supports a larger number of antennas that can provide spatial information of the signal reflections, which enables a vision-based approach for WiFi sensing. To better leverage the spatial formation of the signal reflections and fulfill emerging applications, we provide a holistic layered framework including hardware, physical, deep learning, and application layers as well as a case study. The proposed layered approach could enlighten the research on future WiFi sensing.
