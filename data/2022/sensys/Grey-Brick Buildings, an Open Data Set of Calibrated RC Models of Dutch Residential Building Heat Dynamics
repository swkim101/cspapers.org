Building thermal modeling is the founding stone upon which numerous carbon reduction strategies in the building sector are built. Yet, as of today, little to no interpretable and calibrated models founded on real-world measurements have been open-sourced. This work attempts to remedy this deficiency and renders public improved results of a recently published stochastic model identification of building heat dynamics study evaluated over 225 Dutch residential buildings. Calibrated lumped resistance-capacity models are made available, along with thermal characterizations of the buildings and reported meta-data. The paper discusses how open-access building thermal models support a collection of building service applications such as building performance benchmarks, model-based control, demand-side management, policy impact assessment, and data augmentation. Insights provided present a starting point for open access benchmarks of building thermal dynamics, paving the way toward new scientific discoveries from common standards.
