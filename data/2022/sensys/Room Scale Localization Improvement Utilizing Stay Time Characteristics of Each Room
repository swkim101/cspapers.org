Indoor localization technology is one of the most important topics in the fields of Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous computing, and it has attracted much attention in recent years due to its ability to enable a variety of services. Localization methods using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signal strength can introduce a low-cost location estimation system. However, due to the instability of the received signal strength and signals leaking from adjacent rooms, a simple method based on signal strength alone frequently results in misjudgment, depending on the signal propagation characteristics. In this paper, we propose a method to suppress misjudgment by considering the characteristics of stay time in different rooms. Our proposed method estimates the user state by fitting the distribution of time spent in each room to a Weibull distribution and applying survival analysis. The experimental results suggest that the method will provide more accurate information about the rooms in which users stay.
