Spectrum sensing plays a crucial role in spectrum monitoring and management. However, Due to the expensive cost of high-speed ADCs, wideband spectrum sensing is a long-standing challenge. In this demo, we present how to transform the low-cost Ultrawideband (UWB) devices into a spectrum sensor and showcase WISE, a low-cost wideband spectrum sensing system, which not only can give accurate channel occupancy information, but also can precisely estimate the signal power and bandwidth. Our demo will show that WISE can sense up to 900MHz bandwidth and the power estimation error is less than 3dB. WISE can also accurately detect busy 5G channels and fleeting radar signals. We believe that WISE provides a new paradigm for low-cost wideband spectrum sensing, which is critical for large-scale fine-grained spectrum monitoring.
