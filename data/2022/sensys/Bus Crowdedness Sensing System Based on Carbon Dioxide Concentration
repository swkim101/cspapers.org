Crowdedness sensing of buses is playing an important role in the disease control of COVID-19 and bus resource scheduling. This research analyzes the relationship between carbon dioxide concentration, bus environment and the number of passengers by linear regression. Our prototype system collects the data of bus environment and carbon dioxide concentration to estimate the number of passengers in real time. By collecting the sensing data from a shuttle bus of university campus, we experimentally evaluate the feasibility and sensing performance of the crowdedness estimation model.
