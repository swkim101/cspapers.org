When customers wait their turn to place an order at a street vendor, they often form a spontaneous queue. Due to the presence of passers-by and people standing outside the queue, it is more difficult than one might think to distinguish between those in the queue and those not in the queue. In this paper, we consider a method that uses acoustic ranging to autonomously detect who is in line and in which order, under the condition that all customers have smartphones. The proposed method is unique in that it can distinguish whether a newly arrived user has joined the end of the queue or not by taking cues from the geometric properties of the queue. Our preparatory queueing simulations confirm that 92.5% of the queuers are estimated correctly.
