GitHub hosts hundreds of millions of code repositories written in hundreds of different programming languages. In addition to its hosting services, GitHub provides data and insights into code, such as vulnerability analysis and code navigation, with which users can improve and understand their software development process. GitHub has built Semantic, a program analysis tool capable of parsing and extracting detailed information from source code. The development of Semantic has relied extensively on the functional programming literature; this paper describes how connections to academic research inspired and informed the development of an industrial-scale program analysis toolkit.
