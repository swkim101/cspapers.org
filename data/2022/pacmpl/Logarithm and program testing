Randomized property-based testing has gained much attention recently, but most frameworks stop short at polymorphic properties. Although Bernardy et al. have developed a theory to reduce a wide range of polymorphic properties to monomorphic ones, it relies upon ad-hoc embedding-projection pairs to massage the types into a particular form. This paper skips the embedding-projection pairs and presents a mechanical monomorphization for a general class of polymorphic functions, a step towards automatic testing for polymorphic properties. The calculation of suitable types for monomorphization turns out to be logarithm.
