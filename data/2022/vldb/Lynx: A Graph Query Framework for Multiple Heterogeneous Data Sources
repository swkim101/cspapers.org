Graph model are increasingly popular among modern applications for its ability to model complex relationships between entities. Users tend to query the data as a graph with graph operations (e.g., graph navigation and exploration). However, a large fraction of the data resides in relational databases or other storage systems. Challenges arise in uniformly querying multiple heterogeneous data sources as a graph. Traditional solutions are limited by time-consuming data integration, expensive development effort, and incomplete query requirements. Thus, we developed Lynx, a general graph query framework, to simplify querying graph data by converting complex statements into basic graph operations. Instead of connecting directly to the data sources, Lynx retrieves data through user-implemented interfaces for those graph operations. We demonstrate Lynx's capabilities through real-world scenarios, showcasing Lynx's ability to process graph queries on multiple heterogeneous data sources and also to be used as a generic graph query engine development framework.
