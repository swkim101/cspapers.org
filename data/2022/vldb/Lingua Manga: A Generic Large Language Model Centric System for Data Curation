Data curation is a wide-ranging area which contains many critical but time-consuming data processing tasks. However, the diversity of such tasks makes it challenging to develop a general-purpose data curation system. To address this issue, we present Lingua Manga, a user-friendly and versatile system that utilizes pre-trained large language models. Lingua Manga offers automatic optimization for achieving high performance and label efficiency while facilitating flexible and rapid development. Through three example applications with distinct objectives and users of varying levels of technical proficiency, we demonstrate that Lingua Manga can effectively assist both skilled programmers and low-code or even no-code users in addressing data curation challenges.
