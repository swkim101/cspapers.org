The recent development of mobile and camera devices has led to the generation, sharing, and usage of massive amounts of video data. As a result, deep learning technology has gained attention as an alternative for video recognition and situation judgment. Recently, new systems supporting SQL-like declarative query languages have emerged, focusing on developing their own systems to support new queries combined with deep learning that are not supported by existing systems. The proposed DeepVQL system in this paper is implemented by expanding the PostgreSQL system. DeepVQL supports video database functions and provides various user-defined functions for object detection, object tracking, and video analytics queries. The advantage of this system is its ability to utilize queries with specific spatial regions or temporal durations as conditions for analyzing moving objects in traffic videos.
