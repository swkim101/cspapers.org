 Community search studies the retrieval of certain community structures containing query vertices, which has received lots of attention recently.
 k
 -truss is a fundamental community structure where each edge is contained in at least
 k
 - 2 triangles. Triangle-connected
 k
 -truss community (
 k
 -TTC) is a widely-used variant of
 k
 -truss, which is a maximal
 k
 -truss where edges can reach each other via a series of edge-adjacent triangles. Although existing works have provided indexes and query algorithms for
 k
 -TTC search, the cohesiveness of a
 k
 -TTC (diameter upper bound) has not been theoretically analyzed and the triangle connectivity has not been efficiently captured. Thus, we revisit the
 k
 -TTC search problem in dynamic graphs, aiming to achieve a deeper understanding of
 k
 -TTC. First, we prove that the diameter of a
 k
 -TTC with
 n
 vertices is bounded by [EQUATION]. Then, we encapsulate triangle connectivity with two novel concepts, partial class and truss-precedence, based on which we build our compact index, EquiTree, to support the efficient
 k
 -TTC search. We also provide efficient index construction and maintenance algorithms for the dynamic change of graphs. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our extensive experiments show that EquiTree can boost search efficiency up to two orders of magnitude at a small cost of index construction and maintenance.
