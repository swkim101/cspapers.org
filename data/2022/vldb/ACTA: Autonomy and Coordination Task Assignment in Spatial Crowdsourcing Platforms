Spatial platforms have become increasingly important in people's daily lives. Task assignment is a critical problem in these platforms that matches real-time orders to suitable workers. Most studies only focus on independent platforms that are in a competitive relationship. Recently, an emerging service model was proposed, where orders are shared with multiple similar platforms. It aims to solve the imbalance between supply and demand through cooperation. However, it faces the following main challenges: 1) Coordinating independent platforms fairly based on the limited information; 2) Building a task assignment process with personalized algorithms. In this paper, we study real applications and define the Autonomy and Coordination Task Assignment problem (ACTA) to maximize the global revenue and fairness. We propose a framework to solve ACTA that consists of public order sending, local matching, global conflict adjustment and results notification. The framework uses mid-products and public data to train a revenue estimation model to coordinate participants. We further propose dynamic weight task assignment algorithms to guarantee fairness. Through the experiments, we prove that the platforms can obtain higher revenue, which shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our work.
