The development of Earth Observation technology contributes to the production of massive raster data. It is vital to manage and conduct analytical tasks on the raster data. Existing solutions employ dedicated systems for the raster data management and processing, respectively, incurring problems such as data redundancy, difficulty in updating, expensive data transferring and transformation, etc. To cope with these limitations, this demonstration presents Ganos Aero, a cloud-native system for big raster data management and processing. Ganos Aero proposes a unified raster data model for both the data management and processing, which stores a single copy of the raster data and without performing an expensive tiling procedure, and thus achieves significant improvement in the storage and updating efficiency. To enable efficient query and batch task processing, Ganos Aero implements an on-the-fly tile production mechanism, and optimizes its performance using the cloud features including decoupling compute from storage and pushing costly operations closer to the storage layer.
 Since deployed in Alibaba Cloud in 2022, Ganos Aero has been playing a critical role in many real applications including the modern agriculture, environment monitoring and protection, et al.
