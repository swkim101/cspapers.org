Real-time collaboration has become increasingly important in various applications, from document creation to data analytics. Although collaboration features are prevalent in editing applications, they remain rare in data-analytics applications, where the need for collaboration is even more crucial. This tutorial aims to provide attendees with a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and design decisions associated with supporting real-time collaboration and user interactions in data analytics systems. We will discuss popular conflict resolution technologies, the unique challenges of facilitating collaborative experiences during the workflow construction and execution phases, and the complexities of supporting responsive user interactions during job execution.
