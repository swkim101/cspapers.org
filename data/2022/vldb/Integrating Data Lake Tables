We have made tremendous strides in providing tools for data scientists to discover new tables useful for their analyses. But despite these advances, the proper integration of discovered tables has been under-explored. An interesting semantics for integration, called Full Disjunction, was proposed in the 1980's, but there has been little progress in using it for data science to integrate tables culled from data lakes. We provide ALITE, the first proposal for scalable integration of tables that may have been discovered using join, union or related table search. We empirically show that ALITE can outperform previous algorithms for computing the Full Disjunction. ALITE relaxes previous assumptions that tables share common attribute names (which completely determine the join columns), are complete (without null values), and have acyclic join patterns. To evaluate ALITE, we develop and share three new benchmarks for integration that use real data lake tables.
