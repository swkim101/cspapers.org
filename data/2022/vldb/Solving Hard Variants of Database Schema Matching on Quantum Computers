With quantum computers now available as cloud services, there is a global quest for applications where a quantum advantage can be shown. Naturally, data management is a candidate domain. Workable solutions require the design of hybrid quantum algorithms, where a quantum computing unit (a QPU) and classical computing (via CPUs) cooperate towards solving a problem. This demo illustrates such an end-to-end solution targeting NP-hard variants of database schema matching. Our demo is intended to be educational (and hopefully inspiring), allowing participants to explore the critical design decisions, such as the handover between phases of QPU- and CPU-based computation. It will also allow participants to experience hands-on - through playful interaction - how easily problem sizes exceed the limitations of today's QPUs.
