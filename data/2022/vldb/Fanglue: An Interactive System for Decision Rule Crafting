In many applications the training data do not always contain sufficient information to produce high-quality decision rules for standard (end-to-end) rule mining algorithms, and human experts have to incorporate domain knowledge during rule induction in order to get meaningful results. In this work we present Fanglue, a home-grown system inside Alipay, for interactive decision rule crafting. Fanglue is a distributed in-memory system and is highly responsive when processing large-scale datasets. In addition, Fanglue extends the standard representation of a decision rule by introducing disjunctive clauses. Having disjunctive clauses can improve the coverage and robustness of a decision rule, especially for fraud prevention in Fintech applications.
