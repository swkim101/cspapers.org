 Modern location-based systems have stimulated explosive growth of urban trajectory data and promoted many real-world applications,
 e.g.
 , trajectory prediction. However, heavy big data processing overhead and privacy concerns hinder trajectory acquisition and utilization. Inspired by regular trajectory distribution on transportation road networks, we propose to model trajectory data privately with a deep generative model and leverage the model to generate representative trajectories for downstream tasks or directly support these tasks (
 e.g.
 , popularity ranking), rather than acquiring and processing the original big trajectory data. Nevertheless, it is rather challenging to model high-dimensional trajectories with time-varying yet skewed distribution. To address this problem, we model and generate trajectory sequence with judiciously encoded spatio-temporal features over skewed distribution by leveraging an important factor neglected by the literature - the underlying road properties (
 e.g.
 , road types and directions), which are closely related to trajectory distribution. Specifically, we decompose trajectory into map-matched road sequence with temporal information and embed them to encode spatio-temporal features. Then, we enhance trajectory representation by encoding inherent route planning patterns from the underlying road properties. Later, we encode spatial correlations among edges and daily and weekly temporal periodicity information. Next, we employ a meta-learning module to generate trajectory sequence step by step by learning generalized trajectory distribution patterns from skewed trajectory data based on the well-encoded trajectory prefix. Last but not least, we preserve trajectory privacy by learning the model differential privately with clipping gradients. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods.
