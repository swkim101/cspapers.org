 Instant spatial keyword queries return the results as soon as users type in some characters instead of a complete keyword, which allow users to query the geo-textual data in a
 type-as-you-search
 manner. However, the existing methods of instant spatial keyword queries suffer from several limitations. For example, the existing methods do not consider the typographical errors of input keywords, and cannot be applied to the road networks. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a new query type, i.e., instant error-tolerant spatial keyword queries on road networks. To answer the queries efficiently, we present a framework, termed as Task, which consists of index component, query component, and update component. In the index component, we design a novel index called reverse 2-hop label based trie, which seamlessly integrates spatial and textual information for each vertex of the road network. Based on our proposed index, we devise efficient algorithms to progressively return and update the query results in the query component and update component, respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world road networks to evaluate the performance of our presented Task. Empirical results show that our proposed index and algorithms are up to 1--2 orders of magnitude faster than the baseline.
