NVMe SSDs based on flash are cheap and offer high throughput. Combining several of these devices into a single server enables 10 million I/O operations per second or more. Our experiments show that existing out-of-memory database systems and storage engines achieve only a fraction of this performance. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to close the performance gap between hardware and software through an I/O optimized storage engine design. In a heavy out-of-memory setting, where the dataset is 10 times larger than main memory, our system can achieve more than 1 million TPC-C transactions per second.
