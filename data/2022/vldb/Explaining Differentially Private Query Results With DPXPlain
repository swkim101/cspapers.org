Employing Differential Privacy (DP), the state-of-the-art privacy standard, to answer aggregate database queries poses new challenges for users to understand the trends and anomalies observed in the query results: Is the unexpected answer due to the data itself, or is it due to the extra noise that must be added to preserve DP? We propose to demonstrate DPXPlain, the first system for explaining group-by aggregate query answers with DP. DPXPlain allows users to compare values of two groups and receive a validity check, and further provides an explanation table with an interactive visualization, containing the approximately 'top-k' explanation predicates along with their relative influences and ranks in the form of confidence intervals, while guaranteeing DP in all steps.
