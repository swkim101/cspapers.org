In this work, we focus on the performance benchmarking problem of storage services in cloud-native database systems, which are widely used in various cloud applications. The core idea of these systems is to separate computation and storage in traditional monolithic OLTP databases. Specifically, we first present the characteristics of two representative real I/O workloads at the storage tier of ByteDance's cloud-native database veDB. We then elaborate the limitations of using standard benchmarks such as TPC-C and YCSB to resemble these workloads. To overcome these limitations, we devise a learning-based I/O workload benchmark called CDS-Ben. We demonstrate the superiority of CDSBen by deploying it at ByteDance and showing that its generated I/O traces accurately resemble the real I/O traces in production. Additionally, we verify the accuracy and flexibility of CDSBen by generating a wide range of I/O workloads with different I/O characteristics.
