 As modern applications generate data at an unprecedented speed and often require the querying/analysis of data spanning a large duration, it is crucial to develop indexing techniques that cater to larger-than-memory databases, where data reside on heterogeneous storage devices (such as memory and disk), and support fast data insertion and query processing. In this paper, we propose FILM, a

 emory databases. FILM is a learned tree structure that uses simple approximation models to index data spanning different storage devices. Compared with existing techniques for larger-than-memory databases, such as anti-caching, FILM allows for more efficient query processing at significantly lower main-memory overhead. FILM is also designed to effectively address one of the bottlenecks in existing methods for indexing larger-than-memory databases that is caused by data swapping between memory and disk. More specifically, updating the LRU (for Least Recently Used) structure employed by existing methods for cold data identification (determining the data to be evicted to disk when the available memory runs out) often incurs significant delay to query processing. FILM takes a drastically different approach by proposing an adaptive LRU structure and piggybacking its update onto query processing with minimal overhead. We thoroughly study the performance of FILM and its components on a variety of datasets and workloads, and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority in improving query processing performance and reducing index storage overhead (by orders of magnitudes) compared with applicable baselines.
