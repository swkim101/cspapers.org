Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have existed for years, but new hardware trends and advances in model training and inference have radically improved their performance. With an ever increasing amount of algorithms, systems, and hardware solutions, it is challenging to identify good deployments even for experts. Researchers and industry experts have observed this challenge and have created several benchmark suites for AI and ML applications and systems. While they are helpful in comparing several aspects of AI applications, none of the existing benchmarks measures end-to-end performance of ML deployments. Many have been rigorously developed in collaboration between academia and industry, but no existing benchmark is standardized.
 In this paper, we introduce the TPC Express Benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (TPCx-AI), the first industry standard benchmark for end-to-end machine learning deployments. TPCx-AI is the first AI benchmark that represents the pipelines typically found in common ML and AI workloads. TPCx-AI provides a full software kit, which includes data generator, driver, and two full workload implementations, one based on Python libraries and one based on Apache Spark. We describe the complete benchmark and show benchmark results for various scale factors. TPCx-AI's core contributions are a novel unified data set covering structured and unstructured data; a fully scalable data generator that can generate realistic data from GB up to PB scale; and a diverse and representative workload using different data types and algorithms, covering a wide range of aspects of real ML workloads such as data integration, data processing, training, and inference.
