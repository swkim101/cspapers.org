Wearables activity trackers are becoming widely adopted to understand individual behavior. Understanding behavior may help in self-regulation such as self-monitoring, goal-setting, self-corrective, etc.; Nevertheless, challenges exist in attaining consistent use and adoption of wearables, which hinders behavior understanding. Research has suggested that nudging strategies may change and sustain human engagement. However, it is still unknown how nudging may affect human wearing behavior on an individual level. We conducted a six-month study in which we tested several nudging techniques on the same participants. The preliminary results of our research show that participants perform better when a nudging strategy is applied. In addition, participants responded differently to different nudging techniques. Future research can focus on developing an individual-based nudging mechanism to encourage users to wear their devices consistently.
