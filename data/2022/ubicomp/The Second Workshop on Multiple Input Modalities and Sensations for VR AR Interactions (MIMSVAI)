With the advance of VR/AR technology, more and more VR/AR applications are emerging and have been popular among new users. Interacting with virtual reality and augmented reality technologies will require the development of alternative input modalities as well as coherent integration of multiple realistic sensations to increase the level of perceived realism. These developments will create a more immersive VR/AR experience. However, a lack of robust and intuitive interaction interfaces and realistic sensations hinders usersâ€™ experience for achieving a fascinating acceptance in various application areas of VR/AR interactions. This workshop discusses the challenges and applications of designing a higher coherence between different input modalities and sensations to offer more engaging VR/AR experiences, which can create opportunities for the researchers from both UbiComp and VR/AR fields to jointly discuss and brainstorm alternative input modalities and sensations for VR/AR interactions.
