Cue exposure can be an invaluable tool by which to learn the skills of cue identification and craving perception in the development of mind-body awareness. Virtual reality (VR) has proven highly effective in cue-exposure therapy. In the current study, we developed a system for the collection of biofeedback data during the VR experience and while recounting these experiences with a psychotherapist afterward. Our results provide insight into the means by which VR cues induce cravings and impact the emotional state of the user.
