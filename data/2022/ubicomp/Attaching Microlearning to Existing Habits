To take advantage of microlearning, it is desirable for learners to make microlearning a habit. Most of the conventional methods for making microlearning a habit are intended to form a habit from scratch, but attempts to form a habit from scratch require a lot of motivation and workload from the learner. In this study, we propose habit-attached microlearning as a method to make microlearning a habit with less burden. This method designs a mechanism in which a microlearning task is added to the learnerâ€™s existing habits. In this study, we focused on web browsing on smartphones as a habit to attach to learning, and developed a web browsing application for learning English vocabulary. This paper reports on a controlled experiment conducted to evaluate the learning and habit-forming effects of the developed application.
