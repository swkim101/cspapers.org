With the advancements in ubiquitous computing, ubicomp technology has deeply spread into our daily lives, including office work, home and house-keeping, health management, transportation, or even urban living environments. Furthermore, beyond the initial metrics commonly applied in computing, such as “efficiency” and “productivity”, the benefits that people (users) get from well-being-aware ubiquitous technology have been greatly emphasized in the recent years. Through the fifth “WellComp” (Computing for Well-being) workshop, we will discuss and debate the contribution of ubiquitous computing towards users’ well-being covering both physical, mental, and social wellness (and the combinations thereof), from the viewpoints of various different layers of computing. Organized by a diverse international team of ubicomp researchers, WellComp 2022 will bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to explore versatile topics related to well-being and ubiquitous computing.
