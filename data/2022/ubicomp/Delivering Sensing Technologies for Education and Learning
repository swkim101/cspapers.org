Pervasive and ubiquitous sensing technologies have been frequently leveraged in experimental settings within the Ubicomp, ISWC, and HCI community. In the recent past, we have seen advances in the use of ubiquitous sensing technologies to understand and support learning. Recent work investigated a wide range of education-related technologies that detect attention, postures, behaviors, and emotions. However, the promise of delivering these technologies to potential users en masse remains difficult to fulfill. At this time it is important to understand the factors hindering the use of these technologies, to critically evaluate methodologies for technological development, and to discuss in what ways developed technologies can be safely delivered to students. In this workshop, we bring together experts from the fields of ubiquitous and pervasive computing, HCI, and education to discuss and develop an agenda for moving sensing technologies for learning and education from research to practice.
