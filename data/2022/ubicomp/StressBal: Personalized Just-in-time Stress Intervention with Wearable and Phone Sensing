This paper proposes StressBal, a mobile system that offers personalized just-in-time stress intervention with mobile and wearable sensing. The system runs entirely on-device, detecting stress in real-time and providing respiratory exercise-based interventions. It also updates the stress detection algorithm continuously, based on user feedback. We envision an open mobile platform that helps researchers to design and evaluate automatic, seamless, and unobtrusive stress interventions during everyday activities.
