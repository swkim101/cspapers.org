Multi-modal haptic devices have the capability to convey different types of sensory information through the mechanoreceptors in the skin, allowing for a more accurate and realistic perception of haptic feedback. However, integrating different types of actuators into a device is difficult as it can lead to perceptual interference and potential masking effects. This work outlines the design of a wearable device to study how haptic perception thresholds vary in the presence of more than one type of actuation system in a wearable device, specifically focusing on compression and vibrotactile haptic feedback. The paper also highlights the efforts so far in terms of prototype development and a proposed user study to evaluate interference/interaction between the different haptic stimuli.
