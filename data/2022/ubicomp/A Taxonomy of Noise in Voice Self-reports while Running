Smart earables offer great opportunities for conducting ubiquitous computing research. This paper shares its reflection on collecting self-reports from runners using the microphone on the smart eSense earbud device. Despite the advantages of the eSense in allowing researchers to collect continuous voice self-reports anytime anywhere, it also captured noise signals from various sources and created challenges in data processing and analysis. The paper presents an initial taxonomy of noise in runnersâ€™ voice self-reports data via eSense. This is based on a qualitative analysis of voice recordings based on eSense's microphone with 11 runners across 14 in-the-wild running sessions. The paper discusses the details and characteristics of the observed noise, the challenges in achieving good-quality self-reports, and opportunities for extracting useful contextual information. The paper further suggests a noise-categorization API for the eSense or other similar platforms, not only for the purpose of noise-cancellation but also incorporating the mining of contextual information.
