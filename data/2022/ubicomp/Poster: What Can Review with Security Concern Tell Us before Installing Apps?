Providing pertinent information to potential users about security concerns drawn from user feedback is essential to enhance the security level of the entire mobile ecosystem. According to a usable security survey, star ratings and reviews can help users’ download and permission decisions. However, many apps have security problems with a high star rating. To confirm this problem, we build a dataset by collecting 56,439,878 star ratings and reviews for 8,999 popular game apps on Google Play Store. This study proposes a model using an active learning method that distinguishes Review with Security Concern (RSC) from user reviews. As a result, we find the star rating and RSC have a very weak correlation (Pearson correlation value -0.2949). Thus, it shows that the current star rating system does not reflect users’ security concerns and needs improvements to deliver a more practical metric before installing an app by users.
