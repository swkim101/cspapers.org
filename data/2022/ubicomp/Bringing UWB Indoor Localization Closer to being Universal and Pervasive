Location-based services have the potentials to change how we interact with the places and things around us. UWB indoor localization is one of the most successful enabling technologies that has achieved decimeter accuracy with robustness against complex indoor multipath environments. In this work, we demonstrate a system that not only achieves high localization accuracy, but also supports infinite scalability, full user privacy, and plug-and-play infrastructure deployment, which brings localization closer to a universal and pervasive technology.
