The monitoring of physical and mental health has been the focus of attention. At the same time, with the advancement of wearable sensors and information acquisition technology, there is no longer any satisfaction with the centralized, fixed-point traditional physiological indicator collection methods. Physiological indicator monitoring systems based on portable devices and mobile collection are gradually becoming a priority for research. Based on these needs, we present a wearable human physiological indicator monitoring system called EmoTracer. Through the self-developed and well-designed wearable collection device, body temperature, blood oxygen, heart rate and electrical skin signals are transmitted to the mobile terminal via Bluetooth communication; the mobile terminal then stores and calculates the data and displays the changes in physiological indicators in a visualized form in real-time. At the same time, we conducted an emotion recognition experiment (N = 10) based on our device, which can reach an average accuracy of 91.23%, making a preliminary exploration in the direction of emotion perception.
