It has been reported that the number of fatal accidents in bathtubs is particularly high in residential environments, so it is important to obtain information on body posture and other factors associated with individuals while bathing in bathtubs. In this study, we proposed a method to identify a person entering water by obtaining the change of water pressure from a water pressure sensor installed at the bottom of the bathtub in two situations; one is a situation in which a person is entering bathtub while pouring water into the bathtub, the other is a situation in which the bathtub overflows due to entering water. From evaluation experiments using entering water data collected from four subjects in pouring, overflow, and normal situations, an average F-value of 0.552 was obtained for the identification results in the overflow situation, and an average F-value of 0.792 was obtained for the identification results in the pouring situation.
