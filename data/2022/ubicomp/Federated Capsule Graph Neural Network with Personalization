Capsule-based GNN models have recently shown their competitiveness in graph classification. In this work, we propose FedCapsGNN, a novel framework which enables multiple clients to collaboratively perform capsule-based graph classification tasks under the federated learning paradigm. Our framework effectively combats the ill-effects of graph statistical heterogeneity with a novel local primary capsule augmentation method and a dexterously designed aggregation strategy with clustered capsule network layers. Experimental results demonstrate that our FedCapsGNN framework is able to capture the personality of each local client while effectively utilizing global knowledge, achieving superior accuracy for graph classification tasks on multiple benchmark datasets.
