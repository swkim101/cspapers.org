RADAR-IoT is an IoT gateway framework allowing myriad of sensors to inter-connect, collect data and do interesting things like on-device AI/ML, dashboarding, alerting and combining sensor information with other data sources of a cloud based platform (like wearable devices in an mHealth data platform) and providing real-time actionable intelligence. The amount of available sensors is limitless allowing for possibilities previously not possible, empowering the field of health informatics.
