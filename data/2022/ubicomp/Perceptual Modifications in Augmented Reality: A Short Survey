Views on Augmented Reality (AR) and its technology have changed. Rather than being a research area on its own, with a focus on computer vision and computer-generated imagery, we now have to deal with the integration of AR technology with ubiquitous computing where we have sensors, actuators, and processing capabilities beyond what is possible with a single AR device. The plethora of AR applications that follow from this point of view has not yet fully been investigated. In this paper, we review how in reported AR research this issue is dealt with. We survey the attempts from the AR community to integrate perception technology with AR. These attempts should be added to and integrated with augmented human and multisensorial research that nowadays is being done in the context of ubiquitous computing (Internet of Things, Ambient Intelligence, smart environments).
