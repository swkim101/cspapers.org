With the rapidly growing virtual reality (VR) technologies, maturing motion tracking applications, and the advancement in robotics, physically interacting with the remote world via a robot while the user is observing the scene through a VR headset seems to be one solution to the substantial need for telepresence. This work presents a first-person viewing hand motion controlled robotic arm framework that provides an immersive robot control experience. In particular, we developed a platform with an off-the-shelf 360° camera, a robotic arm, and a VR headset to allow for live 360° video streaming, hand tracking, and robotic arm control. Demo activities with three types of robot operation tasks (i.e., in-air drawing, object collection, and line tracing) show that our platform enables an enhanced first-person vision presence and a smooth robot teleoperation.
