Skin strain is an understudied haptic stimuli that has great potential due to its similarity to touch sensations that are commonly felt in daily life. However, up until now, applications have been focused more on smaller areas of the body, and have focused more on skin strain at an actuator level rather than a garment level. As haptics continues to grow as a field, understanding how stimuli are perceived at a micro and macro scale will be essential to producing innovative haptic products that meet a variety of user needs. This work begins an exploration of artificially produced skin strain on a larger area of the body, covering early development work on a skin strain system for the full arm. The motivation and design details are discussed, and then early work related to actuator optimization and plans for future research.
