As the Attention Economy has grown, numerous digital contents are made with the intention of capturing usersâ€™ attention and spending more of their time by the use of attractive graphics and color psychology. In this paper, we propose a novel defense strategy, called a color-wall, to block digital distraction brought on by the consumption of visually seductive and addictive digital content. When it detects that a user is viewing media or using applications unrelated to the main task, it removes colors from the screen (gray-scaling) to make them less aesthetically pleasing and directs the user away from looking at them. We implemented a mac OS software as a proof-of-concept for the color-wall and conducted user testing (N=14) to assess the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The evaluation results suggest that the color-wall is an effective strategy for reducing unwanted digital distractions such as browsing restricted content (YouTube, Twitter, etc.) while working on a PC.
