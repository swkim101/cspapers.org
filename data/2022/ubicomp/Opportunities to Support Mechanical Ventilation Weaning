Individuals with spinal cord injury or disorder (SCI/D) may experience respiratory impairment and require mechanical ventilation. A key clinical goal is to withdraw ventilator support when possible to manage the risk of secondary complications. However, mechanical ventilation weaning (MVW) trials are often a stressful experience since feelings of inability to breathe and failed weaning attempts can induce anxiety. This study aims to support patientsâ€™ more comfortable and theoretically expedited MVW process. Our findings reveal the potential for technology integration to support MVW and key challenges for implementing various technologies. Considering the design and implementation barriers within the clinical context is vital as we move toward such technology-oriented solutions.
