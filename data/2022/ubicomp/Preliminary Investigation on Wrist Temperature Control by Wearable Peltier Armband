Due to COVID-19 pandemic, body temperature measurement in commercial facilities is performed using a non-contact method. However, if the human body can be controlled in some way to disguise body temperature, a thermometer would have difficulty detecting an entrant with a fever. In this study, we propose a method to control body temperature measured at the wrist in order to demonstrate the vulnerability of temperature measurement at the wrist. Our device lowers body temperature by cooling the upper arm, thereby cooling blood flow and reducing the intensity of infrared radiation detected by a thermometer. The implemented device was used to cool the upper arm under three different conditions. The results showed that cooling the blood flow in the upper arm can lower the body temperature at the wrist. The cooled body temperature was difficult to maintain after the end of cooling, irrespective of the cooling intensity and cooling time.
