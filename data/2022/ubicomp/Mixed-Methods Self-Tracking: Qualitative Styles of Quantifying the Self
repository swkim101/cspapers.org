Self-tracking technologies face inconsistent reactions from users that range from excitement and enthusiasm to frustration and discomfort. Many of those on the latter end of this spectrum deal with complex feelings of disempowerment and objectification; they also face adverse effects from the excessive quantification of their lived experiences. Rather than serve as active agents in their process of monitoring and improving themselves, users feel reduced to docile spectators who are coerced into changing their behavior. This position paper explores the tensions in power redistribution and depersonalization present in existing self-tracking methods and contemplates on qualitative alternatives that may improve the design of future technologies, particularly in the field of learning.
