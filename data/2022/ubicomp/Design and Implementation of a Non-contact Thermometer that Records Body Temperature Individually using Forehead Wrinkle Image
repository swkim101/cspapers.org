With the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the opportunities to measure body temperature when using public facilities and to check oneâ€™s daily health condition. Standing thermometer and handheld devices have been introduced due to their non-contact features. On the other hand, the standing thermometer requires a large space for installation and the person need to move to the front of the device. In this study, we propose a non-contact thermometer that identifies individuals by acquiring images of wrinkles from a camera module and records body temperature individually. The wrinkle image is cropped and then gamma correction removal and grayscaling are applied. The images are fed into a convolutional neural network for the identification. The experiment using images obtained with a smartphone camera from 12 subjects confirmed that individuals could be identified with an average F-value of 0.94. The experiment using images obtained with the proposed device from five subjects confirmed that the identification accuracy exceeded F-value of 0.93 for all subjects.
