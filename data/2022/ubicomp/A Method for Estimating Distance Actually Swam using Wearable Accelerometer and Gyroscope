In swimming competitions, meandering is considered undesirable because rankings are determined to the nearest 0.01 second. In recent years, many swimmers practice without a coach, and such swimmers use devices to check their own swimming. While there are many swimming-related studies and devices that have been developed and marketed, to the best of the authorâ€™s knowledge, there are no devices and studies that can estimate the distance of meandering. This paper proposes a method to estimate the actual distance swum by swimmers in order to improve meandering. Although there are several methods for estimating the distance traveled, such as GPS and Bluetooth, we estimate the distance traveled using only an acceleration sensor and a gyro sensor so that the method can be used indoors. Experiments were conducted to find the optimal device wearing position and to perform actual meandering. The experimental results showed that the proposed method is most suitable when the device is attached to the waist. The actual meandering could also be estimated with an error of approximately 1m or less in most cases.
