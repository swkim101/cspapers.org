Earables are ear-worn devices that offer functionalities beyond basic audio in- and output. In this paper we present the ongoing development of a new, open-source, Arduino-based earable platform called OpenEarable. It is based on standard components, is easy to manufacture and costs roughly $40 per device at batch size ten. We present the first version of the device which is equipped with a series of sensors and actuators: a 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope, an ear canal pressure and temperature sensor, an inward facing ultrasonic microphone as well as a speaker, a push button, and a controllable LED. We demonstrate the versatility of the prototyping platform through three different example application scenarios. In sum, OpenEarable offers a general-purpose, open sensing platform for earable research and development.
