Recent advances in technologies now allow us to learn almost anything in virtual environments, be it via Internet forums or websites, telephone apps, video games, and many more. Such technology-mediated learning can be enhanced with the use of embedded nudges, i.e., devices in the architecture of choice to encourage (nudge) the users towards one choice rather than the other without limiting their freedom of choice. This paper presents an overview of how nudges can help improve knowledge acquisition, as well as a two ongoing projects. Ethical issues are also highlighted.
