Neurofeedback is a form of biofeedback in which a sensory representation of brain activity is fed back to the user in real time to facilitate an understanding of brain function and improve focus and/or attention. Researchers are increasingly using task-related EEG values in training systems for cognitive adaptive development. However, there is a notable lack of research on the means by which EEG data should be visualized to enhance the immersive quality of the experience. In the current study, we plan to qualitatively explore the impact of neurofeedback visualization schemes on the immersiveness of the VR experience. The results of this in-lab study are expected to provide important insights into the design of visualization schemes for emerging VR applications.
