Current drone delivery solutions mainly focus on single package delivery using one drone. However, the recent developments in drone technology enable a drone to deliver multiple packages in a single trip. We use the nearest destination first strategy for the faster delivery of packages in a skyway network. This demonstration is a proof-of-concept prototype for the multi-package delivery in urban airspace following a skyway network. We deploy and test this multi-package drone delivery in an indoor testbed environment using a 3D model of Sydney CBD. Demo: https://youtu.be/YTwsIfUvWPc
