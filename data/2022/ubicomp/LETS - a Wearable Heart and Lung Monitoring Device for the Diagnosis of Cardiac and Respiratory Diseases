The paper reports progress on a wearable device for real-time monitoring of a patient’s lungs and heart. Using a set of electrodes, we can measure various electrical potentials on the patient’s body, which can be used to extract valuable medical information. In addition, electrical tomography and body surface potential mapping have been used for signal analysis and image reconstruction.
