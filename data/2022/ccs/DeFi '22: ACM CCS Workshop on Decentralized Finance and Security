Powered by blockchains, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has grown to a significant economy covering exchanges, borrowing/lending, margin trading, derivatives, and more. While DeFi systems are gaining significant traction (e.g., they already manage tens of billions of dollars worth of assets), making them secure has proven exceptionally challenging---a staggering $1.9 billion was stolen in various hacks in the first seven months of 2022 alone.[4] The challenge faced by the research community is twofold. First, DeFi gives rise to new security problems (such as MEV) that existing methods cannot effectively address. Second, understanding DeFi and its security and privacy implications requires knowledge from a wide range of subjects, such as consensus, game theory, programming language, economics, politics, etc. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from many different fields to jointly advance the understanding of DeFi security and develop new methods and solutions leveraging the interdisciplinary expertise of the community.
