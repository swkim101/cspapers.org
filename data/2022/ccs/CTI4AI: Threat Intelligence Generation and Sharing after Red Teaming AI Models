As the practicality of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based techniques grow, there is an ever increasing threat of adversarial attacks. There is a need to red team this ecosystem to identify system vulnerabilities, potential threats, characterize properties that will enhance system robustness, and encourage the creation of effective defenses. A secondary need is to share this AI security threat intelligence between different stakeholders like, model developers, users, and AI/ML security professionals. In this paper, we create and describe a prototype system CTI4AI, to overcome the need to methodically identify and share AI/ML specific vulnerabilities and threat intelligence.
