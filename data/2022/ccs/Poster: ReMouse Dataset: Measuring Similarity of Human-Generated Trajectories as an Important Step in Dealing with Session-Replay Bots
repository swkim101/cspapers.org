Session-replay bots are believed to be the latest and most advanced generation of web-bots, that are also difficult challenging to defend against. Combating session-replay bots is particularly problematic in online domains that get repeatedly visited by the same genuine human user(s), and possibly in the same/similar way - such as news, banking or gaming sites. Namely, in such domains, it is difficult to determine whether two look-alike sessions are produced by the same human user or these sessions are just bot-generated session replays. In this paper we introduce and provide to the public a novel real-world mouse dynamics dataset named ReMouse. ReMouse dataset is collected in a guided environment and, unlike other publicly available mouse dynamics dataset, it contains repeat-sessions generated by the same human user(s). As such, ReMouse dataset is first of its kind and is of particular relevance for studies on the development of effective defenses against session-replay bots. Our own statistical analysis of ReMouse dataset shows that not only two different human users are highly unlikely to generate same/similar looking sessions when performing the same/similar online task, but even the (repeat) sessions generated by the same human user are likely to be sufficiently distinguishable from one another.
