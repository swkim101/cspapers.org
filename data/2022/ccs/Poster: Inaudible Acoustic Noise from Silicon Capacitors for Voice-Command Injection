Multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), commonly used in electronics products, can generate acoustic noise driven by electrical deviation. Such acoustic noise has been exploited to attack systems' security. In particular, CapSpeaker silently delivers voice commands to voice-controllable systems using inaudible acoustic noise and intermodulation distortion (IMD). Silicon capacitor is an emerging technology that achieves a larger capacitance with a smaller footprint fabricated with semiconductor manufacturing processes using different structures and materials. Do silicon capacitors still generate acoustic noise despite the differences? We positively answer the question by experimentally showing that an off-the-shelf silicon capacitor generates audible acoustic noise through IMD; CapSpeaker is still feasible with the new capacitor
