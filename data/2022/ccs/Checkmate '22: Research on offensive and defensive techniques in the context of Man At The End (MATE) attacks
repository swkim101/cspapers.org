The MATE (Man-At-The-End) model, in which an attacker has access to the target software and/or hardware environment to be exploited and the ability to observe and modify that environment, poses unique challenges for both defense and offense. The CheckMATE workshop focuses on exploration of both offensive and defensives techniques under this model. CheckMATE will provide a discussion forum for researchers and industrial practitioners that are exploring theorentical, practical, and emperical studies in this interesting area of security.
