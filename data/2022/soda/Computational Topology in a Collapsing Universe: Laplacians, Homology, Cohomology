We consider a variety of topology problems on a d -dimensional simplicial complex K given that K ⊂ X for X a collapsible simplicial complex embedded in R d +1 with known collapsing sequence. Our ﬁrst result is a solver for the linear system L 1 x = b , where L 1 is the 1-Laplacian of a simplicial complex K with dim H 1 ( K ) = 0 and K ⊂ X for X a collapsible simplicial complex embedded in R 3 with a known collapsing sequence. Our algorithm runs in ˜ O ( n log 2 ( nκ/ε )) time, where n is the total number of vertices, edges, and triangles in X , κ is the largest condition number of the two parts of the Laplacian, and ε quantiﬁes the approximation quality. This result is a generalization of Cohen et al. [SODA 2014]. The new technical piece of our Laplacian solver, in addition to the machinery described by Cohen et al., is an algorithm to compute a bounding chain of a 1-cycle within K . In addition, we describe faster algorithms for testing null-homology of ( d − 1)-cycles and null-cohomology of d -cocycles. Our algorithm runs in O ( n d ) time, where n d is the number of d -simplices in X . Finally, we describe an algorithm to compute a ( d − 1)-cohomology basis from a given ( d − 1)-homology basis for a d -simplicial complex K in O ( β d − 1 n d ) time; β d − 1 is the rank of the ( d − 1)st homology group of K . In particular, we can obtain a cohomology basis for subcomplexes of a collapsible complex X embedded in R 3 in O ( n d log n d + β d − 1 n ) time using a homology basis computed by the algorithm of Dey [SODA 2019]. For all of the problems above, if K ⊂ R 3 and the collapsible supercomplex X is
