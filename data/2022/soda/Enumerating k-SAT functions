. How many k -SAT functions on n boolean variables are there? What does a typical such function look like? Bollobás, Brightwell, and Leader conjectured that, for each ﬁxed k ≥ 2 , the number of k -SAT functions on n variables is (1+ o (1))2( nk ) + n , or equivalently: a 1 − o (1) fraction of all k -SAT functions are unate, i.e., monotone after negating some variables. They proved a weaker version of the conjecture for k = 2 . The conjecture was conﬁrmed for k = 2 by Allen and k = 3 by Ilinca and Kahn. We show that the problem of enumerating k -SAT functions is equivalent to a Turán density problem for partially directed hypergraphs. Our proof uses the hypergraph container method. Furthermore, we conﬁrm the Bollobás–Brightwell–Leader conjecture for k = 4 by solving the corresponding Turán density problem. Our solution applies a recent result of Füredi and Maleki on the minimum triangular edge density in a graph of given edge density. In an appendix (by Nitya Mani and Edward Yu), we further conﬁrm the k = 5 case of the conjecture via a brute force computer search.
