In the past few decades, Hadamard-based image restoration problems (e.g., low-light image enhancement) attract wide concerns in multiple areas related to artificial intelligence. However, existing works mostly focus on heuristically defining architecture and loss by the engineering experiences that came from extensive practices. This way brings about expensive verification costs for seeking out the optimal solution. To this end, we develop a novel hierarchical bilevel learning scheme to discover the architecture and loss simultaneously for different Hadamard-based image restoration tasks. 

 More concretely, we first establish a new Hadamard-inspired neural unit to aggregate domain knowledge into the network design. Then we model a triple-level optimization that consists of the architecture, loss and parameters optimizations to deliver a macro perspective for network learning. Then we introduce a new hierarchical bilevel learning scheme for solving the built triple-level model to progressively generate the desired architecture and loss. We also define an architecture search space consisting of a series of simple operations and an image quality-oriented loss search space. 

 Extensive experiments on three Hadamard-based image restoration tasks (including low-light image enhancement, single image haze removal and underwater image enhancement) fully verify our superiority against state-of-the-art methods.
