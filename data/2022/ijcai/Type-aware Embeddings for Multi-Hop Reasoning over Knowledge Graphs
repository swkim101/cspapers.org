Multi-hop reasoning over real-life knowledge graphs (KGs) is a highly challenging problem as traditional subgraph matching methods are not capable to deal with noise and missing information. Recently, to address this problem a promising approach based on jointly embedding logical queries and KGs into a low-dimensional space to identify answer entities has emerged. However, existing proposals ignore critical semantic knowledge inherently available in KGs, such as type information. To leverage type information, we propose a novel type-aware model, TypE-aware Message Passing (TEMP), which enhances the entity and relation representation in queries, and simultaneously improves generalization, and deductive and inductive reasoning. Remarkably, TEMP is a plug-and-play model that can be easily incorporated into existing embedding-based models to improve their performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate TEMPâ€™s effectiveness.
