In the context of probabilistic AAFs, we intro-

duce AAFs with marginal probabilities (mAAFs)

requiring only marginal probabilities of argu-

ments/attacks to be specified and not relying on the

independence assumption. Reasoning over mAAFs

requires taking into account multiple probability

distributions over the possible worlds, so that the

probability of extensions is not determined by a

unique value, but by an interval. We focus on the

problems of computing the max and min probabil-

ities of extensions over mAAFs under Dungâ€™s se-

mantics, characterize their complexity, and provide

closed formulas for polynomial cases.
