Autonomous intersection management has the potential to reduce road traffic congestion and energy consumption. To realize this potential, efficient algorithms are needed. 

However, most existing studies locally optimize one intersection at a time, and this can cause negative externalities on the traffic network as a whole.

Here, we focus on coordinating multiple intersections,

and formulate the problem as a distributed constraint optimisation problem (DCOP). We consider three utility design approaches that trade off efficiency and fairness.

Our polynomial-time algorithm for coordinating multiple intersections reduces the traffic delay by about 41 percentage points compared to independent single intersection management approaches.
