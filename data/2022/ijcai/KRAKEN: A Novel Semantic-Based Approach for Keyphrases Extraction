We propose KRAKEN, a novel approach for the extraction of keyphrases from texts. To this aim, KRAKEN makes use of distributional semantics to identify, as completely as possible, representative portions of documents, i.e. keyphrases. In addition, we define novel metrics to assess a weighted significance to the keyphrases extracted from a document, identifying the most important ones by assessing their semantic similarity with the text of the document they belong to.
