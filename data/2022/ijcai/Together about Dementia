We present ``Together about Dementia'', a mobile health app

 that aims to help persons with dementia when they get lost through

 the help of caregivers, relatives, and volunteering

 citizens. When the app detects that a person with dementia is

 disoriented, wandering, and getting lost, it triggers an alarm that

 activates a relative and possibly a volunteer in the proximity. A

 backend system based on a microservice and serverless architecture

 performs the detection of wandering and the subsequent coordination

 of users that are put on a mission to the rescue of the person with

 dementia. The backend system implements an AI technique for

 spatio-temporal anomaly detection based on location data recorded by

 the frontend system installed on the portable device of the person

 with dementia.
