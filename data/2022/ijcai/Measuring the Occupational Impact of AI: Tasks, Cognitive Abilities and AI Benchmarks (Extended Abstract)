We present a framework for analysing the impact of AI on occupations. This framework maps 59 generic tasks from different occupational datasets to 14 cognitive abilities and these to a comprehensive list of 328 AI benchmarks used to evaluate research intensity in AI. The use of cognitive abilities as an intermediate layer allows for an identification of potential AI exposure for tasks for which AI applications have not been explicitly programmed. We provide insights into the abilities through which AI is most likely to affect jobs, and we show how some of the abilities where AI research is currently very intense are linked to tasks with comparatively limited labour input in the labour markets of advanced economies.
