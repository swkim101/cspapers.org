Revision by Comparison (RbC) is a non-prioritized belief revision mechanism on epistemic states that specifies constraints on the plausibility of an input sentence via a designated reference sentence, allowing for kind of relative belief revision. In this paper, we make the strategy underlying RbC more explicit and transfer the mechanism together with its intuitive strengths to a semi-quantitative framework based on ordinal conditional functions where a more elegant implementation of RbC is possible. We furthermore show that RbC can be realized as an iterated revision by so-called weak conditionals. Finally, we point out relations of RbC to credibility-limited belief revision, illustrating the versatility of RbC for advanced belief revision operations.
