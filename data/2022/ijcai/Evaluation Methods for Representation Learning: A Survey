Representation learning enables us to automatically extract generic feature representations from a dataset to solve another machine learning task. Recently, extracted feature representations by a representation learning algorithm and a simple predictor have exhibited state-of-the-art performance on several machine learning tasks. Despite its remarkable progress, there exist various ways to evaluate representation learning algorithms depending on the application because of the flexibility of representation learning. To understand the current applications of representation learning, we review evaluation methods of representation learning algorithms. On the basis of our evaluation survey, we also discuss the future direction of representation learning. The extended version, https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08226, gives more detailed discussions and a survey on theoretical analyses.
