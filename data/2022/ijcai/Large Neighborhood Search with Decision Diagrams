Local search is a popular technique to solve combinatorial

optimization problems efficiently. To escape local minima one generally uses

metaheuristics or try to design large neighborhoods around the current best

solution. A somewhat more black box approach consists in using an

optimization solver to explore a large neighborhood. This is the

large-neighborhood search (LNS) idea that we reuse in this work. We

introduce a generic neighborhood exploration algorithm based on restricted

decision diagrams (DD) constructed from the current best

solution. We experiment DD-LNS on two sequencing problems: the

traveling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW) and a production

planning problem (DLSP). Despite its simplicity, DD-LNS is competitive with

the state-of-the-art MIP approach on DLSP. It is able to improve the

best known solutions of some standard instances for TSPTW and even to prove 

the optimality of quite a few other instances.
