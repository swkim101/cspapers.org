In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are the most critical resource but are still in short supply around the world. Therefore, efficient vaccine allocation strategies are urgently called for, especially in large-scale metropolis where uneven health risk is manifested in nearby neighborhoods. However, there exist several key challenges in solving this problem: (1) great complexity in the large scale scenario adds to the difficulty in experts' vaccine allocation decision making; (2) heterogeneous information from all aspects in the metropolis' contact network makes information utilization difficult in decision making; (3) when utilizing the strong decision-making ability of reinforcement learning (RL) to solve the problem, poor explainability limits the credibility of the RL strategies. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning enhanced experts method. We deal with the great complexity via a specially designed algorithm aggregating blocks in the metropolis into communities and we hierarchically integrate RL among the communities and experts solution within each community. We design a self-supervised contact network representation algorithm to fuse the heterogeneous information for efficient vaccine allocation decision making. We conduct extensive experiments in three metropolis with real-world data and prove that our method outperforms the best baseline, reducing 9.01% infections and 12.27% deaths.We further demonstrate the explainability of the RL model, adding to its credibility and also enlightening the experts in turn.
