With the increasing demand for the protection of personal network meta-data, encrypted networks have grown in popularity, so do the challenge of monitoring and analyzing encrypted network traffic. Currently, some deep learning-based methods have been proposed to leverage statistical features for encrypted traffic classification, which are barely affected by encryption techniques. However, these works still suffer from two main intrinsic limitations: (1) the feature extraction process lacks a mechanism to take into account correlations between flows in the flow sequence; and (2) a large volume of manually-labeled data is required for training an effective deep classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework to address these problems. To be specific, an efficient classifier with attention mechanism is proposed to extract features from flow sequences with low computational cost. Then, a Mean Teacher-style semi-supervised framework is adopted to exploit the unlabeled traffic data, where a spatiotemporal data augmentation method is designed as the key component to explore the spatial and temporal relationship within the unlabeled traffic data. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a large margin.
