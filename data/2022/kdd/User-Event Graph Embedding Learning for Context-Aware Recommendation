Most methods for context-aware recommendation focus on improving the feature interaction layer, but overlook the embedding layer. However, an embedding layer with random initialization often suffers in practice from the sparsity of the contextual features, as well as the interactions between the users (or items) and context. In this paper, we propose a novel user-event graph embedding learning (UEG-EL) framework to address these two sparsity challenges. Specifically, our UEG-EL contains three modules: 1) a graph construction module is used to obtain a user-event graph containing nodes for users, intents and items, where the intent nodes are generated by applying intent node attention (INA) on nodes of the contextual features; 2) a user-event collaborative graph convolution module is designed to obtain the refined embeddings of all features by executing a new convolution strategy on the user-event graph, where each intent node acts as a hub to efficiently propagate the information among different features; 3) a recommendation module is equipped to integrate some existing context-aware recommendation model, where the feature embeddings are directly initialized with the obtained refined embeddings. Moreover, we identify a unique challenge of the basic framework, that is, the contextual features associated with too many instances may suffer from noise when aggregating the information. We thus further propose a simple but effective variant, i.e., UEG-EL-V, in order to prune the information propagation of the contextual features. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our UEG-EL and its variant.
