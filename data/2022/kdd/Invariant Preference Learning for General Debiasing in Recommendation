Current recommender systems have achieved great successes in online services, such as E-commerce and social media. However, they still suffer from the performance degradation in real scenarios, because various biases always occur in the generation process of user behaviors. Despite the recent development of addressing some specific type of bias, a variety of data bias, some of which are even unknown, are often mixed up in real applications. Although the uniform (or unbiased) data may help for the purpose of general debiasing, such data can either be hardly available or induce high experimental cost. In this paper, we consider a more practical setting where we aim to conduct general debiasing with the biased observational data alone. We assume that the observational user behaviors are determined by invariant preference (i.e. a user's true preference) and the variant preference (affected by some unobserved confounders). We propose a novel recommendation framework called InvPref which iteratively decomposes the invariant preference and variant preference from biased observational user behaviors by estimating heterogeneous environments corresponding to different types of latent bias. Extensive experiments, including the settings of general debiasing and specific debiasing, verify the advantages of our method.
