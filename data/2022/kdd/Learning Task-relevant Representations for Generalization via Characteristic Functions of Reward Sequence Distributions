Generalization across different environments with the same tasks is critical for successful applications of visual reinforcement learning (RL) in real scenarios. However, visual distractions---which are common in real scenes---from high-dimensional observations can be hurtful to the learned representations in visual RL, thus degrading the performance of generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach, namely Characteristic Reward Sequence Prediction (CRESP), to extract the task-relevant information by learning reward sequence distributions (RSDs), as the reward signals are task-relevant in RL and invariant to visual distractions. Specifically, to effectively capture the task-relevant information via RSDs, CRESP introduces an auxiliary task---that is, predicting the characteristic functions of RSDs---to learn task-relevant representations, because we can well approximate the high-dimensional distributions by leveraging the corresponding characteristic functions. Experiments demonstrate that CRESP significantly improves the performance of generalization on unseen environments, outperforming several state-of-the-arts on DeepMind Control tasks with different visual distractions.
