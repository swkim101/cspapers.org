Human daily activities, such as working, eating out, and traveling, play an essential role in contact tracing and modeling the diffusion patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, individual-level activity data collected from real scenarios are highly limited due to privacy issues and commercial concerns. In this paper, we present a novel framework based on generative adversarial imitation learning, to generate artificial activity trajectories that retain both the fidelity and utility of the real-world data. To tackle the inherent randomness and sparsity of irregular-sampled activities, we innovatively capture the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying trajectories by leveraging neural differential equations. We incorporate the dynamics of continuous flow between consecutive activities and instantaneous updates at observed activity points in temporal evolution and spatial transformation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that our proposed framework achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of improving the data fidelity and data utility in facilitating practical applications. Moreover, we apply the synthetic data to model the COVID-19 spreading, and it achieves better performance by reducing the simulation MAPE over the baseline by more than 50%.
