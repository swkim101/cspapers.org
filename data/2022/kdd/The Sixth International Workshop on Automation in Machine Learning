The Sixth International Workshop on Automation in Machine Learning aims to identify opportunities and challenges for automation in machine learning, to provide an opportunity for researchers to discuss best practices for automation in machine learning potentially leading to definition of standards, and to provide a forum for researchers to speak out and debate on different ideas in automation in machine learning. The workshop agenda includes four invited keynote speakers and four accepted paper presentations chosen from a peer review process. The workshop seeks to drive engaging and interactive exchange of thoughts and ideas on AutoML.
