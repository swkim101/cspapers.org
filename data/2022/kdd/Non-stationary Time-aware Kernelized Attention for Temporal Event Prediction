Modeling sequential data is essential to many applications such as natural language processing, recommendation systems, time series predictions, anomaly detection, etc. When processing sequential data, one of the critical issues is how to capture the temporal-correlation among events. Though prevalent and effective in many applications, conventional approaches such as RNNs and Transformers, struggle with handling the non-stationary characteristics (i.e., such temporal-correlation among events would change over time), which is indeed encountered in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a non-stationary time-aware kernelized attention approach for input sequences of neural networks. By constructing the Generalized Spectral Mixture Kernel (GSMK), and integrating it to the attention mechanism, we mathematically reveal its representation capability in terms of the time-dependent temporal-correlation. Following that, a novel neural network structure is proposed, which would enable us to encode both stationary and non-stationary time event series. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on both synthetic data which presents the theoretical insights, and a variety of real-world datasets which shows its competitive performance against related work.
