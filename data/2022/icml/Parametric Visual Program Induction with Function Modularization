Generating programs to describe visual observations has gained much research attention recently. However, most of the existing approaches are based on non-parametric primitive functions, making them unable to handle complex visual scenes involving many attributes and details. In this paper, we propose the concept of parametric visual program induction. Learning to generate parametric programs for visual scenes is challenging due to the huge number of function variants and the complex function correlations. To solve these challenges, we propose the method of function modularization, capable of dealing with numerous function variants and complex correlations. Specifically, we model each parametric function as a multi-head self-contained neural module to cover different function variants. Moreover, to eliminate the complex correlations between functions, we propose the hierarchical heterogeneous Monto-Carlo tree search (H2MCTS) algorithm which can provide high-quality uncorrelated supervision during training, and serve as an efficient searching technique during testing. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on three visual program induction datasets involving parametric primitive functions. Experimental results show that our proposed model is able to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art base-line methods in terms of generating accurate programs.
