Caches have been used to construct various types of covert and side channels to leak information. Most existing cache channels exploit the timing difference between cache hits and cache misses. However, we introduce a new and broader classification of cache covert channel attacks: Hit+Miss, Hit+Hit, and Miss+Miss. We highlight that cache misses (or cache hits) for cache lines in different states may have more significant time differences, and these can be used as timing channels. Based on this classification, we propose a new stable and stealthy Miss+Miss cache channel. Write-back caches are widely deployed in modern processors. This paper presents in detail a way in which replacement latency differences can be used to construct timing-based channels (called WB channels) to leak information in a write-back cache. Any modification to a cache line by a sender will set it to the dirty state, and the receiver can observe this through measuring the latency of replacing this cache set. We also demonstrate how senders could exploit a different number of dirty cache lines in a cache set to improve transmission bandwidth with symbols encoding multiple bits. The peak transmission bandwidths of the WB channels in commercial systems can vary between 1300 and 4400 kbps per cache set in a hyper-threaded setting without shared memory between the sender and the receiver. In contrast to most existing cache channels, which always target specific memory addresses, the new WB channels focus on the cache set and cache line states, making it difficult for the channel to be disturbed by other processes on the core, and they can still work in a cache using a random replacement policy. We also analyzed the stealthiness of WB channels from the perspective of the number of cache loads and cache miss rates. We discuss and evaluate possible defenses. The paper finishes by discussing various forms of side-channel attack.
