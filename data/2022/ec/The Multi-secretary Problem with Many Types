The secretary problems are of types of the optimal stopping theory problems and are also distinguished as well known problems in applied probability, statistics and decision theory fields. The importance of these kinds of problems defines many new conditions which have been discussed till now. The significance of these types of problems in social issues causes to define many conditions which are vastly discussed. In this paper, a new condition of this problem is considered. These conditions which have been performed using a real time method are based on Multi-Agent Systems techniques. In this paper, after evaluating this method, the resulted answers are examined using Multi-Agent system techniques.
