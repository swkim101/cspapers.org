What a person chooses to share on social media can be very telling as to what their personality is. A person can show their personality through how many photos they post, what kinds of photos they post, and what kind of language they tend to use. This research investigates the correlation between a person's personality type and the photos and tweets which that person posts. Social media information and personality types were collected from two different platforms, SONA (college-age students) and MTurk (crowdsourcing platform). The same survey was given to both platforms. Participants answered questions pertaining to their personality, and based on these answers were assigned a True Color and scores for Big Five. Our results show that people who identified with the green True Color self schema tended to share more photos than the other True Color categories. Additionally, our results show that people with Open personality types tend to post more photos than other Big Five personality types, and those photos tend to have more people in them than other personality types.
