Nakamoto introduced a mechanism for leader election via proof of work, and allowed this dealer to speak once. In this setting parties do not have inputs and they output a value which they calculated. Jing and Micali took this idea a step further and showed that Byzantine agreement, a function where parties have inputs but no private information, can be reached in a setting where each party speaks only once. This was achieved by introducing the notion of player replaceability. In our recent works we have shown that any function, including those where parties have secret inputs, can be computed in the YOSO (you only speak once) model.
