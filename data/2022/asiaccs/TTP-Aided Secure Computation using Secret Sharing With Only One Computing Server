Secure computation methods include methods that use homomorphic encryption (HE) and those that use secret sharing (SS). Secure computation based on HE can be realized using one server, and the computation process can be made public if the encryption key is kept secure. However, HE generally requires a substantial computation cost. In contrast, SS has the advantage of low computation cost, allowing for high-speed processing; however, all servers must be managed independently. And the process of k or more servers cannot be disclosed. In particular, secret input will be leaked when the same organization manages multiple servers to implement SS. Therefore, a complex model where each server is independently managed is required. Iwamura et al. proposed a secure computation that is information-theoretic secure in n≥k instead of n≥2k−1 by assuming a trusted third party (TTP). In this paper, by making more effective use of a TTP, we demonstrate that secure computation based on SS is possible with only one computing server. Moreover, we show that the entire computation process can be disclosed if the key is managed safely. We realize a method that solves the disadvantages of conventional approaches with a faster computation than those methods.
