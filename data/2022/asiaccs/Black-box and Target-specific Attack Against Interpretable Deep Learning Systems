Deep neural network models are susceptible to malicious manipulations even in the black-box settings. Providing explanations for DNN models offers a sense of security by human involvement, which reveals whether the sample is benign or adversarial even though previous studies achieved a high attack success rate. However, interpretable deep learning systems (IDLSes) are shown to be susceptible to adversarial manipulations in white-box settings. Attacking IDLSes in black-box settings is challenging and remains an open research domain. In this work, we propose a black-box version of the white-box AdvEdge approach against IDLSes, which is query-efficient and gradient-free without obtaining any knowledge of the target DNN model and its coupled interpreter. Our approach takes advantage of transfer-based and score-based techniques using the effective microbial genetic algorithm (MGA). We achieve a high attack success rate with a small number of queries and high similarity in interpretations between adversarial and benign samples.
