In this paper, we argue that energy-based sequence models backed by expressive parametric families can result in uncomputable and inapproximable partition functions. Among other things, this makes model selection — and therefore learning model parameters — not only diﬃcult, but generally undecidable . The reason is that there are no good deterministic or randomized estimators of partition functions. Speciﬁcally, we exhibit a pathological example where under common assumptions, no useful importance sampling estimators of the partition function can guarantee to have variance bounded below a rational number. As alternatives, we consider sequence model families whose partition functions are computable (if they exist), but at the cost of reduced expressiveness. Our theoretical results suggest that statistical procedures with asymptotic guarantees and sheer (but ﬁnite) amounts of compute are not the only things that make sequence modeling work; computability concerns must not be neglected as we consider more expressive model parametrizations.
