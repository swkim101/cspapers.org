The goal of dynamic scene deblurring is to remove the motion blur in a given image. Typical learning-based approaches implement their solutions by minimizing the L1 or L2 distance between the output and the reference sharp image. Recent attempts adopt visual recognition features in training to improve the perceptual quality. However, those features are primarily designed to capture high-level contexts rather than low-level structures such as blurriness. Instead, we propose a more direct way to make images sharper by exploiting the inverse task of deblurring, namely, reblurring. Reblurring amplifies the remaining blur to rebuild the original blur, however, a well-deblurred clean image with zero-magnitude blur is hard to reblur. Thus, we design two types of reblurring loss functions for better deblurring. The supervised reblurring loss at training stage compares the amplified blur between the deblurred and the sharp images. The self-supervised reblurring loss at inference stage inspects if there noticeable blur remains in the deblurred. Our experimental results on large-scale benchmarks and real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the reblurring losses in improving the perceptual quality of the deblurred images in terms of NIQE and LPIPS scores as well as visual sharpness.
