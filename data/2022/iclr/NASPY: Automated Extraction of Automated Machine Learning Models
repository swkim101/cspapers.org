We present NASPY , an end-to-end adversarial framework to extract the network architecture of deep learning models generated by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Existing model extraction attacks mainly focus on conventional DNN models with very simple operations, or require heavy manual analysis with lots of prior knowledge. In contrast, NASPY introduces seq2seq models to automatically identify novel and complicated operations (e.g., separable convolution, dilated convolution) from hardware side-channel sequences of model inference. We design two models (RNN-CTC and transformer), which can achieve only 3.2% and 11.3% error rates for operation prediction. We further present methods to recover the model hyper-parameters and topology from the operation sequence. With these techniques, NASPY is able to extract the complete NAS model architecture with high fidelity and automation, which are rarely analyzed before.
