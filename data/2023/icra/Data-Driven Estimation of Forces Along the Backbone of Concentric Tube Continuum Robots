Concentric tube continuum robots (CTCRs) belong to the family of continuum robots with applications in minimally invasive surgeries. Because of this application domain, measuring the external forces along the body of the robot is paramount. CTCRs are made up of thin elastic rods and are intended to be applied inside the human body, where conventional sensor-based measurements are not feasible. Consequently, research is resorting to estimate the forces through geometric, numeric, or optimization methods. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven approach for estimating contact forces along the body of a CTCR that offers an estimation precision comparable to the current state-of-the-art optimization-based approaches, but exhibits nearly two orders of magnitude faster convergence. The proposed method is scalable and exhibits a significant performance in response to a wide range of external forces. The approach was evaluated in simulations and on a real 2-tube CTCR.
