The Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem has been widely studied in both computer vision and photogrammetry societies. With the development of feature extraction techniques, a large number of feature points might be available in a single shot. It is promising to devise a consistent estimator, i.e., the estimate can converge to the true camera pose as the number of points increases. To this end, we propose a consistent PnP solver, named CPnP, with bias elimination. Specifically, linear equations are constructed from the original projection model via measurement model modification and variable elimination, based on which a closed-form least-squares solution is obtained. We then analyze and subtract the asymptotic bias of this solution, resulting in a consistent estimate. Additionally, Gauss-Newton (GN) iterations are executed to refine the consistent solution. Our proposed estimator is efficient in terms of computationsâ€”it has $O(n)$ time complexity. Simulations and real dataset tests show that our proposed estimator is superior to some well-known ones for images with dense visual features, in terms of estimation precision and computing time.
