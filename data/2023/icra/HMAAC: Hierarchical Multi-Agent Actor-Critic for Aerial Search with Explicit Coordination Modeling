Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become prevalent in Search-And-Rescue (SAR) missions. However, existing solutions to the control and coordination of UAV s are mostly limited to specific environments and are not robust to handle unreliable/unstable communications. To deal with these challenges, Hierarchical Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (HMAAC) framework is proposed where a high-level policy is placed on top of individual low-level actor-critic policies to relax the inter-dependency among the agents. The low-level policies are considered conditionally independent given the coordination action, which is generated by the high-level policy. A Central-ized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) would not work because it cannot be assumed that communication is always perfect during training and that the whole system can rely on stable communications during deployment. The proposed framework is evaluated in AirSim, a realistic multi-UAV simula-tor, and is compared against two existing algorithms, i.e., Multi- Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) and decentralized REINFORCE, in two scenarios, (a) when packet drop is modeled as a Bernoulli process and (b) when shadow zones are created in the search space and communication will be lost if the agents are in these zones. Results show that HMAAC is scalable and robust to unreliable communication and outperforms the other algorithms in terms of exploration and coordination when the number of agents is large and communications are not stable.
