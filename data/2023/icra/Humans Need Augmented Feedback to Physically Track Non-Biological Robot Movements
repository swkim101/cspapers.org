An important component for the effective collaboration of humans with robots is the compatibility of their movements, especially when humans physically collaborate with a robot partner. Following previous findings that humans interact more seamlessly with a robot that moves with human-like or biological velocity profiles, this study examined whether humans can adapt to a robot that violates human signatures. The specific focus was on the role of extensive practice and real-time augmented feedback. Six groups of participants physically tracked a robot tracing an ellipse with profiles where velocity scaled with the curvature of the path in biological and non-biological ways, while instructed to minimize the interaction force with the robot. Three of the 6 groups received real-time visual feedback about their force error. Results showed that with 3 daily practice sessions, when given feedback about their force errors, humans could decrease their interaction forces when the robot's trajectory violated human-like velocity patterns. Conversely, when augmented feedback was not provided, there were no improvements despite this extensive practice. The biological profile showed no improvements, even with feedback, indicating that the (non-zero) force had already reached a floor level. These findings highlight the importance of biological robot trajectories and augmented feedback to guide humans to adapt to non-biological movements in physical human-robot interaction. These results have implications on various fields of robotics, such as surgical applications and collaborative robots for industry.
