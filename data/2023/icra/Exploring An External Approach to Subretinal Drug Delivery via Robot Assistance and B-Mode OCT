Injections into specific retinal layers of the eye present a serious challenge to surgeons in terms of accuracy and perception. The emergence of new gene therapies further emphasizes the need for effective tools for localized drug delivery. Unlike the dominant approach of delivering drugs via a transvitreal intraocular pathway, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of delivering injections into the space between the choroid and the retina using an external approach. The design of a cooperative robotic system for enabling robot-assisted extraocular subretinal injections is presented. The system uses a distal micromanipulator that can serve as a hand-held tool for OCT-aided injection or attach to a six degree of freedom (DOF) serial robot arm for cooperative manipulation. The kinematics and control of the robot for constrained cooperative control motions to enable safe needle injection is presented and experimentally evaluated. These results suggest that the proposed external drug delivery approach is feasible, thereby enabling the advantages of preserving the integrity of the retina and omitting the necessity for vitrectomy.
