Applications of rolling diaphragm transmissions for medical and teleoperated robotics are of great interest, due to the low friction of rolling diaphragms combined with the power density and stiffness of hydraulic transmissions. However, the stiffness-enabling pressure preloads can form a tradeoff against bearing loading in some rolling diaphragm layouts, and transmission setup can be difficult. Utilization of cable drives compliment the rolling diaphragm transmission's advantages, but maintaining cable tension is crucial for optimal and consistent performance. In this paper, a coaxial opposed rolling diaphragm layout with cable drive and an electronic transmission control system are investigated, with a focus on system reliability and scalability. Mechanical features are proposed which enable force balancing, decoupling of transmission pressure from bearing loads, and maintenance of cable tension. Key considerations and procedures for automation of transmission setup, phasing, and operation are also presented. We also present an analysis of system stiffness to identify key compliance contributors, and conduct experiments to validate prototype design performance.
