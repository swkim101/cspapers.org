In this paper, we present a fully distributed framework for multiple quadruped robots in environments with obstacles. Our approach utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) and multi-robot consensus protocol to obtain the distributed control law. It ensures that all the robots are able to avoid obstacles, navigate to the desired positions, and meanwhile synchronize the gaits. In particular, via MPC and consensus, the robots compute the optimal trajectory and the contact profile of the legs. Then an MPC-based locomotion controller is implemented to achieve the gait, stabilize the locomotion and track the desired trajectory. We present experiments in simulation and with three real quadruped robots in an environment with a static obstacle.
