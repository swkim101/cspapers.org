To achieve safe cooperative driving in mixed traffic of manned and unmanned vehicles, it is necessary to understand and model human drivers' driving behaviors. This paper proposed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based method to analyze human driver's control and vehicle's dynamics; and then recognize the human driver's action, such as accelerating, braking, and changing lanes. With the knowledge of the human driver's actions, a probability model is used to predict the human-driven vehicle's acceleration. Such information on the driver behavior and the vehicle behavior can be used to achieve safer cooperative driving, which is realized using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and model predictive control (MPC). The proposed method was tested and evaluated in our custom-built cooperative driving testbed. Experimental results show that the above driver action model is effective and accurate. A preliminary case study on a lane merging scenario is provided to further validate its effectiveness and capability.
