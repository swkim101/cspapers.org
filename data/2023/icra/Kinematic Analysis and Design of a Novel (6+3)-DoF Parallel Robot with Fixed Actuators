A novel kinematically redundant ($6+3$) -DoF parallel robot is presented in this paper. Three identical 3-DoF RU/2-RUS legs are attached to a configurable platform through spherical joints. With the selected leg mechanism, the motors are mounted at the base, reducing the reflected inertia. The robot is intended to be actuated with direct-drive motors in order to perform intuitive physical human-robot interaction. The design of the leg mechanism maximizes the workspace in which the end-effector of the leg can have a 2g acceleration in all directions. All singularities of the leg mechanism are identified under a simplifying assumption. A CAD model of the (6+3)-DoF robot is presented in order to illustrate the preliminary design of the robot.
