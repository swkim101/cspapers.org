Effective task allocation is an essential component to the coordination of heterogeneous robots. This paper proposes a hybrid task allocation algorithm that improves upon given initial solutions, for example from the popular decentralized market-based allocation algorithm, via a derivative-free optimization strategy called Speeding-Up and Slowing-Down (SUSD). Based on the initial solutions, SUSD performs a search to find an improved task assignment. Unique to our strategy is the ability to apply a gradient-like search to solve a classical integer-programming problem. The proposed strategy outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of total task utility and can achieve near optimal solutions in simulation. Experimental results using the Robotarium are also provided.
