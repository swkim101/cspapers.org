This paper presents a collaborative control method based on payload-leading for the multi-quadrotor transportation systems. The goal is to keep the relative distance between the quadrotors and the payload as constant as possible during the transportation, so as to ensure the stable attitude of the payload. The control mechanism consists of a guidance control law that generates the common desired velocity for the quadrotors, an internal feedback controller for each quadrotor, and a decentralized formation controller. The stability of the control structure is proved by Lyapunov theory. Finally, the experimental platform of the multi-quadrotor transportation system is built to verify the effectiveness of the control method. Experimental results show that the proposed method has an excellent control effect.
