This paper proposes a real-time model predictive control (MPC) strategy for accomplishing multiple tasks using robots within a finite-time horizon. In industrial robotic applications, it is crucial to consider various constraints to ensure that joint position, velocity, and torque limits are not exceeded. In addition, singularity-free and smooth motions require executing tasks continuously and safely. Instead of formulating nonlinear MPC problems, we devise linear MPC problems using kinematic and dynamic models linearized along nominal trajectories produced by hierarchical controllers. These linear MPC problems are solvable via the use of Quadratic Pro-gramming; therefore, we significantly reduce the computation time of the proposed MPC framework so the resulting update frequency is higher than 1 kHz. Our proposed MPC framework is more efficient in reducing task tracking errors than a baseline based on operational space control (OSC). We validate our approach in numerical simulations and in real experiments using an industrial manipulator. More specifically, we deploy our method in two practical scenarios for robotic logistics: 1) controlling a robot carrying heavy payloads while accounting for torque limits, and 2) controlling the end-effector while avoiding singularities.
