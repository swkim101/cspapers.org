The arising application of neural networks (NN) in robotic systems has driven the development of safety verification methods for neural network dynamical systems (NNDS). Recursive techniques for reachability analysis of dynamical systems in closed-loop with a NN controller, planner or perception can over-approximate the reachable sets of the NNDS by bounding the outputs of the NN and propagating these NN output bounds forward. However, this recursive reachability analysis may suffer from compounding errors, rapidly becoming overly conservative over a longer horizon. In this work, we prove that an alternative one-shot reachability analysis framework which directly verifies the unrolled NNDS can significantly mitigate the compounding errors, enabling the use of the rolling horizon as a design parameter for verification purposes. We characterize the performance gap between the recursive and one-shot frameworks for NNDS with general computational graphs. The applicability of one-shot analysis is demonstrated through numerical examples on a cart-pole system.
