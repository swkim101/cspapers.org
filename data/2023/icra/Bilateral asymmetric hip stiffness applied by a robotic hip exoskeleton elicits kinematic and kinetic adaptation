Wearable robotic exoskeletons hold great promise for gait rehabilitation as portable, accessible tools. However, a better understanding of the potential for exoskeletons to elicit neural adaptation—a critical component of neurological gait rehabilitation—is needed. In this study, we investigated whether humans adapt to bilateral asymmetric stiffness perturbations applied by a hip exoskeleton, taking inspiration from asymmetry augmentation strategies used in split-belt treadmill training. During walking, we applied torques about the hip joints to repel the thigh away from a neutral position on the left side and attract the thigh toward a neutral position on the right side. Six participants performed an adaptation walking trial on a treadmill while wearing the exoskeleton. The exoskeleton elicited time-varying changes and aftereffects in step length and propulsive/braking ground reaction forces, indicating behavioral signatures of neural adaptation. These responses resemble typical responses to split-belt treadmill training, suggesting that the proposed intervention with a robotic hip exoskeleton may be an effective approach to (re)training symmetric gait.
