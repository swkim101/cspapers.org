Human-robot collaborative disassembly is an emerging trend in the sustainable recycling process of electronic and mechanical products. It requires the use of advanced technologies to assist workers in repetitive physical tasks and deal with creaky and potentially damaged components. Nevertheless, when disassembling worn-out or damaged components, unexpected robot behaviors may emerge, so harmless and symbiotic physical interaction with humans and the environment becomes paramount. This work addresses this challenge at the control level by ensuring safe and passive behaviors in unplanned interactions and contact losses. The proposed algorithm capitalizes on an energy-aware Cartesian impedance controller, which features energy scaling and damping injection, and an augmented energy tank, which limits the power flow from the controller to the robot. The controller is evaluated in a real-world flawed unscrewing task with a Franka Emika Panda and is compared to a standard impedance controller and a hybrid force-impedance controller. The results demonstrate the high potential of the algorithm in human-robot collaborative disassembly tasks.
