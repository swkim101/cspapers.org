In this work, we address a visbility-based target tracking problem in a polygonal environment in which a group of mobile observers try to maintain a line-of-sight with a mobile intruder. We build a bridge between data mining and visibility-based tracking using a novel tiling scheme for the polygon. First, we propose a tracking strategy for a team of guards located on the tiles to dynamically track an intruder when complete coverage of the polygon cannot be ensured. Next, we propose a novel variant of the Voronoi Diagram to construct navigation strategies for a team of co-located guards to track an intruder from any initial position in the environment. We present empirical analysis to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed tiling scheme. Simulations and testbed demonstrations are present in a video attachment.
