Accurately estimating the shape of objects in dense clutters makes important contribution to robotic packing, because the optimal object arrangement requires the robot planner to acquire shape information of all existed objects. However, the objects for packing are usually piled in dense clutters with severe occlusion, and the object shape varies significantly across different instances for the same category. They respectively cause large object segmentation errors and inaccurate shape recovery on unseen instances, which both degrade the performance of shape estimation during deployment. In this paper, we propose a category-level shape estimation method for densely cluttered objects. Our framework partitions each object in the clutter via the multi-view visual information fusion to achieve high segmentation accuracy, and the instance shape is recovered by deforming the category templates with diverse geometric transformations to obtain strengthened generalization ability. Specifically, we first collect the multi-view RGB-D images of the object clutters for point cloud reconstruction. Then we fuse the feature maps representing the visual information of multi-view RGB images and the pixel affinity learned from the clutter point cloud, where the acquired instance segmentation masks of multi-view RGB images are projected to partition the clutter point cloud. Finally, the instance geometry information is obtained from the partially observed instance point cloud and the corresponding category template, and the deformation parameters regarding the template are predicted for shape estimation. Experiments in the simulated environment and real world show that our method achieves high shape estimation accuracy for densely cluttered everyday objects with various shapes.
