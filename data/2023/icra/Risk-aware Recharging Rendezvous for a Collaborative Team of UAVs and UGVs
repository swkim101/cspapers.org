We introduce and investigate the recharging rendezvous problem for a collaborative team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), in which UAVs with limited battery capacity and UGVS persistently monitor an area. The UGVs also act as mobile recharging stations for the UAVs. In contrast to prior work on such problems, we consider the challenge of dealing with stochastic energy consumption in a risk-aware fashion. Specifically, we consider a bi-criteria optimization problem of minimizing the time taken by the UAVs on recharging detours while ensuring that the probability that no UAV runs out of charge is greater than a user-defined risk tolerance. This problem (termed Risk-aware Recharging Rendezvous Problem (RRRP)) is a combinatorial problem with a matching constraint — to ensure UAVs are assigned to the limited UGV recharging slots, and a knapsack constraint — to capture the risk tolerance. We propose a novel bicriteria approximation algorithm to solve RRRP and demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of a persistent monitoring mission compared to baseline methods.
