We present SIERRA, a novel framework for accelerating development and improving reproducibility of results in robotics research. SIERRA accelerates research by automating the process of generating experiments from queries over independent variables, executing experiments, and processing the results to generate deliverables such as graphs and videos. It shifts the paradigm for testing hypotheses from procedural (“Do these steps to answer the query”) to declarative (“Here is the query to test—GO!”), reducing the burden on researchers. It employs a modular architecture enabling easy customization and extension for the needs of individual researchers, thereby eliminating manual configuration and processing via throw-away scripts. SIERRA improves reproducibility of research by providing automation independent of the execution environment (HPC hardware, real robots, etc.) and targeted platform (simulator, real robots, etc.). This enables exact experiment replication, up to the limit of the execution environment and platform, as well as making it easy for researchers to test hypotheses in different computational environments. Though SIERRA is targeted at robotics research, its design makes it extendable to other fields.
