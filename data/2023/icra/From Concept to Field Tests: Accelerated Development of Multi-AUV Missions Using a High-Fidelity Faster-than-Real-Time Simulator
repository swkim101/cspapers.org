We designed and validated a novel simulator for efficient development of multi-robot marine missions. To accelerate development of cooperative behaviors, the simulator models the robots' operating conditions with moderately high fidelity and runs significantly faster than real time, including acoustic communications, dynamic environmental data, and high-resolution bathymetry in large worlds. The simulator's ability to exceed a real-time factor (RTF) of 100 has been stress-tested with a robust continuous integration suite and was used to develop a multi-robot field experiment.
