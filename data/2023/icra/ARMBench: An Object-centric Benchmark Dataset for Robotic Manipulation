This paper introduces Amazon Robotic Manipulation Benchmark (ARMBench), a large-scale, object-centric benchmark dataset for robotic manipulation in the context of a warehouse. Automation of operations in modern warehouses requires a robotic manipulator to deal with a wide variety of objects, unstructured storage, and dynamically changing inventory. Such settings pose challenges in perceiving the identity, physical characteristics, and state of objects during manipulation. Existing datasets for robotic manipulation consider a limited set of objects or utilize 3D models to generate synthetic scenes with limitation in capturing the variety of object properties, clutter, and interactions. We present a large-scale dataset collected in an Amazon warehouse using a robotic manipulator performing object singulation from containers with heterogeneous contents. ARMBench contains images, videos, and metadata that corresponds to 235K+ pick-and-place activities on 190K+ unique objects. The data is captured at different stages of manipulation, i.e., pre-pick, during transfer, and after placement. Benchmark tasks are proposed by virtue of high-quality annotations and baseline performance evaluation are presented on three visual perception challenges, namely 1) object segmentation in clutter, 2) object identification, and 3) defect detection.
