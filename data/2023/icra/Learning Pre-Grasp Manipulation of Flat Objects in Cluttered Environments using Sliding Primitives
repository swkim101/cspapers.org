Flat objects with negligible thicknesses like books and disks are challenging to be grasped by the robot because of the width limit of the robot's gripper, especially when they are in cluttered environments. Pre-grasp manipulation is conducive to rearranging objects on the table and moving the flat objects to the table edge, making them graspable. In this paper, we formulate this task as Parameterized Action Markov Decision Process, and a novel method based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to address this problem by introducing sliding primitives as actions. A weight-sharing policy network is utilized to predict the sliding primitive's parameters for each object, and a Q-network is adopted to select the acted object among all the candidates on the table. Meanwhile, via integrating a curriculum learning scheme, our method can be scaled to cluttered environments with more objects. In both simulation and real-world experiments, our method surpasses the existing methods and achieves pre-grasp manipulation with higher task success rates and fewer action steps. Without fine-tuning, it can be generalized to novel shapes and household objects with more than 85% success rates in the real world.
