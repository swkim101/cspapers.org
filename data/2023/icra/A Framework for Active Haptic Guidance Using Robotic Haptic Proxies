Haptic feedback is an important component of creating an immersive mixed reality experience. Traditionally, haptic forces are rendered in response to the user's interactions with the virtual environment. In this work, we explore the idea of rendering haptic forces in a proactive manner, with the explicit intention to influence the user's behavior through compelling haptic forces. To this end, we present a framework for active haptic guidance in mixed reality, using one or more robotic haptic proxies to influence user behavior and deliver a safer and more immersive virtual experience. We provide details on common challenges that need to be overcome when implementing active haptic guidance, and discuss example applications that show how active haptic guidance can be used to influence the user's behavior. Finally, we apply active haptic guidance to a virtual reality navigation problem, and conduct a user study that demonstrates how active haptic guidance creates a safer and more immersive experience for users.
