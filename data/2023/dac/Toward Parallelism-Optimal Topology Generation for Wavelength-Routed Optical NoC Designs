The wavelength-routed optical network-on-chip (WRONoC) emerges as a promising solution for multi-core system communication, providing high-bandwidth, high-speed, and low-power transmission. As the number of cores in a WRONoC increases, however, some WRONoC topologies could be infeasible with bandwidth and crosstalk constraints if bit-level parallelism is not considered during topology generation. Previous work optimized the parallelism only for the radius selection of microring resonators but not for topology generation. To remedy this drawback, we present a parallelism-aware WRONoC topology generation flow. The proposed flow guarantees to generate a parallelism-optimal topology for full connectivity; and a parallelism-optimal topology for customized connectivity if the netlist meets certain conditions. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show a 67.5% improvement in parallelism.
