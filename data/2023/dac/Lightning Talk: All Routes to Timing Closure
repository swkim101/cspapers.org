Timing analysis and optimization is essential for each stage throughout the entire design flow to achieve timing closure. This talk provides a retrospective and prospective study to highlight two categories of emerging timing challenges: 1) analysis efficiency and scalability, and 2) advanced process effect on timing. We survey recent advances for handling these challenges and provide future research directions in timing.
