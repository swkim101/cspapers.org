In-storage Near-Data Processing (NDP) architectures can reduce data movement between the host and the storage device by offloading computing tasks to the storage. This encourages many studies on building NDP applications, such as recommendation systems and databases, on computational SSDs. However, in the data path of existing NDP architectures, an NDP application has to find out the address of the requested file data by calling the I/O stacks of the kernel on the host, which incurs large overhead for transferring data between the host and the computational SSD. In this paper, we present File Semantics Retriever (FSR) to optimize the data path of NDP architectures by locating and fetching the requested file data directly in the computational SSD. The key idea is to recognize the file system layout and the metadata structures in the storage with the collaboration of a user-space library and a handler in the firmware of the computational SSD. We implement a prototype of FSR and evaluate it on the Cosmos plus OpenSSD, a widely-used computational SSD platform. The experimental results show that FSR outperforms existing NDP architectures in both benchmarks and real-world NDP applications.
