The Deep Learning Processor (DPU) programmable engine released by the official Xilinx Vitis AI toolchain has become one of the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) inference on Xilinx FPGAs. While modern FPGA devices generally have enough hardware resources to accommodate multi-DPUs simultaneously, the Xilinx toolchain currently only supports the deployment of multiple homogeneous DPUs engines that running independent inference tasks (task-level parallelism). In this work, we demonstrate that deployment of multiple heterogeneous DPU engines makes better resource efficiency for a given FPGA device. Moreover, we show that pipelined execution of a CNN inference task over heterogeneous multi-DPU engines may further improve overall inference throughput with carefully designed CNN layers-to-DPU mapping and scheduling. Finally, for a given CNN model and an FPGA device, we propose a comprehensive framework that automatically determines the optimal heterogeneous DPU deployment, and adaptively chooses the execution scheme between task-level and pipelined parallelism. Compared with the state-of-the-art solution with homogeneous multi-DPU engines and network-level parallelism, the proposed framework shows an average improvement of 13% (up-to 19%) and 6.6% (up-to 10%) on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 and ZCU102 platforms, respectively.
