Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is an essential mathematical tool for computing polynomial multiplication in promising lattice-based cryptography. However, costly division operations and complex data dependencies make efficient and flexible hardware design to be challenging, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing approaches either focus on only limited parameter settings or impose substantial hardware overhead. In this paper, we introduce a hardware-algorithm methodology to efficiently accelerate NTT in various settings using in-cache computing. By leveraging an optimized bit-parallel modular multiplication and introducing costless shift operations, our proposed solution provides up to 29× higher throughput-per-area and 10-138× better throughput-per-power compared to the state-of-the-art.
