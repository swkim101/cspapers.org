Recently, we have been witnessing the scale-up of superconducting quantum computers; however, the noise of quantum bits (qubits) is still an obstacle for real-world applications to leveraging the power of quantum computing. Although there exist error mitigation or error-aware designs for quantum applications, the inherent fluctuation of noise (a.k.a., instability) can easily collapse the performance of error-aware designs. Whatâ€™s worse, users can even not be aware of the performance degradation caused by the change in noise. To address both issues, in this paper we use Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as a vehicle to present a novel compression-aided framework, namely QuCAD, which will adapt a trained QNN to fluctuating quantum noise. In addition, with the historical calibration (noise) data, our framework will build a model repository offline, which will significantly reduce the optimization time in the online adaption process. Emulation results on an earthquake detection dataset show that QuCAD can achieve 14.91% accuracy gain on average in 146 days over a noise-aware training approach. For the execution on a 7-qubit IBM quantum processor, ibm-jakarta, QuCAD can consistently achieve 12.52% accuracy gain on earthquake detection.
