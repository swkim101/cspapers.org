Gate-level simulation with delay annotation is a both critical and time-consuming task in the circuit design flow. It is highly nontrivial to parallelize a simulation process, especially on designs with arbitrary general-purpose sequential elements such as latches, gated clocks, and scan chains. Current works on parallelizing gate-level simulation are fundamentally incompatible with these design elements and are highly reliant on circuit partitioning to achieve the best performance. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose gate-level simulation engine with partition-agnostic parallelism. We propose a general sequential behavior encoding technique and a fast event scheduling algorithm for general-purpose simulation tasks. Experimental results have shown up to 30Ã— speed-up over commercial simulation engines.
