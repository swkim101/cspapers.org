Logic-in-memory (LIM) describes the execution of logic gates within memristive crossbar structures, promising to improve performance and energy efficiency. Utilizing only binary values, LIM particularly excels in accelerating binary neural networks, shifting it in the focus of edge applications. Considering its potential, the impact of faults on BNNs accelerated with LIM still lacks investigation. In this paper, we propose faulty logic-in-memory (FLIM), a fault injection platform capable of executing full-fledged BNNs on LIM while injecting in-field faults. The results show that FLIM runs a single MNIST picture 66754Ã— faster than the state of the art by offering a fine-grained fault injection methodology.
