Multiple technologies for realizing quantum computing are currently under development. Neutral atom quantum computing is one such promising technology; it offers advantages such as the ability to perform long-distance interactions and gates consisting of more than two qubits. A particular advantage it provides is the flexibility to arrange the qubits in different topologies by customizing atom layouts. We design Graphine, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first technique to leverage this flexibility to design application-specific topologies for different quantum algorithms based on the structural characteristics of the algorithm circuits. This enables Graphine to improve key performance metrics like the number of gates and pulses by up to 56% and the probability of error by up to 42% on average over widely-used topology designs.
