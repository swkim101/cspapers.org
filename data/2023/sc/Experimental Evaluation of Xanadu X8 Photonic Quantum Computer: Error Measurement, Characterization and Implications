Among the various types of quantum computers, photonic quantum computers have shown great potential due to their high degree of scalability. However, the development of photonic quantum computers is still in its infancy, and the characterization of their performance is of critical importance to guide further improvements. In this work, we present the first characterization and insights derived from Xanadu's X8 photonic quantum computer. Our work represents an important step toward the development of practical and scalable photonic quantum computers.
