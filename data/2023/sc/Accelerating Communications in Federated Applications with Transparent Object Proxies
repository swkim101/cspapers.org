Advances in networks, accelerators, and cloud services encourage programmers to reconsider where to compute-such as when fast networks make it cost-effective to compute on remote accelerators despite added latency. Workflow and cloud-hosted serverless computing frameworks can manage multi-step computations spanning federated collections of cloud, high-performance computing (HPC), and edge systems, but passing data among computational steps via cloud storage can incur high costs. Here, we overcome this obstacle with a new programming paradigm that decouples control flow from data flow by extending the pass-by-reference model to distributed applications. We describe ProxyStore, a system that implements this paradigm by providing object proxies that act as wide-area object references with just-in-time resolution. This proxy model enables data producers to communicate data unilaterally, transparently, and efficiently to both local and remote consumers. We demonstrate the benefits of this model with synthetic bench-marks and real-world scientific applications, running across various computing platforms.
