HPL-MxP is an emerging high performance benchmark used to measure the mixed-precision computing capability of leading super-computers. In this work, we present our efforts on the new Sunway that linearly scales the benchmark to over 40 million cores, sustains an overall mixed-precision performance exceeding 5 ExaFlop/s, and achieves over 85% of peak performance, which is the highest efficiency reached among all heterogeneous systems on the HPL- MxP list. The optimizations of our HPL-MxP implementation include the following: (1) a Two-Direction Look-Ahead and Overlap algorithm that enables overlaps of all communications with computation; (2) a multilevel process-mapping and communication scheduling method that uses the entire network as best as possible while maintaining conflict-free algorithm-flow; and (3) a CG-Fusion computing framework that eliminates up to 60% of inter-chip communications and removes the memory access bottleneck while serving both computation and communication simultaneously. This work could also provide useful insights for tuning cutting-edge applications on Sunway supercomputers as well as other heterogeneous supercom-puters.
