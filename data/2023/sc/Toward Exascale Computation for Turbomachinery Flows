A state-of-the-art large eddy simulation code has been developed to solve compressible flows in turbomachinery. The code has been en-gineered with a high degree of scalability, enabling it to effectively leverage the many-core architecture of the new Sunway system. A consistent performance of 115.8 DP-PFLOPs has been achieved on a high-pressure turbine cascade consisting of over 1.69 billion mesh elements and 865 billion Degree of Freedoms (DOFs). By leveraging a high-order unstructured solver and its portability to large hetero-geneous parallel systems, we have progressed towards solving the
