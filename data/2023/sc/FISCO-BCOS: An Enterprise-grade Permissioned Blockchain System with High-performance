Enterprise-grade permissioned blockchain systems provide a promising infrastructure for data sharing and cooperation between different companies. However, performance bottlenecks seriously hinder the adoption of these systems in many industrial applications that process complex business logic and huge transaction volumes. Our research identifies two key factors that limit the system performance: 1) At the block level, the serial dependency of inter-block processing severely limits the system throughput. A new block must wait for the completion of all previous blocks. 2) At the transaction level, the lack of efficient intra-block transactions concurrency makes it difficult to achieve high performance, especially when dealing with multiple CPU-heavy contracts which are commonly used in industrial scenarios. In this paper, we present FISCO-BCOS, an enterprise-grade permissioned blockchain system with high performance. To overcome serial limitations and fully utilize machine resources, FISCO-BCOS introduces Block Level Pipelining (BLP) workflow to process blocks in a pipeline manner. In addition, a scheduling algorithm Deterministic Multi-Contract (DMC) is designed to efficiently execute transactions in parallel. Under BLP and DMC, FISCO-BCOS achieves inter-block and intra-block paralleling to meet high-performance requirements in industrial application scenarios. We conducted experiments on two popular test workloads and compared FISCO-BCOS with state-of-the-art platforms in academia and industry such as BIDL and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). The result shows that FISCO-BCOS achieves 7.4 times and 28.4 times the throughput of BIDL and HLF, respectively, with half the latency of them. BCOS has already been used in over 300 different large-scale industrial scenarios and has become one of the most popular permissioned blockchains.
