Network Function Virtualization (NFV) platforms consume significant energy, introducing high operational costs in edge and data centers. This paper presents a novel framework called GreenNFV that optimizes resource usage for network function chains using deep reinforcement learning. GreenNFV optimizes resource parameters such as CPU sharing ratio, CPU frequency scaling, last-level cache (LLC) allocation, DMA buffer size, and packet batch size. GreenNFV learns the resource scheduling model from the benchmark experiments and takes Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into account to optimize resource usage models based on the different throughput and energy consumption requirements. Our evaluation shows that GreenNFV models achieve high transfer throughput and low energy consumption while satisfying various SLA constraints. Specifically, GreenNFV with Throughput SLA can achieve 4.4× higher throughput and 1.5× better energy efficiency over the baseline settings, whereas GreenNFV with Energy SLA can achieve 3× higher throughput while reducing energy consumption by 50%.
