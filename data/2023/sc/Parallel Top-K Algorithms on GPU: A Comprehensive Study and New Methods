The top-K problem is an essential part of many important applications in scientific computing, information retrieval, etc. As data volume grows rapidly, high-performance parallel top-K algorithms become critical. We propose two parallel top-K algorithms, AIR Top-$K$ (Adaptive and Iteration-fused Radix Top-K) and Gridselect, for GPU. AIR Top-$K$ employs an iteration-fused design to minimize CPU-GPU communication and device data access. Its adaptive strategy eliminates unnecessary device memory traffic automatically under various data distributions. Gridselect can process data on-the-fly. It adopts a shared queue and parallel two-step insertion to decrease the frequency of costly operations. We comprehensively compare 8 open-source GPU implementations and our methods for a wide range of problem sizes and data distributions. For batch sizes 1 and 100, respectively, AIR Top-$K$ shows 1.98-21.48× and 8.01-574.78× speedup over previous radix top-K algorithm, and 1.44-7.34× and 1.38-31.91× speedup over state-of-the-art methods. Gridselect shows up to 882.29× speedup over its baseline.
