Tracking hemodynamic responses to treatment and stimuli over long periods remains a grand challenge. Moving from established single-heartbeat technology to longitudinal profiles would require continuous data describing how the patient's state evolves, new methods to extend the temporal domain over which flow is sampled, and high-throughput computing resources. While personalized dig-ital twins can accurately measure 3D hemodynamics over several heartbeats, state-of-the-art methods would require hundreds of years of wallclock time on leadership scale systems to simulate one day of activity. To address these challenges, we propose a cloud-based, parallel-in-time framework leveraging continuous data from wearable devices to capture the first 3D patient-specific, longitudi-nal hemodynamic maps. We demonstrate the validity of our method by establishing ground truth data for 750 beats and comparing the results. Our cloud-based framework is based on an initial fixed set of simulations to enable the wearable-informed creation of person-alized longitudinal hemodynamic maps.
