The landscape of modern computers is undoubtedly heterogeneous, as all computing platforms integrate multiple types of processing units and hardware accelerators. However, the entrenched programming models focus on using only the most efficient processing units for each code region, underutilizing the processing power within heterogeneous computers.This paper simultaneous and heterogenous multithreading (SHMT), a programming and execution model that enables opportunities for “real” parallel processing using heterogeneous processing units. In contrast to conventional models, SHMT can utilize heterogeneous types of processing units concurrently for the same code region. Furthermore, SHMT presents an abstraction and a runtime system to facilitate parallel execution. More importantly, SHMT needs to additionally address the heterogeneity in data precision that various processing units support to ensure the quality of the result.This paper implements and evaluates SHMT on an embedded system platform with a GPU and an Edge TPU. SHMT achieves up to 1.95× speedup and 51.0% energy reduction compared to GPU baseline.
