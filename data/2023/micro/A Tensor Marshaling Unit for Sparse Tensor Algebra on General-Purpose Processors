This paper proposes the Tensor Marshaling Unit (TMU), a near-core programmable dataflow engine for multicore architectures that accelerates tensor traversals and merging, the most critical operations of sparse tensor workloads running on today’s computing infrastructures. The TMU leverages a novel multi-lane design that enables parallel tensor loading and merging, which naturally produces vector operands that are marshaled into the core for efficient SIMD computation. The TMU supports all the necessary primitives to be tensor-format and tensor-algebra complete. We evaluate the TMU on a simulated multicore system using a broad set of tensor algebra workloads, achieving 3.6×, 2.8×, and 4.9× speedups over memory-intensive, compute-intensive, and merge-intensive vectorized software implementations, respectively.CCS CONCEPTS• Computer systems organization → Data flow architectures; • Hardware → Hardware accelerators; • Computing methodologies → Parallel programming languages.
