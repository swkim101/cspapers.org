The ability to navigate the Web via the keyboard interface is critical to people with various types of disabilities. However, modern websites often violate web accessibility guidelines for keyboard navigability with respect to web dialogs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically detecting web accessibility bugs that prevent or hinder keyboard users' ability to navigate dialogs in web pages. An extensive evaluation of our technique on real-world subjects showed that our technique is effective in detecting these dialog-related keyboard navigation failures.
