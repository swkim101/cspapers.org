Anomaly detection is one of the crucial research topics in artificial intelligence, encompassing various fields such as health monitoring, network intrusion detection, and fraud detection in financial transactions. Deep anomaly detection (DAD) methods are considered as the effective approaches for addressing complex anomaly detection problems. Among them, the deep isolation forest methods have gained rapid development recently due to their simplicity in parameter turning and efficiency in model training. The existing deep isolation forest approaches are all based on representation learning, while OptiForest theoretically proves the crucial role of the tree structure in isolation forest based methods. In this paper, we analyse the search space of isolation trees under specific data instances and address the challenges in finding optimal isolation forest. Based on the theoretical underpinning and genetic algorithm, we design a deep model DOIForest with two mutation schemes and solution selection, which learns the optimal isolation forest and optimises the parameters in data partitioning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and a series of real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach can achieve better detection accuracy and robustness than the state-of-the-arts.
