Using trajectories of moving objects and performing contact event query during disease transmission is an effective method of prevention and control. Existing contact query processing algorithms only consider single-source (one-to-one) contact event and thus can not discover multi-source (n-to-one) contact events. In this paper, we propose efficient multi-source contact event query processing methods that are capable of querying multi-source contact events. The definition of multi-source contact events is first formulated. Then, a baseline multi-source contact event query processing algorithm is presented, which adopts the idea of sliding window-based sequential scanning. To improve the query efficiency, the 2-dimensional bitmap filter and the anchor time point scanning are designed and used in the optimized query processing algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can find more potential contact events and have good performance in the manner of query time cost.
