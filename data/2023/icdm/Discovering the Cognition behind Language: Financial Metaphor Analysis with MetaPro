Metaphors frequently appear in financial news headlines due to their ability to effectively convey complex financial concepts and market trends in a concise and memorable manner. Cognitive scientists have found that metaphors serve as the reflections of human cognition by means of concept mappings. In this work, we aim to analyze the metaphorical expressions and associated cognitive patterns employed by financial analysts in the headlines of financial analysis reports. Such an examination would enhance our comprehension of the cognitive state of financial analysts regarding various financial trends. We employ the latest computational metaphor processing tool, MetaPro to achieve this target by mining metaphors and cognitive patterns from 1,407,328 financial analyst report headlines, spanning the period from 14 February 2009 to 11 June 2020. We analyze the mined concept mappings by different time periods, and market movements, and deliver novel findings in these two dimensions.
