In addressing the imbalanced issue of data within the realm of Natural Language Processing, text data augmentation methods have emerged as pivotal solutions. This data imbalance is prevalent in the research proposals submitted during the funding application process. Such imbalances, resulting from the varying popularity of disciplines or the emergence of interdisciplinary studies, significantly impede the precision of downstream topic models that deduce the affiliated disciplines of these proposals. At the data level, proposals penned by experts and scientists are inherently complex technological texts, replete with intricate terminologies, which augmenting such specialized text data poses unique challenges. At the system level, this, in turn, compromises the fairness of AI-assisted reviewer assignment systems, which raises a spotlight on solving this issue. This study leverages large language models (Llama V1) as data generators to augment research proposals categorized within intricate disciplinary hierarchies, aiming to rectify data imbalances and enhance the equity of expert assignments. We first sample within the hierarchical structure to find the under-represented class. Then we designed a prompt for keyword-based research proposal generation. Our experiments attests to the efficacy of the generated data, demonstrating that research proposals produced using the prompts can effectively address the aforementioned issues and generate high quality scientific text data, thus help the model overcome the imbalanced issue.
