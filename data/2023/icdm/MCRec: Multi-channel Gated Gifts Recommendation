In recent years, various recommendation methods are proposed to capture user preferences more accurately, with the assumption that different types of records reflects the positive intention of users to buy items in different degree. However, the records of different channels may denote positive or negative impacts on usersâ€™ willingness to buy items in multi-channel scenario, which is a salient features of games. Making recommendation only with the records of buy channel makes it difficult to capture cross-channel impact of items. To solve the issue, this paper proposes a multi-channel gated gifts recommendation method, named MCRec, which is able to mine the impact of acquisition in different channels on buy channel from multi-channel records and generate personalized gifts for users. The MCRec method extracts channel-aware correlation of items from channel-aware item-item graphs. The contribution of different items in various sessions is distinguished with item gate, and the impact of the context of different channels on buy channel is measured with channel gate. Finally, personalized gifts will be generated hierarchically with different purposes. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets that are constructed with the data collected from two massively multiplayer online (MMO) games. The results demonstrate the superiority of our MCRec over state-of-the-art recommendation methods in gifts recommendation. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the design of MCRec in modeling cross-channel impact of items.
