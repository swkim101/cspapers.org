Representing visual signals with implicit coordinate-based neural networks, as an effective replacement of the traditional discrete signal representation, has gained considerable popularity in computer vision and graphics. In contrast to existing implicit neural representations which focus on modelling the scene only, this paper proposes a novel implicit camera model which represents the physical imaging process of a camera as a deep neural network. We demonstrate the power of this new implicit camera model on two inverse imaging tasks: i) generating all-in-focus photos, and ii) HDR imaging. Specifically, we devise an implicit blur generator and an implicit tone mapper to model the aperture and exposure of the camera's imaging process, respectively. Our implicit camera model is jointly learned together with implicit scene models under multi-focus stack and multi-exposure bracket supervision. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our new model on a large number of test images and videos, producing accurate and visually appealing all-in-focus and high dynamic range images. In principle, our new implicit neural camera model has the potential to benefit a wide array of other inverse imaging tasks.
