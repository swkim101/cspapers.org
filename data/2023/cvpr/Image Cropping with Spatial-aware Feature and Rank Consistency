Image cropping aims to find visually appealing crops in an image. Despite the great progress made by previous methods, they are weak in capturing the spatial relationship between crops and aesthetic elements (e.g., salient objects, semantic edges). Besides, due to the high annotation cost of labeled data, the potential of unlabeled data awaits to be excavated. To address the first issue, we propose spatial-aware feature to encode the spatial relationship between candidate crops and aesthetic elements, by feeding the concatenation of crop mask and selectively aggregated feature maps to a light-weighted encoder. To address the second issue, we train a pair-wise ranking classifier on labeled images and transfer such knowledge to unlabeled images to enforce rank consistency. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.
