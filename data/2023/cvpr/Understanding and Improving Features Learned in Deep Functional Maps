In this document, we collect all the results and discussions, which, due to the page limit, could not find space in the main manuscript. More precisely, we first provide the proof of the theorem we introduced in Sec. 3.3 of the main text in Appendix A. Then, the details of the implementation are provided in Appendix B. We present a more in-depth analysis of the modifications we introduced to the deep functional map pipeline in Appendix C. A comparison with other shape-matching methods is provided in Appendix D, as well as additional results regarding the generalization power of pre-trained features in Appendix E. Finally, some qualitative results are included in Appendix F.
