2. Calibration of Scalar α While the extinction coefficients σ, σi, and σp in our model depend on the fog density, the scalar α is independent of the density. Rather, the scalar α has a dependency in terms of spatial locations, resulting in per-pixel α. To obtain the spatiallyvarying α, we built a closed chamber where a fog generator creates fog. We then wait for the fog to stabilize within the box physically and capture the foggy scene without objects in order to calibrate the scalar α.
