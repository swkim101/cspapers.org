Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent zero-shot generalization to new language tasks. However, effective utilization of LLMs for zero-shot visual question-answering (VQA) remains challenging, primarily due to the modality disconnect and task disconnect between the LLM and VQA tasks. End-to-end training on multimodal data may bridge the disconnects, but is inflexible and computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose Img2LLM, a plug-and-play module that provides LLM prompts to enable LLMs to perform zeroshot VQA tasks without end-to-end training. We develop LLM-agnostic models describe image content as exemplar question-answer pairs, which prove to be effective LLM prompts. Img2LLM offers the following benefits: 1) It achieves comparable or better performance than methods relying on end-to-end training. For example, we outperform Flamingo [3] by 5.6% on VQAv2. On the challenging A-OKVQA dataset, our method outperforms few-shot methods by as much as 20%. 2) It flexibly interfaces with a wide range of LLMs to perform VQA. 3) It eliminates the need to specialize LLMs using end-to-end finetuning and serve highly specialized LLMs to end users, thereby reducing cost.
