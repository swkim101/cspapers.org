Enormous hand images with reliable annotations are collected through marker-based MoCap. Unfortunately, degradations caused by markers limit their application in hand appearance reconstruction. A clear appearance recovery insight is an image-to-image translation trained with unpaired data. However, most frameworks fail because there exists structure inconsistency from a degraded hand to a bare one. The core of our approach is to first disentangle the bare hand structure from those degraded images and then wrap the appearance to this structure with a dual adversarial discrimination (DAD) scheme. Both modules take full advantage of the semi-supervised learning paradigm: The structure disentanglement benefits from the modeling ability of ViT, and the translator is enhanced by the dual discrimination on both translation processes and translation results. Comprehensive evaluations have been conducted to prove that our framework can robustly recover photo-realistic hand appearance from diverse marker-contained and even object-occluded datasets. It provides a novel avenue to acquire bare hand appearance data for other down-stream learning problems.
