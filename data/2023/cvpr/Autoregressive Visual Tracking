We present ARTrack, an autoregressive framework for visual object tracking. ARTrack tackles tracking as a coordinate sequence interpretation task that estimates object trajectories progressively, where the current estimate is induced by previous states and in turn affects subsequences. This time-autoregressive approach models the sequential evolution of trajectories to keep tracing the object across frames, making it superior to existing template matching based trackers that only consider the per-frame localization accuracy. ARTrack is simple and direct, eliminating customized localization heads and post-processings. Despite its simplicity, ARTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on prevailing benchmark datasets.
