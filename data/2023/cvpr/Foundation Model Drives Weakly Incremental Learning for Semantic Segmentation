Modern incremental learning for semantic segmentation methods usually learn new categories based on dense annotations. Although achieve promising results, pixel-by-pixel labeling is costly and time-consuming. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation (WILSS) is a novel and attractive task, which aims at learning to segment new classes from cheap and widely available image-level labels. Despite the comparable results, the image-level labels can not provide details to locate each segment, which limits the performance of WILSS. This inspires us to think how to improve and effectively utilize the supervision of new classes given image-level labels while avoiding forgetting old ones. In this work, we propose a novel and data-efficient frame-work for WILSS, named FMWISS. Specifically, we propose pre-training based co-segmentation to distill the knowledge of complementary foundation models for generating dense pseudo labels. We further optimize the noisy pseudo masks with a teacher-student architecture, where a plug-in teacher is optimized with a proposed dense contrastive loss. Moreover, we introduce memory-based copy-paste augmentation to improve the catastrophic forgetting problem of old classes. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework, e.g., FMWISS achieves 70.7% and 73.3% in the 15â€“5 VOC setting, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by 3.4% and 6.1%, respectively.
