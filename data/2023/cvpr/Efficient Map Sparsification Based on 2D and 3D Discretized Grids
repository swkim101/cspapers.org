Localization in a pre-built map is a basic technique for robot autonomous navigation. Existing mapping and localization methods commonly work well in small-scale environments. As a map grows larger, however, more memory is required and localization becomes inefficient. To solve these problems, map sparsification becomes a practical necessity to acquire a subset of the original map for localization. Previous map sparsification methods add a quadratic term in mixed-integer programming to enforce a uniform distribution of selected landmarks, which requires high memory capacity and heavy computation. In this paper, we formulate map sparsification in an efficient linear form and select uniformly distributed landmarks based on 2D discretized grids. Furthermore, to reduce the influence of different spatial distributions between the mapping and query sequences, which is not considered in previous methods, we also introduce a space constraint term based on 3D discretized grids. The exhaustive experiments in different datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in both efficiency and localization performance.
