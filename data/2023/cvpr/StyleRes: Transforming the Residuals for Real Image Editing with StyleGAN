input of the first map2style layer used in e4e. F0 has the spatial dimension of 128×64×64. The intermediate StyleGAN features are extracted as GW = G0→8(W ), where the arrow operator indicates the indices of convolution layers used. GW has the spatial dimension of 512× 64× 64. When we choose the no editing path, we set λr1 = 1.0, λr2 = 0.001, λr3 = 0.1 for the face and λr3 = 0.5 for the car dataset. When we choose the cycle translation path, we set λr1 = 0.0, meaning we do not use cycle consistency at the pixel level, λr2 = 0.0001, λr3 = 0.01 for the face and λr3 = 0.05 for the car dataset. At both paths, we set λa = 0.1. The regularizer coefficient is set to λf = 5.0 for the face dataset and λf = 3.0 for the car dataset. The network is trained with Adam optimizer, with a learning rate equal to 0.0001. We halved the learning rate at iterations 5000, 10000 and 15000.
