Scale variation across object instances remains a key challenge in object detection task. Despite the remarkable progress made by modern detection models, this challenge is particularly evident in the semi-supervised case. While existing semi-supervised object detection methods rely on strict conditions to filter high-quality pseudo labels from network predictions, we observe that objects with extreme scale tend to have low confidence, resulting in a lack of positive supervision for these objects. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that addresses the scale variation problem by introducing a mixed scale teacher to improve pseudo label generation and scale-invariant learning. Additionally, we propose mining pseudo labels using score promotion of predictions across scales, which benefits from better predictions from mixed scale features. Our extensive experiments on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks under various semi-supervised settings demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance.
