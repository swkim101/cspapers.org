The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For example, literacy codes include ‘letter names’, ‘letter sounds’, and math codes include ‘counting’, ‘sorting’. We pose this as a finegrained multilabel classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., ‘letter names’vs ‘letter sounds’). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation, we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as Youtube-8M, and COIN.
