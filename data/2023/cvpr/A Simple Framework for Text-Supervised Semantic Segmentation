Text-supervised semantic segmentation is a novel research topic that allows semantic segments to emerge with image-text contrasting. However, pioneering methods could be subject to specifically designed network architectures. This paper shows that a vanilla contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model is an effective text-supervised semantic segmentor by itself. First, we reveal that a vanilla CLIP is inferior to localization and segmentation due to its optimization being driven by densely aligning visual and language representations. Second, we propose the locality-driven alignment (LoDA) to address the problem, where CLIP optimization is driven by sparsely aligning local representations. Third, we propose a simple segmentation (SimSeg) framework. LoDA and SimSeg jointly amelio-rate a vanilla CLIP to produce impressive semantic segmentation results. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context and COCO datasets by large margins. Code and models are available at github.com/muyangyi/SimSeg.
