We propose a method that leverages graph neural networks, multi-level message passing, and unsupervised training to enable efficient prediction of realistic clothing dynamics. Whereas existing methods based on linear blend skinning must be trained for specific garments, our method, called HOOD, is agnostic to body shape and applies to tight-fitting garments as well as loose, free-flowing clothing. Furthermore, HOOD handles changes in topology (e.g., garments with buttons or zippers) and material properties at inference time. As one key contribution, we propose a hierarchical message-passing scheme that efficiently propagates stiff stretching modes while preserving local detail. We empirically show that HOOD outperforms strong baselines quantitatively and that its results are perceived as more realistic than state-of-the-art methods.
