This document provides additional material that is supplemental to our main paper. Section 1 describes the associated supplemental video. Section 2 provides further information on the technical approach as a description of the datasets, implementation details, and connection between the label propagation and spectral clustering. Section 3 provides additional empirical results in terms of ablations on the number of queries and the decoder learnable spatiotemporal embedding vs . fixed sinusoidal spatiotemporal embedding as well as visualizations to shed further light on the contributions of the queries and label propagation. Section 4 details the used assets and accompanying licenses. Finally, Section 5 describes the societal impact of this research.
