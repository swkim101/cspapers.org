In classic reinforcement learning algorithms, agents make decisions at discrete and fixed time intervals. The duration between decisions becomes a crucial hyperparameter, as setting it too short may increase the problem's difficulty by requiring the agent to make numerous decisions to achieve its goal while setting it too long can result in the agent losing control over the system. However, physical systems do not necessarily require a constant control frequency, and for learning agents, it is often preferable to operate with a low frequency when possible and a high frequency when necessary. We propose a framework called Continuous-Time Continuous-Options (CTCO), where the agent chooses options as sub-policies of variable durations. These options are time-continuous and can interact with the system at any desired frequency providing a smooth change of actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTCO by comparing its performance to classical RL and temporal-abstraction RL methods on simulated continuous control tasks with various action-cycle times. We show that our algorithm's performance is not affected by the choice of environment interaction frequency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of CTCO in facilitating exploration in a real-world visual reaching task for a 7 DOF robotic arm with sparse rewards.
