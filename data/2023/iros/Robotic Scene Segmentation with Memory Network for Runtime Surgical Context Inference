Surgical context inference has recently garnered significant attention in robot-assisted surgery as it can facilitate workflow analysis, skill assessment, and error detection. However, runtime context inference is challenging since it requires timely and accurate detection of the interactions among the tools and objects in the surgical scene based on the segmentation of video data. On the other hand, existing state-of-the-art video segmentation methods are often biased against infrequent classes and fail to provide temporal consistency for segmented masks. This can negatively impact the context inference and accurate detection of critical states. In this study, we propose a solution to these challenges using a Space-Time Correspondence Network (STCN). STCN is a memory network that performs binary segmentation and minimizes the effects of class imbalance. The use of a memory bank in STCN allows for the utilization of past image and segmentation information, thereby ensuring consistency of the masks. Our experiments using the publicly-available JIGSAWS dataset demonstrate that STCN achieves superior segmentation performance for objects that are difficult to segment, such as needle and thread, and improves context inference compared to the state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate that segmentation and context inference can be performed at runtime without compromising performance.
