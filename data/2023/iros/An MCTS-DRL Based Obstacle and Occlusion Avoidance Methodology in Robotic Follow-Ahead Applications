We propose a novel methodology for robotic follow-ahead applications that address the critical challenge of obstacle and occlusion avoidance. Our approach effectively navigates the robot while ensuring avoidance of collisions and occlusions caused by surrounding objects. To achieve this, we developed a high-level decision-making algorithm that generates short-term navigational goals for the mobile robot. Monte Carlo Tree Search is integrated with a Deep Reinforcement Learning method to enhance the performance of the decision-making process and generate more reliable navigational goals. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach in comparison to the existing follow-ahead human-following robotic methods.
