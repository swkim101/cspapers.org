Robotic assistance for experimental manipulation in the life sciences is expected to enable precise manipulation of valuable samples, regardless of the skill of the scientist. Experimental specimens in the life sciences are subject to individual variability and deformation, and therefore require autonomous robotic control. As an example, we are studying the installation of a cranial window in a mouse. This operation requires the removal of the skull, which is approximately 300 um thick, to cut it into a circular shape 8 mm in diameter, but the shape of the mouse skull varies depending on the strain of mouse, sex and week of age. The thickness of the skull is not uniform, with some areas being thin and others thicker. It is also difficult to ensure that the skulls of the mice are kept in the same position for each operation. It is not realistically possible to measure all these features and pre-program a robotic trajectory for individual mice. The paper therefore proposes an autonomous robotic drilling method. The proposed method consists of drilling trajectory planning and image-based task completion level recognition. The trajectory planning adjusts the z-position of the drill according to the task completion level at each discrete point, and forms the 3D drilling path via constrained cubic spline interpolation while avoiding overshoot. The task completion level recognition uses a DSSD-inspired deep learning model to estimate the task completion level of each discrete point. Since an egg has similar characteristics to a mouse skull in terms of shape, thickness and mechanical properties, removing the egg shell without damaging the membrane underneath was chosen as the simulation task. The proposed method was evaluated using a 6-DOF robotic arm holding a drill and achieved a success rate of 80% out of 20 trials.
