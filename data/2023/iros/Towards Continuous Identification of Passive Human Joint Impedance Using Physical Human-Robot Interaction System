The identification of human joint impedance is necessary for various applications, such as improving rehabilitation efficiency or monitoring the human operator's state (fatigue, stress). To this end, in this paper we combine robot's payload identification methods with sliding window recursive least squares algorithm allowing a continuous identification of the varying human joint model without the need for external sensors. We also propose a threshold for detecting fake changes in the identified model parameters due to numerical issues. The presented approach is validated by simulations and experiments using elastic rubber bands representing a simplified passive human joint model attached to a one degree of freedom robotic system. Comparison with simple recursive least squares shows that the proposed method is promising, as it converges to the new parameter in a single window length, whereas the other method takes much longer. In addition, it distinguishes real from fake changes depending on the validity of the used model.
