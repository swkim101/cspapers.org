Trajectory guidance requires a leader robotic agent to assist a follower robotic agent to cooperatively reach the target destination. However, planning cooperation becomes difficult when the leader serves a family of different followers and has incomplete information about the followers. There is a need for learning and fast adaptation of different cooperation plans. We develop a Stackelberg meta-learning approach to address this challenge. We first formulate the guided trajectory planning problem as a dynamic Stackelberg game to capture the leader-follower interactions. Then, we leverage meta-learning to develop cooperative strategies for different followers. The leader learns a meta-best-response model from a prescribed set of followers. When a specific follower initiates a guidance query, the leader quickly adapts to the follower-specific model with a small amount of learning data and uses it to perform trajectory guidance. We use simulations to elaborate that our method provides a better generalization and adaptation per-formance on learning followers' behavior than other learning approaches. The value and the effectiveness of guidance are also demonstrated by the comparison with zero guidance scenarios11The simulation codes are available at https://github.com/yuhan16/Stackelberg-Meta-Learning..
