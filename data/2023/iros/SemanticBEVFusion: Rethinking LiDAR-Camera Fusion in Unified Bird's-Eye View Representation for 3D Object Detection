LiDAR and cameras are two essential sensors for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. LiDAR provides accurate and reliable 3D geometry information while the camera provides rich texture with color. Despite the increasing popularity of fusing these two complementary sensors, the challenge remains in how to effectively fuse 3D LiDAR point cloud with 2D camera images. Recent methods focus on point-level fusion which paints the LiDAR point cloud with camera features in the perspective view or bird's-eye view (BEV)-level fusion which unifies multi-modality features in the BEV representation. In this paper, we rethink these previous fusion strategies and analyze their information loss and influences on geometric and semantic features. We present SemanticBEVFusion to deeply fuse camera features with LiDAR features in a unified BEV representation while maintaining per-modality strengths for 3D object detection. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale nuScenes dataset, especially for challenging distant objects. The code will be made publicly available.
