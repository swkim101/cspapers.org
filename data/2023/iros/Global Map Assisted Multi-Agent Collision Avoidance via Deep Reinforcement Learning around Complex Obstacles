State-of-the-art multi-agent collision avoidance algorithms face limitations when applied to cluttered public environments, where obstacles may have a variety of shapes and structures. The issue arises because most of these algorithms are agent-level methods. They concentrate solely on preventing collisions between the agents while the obstacles are handled merely out-of-policy. Obstacle-aware policies output an action considering both agents and obstacles. Current obstacle-aware algorithms, mainly based on Lidar sensor data, struggle to handle collision avoidance around complex obstacles. To resolve this issue, this paper investigates how to find a better way to travel around diverse obstacles. In particular, we present a global map assisted collision avoidance algorithm which, following the lead of a high-level goal guide and using an obstacle representation called distance map, considers other agents and obstacles simultaneously. Moreover, our model can be loaded into each agent individually, making it applicable to large maps or more agents. Simulation results indicate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, showing in scenarios with complex obstacles. We present a notion for incorporating global information in decentralized decision-making, along with a method for extending agent-level algorithms to cluttered environments in real-world scenarios.
