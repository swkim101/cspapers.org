In this work, we use recent developments in the field of adaptive robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) to build a controller for bilateral teleoperation systems. To guarantee robust constraint satisfaction, we incorporate polytopic tube controllers in the MPC design. In addition, we use online learning methods to learn the environment model. Namely, we use set membership learning to learn the parametric uncertainty bounds and reduce the conservatism of the robust controller, and we combine it with least mean square method to learn a point estimate of the model parameters, which enhances the controller performance. Our simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maintaining robust constraint satisfaction and enhancing performance by learning during teleoperation tasks.
