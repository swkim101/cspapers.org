This paper explores how the personality traits of robot operators can influence their task performance during remote control of robots. It is essential to explore the impact of personal dispositions on information processing, both directly and indirectly, when working with robots on specific tasks. To investigate this relationship, we utilize the open-access multi-modal dataset MOCAS to examine the robot operator's personality traits, affect, cognitive load, and task performance. Our objective is to confirm if personality traits have a total effect, including both direct and indirect effects, that could significantly impact the performance levels of operators. Specifically, we examine the relationship between personality traits such as extroversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness, and task performance. We conduct a correlation analysis between cognitive load, self-ratings of workload and affect, and quantified individual personality traits along with their experimental scores. The findings show that personality traits do not have a total effect on task performance. A supplementary video can be accessed at: https://youtu.be/h3XUtVn7nzg.
