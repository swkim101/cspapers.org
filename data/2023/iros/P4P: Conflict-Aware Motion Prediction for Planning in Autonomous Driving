Motion prediction is crucial in enabling safe motion planning for autonomous vehicles in interactive scenarios. It allows the planner to identify potential conflicts with other traffic agents and generate safe plans. Existing motion predictors often focus on reducing prediction errors, yet it remains an open question on how well they help identify conflicts for the planner, which are critical to the safety of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art predictors through novel conflict-related metrics, such as the success rate of identifying conflicts. Surprisingly, the predictors suffer from a low success rate and thus lead to a large percentage of collisions when we test the prediction-planning system in an interactive simulator. To fill the gap, we propose a simple but effective alternative that combines a physics-based trajectory generator and a learning-based relation predictor to identify conflicts and infer conflict relations. We demonstrate that our predictor, P4P, achieves superior performance over existing learning-based predictors in realistic interactive driving scenarios from Waymo Open Motion Dataset.
