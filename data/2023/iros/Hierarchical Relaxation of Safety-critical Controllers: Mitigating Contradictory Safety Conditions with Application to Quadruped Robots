The safety-critical control of robotic systems often must account for multiple, potentially conflicting, safety constraints. This paper proposes novel relaxation techniques to address safety-critical control problems in the presence of conflicting safety conditions. In particular, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide a means to encode safety as constraints in a Quadratic Program (QP), wherein multiple safety conditions yield multiple constraints. However, the QP problem becomes infeasible when the safety conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied. To resolve this potential infeasibility, we introduce a hierarchy between the safety conditions and employ an additional variable to relax the less important safety conditions (Relaxed-CBF-QP). We also formulate a cascaded structure to achieve smaller violations of lower-priority safety conditions (Hierarchical-CBF-QP). The proposed approach, therefore, ensures the existence of at least one solution to the QP problem with the CBFs while dynamically balancing enforcement of additional safety constraints. Importantly, this paper evaluates the impact of different weighting factors in the Hierarchical-CBF-QP and, due to the sensitivity of these weightings in the observed behavior, proposes a method to determine the weighting factors via a sampling-based technique. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations and experiments on a quadrupedal robot navigating to a goal through regions with different levels of danger.
