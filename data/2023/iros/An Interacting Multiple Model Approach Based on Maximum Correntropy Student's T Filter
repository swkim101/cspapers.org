This paper presents a novel approach called the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM)-based Maximum Correntropy Student's T Filter (MCStF), which addresses the challenges posed by non-Gaussian measurement noises. The MCStF demonstrates superior performance compared to the IMM algorithm based on Kalman Filters (KFs) in both simulation environments and real-time systems. The Crazyflie 2.0 nano Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) model is used in the simulation validation, and results from 3000 independent Monte Carlo runs are shown. After getting the simulation results under monotonously changed non-Gaussian distribution, their performance results have been compared to each other. The same scenario has been applied in the real-time system using Crazyflie 2.0. Next, results from real-time tests are presented in which the position of Crazyflie 2.0 is estimated online.
