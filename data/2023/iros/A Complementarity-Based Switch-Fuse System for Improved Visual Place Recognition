Recently several fusion and switching based approaches have been presented to solve the problem of Visual Place Recognition. In spite of these systems demonstrating significant boost in VPR performance they each have their own set of limitations. The multi-process fusion systems usually involve employing brute force and running all available VPR techniques simultaneously while the switching method attempts to negate this practise by only selecting the best suited VPR technique for given query image. But switching does fail at times when no available suitable technique can be identified. An innovative solution would be an amalgamation of the two otherwise discrete approaches to combine their competitive advantages while negating their shortcomings. The proposed, Switch-Fuse system, is an interesting way to combine both the robustness of switching VPR techniques based on complementarity and the force of fusing the carefully selected techniques to significantly improve performance. Our system holds a structure superior to the basic fusion methods as instead of simply fusing all or any random techniques, it is structured to first select the best possible VPR techniques for fusion, according to the query image. The system combines two significant processes, switching and fusing VPR techniques, which together as a hybrid model substantially improve performance on all major VPR data sets illustrated using PR curves.
