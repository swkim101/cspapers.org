Re-Iocalizing a camera from a single image in a previously mapped area is vital for many computer vision applications in robotics and augmented/virtual reality. In this work, we address the problem of estimating the 6 DoF camera pose relative to a global frame from a single image. We propose to leverage a novel network of relative spatial and temporal geometric constraints to guide the training of a Deep Network for Localization. We employ simultaneously spatial and temporal relative pose constraints that are obtained not only from adjacent camera frames but also from camera frames that are distant in the spatio-temporal space of the scene. We show that our method, through these constraints, is capable of learning to localize when little or very sparse ground-truth 3D coordinates are available. In our experiments, this is less than 1 % of available ground-truth data. We evaluate our method on 3 common visual localization datasets and show that it outperforms other direct pose estimation methods.
