Exoskeletons have shown great potential to enhance locomotion by augmenting the lower limb. While most research has focused on steady-state ambulatory activities, the ability to assist transient, ballistic tasks is also important for understanding the potential of exoskeletons in mobility enhancement. In this preliminary study (N = 5), we developed an individually-customized control strategy to assist vertical jumping. The control strategy was deployed on bilateral ankle exoskeletons (ExoBoot, Dephy Inc.). We structured the control strategy as a work loop that parameterized the assistance provided during the jump. We show that configuring the controller based on individual biomechanics and user preferences facilitates increased vertical jump height when using exoskeleton assistance. In addition, we demonstrate that a user's squat depth can have a significant (p < 0.05) impact on height achieved, but that this depth does not need to be optimized; rather, the exoskeleton provides the maximum performance assistance from both preferred- and deep-squat conditions. Jump height increased by 7.2% with the exoskeleton at its maximum assistance setting, which is comparable to or greater than previous systems.
