Characteristics of wireless manipulation based on permanent magnet coupling, including anchoring distance, panning torque, and translational force, are assessed in this paper. The study focuses on a typical scenario where a slave robot embedded with a small permanent magnet can be remotely controlled within a constrained area by a master large permanent magnet placed outside the environment at a certain distance from it. The key parameters (force and torque) acting on the slave robot are quantified and evaluated. In this article, several combinations of permanent magnets with various dimensions and configurations are studied using finite element methods. Based on the obtained results, we create a lookup table for each parameter, serving as a guideline to help interested researchers choose suitable magnetic combinations for their applications.
