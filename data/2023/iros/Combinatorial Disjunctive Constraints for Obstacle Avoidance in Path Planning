We present a new approach for modeling avoidance constraints in 2D environments, in which waypoints are assigned to obstacle-free polyhedral regions. Constraints of this form are often formulated as mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems employing big-M techniques-however, these are generally not the strongest formulations possible with respect to the MIP's convex relaxation (so called ideal formulations), potentially resulting in larger computational burden. We instead model obstacle avoidance as combinatorial disjunctive constraints and leverage the independent branching scheme to construct small, ideal formulations. As our approach requires a biclique cover for an associated graph, we exploit the structure of this class of graphs to develop a fast subroutine for obtaining biclique covers in polynomial time. We also contribute an open-source Julia library named ClutteredEnvPathOpt to facilitate computational experiments of MIP formulations for obstacle avoidance. Experiments have shown our formulation is more compact and remains competitive on a number of instances compared with standard big-M techniques, for which solvers possess highly optimized procedures.
