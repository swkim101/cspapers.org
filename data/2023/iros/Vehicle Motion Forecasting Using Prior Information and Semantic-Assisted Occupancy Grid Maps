Motion prediction is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles due to uncertainty in the sensor data, the non-deterministic nature of future, and complex behavior of agents. In this paper, we tackle this problem by representing the scene as dynamic occupancy grid maps (DOGMs), associating semantic labels to the occupied cells and incorporating map information. We propose a novel framework that combines deep-learning-based spatio-temporal and probabilistic approaches to predict vehicle behaviors. Contrary to the conventional OGM prediction methods, evaluation of our work is conducted against the ground truth annotations. We experiment and validate our results on real-world NuScenes dataset and show that our model shows superior ability to predict both static and dynamic vehicles compared to OGM predictions. Furthermore, we perform an ablation study and assess the role of semantic labels and map in the architecture.
