This paper proposes a modification of the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter to compute online the probability of detection $(P_{D})$ and probability of survival $(P_{S})$ of targets. This eliminates the need for predetermined and/or constant $P_{D}$ and $P_{S}$ values, that may degrade the estimation. The proposed filter estimates the $P_{D}$ and $P_{S}$ values for each individual target based on newly introduced parameters, which are updated during the measurement update process. The effectiveness of the proposed filter was validated through an in-lab experiment using four unmanned ground robots with varying $P_{D}$ values and a real-world lidar-based obstacle tracking system implemented on an Automated Surface Vehicle operating in a lake with real-time boat traffic. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed filter outperforms the standard PHD filter with incorrect $P_{D}$ and $P_{S}$ values. These findings highlight the potential benefits of the proposed filter in improving target tracking performance in complex environments.
