Over the last decade, a plethora of soft robotic devices have been proposed for the execution of complex grasping and dexterous manipulation tasks. Tasks requiring such increased dexterity are typically executed using fully-actuated, rigid end-effectors equipped with sophisticated sensing and controlled with complex control laws. The new class of soft robotic devices offers an alternative to the traditional end-effectors and facilitates the development of robotic grasping and manipulation solutions that are lightweight, safe to interact with, affordable, and easy to use and control. Within the class of soft robotic grippers and hands, promising recent developments were made in ultra-affordable, even disposable mechanisms based on origami and kirigami structures. This paper proposes a new kirigami-inspired robotic gripper geometry employing compression-based actuation. The compression actuation fundamentally differentiates this new design class from previous kirigami grippers, resulting in more compact robotic grippers with superior grasping capabilities. In particular, we investigate how the shapes of the internal cuts of the kirigami geometries can affect the gripper performance in terms of force exertion and grasping capabilities. A series of experiments are conducted to understand better the working principles behind this new type of kirigami grippers and experimentally validate their efficacy in the execution of complex, everyday life tasks. Further demonstrations of the gripper's capabilities include the pick-and-placing of human hair, egg yolk, and even liquids.
