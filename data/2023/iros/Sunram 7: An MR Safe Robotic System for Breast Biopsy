In breast cancer patients, some nodules are only visible on MRI, thus, requiring MRI-guidance to perform the biopsy. MRI interventions are cumbersome due to the magnetic field and the constrained working space. An MR safe robotic system actuated by pneumatic stepper motors may enable these procedures, improving both accuracy and image-guided navigation. A compact multipurpose pneumatic stepper motor has been designed with outer dimensions $(45 \times 40\times 15)\mathbf{mm}^{\mathbf{3}}$. This is configurable as a linear, rotational or curved stepper motor with a customizable step size and radius of curvature. Five copies of these motors actuate the Sunram 7 biopsy robot, of which the moving part (without protruding racks and tubes) measures $(130 \times 65\times 55)\mathbf{mm}^{\mathbf{3}}$. After manually choosing the target location and angle of approach, the needle is robotically inserted into the breast and the integrated pneumatic biopsy gun is fired to sample tissue from the lesion. The maximum torque of the presented motor is 0.61 N m at 6 bar which can be achieved using 13-teeth polycarbonate gears. Using 17-teeth gears for higher accuracy and a more convenient working pressure of 2 bar the maximum torque is 0.28 N m. The accuracy in free air of the Sunram 7 robot is 1.69mm and 1.72mm in X and Z-direction respectively, with a resulting 2-D error of 2.54 mm. The workspace volume is 4.1 L. When targeting 10 mm-sized lesions in phantoms under MRI guidance, Sunram 7 achieved a success rate of 68%. The minimum interval between two successive biopsies was 5:47 minutes. The presented multipurpose stepper motor has distinct advantages over previous designs in terms of robustness, customizability, printability and ease of integration in MR safe robotics. The Sunram 7 is able to perform accurate MRI-guided biopsies in a large workspace volume while reducing the intervention time when compared to the gold standard (i.e., MRI-guided free-hand biopsy).
