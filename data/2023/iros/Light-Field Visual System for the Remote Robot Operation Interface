Robotic automation is expected to be applicable in various fields. The utilization of robots requires human-robot interaction (HRI) for prolonged direct manipulation or learning. Recently, numerous studies on HRI have been conducted in virtual space using virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VAM-HRI). In the future, VAM-HRI applications are expected to involve users wearing head-mounted displays (HMDs). However, HMDs present various problems, such as vergence and accommodation conflict (VAC) caused by eye strain, and thus cannot be used for long periods. In this study, a remote robot operation interface is developed to solve this problem. Experiments are conducted from the viewpoint of ophthalmology to determine whether “removal of VAC” and “improvement of depth perception” by Light Field HMDs (LFHMD), and “reduction of eye strain” by TransRay are feasible. The results reveal that the LFHMD is superior to the general HMDs for all items.
