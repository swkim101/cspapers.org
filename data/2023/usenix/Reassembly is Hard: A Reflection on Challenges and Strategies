Reassembly, a branch of static binary rewriting, has become a focus of research today. However, despite its widespread use and research interest, there have been no systematic investigations on the techniques and challenges of reassemblers. In this paper, we formally define different types of errors that occur in current existing reassemblers, and present an automated tool named REASSESSOR to find such errors. We attempt to show through our tool and the large-scale benchmark we created the current challenges in the field and how they can be approached.
