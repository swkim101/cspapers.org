Treatment effect estimation is essential in the causal inference literature, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most previous methods assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution, which may not hold in practice since the effect estimators may need to be deployed across domains. Meanwhile, in real-world applications, little or no targeted treatments may be conducted in the new domain. Therefore, we focus on a more realistic scenario in this paper, where treatments and outcomes can be observed in the source domain, but the target domain only contains some unlabeled data, i.e., only features are available. In this scenario, thedistribution shift exists not only in the source data due to the selection bias between the control and treated groups, but also between the source and target data. We propose a novel direct learning framework along with the distribution adaptation and reliable scoring modules. In the distribution adaptation module, we design three specialized density ratio estimators to aid the issue of complex distribution shifts. Even so, we may face the challenge of unreliable pseudo-effects in this framework. To address that, we also design the uncertainty-based reliable scoring module as a vital support, which makes the method more reliable. The experiments are conducted on synthetic data and benchmark datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our method.
