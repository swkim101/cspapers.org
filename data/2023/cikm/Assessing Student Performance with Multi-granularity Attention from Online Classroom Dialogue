Accurately judging students' ongoing performance is very crucial for real-world educational scenarios. In this work, we focus on the task of automatically predicting students' levels of mastery of math questions from teacher-student classroom dialogue data in the online learning environment. We propose a novel neural network armed with a multi-granularity attention mechanism to capture the personalized pedagogical instructions from the very noisy teacher-student dialogue transcriptions. We conduct experiments on a real-world educational dataset and the results demonstrate the superiority and availability of our model in terms of various evaluation metrics.
