Document retrieval has always been a crucial problem in Web search. Recent works leverage pre-trained language models to represent documents in dense vectors. However, these works focus on the textual content but ignore the appearance of web pages (e.g., the visual style, the layout, and the images), which are actually essential for information delivery. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new dense retrieval model, namely VILE, to incorporate visual features into document representations. However, because a web page is usually very large and contains diverse information, simply concatenating its textual and visual features may result in a cluttered multi-modal representation that lacks focus on the important parts of the page. We observe that web pages often have a structured content organization, comprising multiple blocks that convey different information. Motivated by the observation, we propose building a multi-modal document representation by aggregating the fine-grained multi-modal block representations, to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the page. Specifically, we first segment a web page into multiple blocks, then create multi-modal features for each block. %allowing for more effective capture of its content and visual information. The representations of all blocks are then integrated into the final multi-modal page representation. VILE can better model the importance of different content regions, leading to a high-quality multi-modal representation. We collect screenshots and the corresponding layout information of some web pages in the MS MARCO Document Ranking dataset, resulting in a new multi-modal document retrieval dataset. Experimental results conducted on this dataset demonstrate that our model exhibits significant improvements over existing document retrieval models.
