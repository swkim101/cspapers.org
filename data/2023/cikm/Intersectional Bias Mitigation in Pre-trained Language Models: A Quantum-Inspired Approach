The growing criticality of contextualized language models has raised concerns about the perpetuation of biases. Current fairness research often concentrates on single aspects of social groups. However, our study brings a multifaceted approach to the table, reflecting the intricate realities of intersectionality. We propose a bias mitigation algorithm inspired by quantum theory to fine-tune pre-trained language models. Our method applies Jensen-Shannon divergence alongside an entanglement entropy measure to quantify the complexity of entwined identities. Moreover, we utilize an innovative entanglement embedding neural network to address emergent features from different intersectional groups. An Actor-Critic setup facilitates effective fine-tuning. Our approach broadens the scope of intersectional fairness beyond just statistical parity, providing a strategic tool to tackle complex, interrelated biases. We anticipate that this fresh approach to bias mitigation will substantially enhance fairness in a wide range of language model applications.
