Skeleton-based motion capture and visualization is an important computer vision task, especially in the virtual reality (VR) environment. It has grown increasingly popular due to the ease of gathering skeleton data and the high demand of virtual socialization. The captured skeleton data seems anonymous but can still be used to extract personal identifiable information (PII). This can lead to an unintended privacy leakage inside a VR meta-verse. We propose a novel linkage attack on skeleton-based motion visualization. It detects if a target and a reference skeleton are the same individual. The proposed model, called Linkage Attack Neural Network (LAN), is based on the principles of a Siamese Network. It incorporates deep neural networks to embed the relevant PII then uses a classifier to match the reference and target skeletons. We also employ classical and deep motion retargeting (MR) to cast the target skeleton onto a dummy skeleton such that the motion sequence is anonymized for privacy protection. Our evaluation shows that the effectiveness of LAN in the linkage attack and the effectiveness of MR in anonymization.
