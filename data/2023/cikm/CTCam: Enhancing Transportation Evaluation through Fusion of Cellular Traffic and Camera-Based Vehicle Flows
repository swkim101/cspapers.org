Traffic prediction utility often faces infrastructural limitations, which restrict its coverage. To overcome this challenge, we present Geographical Cellular Traffic (GCT) flow that leverages cellular network data as a new source for transportation evaluation. The broad coverage of cellular networks allows GCT flow to capture various mobile user activities across regions, aiding city authorities in resource management through precise predictions. Acknowledging the complexity arising from the diversity of mobile users in GCT flow, we supplement it with camera-based vehicle flow data from limited deployments and verify their spatio-temporal attributes and correlations through extensive data analysis. Our two-stage fusion approach integrates these multi-source data, addressing their coverage and magnitude discrepancies, thereby enhancing the prediction of GCT flow for accurate transportation evaluation. Overall, we propose novel uses of telecom data in transportation and verify its effectiveness in multi-source fusion with vision-based data.
