Fraudsters in the real world frequently add more legitimate links while concealing their direct ones with other fraudsters, leading to heterophily in fraud graphs, which is a problem that most GNN-based techniques are not built to solve. Several works have been proposed to tackle the issue from the spatial domain. However, researches on addressing the heterophily problem in the spectral domain are still limited due to a lack of understanding of spectral energy distribution in graphs with heterophily. In this paper, we analyze the spectral distribution with different heterophily degrees and observe that the heterophily of fraud nodes leads to the spectral energy moving from low-frequency to high-frequency. Further, we verify that splitting graphs using heterophilic and homophilic edges can obtain more significant expressions of signals in different frequency bands. The observation drives us to propose the spectral graph neural network, SplitGNN, to capture signals for fraud detection against heterophily. SplitGNN uses an edge classifier to split the original graph and adopts flexible band-pass graph filters to learn representations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Split-GNN/SplitGNN.
