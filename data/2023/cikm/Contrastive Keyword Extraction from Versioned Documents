Versioned documents are common in many situations and play a vital part in numerous applications enabling an overview of the revisions made to a document or document collection. However, as documents increase in size, it gets difficult to summarize and comprehend all the changes made to versioned documents. In this paper, we propose a novel research problem of contrastive keyword extraction from versioned documents, and introduce an unsupervised approach that extracts keywords to reflect the key changes made to an earlier document version. In order to provide an easy-to-use comparison and summarization tool, an open-source demonstration is made available which can be found at https://contrastive-keyword-extraction.streamlit.app/
