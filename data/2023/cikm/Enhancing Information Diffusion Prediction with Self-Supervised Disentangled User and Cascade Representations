Accurately predicting information diffusion is critical for a vast range of applications. Existing methods generally consider user re-sharing behaviors to be driven by a single intent, and/or assume cascade temporal influence to be unchanged, which might not be consistent with real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised disentanglement framework (DisenIDP) for information diffusion prediction. First, we construct intent-aware hypergraphs to capture users' potential intents from different perspectives, and then perform the light hypergraph convolution to adaptively activate disentangled intents. Second, we extract long-term and short-term cascade influence via independent attention-based encoders. Finally, we set a self-supervised disentanglement task to alleviate the information loss and learn better-disentanglement representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world social datasets demonstrate that DisenIDP outperforms state-of-the-art models across several settings.
