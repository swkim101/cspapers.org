Change Point Detection (CPD) models are used to identify abrupt changes in the distribution of a data stream and have a widespread practical use. CPD methods generally compare the distribution of data sequences before and after a given time step to infer if there is a shift in distribution at the said time step. Numerous divergence measures, which measure distance between data distributions of sequence pairs, have been proposed for CPD \citeMStatisticNIPS, BergCPD and often the choice of divergence measure depends on the data used. Density Ratio Estimation (DRE) \citeRelDivCPD,BergCPD can be used to estimate a broad family of f-divergences, which includes widely used CPD divergences like Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Pearson, and thus DRE is a popular approach for CPD. In this work, we improve upon the existing DRE techniques for CPD, by proposing a novel objective that combines DRE seamlessly with adversarial sample generation. The adversarial samples allows for a robust CPD with DRE to track subtle changes in distribution, leading to a reduction in false negatives. We experiment on a wide variety of real-world, public benchmark datasets to show that our approach improves upon existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, including DRE based CPD methods, by demonstrating an \sim 5% increase in F-score.
