Node classification is an important task in many fields, e.g., predicting entity types in knowledge graphs, classifying papers in citation graphs, or classifying nodes in social networks. In many cases, it is crucial to explain why certain predictions are made. Towards this end, concept learning has been proposed as a means of interpretable node classification: given positive and negative examples in a knowledge base, concepts in description logics are learned that serve as classification models. However, state-of-the-art concept learners, including EvoLearner and CELOE exhibit long runtimes. In this paper, we propose to accelerate concept learning with graph sampling techniques. We experiment with seven techniques and tailor them to the setting of concept learning. In our experiments, we achieve a reduction in training size by over 90% while maintaining a high predictive performance.
