When sharing   relational databases with other parties, in addition to providing high quality (utility) database to the recipients, a database owner also aims to have (i) privacy guarantees for the data entries and (ii)  liability guarantees (via fingerprinting) in case of unauthorized redistribution. However, (i) and (ii) are orthogonal objectives, because when sharing a database with multiple recipients, privacy via data sanitization requires adding noise once (and sharing the same noisy version with all recipients), whereas liability via unique fingerprint insertion requires adding different noises to each shared copy to distinguish all recipients. Although achieving (i) and (ii) together is possible in a na"ive way (e.g., either differentially-private  database perturbation or synthesis followed by fingerprinting), this approach  results in   significant degradation in the utility of   shared databases. In this paper, we achieve privacy and liability guarantees  simultaneously by proposing a novel entry-level differentially-private  (DP) fingerprinting mechanism for relational databases without causing large utility  degradation.
