Blockchain consensus protocols are responsible for coordinating the nodes to make agreements on the transaction results.
Their implementation bugs, including
memory-related and consensus logic vulnerabilities, may pose serious threats.
Fuzzing is a promising technique for protocol vulnerability detection.
However, existing fuzzers cannot deal with complex consensus states of distributed nodes, thus generating a large number of useless packets, inhibiting their effectiveness in reaching the deep logic of consensus protocols.
