Atomic predicate is a key enabler to the rapid development of data plane verification, a technique to monitor and verify correctness of forwarding rules. Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) is widely used as the representation of atomic predicates for its simplicity of use, memory efficiency, and good performance when verifying general forwarding behaviors. However, building the atomic predicates is still the bottleneck in real-time data plane verification for large-scale networks, as existing BDD libraries do not scale well. In this paper, we identify the root cause of the inefficiency: general-purpose BDD libraries are aimed at speeding up a single BDD operation using parallelism rather than a batch of operations. Further, we propose TOBDD, a throughput-optimized BDD library that enables scaling of real-time data plane verification. Evaluations of the data plane verification system based on TOBDD report 2-10x improvement over the state-of-the-art centralized data plane verifier.
