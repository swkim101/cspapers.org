Acoustic backscatter is a recent communication technology that enables ultra-low power sensing and connectivity in underwater environments. This demo presents an interactive graphical tool (Matlab App) for quickly evaluating the performance of acoustic backscatter in real-world scenarios. Our tool enables users to customize a backscatter system with practical underwater transducers and channel properties, then uses an analytical framework to predict the system's power-up and communication range. Researchers and IoT designers with no acoustics background can leverage our tool to make informed design choices and optimize their system's performance.
