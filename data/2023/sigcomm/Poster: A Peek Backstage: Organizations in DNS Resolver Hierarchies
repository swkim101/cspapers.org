We report on a large-scale study of the complex client-side DNS infrastructure. Using all RIPE Atlas probes and our crowdsourced experiment, we capture clients' ingress and egress DNS resolvers from 880 ISPs in 113 different countries, around the world. We study different aspects of this mismatch - including the distance between clients and ingress/egress resolvers and cases of country-level mismatch between clients and their resolvers.
