Optimising the assignment of tasks to workers is an effective approach to ensure high quality in crowdsourced data - particularly in heterogeneous micro tasks. However, previous attempts at heterogeneous micro task assignment based on worker characteristics are limited to using cognitive skills, despite literature emphasising that worker performance varies based on other parameters. This study is an initial step towards understanding whether and how multiple parameters such as cognitive skills, mood, personality, alertness, comprehension skill, and social and physical context of workers can be leveraged in tandem to improve worker performance estimations in heterogeneous micro tasks. Our predictive models indicate that these parameters have varying effects on worker performance in the five task types considered – sentiment analysis, classification, transcription, named entity recognition and bounding box. Moreover, we note 0.003 - 0.018 reduction in mean absolute error of predicted worker accuracy across all tasks, when task assignment is based on models that consider all parameters vs. models that only consider workers’ cognitive skills. Our findings pave the way for the use of holistic approaches in micro task assignment that effectively quantify worker context.
