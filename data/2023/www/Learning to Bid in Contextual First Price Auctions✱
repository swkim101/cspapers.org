In this work, we investigate the problem of how to bid in repeated contextual first price auctions for a single learner (the bidder). Concretely, at each time t, the learner receives a context and decides the bid based on historical information and xt. We assume that the maximum bid of all the others follows a linear model, i.e., mt = ⟨α0, xt⟩ + zt, where is unknown to the learner and zt is randomly sampled from a noise distribution with log-concave density. In this work, we consider both binary feedback (the learner can only observe whether she wins or not) and full information feedback (the learner can observe mt) models of the learner. For binary feedback, when the noise distribution is (partially) known, we propose a bidding algorithm that achieves at most regret, where Δ is a constant reserve in first price auctions.1 For the full information feedback with unknown noise distribution, we provide an algorithm that achieves regret at most . Our approach combines an estimator for log-concave density functions and the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method to learn the noise distribution and linear weight α0 simultaneously. We complement our results with a lower bound result such that any bidding policy in a broad class must achieve regret at least , even when the learner receives the full information feedback and is known.
