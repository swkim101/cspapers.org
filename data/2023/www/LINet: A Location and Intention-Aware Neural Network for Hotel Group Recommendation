Motivated by the collaboration with Fliggy1, a leading Online Travel Platform (OTP), we investigate an important but less explored research topic about optimizing the quality of hotel supply, namely selecting potential profitable hotels in advance to build up adequate room inventory. We formulate a WWW problem, i.e., within a specific time period (When) and potential travel area (Where), which hotels should be recommended to a certain group of users with similar travel intentions (Why). We identify three critical challenges in solving the WWW problem: user groups generation, travel data sparsity and utilization of hotel recommendation information (e.g., period, location and intention). To this end, we propose LINet, a Location and Intention-aware neural Network for hotel group recommendation. Specifically, LINet first identifies user travel intentions for user groups generalization, and then characterizes the group preferences by jointly considering historical user-hotel interaction and spatio-temporal features of hotels. For data sparsity, we develop a graph neural network, which employs long-term data, and further design an auxiliary loss function of location that efficiently exploits data within the same and across different locations. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LINet when compared with state-of-the-art methods. LINet has been successfully deployed on Fliggy to retrieve high quality hotels for business development, serving hundreds of hotel operation scenarios and thousands of hotel operators.
