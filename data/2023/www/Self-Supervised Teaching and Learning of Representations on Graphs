Recent years have witnessed significant advances in graph contrastive learning (GCL), while most GCL models use graph neural networks as encoders based on supervised learning. In this work, we propose a novel graph learning model called GraphTL, which explores self-supervised teaching and learning of representations on graphs. One critical objective of GCL is to retain original graph information. For this purpose, we design an encoder based on the idea of unsupervised dimensionality reduction of locally linear embedding (LLE). Specifically, we map one iteration of the LLE to one layer of the network. To guide the encoder to better retain the original graph information, we propose an unbalanced contrastive model consisting of two views, which are the learning view and the teaching view, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the nodes that are identical in muti-views as positive node pairs, and design the node similarity scorer so that the model can select positive samples of a target node. Extensive experiments have been conducted over multiple datasets to evaluate the performance of GraphTL in comparison with baseline models. Results demonstrate that GraphTL can reduce distances between similar nodes while preserving network topological and feature information, yielding better performance in node classification.
