Web performance optimization services, or web performance optimizers (WPOs), play a critical role in today’s web ecosystem by improving page load speed and saving network traffic. However, WPOs are known for introducing visual distortions that disrupt the users’ web experience. Unfortunately, visual distortions are hard to analyze, test, and debug, due to their subjective measure, dynamic content, and sophisticated WPO implementations. This paper presents Vetter, a novel and effective system that automatically tests and debugs visual distortions. Its key idea is to reason about the morphology of web pages, which describes the topological forms and scale-free geometrical structures of visual elements. Vetter efficiently calculates morphology and comparatively analyzes the morphologies of web pages before and after a WPO, which acts as a differential test oracle. Such morphology analysis enables Vetter to detect visual distortions accurately and reliably. Vetter further diagnoses the detected visual distortions to pinpoint the root causes in WPOs’ source code. This is achieved by morphological causal inference, which localizes the offending visual elements that trigger the distortion and maps them to the corresponding code. We applied Vetter to four representative WPOs. Vetter discovers 21 unknown defects responsible for 98% visual distortions; 12 of them have been confirmed and 5 have been fixed.
