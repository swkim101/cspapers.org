The literature has shown combining a few non-Personal Identifiable Information (non-PII) is enough to make a user unique in a dataset including millions of users. In this work, we demonstrate that the combination of the location and 6 rare (14 random) skills in a LinkedIn profile is enough to become unique in a user base of ~800M users with a probability of 75%. The novelty is these attributes are publicly accessible to anyone registered on LinkedIn and could be activated through advertising campaigns.
