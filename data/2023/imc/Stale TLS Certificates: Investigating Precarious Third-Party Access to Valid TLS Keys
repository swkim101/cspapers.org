Certificate authorities enable TLS server authentication by generating certificates that attest to the mapping between a domain name and a cryptographic keypair, for up to 398 days. This static, name-to-key caching mechanism belies a complex reality: a tangle of dynamic infrastructure involving domains, servers, cryptographic keys, etc. When any of these operations changes, the authentication information in a certificate becomes stale and no longer accurately reflects reality. In this work, we examine the broader phenomenon of certificate invalidation events and discover three classes of security-relevant events that enable a third-party to impersonate a domain outside of their control. Longitudinal measurement of these precarious scenarios reveals that they affect over 15K new domains per day, on average. Unfortunately, modern certificate revocation provides little recourse, so we examine the potential impact of reducing certificate lifetimes (cache duration): shortening the current 398-day limit to 90 days yields a 75% decrease in precarious access to valid TLS keys.
