Network operators in telecom carriers perform failure diagnosis by executing various commands (e.g., show interfaces) on network devices through a command line interface (CLI). The outputs of these CLI commands, which we call command outputs, contain more detailed information than typical one-line system logs but have complex characteristics; thus, existing parsers for system logs are not applicable. In this study, we propose COPA, a parsing method for command outputs for automating time-consuming and labor-intensive failure diagnosis.
