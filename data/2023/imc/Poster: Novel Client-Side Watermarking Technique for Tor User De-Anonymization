Most traditional techniques for Tor user de-anonymization rely on the use of server-side originating traffic watermarks. In this poster, we outline the key ideas behind our novel client-side originating watermark scheme and describe some possible ways of how this scheme could be implemented in practice. We also demonstrate the superior real-world performance of this approach vs. those previously discussed in the literature.
