Smart home IoT platforms are typically closed systems, meaning that there is poor visibility into device behavior. Understanding device behavior is important not only for determining whether devices are functioning as expected, but also can reveal implications for privacy (e.g., surreptitious audio/video recording), security (e.g., device compromise), and safety (e.g., denial of service on a baby monitor). While there has been some work on identifying devices and a handful of activities, an open question is what is the extent to which we can automatically model the entire behavior of an IoT deployment, and how it changes over time, without any privileged access to IoT devices or platform messages. In this work, we demonstrate that the vast majority of IoT behavior can indeed be modeled, using a novel multi-dimensional approach that relies only on the (often encrypted) network traffic exchanged by IoT devices. Our key insight is that IoT behavior (including cross-device interactions) can often be captured using relatively simple models such as timers (for periodic behavior) and probabilistic state-machines (for user-initiated behavior and devices interactions) during a limited observation phase. We then propose deviation metrics that can identify when the behavior of an IoT device or an IoT system changes over time. Our models and metrics successfully identify several notable changes in our IoT deployment, including a camera that changed locations, network outages that impact connectivity, and device malfunctions.
