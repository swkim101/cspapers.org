Edge computing servers have been widely deployed in recent years to address the requirements of diverse tasks that are sensitive to delays and computationally intensive. However, due to their independent nature and uneven distribution of service requests, certain clusters may be relatively idle, while others may be overloaded. This situation can result in increased latency for certain tasks, and it prevents the full utilization of resources in the edge clusters. To mitigate this problem, we design and implement a prototype testbed for task offloading, aimed at achieving computing and network convergence. This testbed facilitates collaboration among multiple edge computing clusters. We construct multiple clusters using Intel NUC mini computers and incorporate key enabling technologies into the system. We assess the testbed's performance by employing multiple video processing services that require low latency and high computational capacity. In scenarios with uneven service requests, load balancing can be achieved across the edge computing clusters, resulting in reduced response latency for user tasks.
