Fingerprinting is a common localisation approach that often estimates a device's position by comparing an observed vector to a set of prior vectors labelled with a ground truth location, typically using methods like k-NN. In Wi-Fi fingerprinting, these vectors represent visible access points and their signal strength. Thus, the choice of metric to compare the fingerprints is crucial. In this work, we discuss our main findings regarding the extent to which metrics in the fingerprint vector space preserve relationships among locations in the 2D/3D geometric/real world. In summary, traditional metrics are not optimal on their own, and while combining them into a learned meta-metric offers slight improvements, deep metric learning, i.e., learning similarities in an end-to-end fashion with deep neural networks, appears much more effective. However, this approach has its challenges given that in the literature the problem has only been formulated for binary similarities rather than continuous ones.
