Ultrasonic microphone jammers protect speech privacy from being eavesdropped by leveraging microphones' non-linearity. However, existing jammers merely introduce independent noises and are vulnerable to capable adversaries who adopt advanced denoising techniques. We propose a novel jammer, namely MicFrozen. It reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the adversary's microphone from two perspectives, i.e., cancelling speech signals and adding noises that are difficult to be removed. It effectively cancels out the protected speech signals at the adversary without compromising the delivery of the signal to the targeted individual. MicFrozen further adds coherent noises that are coupled with the speech signals to resist removal by the adversary. Extensive evaluations show that MicFrozen can cause a low SNR (-13.6 dB) at the adversary and up to 96.9% of speech signals are unrecognized at the adversary even if state-of-the-art denoising techniques are adopted by the adversary. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MicFrozen confronted by capable adversaries.
