As the Platform for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) in rural broadband, the ARA wireless living lab features the deployment of first-of-its-kind wireless access and backhaul platforms in real-world agriculture and rural settings, and preliminary experiments have demonstrated very promising results, e.g., up to 3.2 Gbps wireless access throughput and more than 10 Gbps throughput across a wireless backhaul link of over 10 km. ARA is expected to be publicly released for broad community use starting in September 2023. Through this demo, we plan to share, for the first time, with the wireless research community the transformative research experiments enabled by ARA. To stimulate discussion and community participation, we will demonstrate a few example experiments ranging from MU-MIMO in TV White Space (TVWS) bands to long-range mmWave and microwave backhaul communications, as well as open-source 5G NR protocol stacks such as srsRAN and OpenAirInterface.
