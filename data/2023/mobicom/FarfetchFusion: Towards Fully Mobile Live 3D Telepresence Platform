We present FarfetchFusion, a fully mobile live 3D telepresence system. Enabling mobile live telepresence is a challenging problem as it requires i) realistic reconstruction of the user and ii) high responsiveness for immersive experience. We first thoroughly analyze the live 3D telepresence pipeline and identify three critical challenges: i) 3D data streaming latency and compression complexity, ii) computational complexity of volumetric fusion-based 3D reconstruction, and iii) inconsistent reconstruction quality due to sparsity of mobile 3D sensors. To tackle the challenges, we propose a disentangled fusion approach, which separates invariant regions and dynamically changing regions with our low-complexity spatio-temporal alignment technique, topology anchoring. We then design and implement an end-to-end system, which achieves realistic reconstruction quality comparable to existing server-based solutions while meeting the real-time performance requirements (<100 ms end-to-end latency, 30 fps throughput, <16 ms motion-to-photon latency) solely relying on mobile computation capability.
