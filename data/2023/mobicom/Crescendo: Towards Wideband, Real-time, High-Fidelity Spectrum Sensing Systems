Spectrum sensing systems provide real-time feedback essential for spectrum sharing. However, the growth of spectrum sharing is limited by the capabilities of these spectrum sensors. Sharing a new frequency band is only possible if sensors can detect activity in that band with sufficient time granularity and signal fidelity to meet spectrum sharing policy requirements. In this work, we introduce Crescendo, a system design that shows we can achieve wideband, real-time, high-fidelity spectrum sensing using sweeping spectrum sensors. We first provide an analysis that demonstrates there are operating points of sweeping sensors that can sense multiple popular protocols. Then we demonstrate these sensors can be built in practice with an adaptive gain super-heterodyne RF frontend with high-fidelity LO generation, and evaluate a prototype built with COTS components. In our benchmarks, Crescendo outperforms prior wideband spectrum sensors, achieving a 30 dB increase in dynamic range and 10 dB increase in SNR.
