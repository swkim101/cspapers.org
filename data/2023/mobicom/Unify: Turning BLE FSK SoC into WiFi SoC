With the potential for connecting billions of WiFi devices to low-power Bluetooth/FSK devices, WiFi-Bluetooth cross-technology communication (CTC) has drawn significant interests from academia and industry. However, state-of-the-art CTC solutions either are limited to one-way communication, or require multiple chips with hardware modifications. We present a novel solution, Unify, that eliminates both of these undesirable features. By just updating firmware, Unify transforms BLE/FSK SoCs (Systems-on-a-Chip) into WiFi SoCs. It enables bidirectional communication between BLE/FSK devices and unmodified WiFi APs/devices, and is compatible with products of all major WiFi chip vendors. Unify is a single-chip solution and requires no hardware modifications. Thanks to their high integration, Unify devices are smaller, cheaper and consume significantly less power than both off-the-shelf WiFi chips and prior WiFi-FSK CTC solutions.
