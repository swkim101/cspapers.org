This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of TaGroup, a fast, fine-grained, and robust grouping technique for RFIDs. It can achieve a nearly 100% accuracy in distinguishing multiple groups of closely located RFIDs, within only a few seconds. It would benefit many inventory tracking applications, such as self-checkout in retails and packaging quality control in logistics. We make two technical innovations. First, we propose a novel method which can measure the channels between multiple pairs of commercial RFID tags simultaneously, and then estimate the proximity relations between them based on the channel information. Second, we introduce a spatio-temporal graph model which captures a full picture of proximity relations among all the tags, based on which TaGroup can perform a robust grouping of the tags. These two designs together boost the grouping speed and accuracy of TaGroup. Our experiments show that in grouping 120 tags into 4 closely located groups, TaGroup can achieve a nearly 100% accuracy, at the cost of only 3 seconds.
