Enhancing the safety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) poses a significant research challenge in the context of connected mobility and a plethora of technological opportunities trying to balance efficiency and widespread applicability. This paper presents a demo focused on applying 5G Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) to address this challenge through the combination of commercial mobile devices, public cellular networks, and data fusion between vehicle positioning and city camera infrastructure. The demo showcases the designed system and its experimental evaluation in the Modena Automotive Smart Area (MASA) through the 5G MEC infrastructure of Telecom Italia (TIM) with the aim to build a secure and efficient connected mobility environment.
