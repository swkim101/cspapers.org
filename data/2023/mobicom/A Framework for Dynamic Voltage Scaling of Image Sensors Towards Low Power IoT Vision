Energy-efficient visual sensing is crucial for enabling battery-backed low power IoT and mobile applications. However, modern image sensors still exhibit high power consumption, primarily attributed to analog readout. This high power consumption arises from the conventional practice of supplying a fixed voltage to the analog circuitry of image sensors. Towards that end, we propose to aggressively scale analog voltage supplied to the camera as means to significantly reduce sensor power consumption. This demonstration showcases the potential of dynamic voltage scaling on commercial image sensors within an RPi-based video streaming pipeline. We enable users to flexibly configure sensor voltage settings and observe the impact on both image fidelity and sensor power consumption. Furthermore, this demonstration offers a framework for studying the implications of flexible voltage specification in the context of a person tracking application.
