Implantable and edible medical devices promise to provide continuous, directed, and comfortable healthcare treatments. Communicating with such devices and localizing them is a fundamental, but challenging, mobile networking problem. Recent work has focused on leveraging near field magnetism-based systems to avoid the challenges of attenuation, refraction, and reflection experienced by radio waves. However, these systems suffer from limited range, and require fingerprinting-based localization techniques. We present InnerCompass, a magnetic backscatter system for in-body communication and localization. InnerCompass relies on new magnetism-native design insights that enhance the range of these devices. We design the first analytical model for magnetic-field-based localization, that generalizes across different scenarios. We've implemented InnerCompass and evaluated it in porcine tissue. Our results show that Inner-Compass can communicate at 5 Kbps at a distance of 25 cm, and localize with an accuracy of 5 mm.
