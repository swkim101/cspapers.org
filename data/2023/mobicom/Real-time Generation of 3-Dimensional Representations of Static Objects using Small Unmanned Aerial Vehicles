Recent advances in robotics and nanotechnology resulted in a set of miniaturized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Such small UAVs are envisioned to operate in hard-to-reach areas for enabling applications such as structural monitoring or content capturing. Towards showcasing this vision, we demonstrate a small UAV-supported setup for real-time autonomous generation of 3-Dimensional (3D) representations of static objects. In the setup, a small UAV (i.e., CrazyFlie 2.1) is envisioned to visit a set of locations, acting as a carrier and power source of a camera sensor. At each location, the sensor is expected to take a picture of the object and report it to the station. The station implements a pipeline for 3D reconstruction based on the pictures taken by the UAV.
