Having been studied for more than a decade, Wi-Fi human sensing still faces a major challenge in the presence of multiple persons, simply because the limited bandwidth of Wi-Fi fails to provide a suficient range resolution to physically separate multiple subjects. Existing solutions mostly avoid this challenge by switching to radars with GHz bandwidth, at the cost of cumbersome deployments. Therefore, could Wi-Fi human sensing handle multiple subjects remains an open question. This paper presents MUSE-Fi, the first Wi-Fi multi-person sensing system with physical separability. The principle behind MUSE-Fi is that, given a Wi-Fi device (e.g., smartphone) very close to a subject, the near-field channel variation caused by the subject significantly overwhelms variations caused by other distant subjects. Consequently, focusing on the channel state information (CSI) carried by the trafic in and out of this device naturally allows for physically separating multiple subjects. Based on this principle, we propose three sensing strategies for MUSE-Fi: i) uplink CSI, ii) downlink CSI, and iii) downlink beamforming feedback, where we specifically tackle signal recovery from sparse (per-user) trafic under realistic multi-user communication scenarios. Our extensive evaluations clearly demonstrate that MUSE-Fi is able to successfully handle multi-person sensing with respect to three typical applications: respiration monitoring, gesture detection, and activity recognition.
