Wireless embedded systems assist us in collecting data from the physical world, through sensor data analysis, such systems allow us to understand our environment. However, deploying wireless embedded systems and analyzing the collected data remains significantly challenging. This is due to the steep learning curve required to implement custom machine-learning models and other algorithms for data analysis. Furthermore, it is also challenging to program individual embedded devices. The diversity of the available platforms and their capabilities further compounds this problem. In response, we introduce an end-to-end system, called the Otter. It facilitates simple sensor data collection using commodity-embedded platforms. Moreover, it employs a large language model to design a natural language interface for the analysis and extraction of useful information from the sensor data. We present our preliminary work on prototyping this system, applying it to a specific use case of hand gesture detection. Otter represents one of the first systems to leverage the enhanced capabilities of large language models for simplifying wireless embedded system deployments.
