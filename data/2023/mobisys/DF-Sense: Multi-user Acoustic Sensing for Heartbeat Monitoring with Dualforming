Acoustic sensing for heartbeat monitoring has become a prevailing research topic in wireless sensing. Existing acoustic sensing systems have two limitations---limited sensing range, and heartbeat monitoring for a single user only, hindering the large-scale deployment of applications. In this paper, we present DF-Sense, a Dual Forming based multi-user acoustic Sensing system for heartbeat monitoring in home settings. Specifically, we design a novel sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) enhancement model, namely Dualforming, based on the constructive superposition across multiple subcarriers and microphones, and further build the quantitative relationship between critical factors and SSNR enhancement to optimize sensing performance. To enable Dualforming, we propose a novel MUltiple Subtle SIgnal Classification (MUS2IC) method to identify multiple subjects with subtle motions. We implement DF-Sense using commercial acoustic devices and conduct extensive experiments in a home setting. Results show that DF-Sense achieves high precision measurement of instantaneous heart rate within the range of 10 m, which is sufficient for most daily space requirements, and is able to monitor heartbeat for up to 6 subjects in a 2-D space simultaneously.
