Web-based extended reality (WebXR) can enable lightweight, easy-to-access, and cross-platform augmented reality (AR) experiences. Context awareness is one key feature of AR. Supporting this in browser-based WebXR applications is challenging as typical object detection algorithms are too computationally demanding to be run in-browser, leading to slow response times and decreased battery life. In this demo, we show a WebXR AR application that uses a technique of WebRTC-based video streaming to obtain a usable video stream on an edge server to perform object detection.
