As client applications evolve with new businesses and features, new performance overheads may be introduced. For example, in the application startup scenario, the initialization of newly connected SDKs and the addition of disk access operations on the main thread can increase the startup time, leading to a decline in user experience. Traditional performance testing detects application indicators through automated testing, video frame splitting, or log tracking, but due to fluctuations in the offline environment, test results often fluctuate, and confidence is not high. To optimize performance in a more refined way, it is necessary to not only evaluate performance through indicators but also to pinpoint the cause of the problem accurately. Domino is a client-side performance testing platform based on Trace analysis. In this demonstration, we will provide two versions of AndroidDemo applications, simulate several performance issues, and use the Domino platform to more precisely locate performance problems and provide development repair suggestions.
