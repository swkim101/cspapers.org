Positioning is an enabler for many location-based services in the vertical industrial domain such as autonomous driving and robot-to-cobot interaction, to name a few. Industry and academia are actively enabling localization through 5G and WiFi as they are universally deployed. However, the current WiFi and 5G protocols cannot deal with the hard requirements of accuracy, latency, and robustness. To deal with that, we have proposed a series of works to enable precise, pervasive, and real-time positioning.
