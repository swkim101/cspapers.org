In this demonstration, we introduce the vulnerability of indices in unpooling autoencoders. We show that this small factor can be maliciously exploited by performing man-in-the-middle attacks to eavesdrop on the victim's data, resulting in reconstruction and adversarial attacks. Such attacks especially make systems that integrate collaborative inference operations vulnerable. This demo presentation will empirically show the feasibility of index-based attacks by launching reconstruction and adversarial attacks on embedded/mobile computing platforms.
