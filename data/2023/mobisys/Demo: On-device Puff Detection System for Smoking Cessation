Customized, on-device applications that provide timely interventions about smoking episodes are very helpful for smoking cessation. For this, real-time detection of smoking puffs are necessary through unobtrusive wearable devices. This work demonstrates auto-generated tiny puff detection models for on-device inference on low-power wearable devices.
