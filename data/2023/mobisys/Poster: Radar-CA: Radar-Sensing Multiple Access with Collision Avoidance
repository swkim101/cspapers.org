We propose a practical and efficient radar interference mitigation system, Radar-CA. Radar-CA overcomes the limitations of requiring any additional equipment or resources. Radar-CA transfers the access time estimation problem to a frequency estimation problem, enabling interference mitigation through a central controller, and our preliminary result shows that Radar-CA is capable of mitigating interference efficiently in a dense radar network.
