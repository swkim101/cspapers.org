We provide a survey and empirical comparison of the state-of-the-art in neural selective classification for NLP tasks. We also provide a methodological blueprint, including a novel metric called refinement that provides a calibrated evaluation of confidence functions for selective prediction. Finally, we supply documented, open-source code to support the future development of selective prediction techniques.
