Span-based nested named-entity recognition (NER) has a cubic-time complexity using avariant of the CYK algorithm. We show that by adding a supplementary structural constraint on the search space, nested NER has a quadratic-time complexity, that is the same asymptotic complexity than the non-nested case. The proposed algorithm covers a large part of three standard English benchmarks and delivers comparable experimental results.
