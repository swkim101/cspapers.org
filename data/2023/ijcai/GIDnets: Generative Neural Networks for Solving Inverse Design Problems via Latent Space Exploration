In a number of different fields, including Engeneering, Chemistry and Physics, the design of technological tools and device structures is increasingly supported by deep-learning based methods, which provide suggestions on crucial architectural choices based on the properties that these tools and structures should exhibit. The paper proposes a novel architecture, named GIDnet, to address this inverse design problem, which is based on exploring a suitably defined latent space associated with the possible designs. Among its distinguishing features, GIDnet is capable of identifying the most appropriate starting point for the exploration and of likely converging into a point corresponding to a design that is a feasible one. Results of a thorough experimental activity evidence that GIDnet outperforms earlier approaches in the literature.
