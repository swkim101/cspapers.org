Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are the promising models of neuromorphic vision recognition. The mean square error (MSE) and cross-entropy (CE) losses are widely applied to supervise the training of SNNs on neuromorphic datasets. However, the relevance between the output spike counts and predictions is not well modeled by the existing loss functions. This paper proposes a Spike Count Maximization (SCM) training approach for the SNN-based neuromorphic vision recognition model based on optimizing the output spike counts. The SCM is achieved by structural risk minimization (SRM) and a specially designed spike counting loss. The spike counting loss counts the output spikes of the SNN by using the L0-norm, and the SRM maximizes the distance between the margin boundaries of the classifier to ensure the generalization of the model. The SCM is non-smooth and non-differentiable, and we design a two-stage algorithm with fast convergence to solve the problem. Experiment results demonstrate that the SCM performs satisfactorily in most cases. Using the output spikes for prediction, the accuracies of SCM are 2.12%~16.50% higher than the popular training losses on the CIFAR10-DVS dataset.
