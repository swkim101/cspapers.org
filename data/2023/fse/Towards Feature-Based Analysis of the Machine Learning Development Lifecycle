The safety and trustworthiness of systems with components that are based on Machine Learning (ML) require an in-depth understanding and analysis of all stages in its Development Lifecycle (MLDL). High-level abstractions of desired functionalities, model behaviour, and data are called features, and they have been studied by different communities across all MLDL stages. In this paper, we propose to support Software Engineering analysis of the MLDL through features, calling it feature-based analysis of the MLDL. First, to achieve a shared understanding of features among different experts, we establish a taxonomy of existing feature definitions currently used in various MLDL stages. Through this taxonomy, we map features from different stages to each other, discover gaps and future research directions and identify areas of collaboration between Software Engineering and other MLDL experts.
