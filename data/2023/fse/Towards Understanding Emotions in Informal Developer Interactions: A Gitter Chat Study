Emotions play a significant role in teamwork and collaborative activities like software development. While researchers have analyzed developer emotions in various software artifacts (e.g., issues, pull requests), few studies have focused on understanding the broad spectrum of emotions expressed in chats. As one of the most widely used means of communication, chats contain valuable information in the form of informal conversations, such as negative perspectives about adopting a tool. In this paper, we present a dataset of developer chat messages manually annotated with a wide range of emotion labels (and sub-labels), and analyze the type of information present in those messages. We also investigate the unique signals of emotions specific to chats and distinguish them from other forms of software communication. Our findings suggest that chats have fewer expressions of Approval and Fear but more expressions of Curiosity compared to GitHub comments. We also notice that Confusion is frequently observed when discussing programming-related information such as unexpected software behavior. Overall, our study highlights the potential of mining emotions in developer chats for supporting software maintenance and evolution tools.
