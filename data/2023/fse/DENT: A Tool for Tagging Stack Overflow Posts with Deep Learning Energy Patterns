Energy efficiency has become an important consideration in deep learning systems. However, it remains a largely under-emphasized aspect during the development. Despite the emergence of energy-efficient deep learning patterns, their adoption remains a challenge due to limited awareness. To address this gap, we present DENT (Deep Learning Energy Pattern Tagger, a Chrome extension used to add "energy pattern tags" to the deep learning related questions from Stack Overflow. The idea of DENT is to hint to the developers about the possible energy-saving opportunities associated with the Stack Overflow post through energy pattern labels. We hope this will increase awareness about energy patterns in deep learning and improve their adoption. A preliminary evaluation of DENT achieved an average precision of 0.74, recall of 0.66, and an F1-score of 0.65 with an accuracy of 66%. The demonstration of the tool is available at https://youtu.be/S0Wf_w0xajw and the related artifacts are available at https://rishalab.github.io/DENT/
