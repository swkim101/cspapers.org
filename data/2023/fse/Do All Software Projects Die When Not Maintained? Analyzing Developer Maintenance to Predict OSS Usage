Abstract: Past research suggests software should be continuously maintained in order to remain useful in our digital society. To determine whether these studies on software evolution are supported in modern-day software libraries, we conduct a natural experiment on 26,050 GitHub repositories, statistically modeling library usage based on their package-level downloads against different factors related to project maintenance.
