Developerâ€™s commit messages contain information about decisions taken and their rationale. Extracting this information is challenging since we lack a detailed understanding of how developers express these concepts. Our work-in-progress targets this challenge by producing a labelled data set of commit messages for a Linux Kernel component. We report preliminary analyses which suggest that larger commit messages and more experienced developers commits tend towards having 40% of sentences containing rationale. This may indicate a guideline for developers to target.
