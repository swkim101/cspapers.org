We address the problem of constraint encoding explosion which hinders the applicability of state merging in symbolic execution. Specifically, our goal is to reduce the number of disjunctions and if-then-else expressions introduced during state merging. The main idea is to dynamically partition the symbolic states into merging groups according to a similar uniform structure detected in their path constraints, which allows to efficiently encode the merged path constraint and memory using quantifiers. To address the added complexity of solving quantified constraints, we propose a specialized solving procedure that reduces the solving time in many cases. Our evaluation shows that our approach can lead to significant performance gains.
