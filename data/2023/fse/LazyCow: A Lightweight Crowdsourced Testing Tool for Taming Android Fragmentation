Android fragmentation refers to the increasing variety of Android devices and operating system versions. Their number make it impossible to test an app on every supported device, resulting in many device compatibility issues and leading to poor user experiences. To mitigate this, a number of works that automatically detect compatibility issues have been proposed. However, current state-of-the-art techniques can only be used to detect specific types of compatibility issues (i.e., compatibility issues caused by API signature evolution), i.e., many other essential categories of compatibility issues are still unknown. For instance, customised OS versions on real devices and semantic OS modifications could result in severe compatibility issues that are difficult to detect statically. In order to address this research gap and facilitate the prospect of taming Android frag- mentation through crowdsourced efforts, we propose LazyCow, a novel, lightweight, crowdsourced testing tool. Our experimental results involving thousands of test cases on real Android devices demonstrate that LazyCow is effective at autonomously identifying and validating API-induced compatibility issues. The source code of both client side and server side are all made publicly available in our artifact package. A demo video of our tool is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xzWv_mo5xQ.
