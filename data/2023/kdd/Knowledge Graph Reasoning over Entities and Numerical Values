A complex logic query in a knowledge graph refers to a query expressed in logic form that conveys a complex meaning, such as where did the Canadian Turing award winner graduate from? Knowledge graph reasoning-based applications, such as dialogue systems and interactive search engines, rely on the ability to answer complex logic queries as a fundamental task. In most knowledge graphs, edges are typically used to either describe the relationships between entities or their associated attribute values. An attribute value can be in categorical or numerical format, such as dates, years, sizes, etc. However, existing complex query answering (CQA) methods simply treat numerical values in the same way as they treat entities. This can lead to difficulties in answering certain queries, such as which Australian Pulitzer award winner is born before 1927, and which drug is a pain reliever and has fewer side effects than Paracetamol. In this work, inspired by the recent advances in numerical encoding and knowledge graph reasoning, we propose numerical complex query answering. In this task, we introduce new numerical variables and operations to describe queries involving numerical attribute values. To address the difference between entities and numerical values, we also propose the framework of Number Reasoning Network (NRN) for alternatively encoding entities and numerical values into separate encoding structures. During the numerical encoding process, NRN employs a parameterized density function to encode the distribution of numerical values. During the entity encoding process, NRN uses established query encoding methods for the original CQA problem. Experimental results show that NRN consistently improves various query encoding methods on three different knowledge graphs and achieves state-of-the-art results.
