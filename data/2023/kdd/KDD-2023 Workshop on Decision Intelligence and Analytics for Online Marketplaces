Online marketplace is a digital platform that connects buyers (demand) and sellers (supply) and provides exposure opportunities that individual participants would not otherwise have access to. Online marketplaces exist in a diverse set of domains and industries, for example, rideshare (Lyft, DiDi, Uber), house rental (Airbnb), real estate (Beke), online retail (Amazon, Ebay), and food ordering and delivery (Doordash, Meituan). Besides academia, many companies and institutions are researching on topics specific to their particular domains. The fundamental mechanism of an online marketplace is to match supply and demand to generate transactions, with objectives considering service quality, participants experience, financial and operational efficiency. It is valuable to bring together researchers and practitioners from different application domains to discuss their experiences, challenges, and opportunities to leverage cross-domain knowledge. The goal of this workshop is to offer an opportunity to appreciate the diversity in applications, to draw connections to inform decision optimization across different industries, and to discover new problems that are fundamental to marketplaces of different domains. The previous version of this workshop at KDD-2022 was a tremendous success in terms of participation, technical contribution, and community interest. This updated version of the workshop is especially timely to cover the issues and algorithms pertinent to general online marketplaces, specific problems and applications arising from those diverse domains, as well as emerging topics such as competition and resilience to market condition shifts.
