Detecting stress via user's social media posts has attracted increasing research interests in recent years. The majority of the methods leverage word embeddings to represent each of the posted words as a vector, and then perform classification on a sequence of word vectors. To enhance the performance of distinguishing words/phrases related to stressors and stressful emotions from others, in this study, we present a stress-specific word embedding learning framework upon the pre-trained language model BERT. Specifically, we formulate three self-supervised contrastive learning tasks with a joint learning objective. (1) The stressor discrimination task, which is designed to allow the framework to be sensitive to words/phrases about stressors. (2) The stressor cluster discrimination task, which is designed to allow the framework to distinguish stressors into different categories. (3) The stressful emotion discrimination task, which is designed to allow the framework to grasp words/phrases about stressful emotions. Our performance study shows that the learned stress-specific word embedding can significantly benefit social media based stress detection tasks, especially in the more practical scenarios with insufficient labeled data. Besides, we build two user-level social media based stress detection datasets that can help train machine learning models to facilitate human well-being.
