Research has shown that police officer involved shootings, misconduct and excessive use of force complaints exhibit network effects, where officers are at greater risk of being involved in these incidents when they socialize with officers who have a history of use of force and misconduct. In this work, we first construct a network survival model for the time-to-event of use of force incidents involving new police trainees. The model includes network effects of the diffusion of risk from field training officer (FTO) to trainee. We then introduce a network rewiring algorithm to maximize the expected time to use of force events upon completion of field training. We study several versions of the algorithm, including constraints that encourage demographic diversity of FTOs. Using data from Indianapolis, we show that rewiring the network can increase the expected time (in days) of a recruit's first use of force incident by 8%. We then discuss the potential benefits and challenges associated with implementing such an algorithm in practice.
