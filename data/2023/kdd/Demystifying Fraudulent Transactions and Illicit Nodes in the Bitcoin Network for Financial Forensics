Blockchain provides the unique and accountable channel for financial forensics by mining its open and immutable transaction data. A recent surge has been witnessed by training machine learning models with cryptocurrency transaction data for anomaly detection, such as money laundering and other fraudulent activities. This paper presents a holistic applied data science approach to fraud detection in the Bitcoin network with two original contributions. First, we contribute the Elliptic++dataset, which extends the Elliptic transaction dataset to include over 822k Bitcoin wallet addresses (nodes), each with 56 features, and 1.27M temporal interactions. This enables both the detection of fraudulent transactions and the detection of illicit addresses (actors) in the Bitcoin network by leveraging four types of graph data: (i) the transaction-to-transaction graph, representing the money flow in the Bitcoin network, (ii) the address-to-address interaction graph, capturing the types of transaction flows between Bitcoin addresses, (iii) the address-transaction graph, representing the bi-directional money flow between addresses and transactions (BTC flow from input address to one or more transactions and BTC flow from a transaction to one or more output addresses), and (iv) the user entity graph, capturing clusters of Bitcoin addresses representing unique Bitcoin users. Second, we perform fraud detection tasks on all four graphs by using diverse machine learning algorithms. We show that adding enhanced features from the address-to-address and the address-transaction graphs not only assists in effectively detecting both illicit transactions and illicit addresses, but also assists in gaining in-depth understanding of the root cause of money laundering vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency transactions and the strategies for fraud detection and prevention.
