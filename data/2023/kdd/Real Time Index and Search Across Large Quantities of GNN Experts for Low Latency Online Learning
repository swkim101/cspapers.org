Online learning is a powerful technique that allows models to adjust to concept drift in dynamically changing graphs. This approach is crucial for large mobility-based companies like Grab, where batch-learning methods fail to keep up with the large amount of training data. Our work focuses on scaling graph neural network mixture of expert (MoE) models for real-time traffic speed prediction on road networks, while meeting high accuracy and low latency requirements. Conventional spatio-temporal and incremental MoE frameworks struggle with poor inference accuracy and linear time complexity when scaling experts, for the latter, leading to prohibitively high latency in model updates. To address this issue, we introduce the Indexed Router, a novel method that categorizes experts into a structured hierarchy called the indexed tree. This approach reduces the time to scale and search N number of experts from O(N) to O(log N), making it ideal for online learning under tight service level agreements. Our experiments show that these time savings do not compromise inference accuracy, and our Indexed Router outperforms state-of-the-art spatio-temporal and incremental MoE models in terms of traffic speed prediction accuracy on real-life GPS traces from Grab's database and publicly available records. In summary, the Indexed Router enables MoE models to scale across large numbers of experts with low latency, while accurately identifying the relevant experts for inference.
