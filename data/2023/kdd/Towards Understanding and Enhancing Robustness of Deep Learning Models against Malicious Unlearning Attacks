Given the availability of abundant data, deep learning models have been advanced and become ubiquitous in the past decade. In practice, due to many different reasons (e.g., privacy, usability, and fidelity), individuals also want the trained deep models to forget some specific data. Motivated by this, machine unlearning (also known as selective data forgetting) has been intensively studied, which aims at removing the influence that any particular training sample had on the trained model during the unlearning process. However, people usually employ machine unlearning methods as trusted basic tools and rarely have any doubt about their reliability. In fact, the increasingly critical role of machine unlearning makes deep learning models susceptible to the risk of being maliciously attacked. To well understand the performance of deep learning models in malicious environments, we believe that it is critical to study the robustness of deep learning models to malicious unlearning attacks, which happen during the unlearning process. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we first demonstrate that malicious unlearning attacks pose immense threats to the security of deep learning systems. Specifically, we present a broad class of malicious unlearning attacks wherein maliciously crafted unlearning requests trigger deep learning models to misbehave on target samples in a highly controllable and predictable manner. In addition, to improve the robustness of deep learning models, we also present a general defense mechanism, which aims to identify and unlearn effective malicious unlearning requests based on their gradient influence on the unlearned models. Further, theoretical analyses are conducted to analyze the proposed methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the vulnerabilities of deep learning models to malicious unlearning attacks and the effectiveness of the introduced defense mechanism.
