We propose algebraic protocols that enable the definition of protocol templates and session types analogous to the definition of domain-specific types with algebraic datatypes. Parameterized algebraic protocols subsume all regular as well as most context-free and nested session types and, at the same time, replace the expensive superlinear algorithms for type checking by a nominal check that runs in linear time. Algebraic protocols in combination with polymorphism increase expressiveness and modularity by facilitating new ways of parameterizing and composing session types.
