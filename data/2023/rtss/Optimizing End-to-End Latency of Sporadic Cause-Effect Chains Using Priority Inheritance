Analysis and optimization of end-to-end latency in cause-effect chains is an important problem in real-time systems. Under task-level fixed-priority scheduling, the end-to-end latency largely relies on the relative priority of the tasks in the chain, so previous work has tried to improve the latency via priority assignment. However, the improvement of static priority assignment is limited due to the conflict between schedulability of individual tasks and end-to-end latency of the chain, i.e., a priority assignment leading to good end-to-end latency may make the task set unschedulable. This work proposes a novel method named Dynamic Priority Inheritance Protocol (DPI) to optimize the end-to-end latency of sporadic cause-effect chains. Under DPI, the propagation delay between two communicating jobs is independent of the task relative priority. So the optimization can work on any priority assignment, and no longer conflicts with task schedulability. Moreover, we propose DPI-B, a combination of DPI and a Buffer Manipulation Protocol, for cause-effect chains that also need to meet the determinism requirement. We conduct experiments with both automotive benchmarks and randomly generated workload. The results show the effectiveness of our method in comparison with the state-of-the-art.
