Due to the emergence of parallel architectures and parallel programming frameworks, modern real-time applications are often composed of parallel tasks that can occupy multiple processors at the same time. Among parallel task models, gang scheduling has received much attention in recent years due to its performance efficiency and applicability to parallel architectures such as graphics processing units. Despite this attention, the soft real-time (SRT) scheduling of gang tasks has received little attention. This paper, for the first time, considers the SRT-feasibility problem for gang tasks. Necessary and sufficient feasibility conditions are presented that relate the SRT-feasibility problem to the HRT-feasibility problem of "equivalent" task systems. Based on these conditions, intractability results for SRT gang scheduling are derived. This paper also presents server-based scheduling policies, corresponding schedulability tests, and an improved schedulability condition for the global-earliest-deadline-first (GEDF) scheduling of gang tasks. Moreover, GEDF is shown to be non-optimal in scheduling SRT gang tasks.
