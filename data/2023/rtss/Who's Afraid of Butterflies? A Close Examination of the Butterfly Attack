The Butterfly Attack, introduced in an RTSS 2019 paper, was billed as a new kind of timing attack against control loops in cyber-physical systems. We conduct a close inspection of the Butterfly Attack in order to identify the root vulnerability that it exploits, and show that an appropriate application of real-time scheduling theory provides an effective countermeasure. We propose improved defenses against this and similar attacks by drawing upon techniques from real-time scheduling theory, control theory, and systems implementation, that are both provably secure and are able to make efficient use of computing resources.
