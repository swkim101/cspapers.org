Recently, researchers have demonstrated multiple-bits-per-cell (MBPC) data storage using resistive random access memory (RRAM) device technologies. In MBPC storage, a level allocation algorithm identifies a level allocation that maps resistance ranges to bit combinations. State-of-the-art level allocation algorithms, such as sigma-based allocation (SBA), fit cell characterization data to parameterized distributions and then use distribution parameters (i.e., programmed resistance standard deviation Ïƒ) to find level allocations. However, from the datasets we collected, the data points do not actually conform to the chosen distribution, and therefore the real-world analog behaviors are poorly approximated by the parameterized distribution-based approach. We present PBA, a percentile-based level allocation algorithm that computes level allocations directly from characterization data. We show that PBA level allocations have 30%-71% lower bit-error rates and 22%-41% lower ECC storage overheads than SBA on three fabricated RRAM storage arrays.
