Constant coefficient multipliers are widely used in digital signal processing and machine learning architectures. Researchers have proposed HBU-CCM (hybrid binary-unary constant coefficient multiplier), which is an approximate method that outperforms conventional binary and FloPoCo-KCM (table-based real multiplier) methods in terms of hardware cost at the expense of accuracy due to aliasing issues. SimBU (self-similarity-based hybrid binary-unary) is another method that was recently proposed to implement general nonlinear functions using self-similarities leading to few hardware resources. In this work, we use a simplified version of the SimBU algorithm to address the aliasing issues of HBU-CCM and improve accuracy. We also implement a convolution kernel for a Gaussian blurring filter to evaluate our method and compare it to previous works. Our method outperforms conventional binary and FloPoCo-KCM methods in terms of hardware cost with desired accuracy and with no aliasing error as opposed to HBU-CCM.
