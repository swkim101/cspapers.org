Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown much promise in resolving sophisticated scientific problems with non-Euclidean data, such as traffic prediction, disease classification, and many others. However, the irregular sparsity of real-world graphs remains a major challenge toward efficient GCN acceleration. In this paper, we propose SAGA, a Sparsity-Agnostic Graph Convolutional Accelerator with near-optimal workload balance. Specifically, it consists of two unique features, an NZ-based scheduling, and a novel accelerator architecture. Unlike conventional GCN accelerators with uneven distribution of sparse matrix, the proposed NZ-based scheduling leverages the metadata encoded in the compression format to enable even distribution of sparse matrix at runtime, thus achieving near-optimal workload balancing. In addition, the proposed architecture, including a task scheduler, an accumulation table, and a partial row accumulation unit, can support the proposed NZ-based scheduling without data preprocessing and reformatting with low overheads. We prototyped the proposed design through FPGAs, and our evaluation results show that SAGA achieves up to $\mathbf{1.56}\times$ speedup and $\mathbf{2.05}\times$ energy savings on average as compared to the prior art [1].
