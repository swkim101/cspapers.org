Three-dimensional (3D) point cloud has been employed in a wide range of applications recently. As a powerful weapon for point cloud analysis, point-based point cloud neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated superior performance with less computation complexity and parameters, compared to sparse 3D convolution-based networks and graph-based convolutional neural networks. However, point-based PNNs still suffer from high computational redundancy, large off-chip memory access, and low parallelism in hardware implementation, thereby hindering the applications on edge devices. In this paper, to address these challenges, an energy-efficient 3D point cloud neural network accelerator is proposed for on-chip edge computing. An efficient filter pruning scheme is used to skip the redundant convolution of pruned filters and zero-value feature channels. A block-wise multi-layer perceptron (MLP) fusion method is proposed to increase the on-chip reuse of features, thereby reducing off-chip memory access. A dual-stream blocking technique is proposed for higher parallelism while maintaining inference accuracy. Implemented in an industrial 28-nm CMOS technology, the proposed accelerator achieves an effective energy efficiency of 12.65 TOPS/W and 0.13 mJ/frame energy consumption for PointNeXt-S at 100 MHz, 0.9 V supply voltage, and 8-bit data width. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud neural network accelerators, the proposed accelerator enhances the energy efficiency by up to 66.6× and reduces the energy consumption per frame by up to 70.2×.
