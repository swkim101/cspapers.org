3D heterogeneous integration enables the integration of multiple heterogeneous chiplets into the same package with the effective reduction of package size and interconnection latency. According to the market requirement, chiplets with robust re-usability and effective cost reduction can be selected from a library to form different package products for enlarging total profit. Since die-to-wafer (D2W) bonding enables the chiplets with different sizes to be bonded in a package, it is a more flexible option for 3D heterogeneous integration compared with the conventional wafer-to-wafer (W2W) bonding. However, this promising technique creates new issues, including 1) flexible chiplet bonding enabling more than one chiplet to be bonded with a base chiplet to construct multiple products and 2) degraded bonding leading to the degradation of performance. In this work, a distributed integer-linear-programming-based (ILP-based) method is proposed to efficiently maximize the profits of multiple package products considering the issues of cost-addition 3D heterogeneous integration with D2W bonding. Compared with the baseline, the distributed ILP-based method can achieve the best profits while achieving a 5.96X speedup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to solve the multi-product optimization problem for 3D heterogeneous integration with D2W bonding.
