The Electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electrical cardiac activity generated by the heart to detect abnormal heartbeats and heart attacks. However, the irregular occurrence of the abnormalities demands continuous monitoring of heartbeats. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to automate this task, reducing the labor required during monitoring. In recent years, many companies have launched products with ECG monitoring and irregular heartbeat alerts. Among all classification algorithms, the time series-based algorithm dynamic time warping (DTW) is widely adopted to undertake the ECG classification task. Though progress has been achieved, the DTW-based ECG classification also introduces a new attack vector: the potential leakage of patients' diagnostic results. This paper investigates the potential of side channel-assisted inference attacks on the prevalent DTW-based ECG classification model. In particular, we first identify a vulnerability of DTW for ECG classification, that is, the correlation between warping path choice and prediction results. Based on the vulnerability, we further leverage two types of side-channel attacks, i.e., cache-based side-channel attack Flus+Reload, and trace-based side-channel attack with hardware performance counters, to assess the potential of stealing machine learning-based ECG input samples' labels. Afterward, we build prototypes that leverage Flush+Reload and hardware performance counters to monitor warping path selection with training ECG data, and then construct a predictor to establish a relation between side-channel observations and labels of input ECG samples. Based on experiments, we find that the Flush+Reload-based inference leakage can achieve up to 92.1% and 81.1% attack success rate with Flush+Reload and hardware performance counters to identify the labels of the two ECG samples in DTW.
