LUT-based synthesis methods have recently been proposed as a way to synthesize quantum Boolean circuits in a qubit constrained environment. Other results have also shown that allowing a relative phase when implementing quantum Boolean circuits yields an advantage in T-count without additional ancilla qubits, which is advantageous in the fault-tolerant quantum computing paradigm. We propose a method that utilizes both LUT-based synthesis and relative phase quantum Boolean circuits which minimize the T-count while minimizing the ancilla required to implement them. We leverage recent results regarding relative phase versions of Boolean functions and Shannon's decomposition to propose a novel method to synthesize arbitrary Boolean functions up to a relative phase. We then utilize this method to synthesize Boolean logic inside each LUT as a relative phase quantum Boolean circuit and show that the resulting quantum circuit has a clear advantage in T-count over more naive methods.
