Systolic array designs have regained popularity in recent years, particularly for their applications in accelerating CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) computing in hardware, including on FPGAs. However, existing FPGA layout techniques are primarily designed for general-purpose applications and have not fully leveraged the regularity of systolic arrays to enhance solution quality. This paper presents a new algorithmic approach for systolic array placement on FPGAs. Our approach enables 23% â€“ 25% wirelength reduction for CNN circuits compared to an industrial tool and state-of-the-art academic methods. Moreover, it usually leads to significantly reduced routing resource utilization, accelerated placement runtime and improved timing performance.
