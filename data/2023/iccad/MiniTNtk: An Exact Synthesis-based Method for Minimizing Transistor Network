Transistor network minimization is an important step in designing new standard cells. Existing methods for minimizing transistor networks all rely on some heuristic techniques. Hence, there is still room for further improvement. In this work, we propose MiniTNtk, an exact synthesis-based method for minimizing transistor networks. It models the generation of the transistor network for a Boolean function as a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem and can return a transistor network with the fewest transistors. Furthermore, sometimes, it is necessary to limit the number of transistors in series. We propose an extension of MiniTNtk for minimizing the transistor network under a bound on the number of transistors in series. The experimental results showed that MiniTNtk is the first method that achieves the optimal transistor networks for a set of Boolean functions with known optimal solutions to the best of our knowledge. Additionally, compared with related works, MiniTNtk reduces the number of transistors by up to 9.39% over all 4-input P-class representative functions. Moreover, the experiment on a complex Boolean function demonstrated the high efficiency of MiniTNtk.
