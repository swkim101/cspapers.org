Quantum circuit serves as a popular programming model that describes the computation using a set of quantum gates, which requires generating a sequence of pulses that collect the operation of each gate for superconducting quantum devices. However, existing quantum synthesis frameworks, like IBM OpenPulse [1], involve massive redundant computation during pulse generation, suffering from a high computational cost when handling large-scale circuits. In this paper, we propose QPulseLib, a novel library with reusable pulses that can directly provide the pulse of a circuit block. To establish this library, we transform the circuit and apply convolutional operators to extract reusable patterns and pre-calculate their resultant pulses. Then, we develop a matching algorithm to identify such patterns shared by the target circuit. Experiments show that QPulseLib achieves 158.46 × and 16.03 × speedup for pulse generation, compared to OpenPulse and AccQOC [2].
