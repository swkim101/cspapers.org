Designing analog integrated circuits (ICs), particularly sensors and reference circuits, requires a significant amount of human expertise and time, largely due to the requirement of maintaining process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) consistency. So far, there has been plenty of work on tuning the circuit to meet the PVT consistency requirements by comparing the offset of the DC operating point, but this inevitably leads to circuit performance degradation. To improve, we propose a ‘PVT-Transfer’ framework that utilizes knowledge transfer among PVT corners through evolutionary multitasking. Specifically, via cross-operating the circuit parameters under different PVT corners, knowledge is transferred through parameter migration to improve the robustness of the circuit. Further, PVT-Transfer employs data-driven learning to identify potential similarities among PVT variations, thereby leading to more cost-effective optimization. This framework is evaluated on two voltage references and compared with four state-of-the-art circuit sizing methods. The post-layout Monte-Carlo simulation results verify that PVT-Transfer outperforms the existing methods. It reduces the number of simulations required by 60% compared to the GCN-RL method. Besides, PVT-transfer achieves up to 10× improvement in the figure of merit over the human design.
