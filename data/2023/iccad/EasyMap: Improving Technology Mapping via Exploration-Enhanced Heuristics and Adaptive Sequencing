Technology mapping is a crucial step in the logic synthesis in chip design e.g. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) design, where a logic network is transformed into a K-bounded lookup tables (K-LUTs) network. Traditional mapping algorithms converges quickly to a suboptimal result, which limits the exploration capacity for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a new mapping method called Exploration-enhanced heuristics and Adaptive sequencing for Technology Mapping (EasyMap). EasyMap includes a pool of new heuristics and considers the mapping exploration as a conditional sequence optimization problem. During the mapping exploration procedure, heuristic algorithms with specific parameters are selected and applied sequentially. Our EasyMap outperforms the widely used IfMap in ABC by a significant margin. In particular, when optimizing area with a level constraint, EasyMap outperforms IfMap by reducing 9.1% more area on arithmetic circuits of the EPFL benchmark. Moreover, when optimizing area without level constraints at the same time, EasyMap can reduce 19% more area than IfMap on arithmetic circuits.
