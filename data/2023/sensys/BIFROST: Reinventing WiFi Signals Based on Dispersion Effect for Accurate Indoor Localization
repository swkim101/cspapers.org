WiFi-based device localization is a key enabling technology for smart applications, which has attracted numerous research studies in the past decade. Most of the existing approaches rely on Line-of-Sight (LoS) signals to work, while a critical problem is often neglected: In the real-world indoor environments, WiFi signals are everywhere, but very few of them are usable for accurate localization. As a result, the localization accuracy in practice is far from being satisfactory. This paper presents Bifrost, a novel hardwaresoftware co-design for accurate indoor localization. The core idea of Bifrost is to reinvent WiFi signals, so as to provide sufficient LoS signals for localization. This is realized by exploiting the dispersion effect of signals emitted by the leaky wave antenna (LWA). We present a low-cost plug-in design of LWA that can generate orthogonal polarized signals: On one hand, LWA disperses signals of different frequencies to different angles, thus providing Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) information for the localized target. On the other hand, the target further leverages the antenna polarization mismatch to distinguish AoAs from different LWAs. In the software layer, fine-grained information in Channel State Information (CSI) is exploited to cope with multipath and noise. We implement Bifrost and evaluate its performance under various settings. The results show that the median localization error of Bifrost is 0.81m, which is 52.35% less than that of SpotFi, a state-of-the-art approach. SpotFi, when combined with Bifrost to work in the realistic settings, can reduce the localization error by 33.54%.
