Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) is an emerging technology that enables physical-layer direct communication from a WiFi sender to other Internet of Things (IoT) receivers via waveform emulation. The previous works use the reverse engineering to find the appropriate WiFi payload that can emulate the waveform similar to the desired IoT packet in the format of the IoT protocol (e.g., ZigBee). Unfortunately, the reverse engineering approach suffers from many limitations, such as being non-reversible and unscalable, misaligning symbols, and over-relying on empiricism. In this work, we present XiTuXi, a one-size-fits-all solution to automatically achieve the CTC by taking advantage of the neural machine translation (NMT), inspired by the task comparability between CTC and homophony-based cross-linguistic communication. We employ a well-known NMT model called Transformer to learn the bit-sequence to bit-sequence translation rationale behind the CTC without human intervention. Particularly, we introduce the forward engineering to address the dilemma of acquiring training datasets. By using XiTuXi, we achieved the CTC with 30 protocol combinations (ie., 802.11b, g, n, ax, ah Ã… ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, and Sigfox) effortlessly, which ultimately liberates the experts from previous tedious tasks.
