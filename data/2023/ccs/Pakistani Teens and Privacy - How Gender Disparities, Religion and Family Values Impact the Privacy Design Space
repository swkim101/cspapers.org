The understanding of how teenagers perceive, manage and perform privacy is less well-understood in spaces outside of Western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic countries. To fill this gap we interviewed 30 teens to investigate the privacy perceptions, practices, and experienced digital harms of young people in Pakistan, a particularly interesting context as privacy in this context is not seen as an individual right or performed within an individualistic framework but instead is influenced by a combination of factors including social norms, family dynamics and religious beliefs. Based on our findings, we developed four personas to systematize the needs and values of this specific population and then conducted focus groups with co-design activities to further explore privacy conflicts. Among other things that confirm and extend existing theories on teen's privacy practices and perceptions, our findings suggest that young women are disproportionately impacted by privacy violations and the harms extend beyond themselves to include their families.
