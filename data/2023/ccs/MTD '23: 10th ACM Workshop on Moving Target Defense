The tenth ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD) is held on November 26, 2023, in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The main objective of the workshop is to discuss novel randomization, diversification, and dynamism techniques for computer systems and network, new metric and analysis frameworks to assess and quantify the effectiveness of MTD, and discuss challenges and opportunities that such defenses provide. We have constructed an exciting and diverse program of six refereed papers, and two invited keynote talks that will provide the participants with a vibrant and thought-provoking set of ideas and insights.
