Proof of Storage-Time (PoST) is a cryptographic primitive that enables a server to demonstrate non-interactive continuous availability of outsourced data in a publicly verifiable way. In this work, we propose Attestor, a stateless transparent proof-of-storage-time scheme with simple proofs and efficient publicly output verification without using trapdoors and incurring any extra overheads in the setup phase. We design our PoST protocol, Attestor, using: a standard VDF scheme with proof aggregation.
