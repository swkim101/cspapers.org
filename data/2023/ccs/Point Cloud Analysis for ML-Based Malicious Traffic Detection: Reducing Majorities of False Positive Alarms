As an emerging security paradigm, machine learning (ML) based malicious traffic detection is an essential part of automatic defense against network attacks. Powered by dedicated traffic features, the ML based methods can detect various sophisticated attacks, in particular capturing zero-day attacks, which cannot be achieved by the traditional non-ML methods. However, false positive alarms raised by these advanced ML methods become the major obstacle to real-world deployment. These methods require experts to manually analyze false positives, which incurs significant labor costs. Thus, it is vital that we can reduce such false positives without heavyweight manual investigations. In this paper, we propose pVoxel, an unsupervised method that identifies false positives for existing ML based traffic detection systems without requiring any prior knowledge on the alarms. To effectively process each alarm, pVoxel treats the traffic feature vector associated with the alarm as a point in the traffic feature space, and utilizes point cloud analysis to capture the topological features among the points for classifying the alarms. In particular, we aggregate the points into voxels, i.e., high-dimensional cubes, which allows us to develop an unsupervised method to identify the voxels indicating false positives according to their density features. Our experiments with 75 real-world datasets demonstrate that pVoxel can effectively reduce 95.55% false positives for 11 state-of-the-art traffic detection methods under various settings. Meanwhile, pVoxel can handle 201.10 thousand alarms per second, which demonstrates that it can achieve efficient alarm processing.
