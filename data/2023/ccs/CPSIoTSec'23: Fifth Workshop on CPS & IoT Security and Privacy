The fifth Workshop on CPS & IoT Security and Privacy is set to take place in Copenhagen, Denmark, on November 26, 2023, in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'23). This workshop marks the amalgamation of two workshops held in 2019: one focused on the security and privacy of cyber-physical systems, while the other one centered on the security and privacy of IoT. The primary objective of this workshop is to create a collaborative forum that brings together academia, industry experts, and governmental entities, encouraging them to contribute cutting-edge research, share demonstrations or hands-on experiences, and engage in discussions. This year, our call for contributions encompassed a broad spectrum, including mature research papers, work in progress submissions, and Systematization of Knowledge papers. The workshop program includes five full-length papers on the security and privacy of CPS/IoT, alongside five shorter papers that present original work-in-progress. Furthermore, the workshop will feature two distinguished keynote presentation, offering insights into the field, and a demonstration to provide a practical dimension to the discussions.
