This work presents HPCG (short for hardware-assisted pseudorandom correlation generator), a work-in-progress lightweight TEE (LTEE)-assisted MPC solution for both high performance and strong security. HPCG relies on a succinct codebase and small LTEE chips that work only in the MPC offline phase, with the aim of addressing efficiency bottlenecks in traditional MPC, while minimizing the use and trust in secure hardware, which makes a rational compromise between pure cryptography and TEE techniques. We design HPCG to work for diverse MPC settings in the preprocessing model and conform to the mainstream secret-sharing semantics, making it easy to deploy and integrate into existing MPC practices.
