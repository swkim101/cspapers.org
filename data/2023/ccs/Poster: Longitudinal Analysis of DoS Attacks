Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks have become a regular occurrence in the digital world of today. Easy-to-use attack software via download and botnet services that can be rented cheaply in the darknet enable adversaries to conduct such attacks without requiring a comprehensive knowledge of the techniques. To investigate this threat, we conduct a study on DoS attacks that occurred between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2022. We gather statistics regarding the victims and on how the attacks were conducted. Furthermore, we show possible side effects of such attacks on critical Internet infrastructure. This study provides interesting insights as well as observations and is useful for researchers and experts for developing defenses to mitigate DoS attacks. We therefore make our dataset publicly available.
