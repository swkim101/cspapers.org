We present MARS (Metadata Augmented Real-time Streaming), a system that enables game-aware streaming interfaces for Twitch. Current streaming interfaces provide a video stream of gameplay and a chat channel for conversation, but do not allow viewers to interact with game content independently from the steamer or other viewers. With MARS, a Unity game’s metadata is rendered in real-time onto a Twitch viewer’s interface. The metadata can then power viewer-side interfaces that are aware of the streamer’s game activity and provide new capacities for viewers. Use cases include providing contextual information (e.g. clicking on a unit to learn more), improving accessibility (e.g. slowing down text presentation speed), and supporting novel stream-based game designs (e.g. asymmetric designs where the viewers know more than the streamer). We share the details of MARS’ architecture and capabilities in this paper, and showcase a working prototype for each of our three proposed use cases.
