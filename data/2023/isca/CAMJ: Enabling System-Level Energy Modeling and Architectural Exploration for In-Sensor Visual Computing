CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) are fundamental to emerging visual computing applications. While conventional CIS are purely imaging devices for capturing images, increasingly CIS integrate processing capabilities such as Deep Neural Network (DNN). Computational CIS expand the architecture design space, but to date no comprehensive energy model exists. This paper proposes CamJ, a detailed energy modeling framework that provides a component-level energy breakdown for computational CIS and is validated against nine recent CIS chips. We use CamJ to demonstrate three use-cases that explore architectural trade-offs including computing in vs. off CIS, 2D vs. 3D-stacked CIS design, and analog vs. digital processing inside CIS.
