Piecewise constant curvature is a popular kinematics framework for continuum robots. Computing the model parameters from the desired end pose, known as the inverse kinematics problem, is fundamental in manipulation, tracking and planning tasks. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-solution solver to address the inverse kinematics problem of 3-section constant-curvature robots by bridging both the theoretical reduction and numerical correction. We derive analytical conditions to simplify the original problem into a one-dimensional problem. Further, the equivalence of the two problems is formalised. In addition, we introduce an approximation with bounded error so that the one dimension becomes traversable while the remaining parameters analytically solvable. With the theoretical results, the global search and numerical correction are employed to implement the solver. The experiments validate the better efficiency and higher success rate of our solver than the numerical methods when one solution is required, and demonstrate the ability of obtaining multiple solutions with optimal path planning in a space with obstacles.
