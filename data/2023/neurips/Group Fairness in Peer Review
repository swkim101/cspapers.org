In the past few years, conferences like AAAI and NeurIPS have grown tremendously. While on the one hand this has attracted submissions from a large number of communities, on the other hand it has also resulted in a poor reviewing experience for some communities, whose submissions end up being assigned to less qualified reviewers outside of their communities. An often-advocated solution is to break up such large conferences into smaller conferences to decentralize the reviewing process. However, this can lead to isolation of various communities and slower emergence of truly interdisciplinary ideas. In this work, we tackle this challenge by introducing a notion of group fairness, namely the core, to the peer review setting. A reviewing assignment is in the core if every subset of researchers (a possible community) is treated in such a manner such that they cannot achieve a better outcome by breaking off and organizing a smaller conference on their own. We study a simple peer review model, prove that it always admits a reviewing assignment in the core, and design an efficient algorithm to find one such assignment. On the negative side, we show that the core is incompatible with achieving a good worst-case approximation of social welfare, an often-sought desideratum. We complement these results by conducting experiments with real data. We observe that our algorithm, in addition to satisfying the core, generates good social welfare on average. In contrast, existing review assignment systems violate the core, treat many communities unfairly, and significantly incentivize them to disengage.
