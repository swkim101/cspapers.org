As the size of circuit designs continues to grow rapidly, artificial intelligence technologies are being extensively used in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) to assist with circuit design. Placement and routing are the most time-consuming parts of the physical design process, and how to quickly evaluate the placement has become a hot research topic. Prior works either transformed circuit designs into images using hand-crafted methods and then used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features, which are limited by the quality of the hand-crafted methods and could not achieve end-to-end training, or treated the circuit design as a graph structure and used Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to extract features, which require time-consuming preprocessing. In our work, we propose a novel perspective for circuit design by treating circuit components as point clouds and using Transformer-based point cloud perception methods to extract features from the circuit. This approach enables direct feature extraction from raw data without any preprocessing, allows for end-to-end training, and results in high performance. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in congestion prediction tasks on both the CircuitNet and ISPD2015 datasets, as well as in design rule check (DRC) violation prediction tasks on the CircuitNet dataset. Our method establishes a bridge between the relatively mature point cloud perception methods and the fast-developing EDA algorithms, enabling us to leverage more collective intelligence to solve this task.
