A point cloud is a discrete set of data points sampled from a 3D geometric surface. Chamfer distance (CD) is a popular metric and training loss to measure the distances between point clouds, but also well known to be sensitive to out-liers. We propose InfoCD , a novel contrastive Chamfer distance loss, and learn to spread the matched points to better align the distributions of point clouds. As such InfoCD leads to an improved surface similarity metric. We show that minimizing InfoCD is equivalent to maximizing a lower bound of the mutual information between the underlying geometric surfaces represented by the point clouds, leading to a regularized CD metric which is robust and computationally efficient for deep learning. We conduct comprehensive experiments for point cloud completion using InfoCD and observe significant improvements consistently over all the popular baseline networks trained with CD-based losses, leading to new state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.
