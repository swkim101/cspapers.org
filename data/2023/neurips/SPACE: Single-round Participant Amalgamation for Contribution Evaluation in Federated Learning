The evaluation of participant contribution in federated learning (FL) has recently gained significant attention due to its applicability in various domains, such as incentive mechanisms, robustness enhancement, and client selection. Previous approaches have predominantly relied on the widely adopted Shapley value for participant evaluation. However, the computation of the Shapley value is expensive, despite using techniques like gradient-based model reconstruction and truncating unnecessary evaluations. Therefore, we present an efficient approach called Single-round Participants Amalgamation for Contribution Evaluation (SPACE). SPACE incorporates two novel components, namely Federated Knowledge Amalgamation and Prototype-based Model Evaluation to reduce the evaluation effort by eliminating the dependence on the size of the validation set and enabling participant evaluation within a single communication round. Experimental results demonstrate that SPACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both running time and Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient (PCC). Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on applications, client reweighting, and client selection highlight the effectiveness of SPACE. The code is available at https://github.com/culiver/SPACE.
