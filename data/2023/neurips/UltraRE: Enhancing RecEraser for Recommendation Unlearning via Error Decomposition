With growing concerns regarding privacy in machine learning models, regulations have committed to granting individuals the right to be forgotten while mandating companies to develop non-discriminatory machine learning systems, thereby fueling the study of the machine unlearning problem. Our attention is directed toward a practical unlearning scenario, i.e., recommendation unlearning. As the state-of-the-art framework, i.e., RecEraser, naturally achieves full unlearning completeness, our objective is to enhance it in terms of model utility and unlearning efﬁciency. In this paper, we rethink RecEraser from an ensemble-based perspective and focus on its three potential losses, i.e., redundancy, relevance, and combination. Under the theoretical guidance of the above three losses, we propose a new framework named UltraRE , which simpliﬁes and powers RecEraser for recommendation tasks. Speciﬁcally, for redundancy loss, we incorporate transport weights in the clustering algorithm to optimize the equilibrium between collaboration and balance while enhancing efﬁciency; for relevance loss, we ensure that sub-models reach convergence on their respective group data; for combination loss,
