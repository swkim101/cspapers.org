We derive the first finite-time logarithmic regret bounds for Bayesian bandits. For Gaussian bandits, we obtain a $O(c_h \log^2 n)$ bound, where $c_h$ is a prior-dependent constant. This matches the asymptotic lower bound of Lai (1987). Our proofs mark a technical departure from prior works, and are simple and general. To show generality, we apply our technique to linear bandits. Our bounds shed light on the value of the prior in the Bayesian setting, both in the objective and as a side information given to the learner. They significantly improve the $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ bounds, that despite the existing lower bounds, have become standard in the literature.
