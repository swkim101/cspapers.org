In the rapidly evolving landscape of smart home automation, the potential of IoT devices is vast. In this realm, rules are the main tool utilized for this automation, which are predefined conditions or triggers that establish connections between devices, enabling seamless automation of specific processes. However, one significant challenge researchers face is the lack of comprehensive datasets to explore and advance the field of smart home rule recommendations. These datasets are essential for developing and evaluating intelligent algorithms that can effectively recommend rules for automating processes while preserving the privacy of the users, as it involves personal information about users’ daily lives. To bridge this gap, we present the Wyze Rule Dataset, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for smart home rule recommendation research. Wyze Rule encompasses over 1 million rules gathered from a diverse user base of 300,000 individuals from Wyze Labs, offering an extensive and varied collection of real-world data. With a focus on federated learning, our dataset is tailored to address the unique challenges of a cross-device federated learning setting in the recommendation domain, featuring a large-scale number of clients with widely heterogeneous data. To establish a benchmark for comparison and evaluation, we have meticulously implemented multiple baselines in both centralized and federated settings. Researchers can leverage these baselines to gauge the performance and effectiveness of their rule recommendation systems, driving advancements in the domain. The Wyze Rule Dataset is publicly accessible through HuggingFace’s dataset
