Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have undergone continuous development and extensive research over the decades to improve biological plausibility while optimizing energy efﬁciency. However, traditional deep SNN training methods have some limitations, and they rely on strategies such as pre-training and ﬁne-tuning, indirect encoding and reconstruction, and approximate gradients. These strategies lack complete training models and lack biocompatibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel learning method named Deep Spiking Neural Networks with Joint Excitatory Inhibition Loop Iterative Learning (EICIL). Inspired by biological neuron signal transmission, this method integrates excitatory and inhibitory behaviors in neurons, organically combining these two behavioral modes into one framework. EICIL signiﬁcantly improves the biomimicry and adaptability of spiking neuron models and expands the representation space of spiking neurons. Extensive experiments based on EICIL and traditional learning meth-ods show that EICIL outperforms traditional methods on various datasets such as CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, demonstrating the key role of learning methods that integrate both behaviors during training.
