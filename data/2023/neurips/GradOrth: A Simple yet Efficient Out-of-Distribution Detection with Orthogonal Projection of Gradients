Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial for ensuring the safe deployment of machine learning models in real-world applications. However, existing OOD detection approaches primarily rely on the feature maps or the full gradient space information to derive OOD scores neglecting the role of most important parameters of the pre-trained network over in-distribution (ID) data. In this study, we propose a novel approach called GradOrth to facilitate OOD detection based on one intriguing observation that the important features to identify OOD data lie in the lower-rank subspace of in-distribution (ID) data. In particular, we identify OOD data by computing the norm of gradient projection on the subspaces considered important for the in-distribution data. A large orthogonal projection value (i.e. a small projection value) indicates the sample as OOD as it captures a weak correlation of the ID data. This simple yet effective method exhibits outstanding performance, showcasing a notable reduction in the average false positive rate at a 95% true positive rate (FPR95) of up to 8% when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.
