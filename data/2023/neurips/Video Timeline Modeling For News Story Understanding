In this paper, we present a novel problem, namely video timeline modeling. Our objective is to create a video-associated timeline from a set of videos related to a specific topic, thereby facilitating the content and structure understanding of the story being told. This problem has significant potential in various real-world applications, for instance, news story summarization. To bootstrap research in this area, we curate a realistic benchmark dataset, YouTube-News-Timeline, consisting of over $12$k timelines and $300$k YouTube news videos. Additionally, we propose a set of quantitative metrics to comprehensively evaluate and compare methodologies. With such a testbed, we further develop and benchmark several deep learning approaches to tackling this problem. We anticipate that this exploratory work will pave the way for further research in video timeline modeling.
