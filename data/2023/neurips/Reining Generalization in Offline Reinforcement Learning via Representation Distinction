Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to address the challenge of distribution shift between the dataset and the learned policy, where the value of out-of-distribution (OOD) data may be erroneously estimated due to overgeneralization. It has been observed that a considerable portion of the benefits derived from the conservative terms designed by existing offline RL approaches originates from their impact on the learned representation. This observation prompts us to scrutinize the learning dynamics of offline RL, formalize the process of generalization, and delve into the prevalent overgeneralization issue in offline RL. We then investigate the potential to rein the generalization from the representation perspective to enhance offline RL. Finally, we present Representation Distinction (RD), an innovative plug-in method for improving offline RL algorithm performance by explicitly differentiating between the representations of in-sample and OOD state-action pairs generated by the learning policy. Considering scenarios in which the learning policy mirrors the behavioral policy and similar samples may be erroneously distinguished, we suggest a dynamic adjustment mechanism for RD based on an OOD data generator to prevent data representation collapse and further enhance policy performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying RD to designed backbone algorithms and widely-used offline RL algorithms. The proposed RD method significantly improves their performance across various continuous control tasks on D4RL datasets, surpassing several state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms.
