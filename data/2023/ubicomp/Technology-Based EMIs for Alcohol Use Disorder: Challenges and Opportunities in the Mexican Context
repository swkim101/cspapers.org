The excessive and problematic consumption of alcohol characterizes Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). In Mexico, the 12-month prevalence of any substance is 2.5%, and the lifetime prevalence of alcohol dependence is 5.9%. Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) are treatments that are provided to patients during their daily lives and in natural settings. EMIs can monitor alcohol consumption, provide personalized feedback, and deliver coping strategies to help individuals manage their cravings and avoid relapse. This work discusses challenges and opportunities associated with technology-based Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in Mexico. We aim to contribute valuable insights into improving AUD interventions and strategies for the Mexican population, which could also provide insights into LATAM countries with similar contexts.
