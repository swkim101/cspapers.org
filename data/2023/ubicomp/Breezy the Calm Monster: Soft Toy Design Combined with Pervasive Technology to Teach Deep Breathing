Anger dysregulation can lead to aggression and peer rejection in early childhood. Anger episodes and temper tantrums frequently escalate, leaving parents and young children needing effective emotion regulation interventions. This research investigates how designing a playful interaction with ubiquitous technology can help parents teach young children emotion regulation strategies such as deep breathing. Breezy is a soft toy with an app and a storybook that helps parents and engages them in teaching deep breathing as an anger regulation strategy. The soft toy has sensory and physical features and can be held as a puppet, which helps young children to connect with the toy. The digital app addresses facial expressions and physiological components of emotions through sensory and interactive features that encourage identifying emotions. The storybook facilitates a familiar context for parents' engagement through playful learning. The interactive system provides parents with opportunities to teach their young children to identify and label anger and practice and model age-appropriate breathing exercises. This research aims to inform the design of future educational and playful interactions for emotional competence skills, as well as to broaden their application and promote their use in homes.
