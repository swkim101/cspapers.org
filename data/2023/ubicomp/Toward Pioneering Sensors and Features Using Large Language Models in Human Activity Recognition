In this paper, we propose a feature pioneering method using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the proposed method, we use ChatGPT 1 to find new sensor locations and new features. Then we evaluate the machine learning model which uses the found features using an open dataset. In current machine learning, humans make features, for this engineers visit real sites and have discussions with experts and veteran workers. However, this method has the problem that the quality of the features depends on the engineer. In order to solve this problem, we propose a way to make new features using LLMs. As a result, we obtain almost the same level of accuracy as the proposed model which used fewer sensors and the model uses all sensors in the dataset. This indicates that the proposed method is able to extract important features efficiently.
