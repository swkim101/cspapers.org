With the proliferation of connected devices with advanced sensing, computing, and communication capabilities, ubiquitous computing systems have become prevalent nowadays. They have the potential to revolutionize various industries by enabling new applications and services (e.g., patient monitoring, personalized recommendations, traffic control, home energy management). However, in real-world ubiquitous computing systems, data collection can be expensive or impossible. Due to the limited quantity and quality of data available, pure data-driven methods may not perform well. A promising approach to overcome these limitations is to utilize physical knowledge, including domain knowledge from experts, heuristics based on experience, and analytic models of physical phenomena. The theme of this workshop is to advance the theoretical understanding, algorithmic development and system implementations of ubiquitous computing systems that integrate physical knowledge with data-driven methods. The workshop will provide an inclusive gathering for researchers and practitioners from various fields and facilitate future collaborations. The workshop welcomes research papers as well as position papers. The overall goal is to grow the community who are dedicated to improving ubiquitous computing systems by fusing physical knowledge into data-driven methods.
