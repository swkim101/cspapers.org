Combined with the unprecedented stress of the COVID-19 crisis and the increase in social unrest, human-caused environmental disasters are having a profound impact on well-being, resulting in a dramatic spike in mental health issues. Studies are emerging daily around concepts of ecological grieving stress, depression, anxiety, and a host of emotions that are surfacing and increasing in our modern times. From eco-nostalgia to eco-anxiety and eco-grief, our responses to climate change, environmental devastation, and social unrest can prevent us from taking positive action, often leading to existential crises. Our proposed project, Haikeus: Transmuting Ecological Grieving into Action, works directly at the interface of some of humanity's wicked problems, which are complex, challenging to solve, and hard to fully understand. The aim of this project is to bring awareness and motivation for transmuting such an emotion into an action through the power of creativity. We further argue that the established methods could facilitate a more nuanced understanding of organizational barriers to communicate its potential value to proceed with the change.
