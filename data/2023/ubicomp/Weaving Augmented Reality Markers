This paper presents the use of weaving as a technique to create functional augmented reality (AR) markers using different textile structures and colors. We conducted experiments with plain, twill, and satin weaves, as well as varying colors in the warp, to test the effectiveness of the markers. Our findings show that weaving is a viable method for creating AR markers, and the software can detect markers even with varying colors and slightly misaligned quadrants. This work opens up new possibilities for weaving and textile structures in AR design.
