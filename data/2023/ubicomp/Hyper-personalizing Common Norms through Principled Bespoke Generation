In our everyday lives, we often follow standardized norms based on the “standard person”. However, these existing norms, created by averaging data from large populations, often fail to fit an individual. It is also challenging to implement guidelines based on these norms due to various real-life constraints in our life. We propose a hyper-personalization approach, leveraging principled generation to overcome these limitations. We explore a method that deconstructs the standard norms into principles and embodiments, and then generates contextualized guidelines by producing embodiments based on these principles. We initially identified the efficacy of our research by designing a real-life actionable sleep recommendation system. Our next step is the personalization of vocabulary in children’s language learning. In the end, we aim to design and implement a framework that can be applicable to potential cases in the future.
