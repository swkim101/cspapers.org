This study explores the potential of conversational agents to improve well-being during food preparation and consumption. We describe the process of designing and evaluating a conversational agent that promotes mindful eating and cooking. We first discuss the findings of an exploratory study conducted to understand changes in food behaviors of young adults in Mexico during the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on well-being. Subsequently, an iterative methodology is used to design and evaluate two interactive systems with 2 different studies. The results of these interventions provide evidence that the systems improve the eating/cooking experience and promote mindfulness when performing these activities.
