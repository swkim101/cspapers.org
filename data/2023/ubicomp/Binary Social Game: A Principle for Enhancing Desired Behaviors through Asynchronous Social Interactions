Within the HCI community, the impact of social dynamics on behavior change has gained considerable interest. This paper introduces the Binary Social Game (BSG), a principle that utilizes asynchronous social interactions to motivate desired behaviors. Initially, we developed GrowFlower based on the BSG principle, and its effectiveness was evaluated through a two-week wizard-of-oz study. After gaining insights from the preliminary study, we refined our approach and created GENGO, a bingo-style game that is specifically designed to encourage exercise as a targeted behavior. A subsequent two-month user study in real-world conditions, involving 82 participants, validated GENGOâ€™s effectiveness in fostering consistent exercise habits. These findings highlight the potential of BSG as a useful tool for promoting desired behaviors within a group context, especially through asynchronous social interactions. This study contributes to the understanding of how social dynamics can be leveraged for behavior change.
