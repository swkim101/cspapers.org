Rapid technological advances are expanding the practical applicability of virtual reality and/or augmented reality (VR/AR); however, the degree to which new users are able to interact with these technologies is limited by current input modalities. Gaining an intuitive grasp of VR/AR applications requires that users be immersed in the virtual environment, which in turn depends on the integration of multiple realistic sensory feedback mechanisms. This workshop will bring together researchers from the fields of UbiComp and VR/AR to explore alternative input modalities and sensory feedback systems to facilitate the design of coherent and engaging VR/AR experiences comparable to those in the real world.
