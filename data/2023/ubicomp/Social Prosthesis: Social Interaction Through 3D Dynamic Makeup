Prosthetic makeup is the use of prosthetic materials for cosmetic or makeup effects to extend the skin and features. Commonly used to simulate wounds or exaggerate physical characteristics, prosthetic makeup is usually created for film or theatrical purposes, rather than for everyday fashion or social wearability. Social Prosthesis is a design project which aims to introduce interactivity, movement, and aesthetic within silicone prosthetics by providing design considerations and fabrication techniques unique to on-face wearables. Through opening up opportunities for cosmetic expression and storytelling through dynamic makeup, Social Prosthesis invokes the sociality of beautyâ€”the change and movement that happens when we alter our appearances in contact with others.
