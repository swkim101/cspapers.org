The significant increase in data production resulting from the widespread adoption of mobile and IoT technologies has revolutionized healthcare but also presents significant privacy and ethical challenges. The field of medical data collection is no exception and has limitations in terms of the source, variety and quantity of records from studies on healthcare and wellness. One way to address this dilemma is the use of the Blockchain for patient data collection and use. The anonymity of a centralized network allows the patient’s identity to be protected. The structure formed by nodes allows the information to be always available and does not depend on a main server. The immutability of records in the chain ensures unambiguous traceability of information flow by the healthcare provider. Finally, the network’s consensus and reward mechanisms could motivate new users to participate in active sensing. In this article we will expose the architecture of an application that relies on the Blockchain to meet the above information needs by leveraging the potential of the Ethereum network. In addition, we present a use case where consciously collected data from our platform is used to train a machine learning model automatically, using a P2P Browser-Based Computational Notebook as execution and distribution environment.
