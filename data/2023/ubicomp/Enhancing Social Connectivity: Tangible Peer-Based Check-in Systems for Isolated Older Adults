Population aging is a global phenomenon. It is expected that by 2050, the older adult population will be 21.4% of the total population in US alone, according to Pew Research. WHO recognizes social engagement as an important factor for reducing isolation. Researchers have historically used digital technologies to build connections, but they offer disadvantages like accessibility issues and have not been a good match for the aged population. My doctoral research aims to (1) understand older adultsâ€™ needs, preferences, and challenges in maintaining social connections (2) investigate the benefits of tangible technologies to help older adults stay connected (3) create a design framework for tangible technologies to improve social connection for older adults. This doctoral consortium paper discusses my research on exploring the potential of tangible technologies, as opposed to digital, to reduce social isolation among older adults.
