Wearables have become ubiquitous technologies that allow people to capture rich data to track their health information, immerse themselves in virtual reality, and stay connected. However, there is a consensus that wearables are only available to a select few due to cost, reducing the potential benefits they can provide to underserved populations. To ensure that wearables are designed more equitably and include the voices of underserved communities in the design process, I conducted a qualitative study with 19 participants from low-income communities and found that safety was a critical issue and that wearables can potentially be used to address their daily safety concerns. In this thesis position paper, I motivate the importance of codesigning wearables with and for underserved communities and propose a novel approach at the hardware and software levels for the development of safety-based wearable devices based on the needs of these communities.
