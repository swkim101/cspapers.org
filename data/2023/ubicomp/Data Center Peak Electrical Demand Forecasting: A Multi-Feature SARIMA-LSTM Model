Accurate peak electrical demand forecasting plays a pivotal role in managing energy consumption in Internet Data Centers (IDCs), where electricity expense forms a major part of operational costs. To intelligently schedule energy storage for shaving the peak load and reducing both energy expense during peak hours as well as the demand charge, IDC operators need precise predictions of the magnitude and timing of daily peak electrical demand. This paper introduces a novel method for peak load forecasting that combines the strengths of both the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Our approach is rigorously validated with the field dataset from three Tencent Inc.â€™s data center in North China region. The successful application of this method underscores its robustness and potential for broader application within the IDC sector and the wider power industry.
