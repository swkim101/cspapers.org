Wearable technologies have gained significant traction in various domains with healthcare being a particularly prominent area for their use, often in conjunction with mobile (health) applications. The increasing demand and versatility of these technologies pose challenges in meeting the specific needs of patients, healthy subjects, as well as healthcare professionals. Despite their growing adoption, there is a notable lack of empirical research focusing on user behavior, adaptation, acceptance, and usability evaluation for wearable technologies and companion apps. Research focusing on human factors and usability is currently inadequate in this specific area. Therefore, the objective of my research is to develop a structured guideline to address these limitations. The primary goal is to create a practical and flexible framework for assessing the usability of wearables and their associated mobile apps. This framework will be designed to be accessible and adaptable, allowing both usability experts and non-experts such as clinical researchers to evaluate wearable technology together with its companion mobile app. Through the development, validation, and implementation of this framework, this investigation aims to support the evaluation in a structured manner, and thus enhance the long-term adoption and improve the acceptance of wearable technologies and mobile (health) apps.
