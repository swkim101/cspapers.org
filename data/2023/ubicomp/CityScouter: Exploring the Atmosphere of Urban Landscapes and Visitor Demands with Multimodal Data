This paper proposes a novel demo application named CityScouter that utilizes multimodal data to analyze various aspects of urban characteristics quantitatively. Existing studies have proposed systems to examine either the physical characteristics of cities or the nature of people residing there. However, there is a lack of systems that analyze the characteristics of cities from both the physical and the residentsâ€™ aspects. CityScouter addresses this challenge by leveraging computer vision technologies to quantify the quality of the urban landscape atmosphere and combining it with location information and user search history to reveal the desires of people visiting the area. The application is user-friendly and compatible with mobile devices, enabling users to conveniently enhance their understanding of cities while exploring them. Additionally, we provide reviews from urban development experts, offering insights into the applicability of our application. Furthermore, we showcase the usefulness and user experience of CityScouter through live demonstrations at the conference venue.
