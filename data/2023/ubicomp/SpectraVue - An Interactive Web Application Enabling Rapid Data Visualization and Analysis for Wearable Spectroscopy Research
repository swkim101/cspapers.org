Spectroscopic analysis of physiological phenomena has remained an important yet underutilized application in wearable technology today. Lumos has recently been introduced as an open-source wearable device capable of on-body spectroscopic research across the visible spectrum, enabling scientists and researchers to study the optical properties of various clinical biomarkers in real-time. However, a key limitation in the data output of this device is the lengthy process required to visualize and plot the spectral responses of observed mediums. In this paper, we present SpectraVue, an interactive web application that allows for visualization of Lumos spectral data. Utilizing a user-friendly interface, SpectraVue enables researchers to quickly generate three-dimensional plots from Lumos data stored in csv or text files, providing a comprehensive view of the spectral response of the medium under investigation. Additionally, SpectraVue offers features such as comparison of spectral data with a clinical biomarker, various data export options, and interactive plotting, further enhancing the user experience and researcher efficiency. The output graphs can be used to provide a standardization of spectral responses across a wide range of mediums, including characterization of these responses in clinical biomarkers such as glucose and alcohol. SpectraVue aims to facilitate these investigations by streamlining the data processing and visualization workflow, thereby accelerating clinical diagnostic research.
