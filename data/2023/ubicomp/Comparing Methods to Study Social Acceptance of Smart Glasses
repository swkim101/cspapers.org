Conducting user studies on social perception of wearable technology requires a framework with sufficient sensitivity to emulate perception in real-life. Using videos can efficiently reach a large number of participants, but what level of video fidelity is necessary to achieve results similar to live interaction? In a study of 48 participants, we examine four different viewing conditions: phone, laptop, big screen, and live demonstration, while investigating the social weight of wearing different glasses (Vuzix Blade, Tooz Devkit, North Focals, or prescription glasses). Contrary to our hypothesis, the live condition was not the most sensitive.
