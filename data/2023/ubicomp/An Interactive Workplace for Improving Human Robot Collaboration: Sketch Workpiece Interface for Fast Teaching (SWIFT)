Ubiquitous computing refers to the concept of integrating computers and technology into everyday objects and environments, making them constantly available and seamlessly interconnected. In recent times, there has been a growing adoption of the concept in industrial settings as well. This contribution targets the replacement of an industrial manual repair process through a robotic solution. The focus of this work is on the novel interface utilizing a digital pen and spatial augmented reality, which mimics the original job preparation process but ubiquitously enables automated robot programming. This shifts the work of the human from a dull, dirty and dangerous process to the cognitively more demanding part of inspection and process strategy definition, whereas the robot is used as a dexterous and tenacious intelligent process tool to perform the surface processing operation itself.
