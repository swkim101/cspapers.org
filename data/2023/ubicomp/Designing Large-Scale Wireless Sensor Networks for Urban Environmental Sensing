Hardware and software advances have paved the way for large-scale environmental urban sensor networks, but there is no guidance on where to place a finite number of nodes and how to assess the network design. In this work, I develop and test two quality metrics for urban sensor networksâ€”one that focuses on the impacts of urban form and one that acknowledges cities as social spaces. I then propose a data-driven algorithm grounded in urban planning theory for a new urban sensor network design. Through real-world deployments and simulations using open data, I will compare my proposed design and quality metrics to those used in prior sensor networks. This work will enable the deployment of environmental sensor networks that produce useful citywide data for numerous stakeholders despite the complexities of urban environments.
