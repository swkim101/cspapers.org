This paper presents a novel physical impersonating attack against face recognition systems. It aims at generating consistent style changes across multiple pictures of the attacker under different conditions and poses. Additionally, the style changes are required to be physically realizable by make-up and can induce the intended misclassification. To achieve the goal, we develop novel techniques to embed multiple pictures of the same physical person to vectors in the StyleGANâ€™s latent space, such that the embedded latent vectors have some implicit correlations to make the search for consistent style changes feasible. Our digital and physical evaluation results show our approach can allow an outsider attacker to successfully impersonate the insiders with consistent and natural changes.
