Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many fields due to their increasingly high accuracy. However, they are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing a serious threat to security-critical applications such as autonomous driving, remote diagnosis, etc. Existing solutions are limited in detecting/preventing such attacks, and also impacting the performance on the original tasks. In this paper, we present AI-Guardian, a novel approach to defeating adversarial attacks that leverages intentionally embedded backdoors to fail the adversarial perturbations and maintain the performance of the original main task. We extensively evaluate AI-Guardian using five popular adversarial example generation approaches, and experimental results demonstrate its efficacy in defeating adversarial attacks. Specifically, AI-Guardian reduces the attack success rate from 97.3% to 3.2%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art works by 30.9%, with only a 0.9% decline on the clean data accuracy. Furthermore, AI-Guardian introduces only 0.36% overhead to the model prediction time, almost negligible in most cases.
