While deep learning techniques have achieved great success in modern digital products, researchers have shown that deep learning models are susceptible to Trojan attacks. In a Trojan attack, an adversary stealthily modifies a deep learning model such that the model will output a predefined label whenever a trigger is present in the input. In this paper, we present TrojanModel, a practical Trojan attack against Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. ASR systems aim to transcribe voice input into text, which is easier for subsequent downstream applications to process. We consider a practical attack scenario in which an adversary inserts a Trojan into the acoustic model of a target ASR system. Unlike existing work that uses noise-like triggers that will easily arouse user suspicion, the work in this paper focuses on the use of unsuspicious sounds as a trigger, e.g., a piece of music playing in the background. In addition, TrojanModel does not require the retraining of a target model. Experimental results show that TrojanModel can achieve high attack success rates with negligible effect on the target modelâ€™s performance. We also demonstrate that the attack is effective in an over-the-air attack scenario, where audio is played over a physical speaker and received by a microphone.
