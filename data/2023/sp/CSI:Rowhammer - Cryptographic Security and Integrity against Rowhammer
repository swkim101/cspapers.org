In this paper, we present CSI:Rowhammer, a principled hardware-software co-design Rowhammer mitigation with cryptographic security and integrity guarantees, that does not focus on any specific properties of Rowhammer. We design a new memory error detection mechanism based on a low-latency cryptographic MAC and an exception mechanism initiating a software-level correction routine. The exception handler uses a novel instruction-set extension for the error correction and resumes execution afterward. In contrast to regular ECC-DRAM that remains exploitable if more than 2 bits are flipped, CSI:Rowhammer maintains the security level of the cryptographic MAC. We evaluate CSI:Rowhammer in a gem5 proof-of-concept implementation. Under normal conditions, we see latency overheads below 0.75% and no memory overhead compared to off-the-shelf ECC-DRAM. While the average latency to correct a single bitflip is below 20 ns (compared to a range from a few nanoseconds to several milliseconds for state-of-the-art ECC memory), CSI:Rowhammer can detect any number of bitflips with overwhelming probability and correct at least 8 bitflips in practical time constraints.
