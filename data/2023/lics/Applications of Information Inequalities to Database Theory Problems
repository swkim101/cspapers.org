The paper describes several applications of information inequalities to problems in database theory. The problems discussed include: upper bounds of a queryâ€™s output, worst-case optimal join algorithms, the query domination problem, and the implication problem for approximate integrity constraints. The paper is self-contained: all required concepts and results from information inequalities are introduced here, gradually, and motivated by database problems.
