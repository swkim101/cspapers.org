The Rabin tree theorem yields an algorithm to solve the satisfiability problem for monadic second-order logic over infinite trees. Here we solve the probabilistic variant of this problem. Namely, we show how to compute the probability that a randomly chosen tree satisfies a given formula. We additionally show that this probability is an algebraic number. This closes a line of research where similar results were shown for formalisms weaker than the full monadic second-order logic.
