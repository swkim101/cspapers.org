the family of efficient attention approaches in which the lengths of the attention operands are reduced to M ( < N ) by applying an abstraction function, resulting in reduced complexity of the attention while retaining the form of basic attention computation in Eq. 3. Abstrac-tive attentions can be further categorized to either resolution preserving or non-preserving , according to which operands are chosen to be abstracted. Resolution non-preserving attention is the
