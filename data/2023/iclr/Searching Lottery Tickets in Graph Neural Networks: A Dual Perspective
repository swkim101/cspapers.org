Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various graph learning tasks. However, the computational overheads of fitting GNNs to large-scale graphs grow rapidly, posing obstacles to GNNs from scaling up to real-world applications. To tackle this issue, Graph Lottery Ticket (GLT) hypothesis articulates that there always exists a sparse subnetwork/subgraph with admirable performance in GNNs with random initialization. Such a pair of core subgraph and sparse subnetwork (called graph lottery tickets) can be uncovered by iteratively applying a novel sparsification method. While GLT provides new insights for GNN compression, it requires a full pretraining process to obtain graph lottery tickets, which is not universal and friendly to real-world applications. Moreover, the graph sparsification in GLT utilizes sampling techniques, which may result in massive information loss and aggregation failure. In this paper, we explore the searching of graph lottery tickets from a complementary perspective â€“ transforming a random ticket into a graph lottery ticket, which allows us to more comprehensively explore the relationships between the original network/graph and their sparse counterpart. Compared to GLT, our proposal helps achieve a triple-win situation of graph lottery tickets with high sparsity, admirable performance, and good explainability. More importantly, we rigorously prove that our model can eliminate noise and maintain reliable information in substructures using the graph information bottleneck theory. Extensive experimental results on various graphrelated tasks validate the effectiveness of our framework.
