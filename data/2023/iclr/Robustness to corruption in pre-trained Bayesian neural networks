We develop ShiftMatch, a new training-data-dependent likelihood for robustness to corruption in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). ShiftMatch is inspired by the training-data-dependent"EmpCov"priors from Izmailov et al. (2021a), and efficiently matches test-time spatial correlations to those at training time. Critically, ShiftMatch is designed to leave the neural network's training time likelihood unchanged, allowing it to use publicly available samples from pre-trained BNNs. Using pre-trained HMC samples, ShiftMatch gives strong performance improvements on CIFAR-10-C, outperforms EmpCov priors (though ShiftMatch uses extra information from a minibatch of corrupted test points), and is perhaps the first Bayesian method capable of convincingly outperforming plain deep ensembles.
