Existing collaborative self-supervised learning (SSL) schemes are not suitable for cross-client applications because of their expensive computation and large local data requirements. To address these issues, we propose MocoSFL, a collaborative SSL framework based on Split Federated Learning (SFL) and Momentum Contrast (MoCo). In MocoSFL, the large backbone model is split into a small client-side model and a large server-side model, and only the small client-side model is processed locally on the clientâ€™s local devices. MocoSFL has three key components: (i) vector concatenation which enables the use of small batch size and reduces computation and memory requirements by orders of magnitude; (ii) feature sharing that helps achieve high accuracy regardless of the quality and volume of local data; (iii) frequent synchronization that helps achieve better non-IID performance because of smaller local model divergence. For a 1,000-client case with non-IID data (each client only has data from 2 random classes of CIFAR-10), MocoSFL can achieve over 84% accuracy with ResNet-18 model. Next we present TAResSFL module that significantly improves the resistance to privacy threats and communication overhead with small sacrifice in accuracy for a MocoSFL system. On a Raspberry Pi 4B device, the MocoSFL-based scheme requires less than 1 MB of memory and less than 40 MB of communication, and consumes less than 5W power. The code is available at https:
