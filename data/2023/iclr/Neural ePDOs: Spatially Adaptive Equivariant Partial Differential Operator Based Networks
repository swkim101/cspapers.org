Endowing deep learning models with symmetry priors can lead to a considerable performance improvement. As an interesting bridge between physics and deep learning, the equivariant partial differential operators (PDOs) have drawn much researchersâ€™ attention recently. However, to ensure the PDOs translation equivariance, previous works have to require coefficient matrices to be constant and spatially shared for their linearity, which could lead to the sub-optimal feature learning at each position. In this work, we propose a novel nonlinear PDOs scheme that is both spatially adaptive and translation equivariant. The coefficient matrices are obtained by local features through a generator rather than spatially shared. Besides, we establish a new theory on incorporating more equivariance like rotations for such PDOs. Based on our theoretical results, we efficiently implement the generator with an equivariant multilayer perceptron (EMLP). As such equivariant PDOs are generated by neural networks, we call them Neural ePDOs. In experiments, we show that our method can significantly improve previous works with smaller model size in various datasets. Especially, we achieve the state-ofthe-art performance on the MNIST-rot dataset with only tenth of parameters of the previous best model.
