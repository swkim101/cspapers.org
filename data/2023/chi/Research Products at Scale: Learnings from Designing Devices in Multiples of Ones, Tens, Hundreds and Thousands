In this paper, I argue that scale is an important quality of research products [32] and reflect upon the lessons learnt from designing and producing research products at scales ranging from one-offs to those reproduced in thousands. I describe details from a body of research completed by our studio over twenty years by examining four research projects that were designed, developed, and manufactured at four distinct levels of scale. I draw out details from these projects that have not previously been reported and discuss the methodological implications of growth not just for design and production, but also for strategies for engaging with participants. In addition, I discuss particular features of research products produced at the four levels of scale and describe the benefits and trade-offs of producing research products at different scales.
