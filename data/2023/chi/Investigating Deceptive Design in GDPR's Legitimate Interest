Legitimate interest is one of the six grounds for processing data under the European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The flexibility and ambiguity of the term "legitimate interests" can be problematic; coupled with the lack of enforcement from legal authorities and different interpretations from the various data protection authorities, legitimate interests can be taken advantage of as a loophole to collect more user data. Drawing insights from multiple disciplines, we ran two studies to empirically investigate the deceptive designs being used when legitimate interests are applied in privacy notices, and how user perceptions line up with these practices. We identified six deceptive designs, and found that the ways legitimate interest is applied in practice does not match user expectations.
