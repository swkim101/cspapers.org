In medical simulation training two approaches are currently rather disjunct: realistic manikins are used to teach physical skills and procedures and VR systems are used to train situation assessment and decision making. We propose a mixed reality approach, which allows trainees to use real tools and their hands when interacting with a physical manikin overlaid with a responsive virtual avatar. In close exchange with first responder organizations, we developed and evaluated an MR training scenario. In the scenario, users can talk to injured people in a car accident, assess the threat of the environment, and utilize real medical equipment. Participants experienced high levels of physical- and self-presence, increased stress levels, and reported a high technology acceptance. The proposed main requirements of first responders regarding haptic multi-sensory skill training in MR and the lessons learned from the workshop aim to guide the design of training solutions for medical training in MR.
