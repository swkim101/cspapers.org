Unit visualizations have been widely used in data storytelling within interactive articles and videos. However, authoring data stories that contain animated unit visualizations is challenging due to the tedious, time-consuming process of switching back and forth between writing a narrative and configuring the accompanying visualizations and animations. To streamline this process, we present DataParticles, a block-based story editor that leverages the latent connections between text, data, and visualizations to help creators flexibly prototype, explore, and iterate on a story narrative and its corresponding visualizations. To inform the design of DataParticles, we interviewed 6 domain experts and studied a dataset of 44 existing animated unit visualizations to identify the narrative patterns and congruence principles they employed. A user study with 9 experts showed that DataParticles can significantly simplify the process of authoring data stories with animated unit visualizations by encouraging exploration and supporting fast prototyping.
