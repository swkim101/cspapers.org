In this paper, we present WACO, a novel method of co-optimizing the format and the schedule of a given sparsity pattern in a sparse tensor program. A core challenge in this paper is the design of a lightweight cost model that accurately predicts the runtime of a sparse tensor program by considering the sparsity pattern, the format, and the schedule. The key idea in addressing this is exploiting a sparse convolutional network to learn meaningful features of the sparsity pattern and embedding a coupled behavior between the format and the schedule using a specially designed schedule template. In addition, within the enormous search space of co-optimization, our novel search strategy, an approximate nearest neighbor search, efficiently and accurately retrieves the best format and schedule for a given sparsity pattern. We evaluated WACO for four different algorithms (SpMV, SpMM, SDDMM, and MTTKRP) on a CPU using 726 different sparsity patterns. Our experimental results showed that WACO outperformed four state-of-the-art baselines, Intel MKL, BestFormat, TACO with a default schedule, and ASpT. Compared to the best of four baselines, WACO achieved 1.43×, 1.18×, 1.14×, and 1.27× average speedups on SpMV, SpMM, SDDMM, and MTTKRP, respectively.
