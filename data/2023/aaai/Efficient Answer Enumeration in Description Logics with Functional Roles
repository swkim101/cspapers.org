We study the enumeration of answers to ontology-mediated queries
when the ontology is formulated in a description logic that supports
functional roles and the query is a CQ. In particular, we show that
enumeration is possible with linear preprocessing and constant delay
when a certain extension of the CQ (pertaining to functional roles)
is acyclic and free-connex acyclic. This holds both for complete answers and
for partial answers. We provide matching lower bounds for the
case where the query is self-join free.
