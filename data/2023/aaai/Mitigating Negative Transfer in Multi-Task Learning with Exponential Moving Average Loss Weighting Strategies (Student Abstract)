Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a growing subject of interest in deep learning, due to its ability to train models more efficiently on multiple tasks compared to using a group of conventional single-task models. However, MTL can be impractical as certain tasks can dominate training and hurt performance in others, thus making some tasks perform better in a single-task model compared to a multi-task one. Such problems are broadly classified as negative transfer, and many prior approaches in the literature have been made to mitigate these issues. One such current approach to alleviate negative transfer is to weight each of the losses so that they are on the same scale. Whereas current loss balancing approaches rely on either optimization or complex numerical analysis, none directly scale the losses based on their observed magnitudes. We propose multiple techniques for loss balancing based on scaling by the exponential moving average and benchmark them against current best-performing methods on three established datasets. On these datasets, they achieve comparable, if not higher, performance compared to current best-performing methods.
