Existing learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods rely on the depth range to build the 3D cost volume and may fail when the range is too large or unreliable. To address this problem, we propose a disparity-based MVS method based on the epipolar disparity flow (E-flow), called DispMVS, which infers the depth information from the pixel movement between two views. The core of DispMVS is to construct a 2D cost volume on the image plane along the epipolar line between each pair (between the reference image and several source images) for pixel matching and fuse uncountable depths triangulated from each pair by multi-view geometry to ensure multi-view consistency. To be robust, DispMVS starts from a randomly initialized depth map and iteratively refines the depth map with the help of the coarse-to-fine strategy. Experiments on DTUMVS and Tanks\&Temple datasets show that DispMVS is not sensitive to the depth range and achieves state-of-the-art results with lower GPU memory.
