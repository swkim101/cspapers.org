Spike camera is a kind of neuromorphic sensor that uses a novel ``integrate-and-fire'' mechanism to generate a continuous spike stream to record the dynamic light intensity at extremely high temporal resolution. However, as a trade-off for high temporal resolution, its spatial resolution is limited, resulting in inferior reconstruction details. To address this issue, this paper develops a network (SpikeSR-Net) to super-resolve a high-resolution image sequence from the low-resolution binary spike streams. SpikeSR-Net is designed based on the observation model of spike camera and exploits both the merits of model-based and learning-based methods. To deal with the limited representation capacity of binary data, a pixel-adaptive spike encoder is proposed to convert spikes to latent representation to infer clues on intensity and motion. Then, a motion-aligned super resolver is employed to exploit long-term correlation, so that the dense sampling in temporal domain can be exploited to enhance the spatial resolution without introducing motion blur. Experimental results show that SpikeSR-Net is promising in super-resolving higher-quality images for spike camera.
