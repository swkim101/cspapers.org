To train a model in a traditional supervised learning classification system for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, it is essential to have labeled data, which is not present in large amounts for many tasks. Prompt-based learning methods attempt to combat the supervised learning need for labeled data by directly adapting pre-trained language models and modeling the probability of text itself. In this paper, we propose a novel data-agnostic strategy for prompt-based fine-tuning that leverages feature moments (a.k.a., mean and standard deviation) as a data augmentation technique and employs training dynamics (i.e., confidence and variability) to allow more informative samples to be concatenated for generating demonstrations as input context. Our approach is a strong method for few-shot learning that forces the language model to pay special attention to the feature moments and allows more informative samples to be concatenated for generating demonstrations as input context by selecting high confidence and low variance samples. To demonstrate its effectiveness given limited training data, we conduct extensive experiments in different few-shot settings on three empathy and emotion classification datasets (from various domains). We further evaluate our method's robustness by introducing noise to our few-shot input data and labels and show that exchanging moments between samples and incorporating cartography-based demonstrations are beneficial when the available data is limited and noisy.
