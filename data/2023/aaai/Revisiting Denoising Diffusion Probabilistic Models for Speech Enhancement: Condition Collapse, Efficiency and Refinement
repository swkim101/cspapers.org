Recent literature has shown that denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can be used to synthesize high-fidelity samples with a competitive (or sometimes better) quality than previous state-of-the-art approaches. However, few attempts have been made to apply DDPM for the speech enhancement task. The reported performance of the existing works is relatively poor and significantly inferior to other generative methods. In this work, we first reveal the difficulties in applying existing diffusion models to the field of speech enhancement. Then we introduce DR-DiffuSE, a simple and effective framework for speech enhancement using conditional diffusion models. We present three strategies (two in diffusion training and one in reverse sampling) to tackle the condition collapse and guarantee the sufficient use of condition information. For efficiency, we introduce the fast sampling technique to reduce the sampling process into several steps and exploit a refinement network to calibrate the defective speech. Our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance to the GAN-based model and shows a significant improvement over existing DDPM-based algorithms.
