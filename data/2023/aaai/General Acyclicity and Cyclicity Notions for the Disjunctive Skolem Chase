The disjunctive skolem chase is a sound, complete, and potentially non-terminating procedure for solving boolean conjunctive query entailment over knowledge bases of disjunctive existential rules. We develop novel acyclicity and cyclicity notions for this procedure; that is, we develop sufficient conditions to determine chase termination and non-termination. Our empirical evaluation shows that our novel notions are significantly more general than existing criteria.
