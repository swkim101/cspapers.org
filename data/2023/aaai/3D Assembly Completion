Automatic assembly is a promising research topic in 3D computer vision and robotics. Existing works focus on generating assembly (e.g., IKEA furniture) from scratch with a set of parts, namely 3D part assembly. In practice, there are higher demands for the robot to take over and finish an incomplete assembly (e.g., a half-assembled IKEA furniture) with an off-the-shelf toolkit, especially in human-robot and multi-agent collaborations. Compared to 3D part assembly, it is more complicated in nature and remains unexplored yet. The robot must understand the incomplete structure, infer what parts are missing, single out the correct parts from the toolkit and finally, assemble them with appropriate poses to finish the incomplete assembly. Geometrically similar parts in the toolkit can interfere, and this problem will be exacerbated with more missing parts. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel task called 3D assembly completion. Given an incomplete assembly, it aims to find its missing parts from a toolkit and predict the 6-DoF poses to make the assembly complete. To this end, we propose FiT, a framework for Finishing the incomplete 3D assembly with Transformer. We employ the encoder to model the incomplete assembly into memories. Candidate parts interact with memories in a memory-query paradigm for final candidate classification and pose prediction. Bipartite part matching and symmetric transformation consistency are embedded to refine the completion. For reasonable evaluation and further reference, we design two standard toolkits of different difficulty, containing different compositions of candidate parts. We conduct extensive comparisons with several baseline methods and ablation studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
