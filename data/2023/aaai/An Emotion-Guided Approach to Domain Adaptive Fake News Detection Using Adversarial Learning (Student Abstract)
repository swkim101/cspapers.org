Recent works on fake news detection have shown the efficacy of using emotions as a feature for improved performance. However, the cross-domain impact of emotion-guided features for fake news detection still remains an open problem. In this work, we propose an emotion-guided, domain-adaptive, multi-task approach for cross-domain fake news detection, proving the efficacy of emotion-guided models in cross-domain settings for various datasets.
