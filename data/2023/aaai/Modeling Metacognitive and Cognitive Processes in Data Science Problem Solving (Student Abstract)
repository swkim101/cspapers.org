Data Science (DS) is an interdisciplinary topic that is applicable to many domains. In this preliminary investigation, we use caselet, a mini-version of a case study, as a learning tool to allow students to practice data science problem solving (DSPS). Using a dataset collected from a real-world classroom, we performed correlation analysis to reveal the structure of cognition and metacognition processes. We also explored the similarity of different DS knowledge components based on studentsâ€™ performance. In addition, we built a predictive model to characterize the relationship between metacognition, cognition, and learning gain.
