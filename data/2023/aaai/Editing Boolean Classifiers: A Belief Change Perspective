This paper is about editing Boolean classifiers, i.e., determining how a Boolean classifier should be modified when new pieces of evidence must be incorporated. Our main goal is to delineate what are the rational ways of making such edits. This goes through a number of rationality postulates inspired from those considered so far for belief revision. We give a representation theorem and present some families of edit operators satisfying the postulates.
