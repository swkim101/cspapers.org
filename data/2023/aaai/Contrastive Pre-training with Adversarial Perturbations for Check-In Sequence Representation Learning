A core step of mining human mobility data is to learn accurate representations for user-generated check-in sequences. The learned representations should be able to fully describe the spatial-temporal mobility patterns of users and the high-level semantics of traveling. However, existing check-in sequence representation learning is usually implicitly achieved by end-to-end models designed for specific downstream tasks, resulting in unsatisfactory generalizable abilities and poor performance. Besides, although the sequence representation learning models that follow the contrastive learning pre-training paradigm have achieved breakthroughs in many fields like NLP, they fail to simultaneously consider the unique spatial-temporal characteristics of check-in sequences and need manual adjustments on the data augmentation strategies. So, directly applying them to check-in sequences cannot yield a meaningful pretext task. To this end, in this paper we propose a contrastive pre-training model with adversarial perturbations for check-in sequence representation learning (CACSR). Firstly, we design a novel spatial-temporal augmentation block for disturbing the spatial-temporal features of check-in sequences in the latent space to relieve the stress of designing manual data augmentation strategies. Secondly, to construct an effective contrastive pretext task, we generate “hard” positive and negative pairs for the check-in sequence by adversarial training. These two designs encourage the model to capture the high-level spatial-temporal patterns and semantics of check-in sequences while ignoring the noisy and unimportant details. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of CACSR on two kinds of downstream tasks using three real-world datasets. The results show that our model outperforms both the state-of-the-art pre-training methods and the end-to-end models.
