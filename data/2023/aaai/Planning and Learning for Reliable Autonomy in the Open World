Safe and reliable decision-making is critical for long-term deployment of autonomous systems. Despite the recent advances in artificial intelligence, ensuring safe and reliable operation of human-aligned autonomous systems in open-world environments remains a challenge. My research focuses on developing planning and learning algorithms that support reliable autonomy in fully and partially observable environments, in the presence of uncertainty, limited information, and limited resources. This talk covers a summary of my recent research towards reliable autonomy.
