Couples often encounter the challenge of sharing house chores. This raises the fundamental question of how to divide chores. In this paper, we present a new application for a fair division of household chores. Our platform, called Kajibuntan, allows couples to specify the set of chores to be shared, their preferences over them, and the current allocation. Our tool visualizes the current allocation and makes proposals according to their preferences based on the theory of fair division. The goal of our tool is to provide a systematic and transparent system to divide household chores and help creating harmony in the home.
