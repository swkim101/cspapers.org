Crowdsourcing is a popular method for crowd workers to collaborate on tasks. However, workers coordinate and share answers during the crowdsourcing process. The term for this is "collusion". Copies from others and repeated submissions are detrimental to the quality of the assignments. The majority of the existing research on collusion detection is limited to ground truth problems (e.g., labeling tasks) and requires a predetermined threshold to be established in advance. In this paper, we aim to detect collusion behavior of workers in an adaptive way, and propose an Adaptive Clustering Based Collusion Detection approach (ACCD) for a broad range of task types and data types solved via crowdsourcing (e.g., continuous rating with or without distributions). Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show the superiority of ACCD over state-of-the-art approaches.
