I am fascinated by how rich and flexible human intelligence is. From a quick glance at the scenes in Figure 1A, we effortlessly recognize the 3D geometry and texture of the objects within, reason about how they support each other, and when they move, track and predict their trajectories. Stacking blocks, picking up fruits---we also plan and interact with scenes and objects in many ways.
