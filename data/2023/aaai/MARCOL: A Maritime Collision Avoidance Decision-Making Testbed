Safe and efficient maritime navigation is fundamental for autonomous surface vehicles to support many applications in the blue economy, including cargo transportation that covers 90% of the global marine industry. We developed MARCOL, a collision avoidance decision-making framework that provides safe, efficient, and explainable collision avoidance strategies and that allows for repeated experiments under diverse high-traffic scenarios.
