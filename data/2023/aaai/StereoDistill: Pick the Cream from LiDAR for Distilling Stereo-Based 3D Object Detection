In this paper, we propose a cross-modal distillation method named StereoDistill to narrow the gap between the stereo and LiDAR-based approaches via distilling the stereo detectors from the superior LiDAR model at the response level, which is usually overlooked in 3D object detection distillation.
The key designs of StereoDistill are: the X-component Guided Distillation~(XGD) for regression and the Cross-anchor Logit Distillation~(CLD) for classification. In XGD, instead of empirically adopting a threshold to select the high-quality teacher predictions as soft targets, we decompose the predicted 3D box into 
sub-components and retain the corresponding part for distillation if the teacher component pilot is consistent with ground truth to largely boost the number of positive predictions and alleviate the mimicking difficulty of the student model. For CLD, we aggregate the probability distribution of all anchors at the same position to encourage the highest probability anchor rather than individually distill the distribution at the anchor level. 
Finally, our StereoDistill achieves state-of-the-art results for stereo-based 3D detection on the KITTI test benchmark and extensive experiments on KITTI and Argoverse Dataset validate the effectiveness.
