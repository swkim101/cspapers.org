Recent style translation methods have extended their transferability from texture to geometry. However, performing translation while preserving image content when there is a significant style difference is still an open problem. To overcome this problem, we propose Invertible Conditional Fast GAN (IcFGAN) based on GAN inversion and cFGAN. It allows for unpaired photo-to-manga face translation. Experimental results show that our method could translate styles under significant style gaps, while the state-of-the-art methods could hardly preserve image content.
