In this paper, we study the effect of preferences in abstract argumentation under a claim-centric perspective. Recent work has revealed that semantical and computational properties can change when reasoning is performed on 
 claim-level rather than on the argument-level, while under certain 
 natural restrictions (arguments with the same claims have the 
 same outgoing attacks) these properties are conserved. We now investigate
 these effects when, in addition, preferences have to be taken into account and consider four prominent reductions to handle preferences between arguments.
 As we shall see, these reductions give rise to 
 different classes of claim-augmented argumentation frameworks, and behave 
 differently in terms of semantic properties and computational complexity.
 This strengthens the view that the actual choice for handling preferences 
 has to be taken with care.
