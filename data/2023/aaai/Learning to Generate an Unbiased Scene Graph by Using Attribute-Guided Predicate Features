Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to capture the semantic information in an image and build a structured representation, which facilitates downstream tasks. The current challenge in SGG is to tackle the biased predictions caused by the long-tailed distribution of predicates. Since multiple predicates in SGG are coupled in an image, existing data re-balancing methods cannot completely balance the head and tail predicates. In this work, a decoupled learning framework is proposed for unbiased scene graph generation by using attribute-guided predicate features to construct a balanced training set. Specifically, the predicate recognition is decoupled into Predicate Feature Representation Learning (PFRL) and predicate classifier training with a class-balanced predicate feature set, which is constructed by our proposed Attribute-guided Predicate Feature Generation (A-PFG) model. In the A-PFG model, we first define the class labels of and corresponding visual feature as attributes to describe a predicate. Then the predicate feature and the attribute embedding are mapped into a shared hidden space by a dual Variational Auto-encoder (VAE), and finally the synthetic predicate features are forced to learn the contextual information in the attributes via cross reconstruction and distribution alignment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, our decoupled learning framework and A-PFG model are applied to various SGG models. The empirical results show that our method is substantially improved on all benchmarks and achieves new state-of-the-art performance for unbiased scene graph generation.
