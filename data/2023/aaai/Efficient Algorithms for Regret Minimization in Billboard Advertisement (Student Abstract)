Now-a-days, billboard advertisement has emerged as an effective outdoor advertisement technique. In this case, a commercial house approaches an influence provider for a specific number of views of their advertisement content on a payment basis. If the influence provider can satisfy this then they will receive the full payment else a partial payment. If the influence provider provides more or less than the demand then
certainly this is a loss to them. This is formalized as ‘Regret’
and the goal of the influence provider will be to minimize
the ‘Regret’. In this paper, we propose simple and efficient
solution methodologies to solve this problem. Efficiency and
effectiveness have been demonstrated by experimentation.
