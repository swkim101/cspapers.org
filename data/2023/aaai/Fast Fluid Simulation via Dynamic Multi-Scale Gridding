Recent works on learning-based frameworks for Lagrangian (i.e., particle-based) fluid simulation, though bypassing iterative pressure projection via efficient convolution operators, are still time-consuming due to excessive amount of particles. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic multi-scale gridding method to reduce the magnitude of elements that have to be processed, by observing repeated particle motion patterns within certain consistent regions. Specifically, we hierarchically generate multi-scale micelles in Euclidean space by grouping particles that share similar motion patterns/characteristics based on super-light motion and scale estimation modules. With little internal motion variation, each micelle is modeled as a single rigid body with convolution only applied to a single representative particle. In addition, a distance-based interpolation is conducted to propagate relative motion message among micelles. With our efficient design, the network produces high visual fidelity fluid simulations with the inference time to be only 4.24 ms/frame (with 6K fluid particles), hence enables real-time human-computer interaction and animation. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our work achieves great simulation acceleration with negligible prediction error increase.
