In this paper we introduce a simple way to evaluate epistemic logic programs by means of answer set programming with quantifiers, a recently proposed extension of answer set programming. The method can easily be adapted for most of the many semantics that were proposed for epistemic logic programs. We evaluate the proposed transformation on existing benchmarks using a recently proposed solver for answer set programming with quantifiers, which relies on QBF solvers.
