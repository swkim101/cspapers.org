Graph pattern mining is an essential task in many fields, which explores all the instances of user-interested patterns in a data graph. Pattern-centric mining systems transform the patterns into a series of set operations to guide the exploration and substantially outperform the embedding-centric counterparts that exhaustively enumerate all subgraphs. These systems provide novel specializations to achieve optimum search space, but the inherent redundancies caused by recurrent set intersections on the same or different subgraph instances remain and are difficult to trace, significantly degrading the performance.
In this paper, we propose a dataflow-based graph pattern mining framework named Cyclosa to eliminate the above redundancies by utilizing the concept of computation similarity. Cyclosa is characterized by three features. First, it reorganizes the set operations for a pattern into a set dataflow representation which can elegantly indicate the possibility of redundancies while sustaining the optimal scheduling for high performance. Second, the dataflow-guided parallel execution engine decouples data access and computations to enable efficient results sharing. Third, the memory-friendly data management substrate can automatically manage the computation results with high reuse possibility. Evaluation of different patterns demonstrates that Cyclosa outperforms state-of-the-art pattern-centric systems
