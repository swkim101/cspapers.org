Previous results have shown that a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) using different learning rates, such as different constant rates or different decaying rates, is useful for training generative adversarial networks (GANs) in theory and in practice. Moreover, not only the learning rate but also the batch size is important for training GANs with TTURs and they both affect the number of steps needed for training. This paper studies the relationship between batch size and the number of steps needed for training GANs with TTURs based on constant learning rates. We theoretically show that, for a TTUR with constant learning rates, the number of steps needed to find stationary points of the loss functions of both the discriminator and generator decreases as the batch size increases and that there exists a critical batch size minimizing the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. Then, we use the Fr'echet inception distance (FID) as the performance measure for training and provide numerical results indicating that the number of steps needed to achieve a low FID score decreases as the batch size increases and that the SFO complexity increases once the batch size exceeds the measured critical batch size. Moreover, we show that measured critical batch sizes are close to the sizes estimated from our theoretical results.
