We study provable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in the general framework of partially observable stochastic games (POSGs). To circumvent the known hardness results and the use of computationally intractable oracles, we advocate leveraging the potential \emph{information-sharing} among agents, a common practice in empirical MARL, and a standard model for multi-agent control systems with communications. We first establish several computation complexity results to justify the necessity of information-sharing, as well as the observability assumption that has enabled quasi-efficient single-agent RL with partial observations, for computational efficiency in solving POSGs. We then propose to further \emph{approximate} the shared common information to construct an {approximate model} of the POSG, in which planning an approximate equilibrium (in terms of solving the original POSG) can be quasi-efficient, i.e., of quasi-polynomial-time, under the aforementioned assumptions. Furthermore, we develop a partially observable MARL algorithm that is both statistically and computationally quasi-efficient. We hope our study may open up the possibilities of leveraging and even designing different \emph{information structures}, for developing both sample- and computation-efficient partially observable MARL.
