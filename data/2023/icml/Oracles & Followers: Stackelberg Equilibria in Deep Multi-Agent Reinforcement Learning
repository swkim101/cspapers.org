We argue that the random oracle model—where all parties have access to a public random oracle—provides a bridge between cryptographic theory and cryptographic practice. In the paradigm we suggest, a practical protocol <italic>P</italic> is produced by first devising and proving correct a protocol <italic>P<supscrpt>R</supscrpt></italic> for the random oracle model, and then replacing oracle accesses by the computation of an “appropriately chosen” function <italic>h</italic>. This paradigm yields protocols much more efficient than standard ones while retaining many of the advantages of provable security. We illustrate these gains for problems including encryption, signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs.
