This paper studies the multi-agent performative prediction (Multi-PP) games over multiplex networks. We consider a distributed learning setting where agents partially cooperate on an agent network , while during learning, the data samples drawn depend on the prediction models of the agent itself and neighboring agents on a population network . The dynamics of Multi-PP games is hence affected by the interplay between both networks. This paper concentrates on this Multi-PP game with the following contributions. Firstly, we analyze sufficient conditions for the existence of the performative stable equilibrium (PSE) and Nash equilibrium (NE) of the Multi-PP games. Secondly, we analyze the changes to the equilibrium induced by perturbed data distributions, and derive the closed-form solutions where the network topologies are explicit. Our results connect the existence of PSE/NE with strengths of agentsâ€™ cooperation, and the changes of equilibrium solutions across agents with their node centrality, etc. Lastly, we show that a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based distributed learning procedure finds the PSE under the said sufficient condition. Numerical illustrations on the network effects in Multi-PP games corroborate our findings.
