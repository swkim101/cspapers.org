We consider test-time adaptation (TTA), the task of adapting a trained model to an arbitrary test domain using unlabeled input data on-the-fly during testing. A common practice of TTA is to disre-gard data used in training due to large memory demand and privacy leakage. However, the training data are the only source of supervision. This motivates us to investigate a proper way of using them while minimizing the side effects. To this end, we propose two lightweight yet informative proxies of the training data and a TTA method fully exploiting them. One of the proxies is composed of a small number of images synthesized (hence, less privacy-sensitive) by data condensation which minimizes their domain-specificity to capture a general underlying structure over a wide spectrum of domains. Then, in TTA, they are translated into labeled test data by stylizing them to match styles of unlabeled test samples. This enables virtually supervised test-time training. The other proxy is inter-class relations of training data, which are transferred to target model during TTA. On four public benchmarks, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones at remarkably less computation and memory.
