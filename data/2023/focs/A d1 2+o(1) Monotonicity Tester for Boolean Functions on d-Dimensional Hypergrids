Monotonicity testing of Boolean functions on the hypergrid, $f:[n]^{d} \rightarrow\{0,1\}$, is a classic topic in property testing. Determining the non-adaptive complexity of this problem is an important open question. For arbitrary n, [Black-Chakrabarty-Seshadhri, SODA 2020] describe a tester with query complexity $\widetilde{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-4 / 3} d^{5 / 6}\right)$. This complexity is independent of n, but has a suboptimal dependence on d. Recently, [Braverman-Khot-Kindler-Minzer, ITCS 2023] and [Black-Chakrabarty-Seshadhri, STOC 2023] describe $\widetilde{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-2} n^{3} \sqrt{d}\right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-2} n \sqrt{d}\right)$-query testers, respectively. These testers have an almost optimal dependence on d, but a suboptimal polynomial dependence on n. In this paper, we describe a non-adaptive, onesided monotonicity tester with query complexity $O\left(\varepsilon^{-2} d^{1 / 2+o(1)}\right)$, independent of n. Up to the $d^{o(1)}$. factors, our result resolves the non-adaptive complexity of monotonicity testing for Boolean functions on hypergrids. The independence of n yields a non-adaptive, one-sided $O\left(\varepsilon^{-2} d^{1 / 2+o(1)}\right)$-query monotonicity tester for Boolean functions $f: \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow\{0,1\}$ associated with an arbitrary product measure.
