Methods for teaching computer science (CS) have changed very little in the past decades. As a result, students graduating from CS/IT programs, educated in the same manner year after year, develop software with the same prior limitations and exclusionary practices. An effort is underway to implement inclusive software design thinking, using the GenderMag method, to enable students to design software for people not like themselves, throughout the undergraduate CS/IT curriculum, with the goal of graduates becoming inclusive software designers. Faculty attended a four-half-day virtual summer workshop for background and practice on inclusive software design methods and use the materials in practice the following year, implementing the interventions in a set of courses in the CS/IT curriculum. Each year, from CS0/CS1 through Senior Capstone, introduces and/or reinforces inclusive design methods. The impact of this approach measured over the entire undergraduate curriculum will determine if students exposed to inclusive design as part of their CS/IT education will design more inclusive software than students not exposed to inclusive design. The effort's intent is not to disrupt the existing undergraduate courses but to integrate equity and inclusion in the CS/IT work the students are already doing. Faculty involved will discuss their preparation and activity, discussing how this method can broaden participation in computing. This talk will focus on non-invasive curriculum development that has taken place and the impact and changes to faculty in-class lesson delivery.
