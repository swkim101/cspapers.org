This assignment from an introductory programming class is to reproduce one of several choices of optical illusions. Part 1 of the assignment requires only loops, while part 2 requires nested loops. Students and instructors find the images interesting and surprising, so the assignment is fun for the students to do. What is unusual about the assignment is that it can be given very early in CS1 (after 2-3 weeks for part 1, after 4-5 weeks for part 2), provided your course structure includes use of a basic graphics library. We use a locally-developed graphics package, but the assignment is very flexible and most of the drawings can be produced with a wide variety of choices for graphics packages and programming languages. Students must also already be familiar with variables, loops, and nested loops. If they know how to produce animations, that increases the options you can include in the assignment. We give multiple options of images for the students to reproduce. The students then choose their own level of challenge. We see the more advanced students choosing a more difficult option and taking the assignment to a higher level, The easiest choice is accessible to essentially all of the students.
