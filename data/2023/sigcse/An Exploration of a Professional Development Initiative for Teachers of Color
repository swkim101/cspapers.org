The Computing Educator Diversity Initiative (CEDI) is focused around an innovative and interactive online learning process that focuses on teacher professional development. CEDI focuses on virtual versions of in-person workshops that highlight the importance of supporting educators of color as they prepare and eventually become certified to teach computer science. The poster will highlight how CEDI educators work within a community of practice to deepen their CS content knowledge, pedagogical skills, and equitable strategies to obtain their CS certification and become highly effective CS teachers. We will also present approaches and associated principles for preparing and supporting teachers of color through professional development, direct resources to teachers, and strategies for taking CS certification tests.
