The Audiovisual Labeled Emotion (ALE) Research Platform prototype is a small low-cost audio-visual research platform with an integrated labeling mobile app for self-reporting affect and activity. The platform is designed for collecting labeled audiovisual data sets to research paired or small group interactions in indoor educational, healthcare, or other settings where personal interaction occurs in a natural setting. This demonstration will describe how to setup and use the ALE research platform, present the sensors, including a camera system for 3D video and audio recording, and demonstrate the labeling app. The demonstration space will be used as an example setting for data collection. In addition, participants will be able to install and use the labeling app to get hands on experience with the system. Use of the ALE platform is both an opportunity to collect much more labeled observational data during educational activities as well as an opportunity to engage students in learning about human participant research so they can develop their own studies involving labeled audiovisual recordings of human interaction.
