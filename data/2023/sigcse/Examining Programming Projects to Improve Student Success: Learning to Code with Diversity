This lightning talk describes the beginning efforts to improve student success in introductory programming through an examination of projects, with a focus on improving diversity and inclusivity in the problems given. Some students struggle with completing tasks assigned in class. Often, the issue is they do not understand the programming concept that is required. However, sometimes it is a lack of understanding of the problem construct that prevents them from succeeding. To this end, we are reviewing the problems used in class assignments, removing as many roadblocks as possible. For example, one project asks students to create a program to play MadLibs. We have noticed that not all students know what this is, frequently because it is not a game played in their childhood culture. Thus, they struggle to understand the purpose of the game rather than focus on how to write the program. Since the goal of this project is to practice working with strings, the project directions can be modified to remove any mention of MadLibs. Similar modifications can be made with the goal of increased diversity. This can be done by including games from around the world, language exercises in non-English, or problems that highlight accessibility in technology. In addition to examining current assignments, we are also developing a survey to gather input from the students on what assignments were the hardest (and why). These efforts are ongoing; interested faculty and students are welcome to join our explorations and discussions.
