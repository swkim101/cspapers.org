Notional Machines (NMs) are a pedagogical device used by teachers in order to help students understand certain concepts. While NMs have been cataloged, the effectiveness of NMs has been rarely evaluated. We build upon this research by exploring what makes certain NMs more effective in various computer science and mathematics courses. We interview professors and students to assess NMs used in the classroom. Notably we found that most students are able to employ the NMs introduced by their professors, and that introductory students prefer template-like NMs, whereas upper level students rely on more conceptual NMs.
