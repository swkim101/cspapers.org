Lack of diversity and high dropout rates among underrepresented students plague the CS discipline. We developed, administered, and validated survey scales measuring social factors that impact the retention and graduation of under-represented CS undergrads at two institutions. Results revealed significant differences between students who identify as men vs. women in terms of computing identity and confidence, and between black and non-black students in terms of familiarity with future opportunities.
