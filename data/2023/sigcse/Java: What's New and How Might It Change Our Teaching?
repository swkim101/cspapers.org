Java had a long period of little change in its features: between Java 5 in 2004 and Java 9 in 2017, lambda functions were the only major addition to the language. However, Java's development pace has suddenly quickened, and not just in version numbers: by the time Java 17 was released in September 2021, new features in the language since Java 9 included record types, switch expressions, sealed classes, var declaration types, text blocks and pattern-matching instanceof. More new features are also on the horizon. Java remains one of the most popular languages for teaching in high-school and university/college, but many educators will not have had the time to learn these new features, let alone consider whether they should adjust their teaching to include any of these features. In this in-person workshop we will explain the new features to attendees and then facilitate discussion on whether the features should be incorporated into Java teaching at the introductory or advanced level, if at all.
