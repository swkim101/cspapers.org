Constituency Innovation Hubs (CIHs) is a project by the Kenyan government to establish digital hubs in each of its constituencies to promote digital literacy and to bridge the digital divide between the urban and rural areas. Each CIH provides digital equipment with free IT and Internet access for the local community and form a central part of the government's agenda to transform Kenya into an information society, preparing its citizens for a digital economy. The main emphasis has been on implementation of the hubs with little consideration for their ongoing maintenance and support, leading many of them to underperform or fail. The aim of this research was to investigate the challenges associated with a CIH and explore the reasons behind this with a view to proposing a more sustainable approach. The study adopted a case study approach focusing on a typical rural CIH in Ndhiwa. Using a qualitative approach, interviews were conducted with the local community (staff, users, and non-users of the CIH; n=53). Thematic analysis applied to the resulting data identified several key challenges: infrastructure, lack of knowledge, understanding, motivation and trust among users, and inadequate levels of tutor and technical support. This study recommends it is critical to work in partnership with each community to ensure the CIH is sustainable and meets that community's needs.
