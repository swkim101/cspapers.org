Conference presentations usually focus on successful innovations: new ideas that yield significant improvements to current practice. Yet we often learn more from failure than from success. In this panel, we present five case studies of "good ideas" for improving CS education that didn't go as planned, related to offering additional help to students. Each contributor will describe their "good idea," the situation that resulted, and wider lessons for the CS community.
