In a one-size-fits-all conventional teaching context, student disparities in the background of pre-knowledge, skills, or comprehension lead to the alienation of the struggling students while boring those who are experienced. At issue is the appropriateness of the one-size-fits-all pedagogical model. An alternative is adaptive learning. Dated back to 1912, Edward L. Thorndike proposed the idea of a mechanical miracle that intends to conduct personal instructions through special print. This idea has inspired century-old efforts to automate education by creating such a kind of teaching machine that adaptively features automation, timely feedback, and self-pacing to student mastery in classrooms. With the technology evolving, a great range of state-of-the-art works that provide digital "teaching machines" have emerged, allowing adaptive learning. However, most of them focus on math or elementary reading and writing skills, and few are on programming-based courses. The few available are costly, heavy-weighted in adaptability, or limited in mapping competencies to an entire formal assessment, with questions that are not naturally differentiated in an assessment and thus, lacking flexibility. In response to these issues, we initialized an exploratory project and developed an agile adaptive learning web tool that maximizes the adaptive and connected learning experience of students on Canvas. This demo provides a brief tutorial on the steps to set up learning concepts, learning objectives, and objective-to-question mappings as well as on-the-fly quiz generation that matches required learning outcomes along with visualization of assessment outcome coverage and student mastery map. A teaching case will also be demonstrated. In the demo, we will use CS2-DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) as an example, but the ideas apply generally.
