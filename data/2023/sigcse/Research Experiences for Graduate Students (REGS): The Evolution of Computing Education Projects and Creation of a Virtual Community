Despite the expansion and development of the field of computing education (CEd), a lack of formal programs means that researchers often exist as islands across and within a diverse range of departments. Given the broad nature of the discipline, trying to build a community typically occurs through more formal conferences. Another way to expand engagement with the field is through Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), programs that offer students the chance to get involved with research. REUs have been shown to strengthen disciplinary identity and encourage the pursuit of graduate degrees. However, such opportunities are not usually available at the graduate level. To address this gap, we present an experience report that describes our approach, Research Experiences for Graduate Students (REGS). In the work that follows, we detail our implementation and the partnerships created that allowed (n = 10) internationally dispersed graduate students from different institutions the chance to build connections, conduct CEd research, and develop a graduate-centric community. Leadership researchers, faculty, and staff supported the efforts, offering guidance and critical examination of the work to establish rigor over the course of the projects. Publications and presentations contributed to the CEd knowledge base, and interviews with the students upon completion of the experience illustrated the value of participation in the REGS.
