This virtual workshop introduces Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) to anyone who teaches CS or related subjects. In a POGIL classroom, teams of 3-4 learners work on activities with a particular structure based on learning cycles. Through scripted inquiry and investigation, learners discover concepts and construct their own knowledge. Using assigned team roles and other scaffolding, learners develop process skills and individual responsibility. The teacher is not a lecturer, but an active facilitator who helps all students to be engaged and achieve the learning objectives. POGIL is an evidence-based approach that has been shown to improve student performance significantly. Workshop participants will work through POGIL activities as students and complete meta-activities designed to introduce core POGIL concepts, practices, and benefits. We will share POGIL materials for a variety of CS courses. For more information, see http://IntroCSpogil.org and http://pogil.org, to find activities for CS1, CS2, and other courses.
