To address the issue of meaningfully including students in elementary computer science (CS) education, we design, implement, and evaluate an innovative professional development (PD) and community of practice (CoP) model for supporting elementary general and special education teacher dyads to apply inclusive pedagogy in their CS instructional practice. This project aims to improve interest, ability beliefs, and academic outcomes for elementary students with disabilities in CS learning. This online PD/CoP supports teachers in learning, implementing, and reflecting on how to best integrate Universal Design for Learning and High-Leverage Practices within CS instruction. Membership in this PD/CoP is predicted to increase the participation of students with disabilities in elementary CS instruction by increasing the teachers' CS content and pedagogical knowledge, self-efficacy, and inclusive mindsets and practice.
