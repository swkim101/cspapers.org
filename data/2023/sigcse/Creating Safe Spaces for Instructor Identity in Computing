This panel will highlight the experiences of Black, Asian, and Latinx women and non-binary instructors as junior faculty. Despite efforts to broaden participation, CS departments are often quite homogeneous, forcing faculty of marginalized identities to attenuate certain aspects of, or entire identities, to better "fit in" with their colleagues. We will discuss the impacts on faculty and engage with the audience to identify avenues of individual (i.e., colleagues) and systemic (i.e., department culture and policies) allyship.
