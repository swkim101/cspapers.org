PrairieLearn is an open source, extensible online assessment platform built on modern web technologies. In this workshop, we will focus on how PrairieLearn can be used to improve student learning in undergraduate computer science classes. However, the platform is also more than suitable for use as an assessment engine in a variety of courses including the humanities, social, physical, and life sciences. In the first part of the workshop, we will showcase multiple question styles that highlight PrairieLearn's abilities as an online platform, including deploying automatically and manually graded questions at scale in large classes. In the second part of the workshop, we will discuss the anatomy of a PrairieLearn question, create several custom questions, and design assessments in PrairieLearn. In the third part, we will share strategies on adopting PrairieLearn at your institution. In particular, how algorithmically generated questions can be used in support of alternative grading schemes such as Mastery- or Specifications-Grading. Finally, we will share how PrairieLearn can be extended to support other coding languages and paradigms with custom and external autograders. There will be plenty of opportunities for questions throughout the workshop, and we intend to leave plenty of time for additional 1:1 support and training. Attendees will be able to attend the session virtually and are recommended to bring a web-connected computing device. By the end of the session, attendees will know enough to run a whole class on PrairieLearn including designing questions appropriate for homework, labs, and tests.
