Software engineering is regularly listed as a top career, but typical curricula rarely equip college graduates to join latest industry practices. Providing a course on software deployment and operations (DevOps) gives students a place to learn how the practices of agile software engineering align with organizational culture and business objectives. Students can get hands-on experience with current industry practices, tools, and technologies along with broader context of their utility and purposes. This work invites discussion on the structure of a recently developed course on DevOps, including course modules, assignments, discussions, and projects. Reflections from a pilot offering are given, along with lessons learned and planned changes for the next offering.
