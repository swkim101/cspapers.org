Computer gameplay and social media are two widespread forms of entertainment in the digital age. Currently, there is little evidence to support that leisure-time digital consumption is associated with computer science (CS) affinity. Female students generally spend less time on gaming and more time on social media than male students, so a gender comparison perspective is helpful. Using a national sample of 10,197 U.S. college students in introductory CS courses, we found that frequent computer gameplay was strongly associated with a CS career interest for both male and female students. Yet, increased social media use predicted a higher CS career interest for female students but a lower interest in male students.
