Efforts in the United States to broaden the participation of racial and ethnic minorities in K12 computer science (CS) education often focus on the need for children to change themselves to meet the standards and norms of traditional computing education. Less attention has been paid to how CS education itself might change and adapt to cultural contexts and locations that children already participate in and find of value. In this paper, we describe efforts to change the shape and culture of CS education by designing and implementing it in and for a youth boxing gym in an African American community. We report findings from a boxing inspired CS curriculum that was designed in collaboration with boxing coaches, mentors, and academic staff members at the gym. It was piloted over the course of two six-hour workshops with 15 middle and high school age children. We focused on two issues that are relevant to broadening participation and reshaping the culture of CS education: (1) how the curriculum changed children's perceptions of CS and (2) the creative adaptations that children made to the curricular content and materials. An analysis of pre- and post-surveys using a nonparametric test showed significant positive changes in children's responses to the constructs of self-confidence and expression with CS. Vignettes of children appropriating and personalizing technologies from the workshops are used to unpack these findings. We end with a discussion about the implications of these findings for culture-based CS education in both school and community contexts.
