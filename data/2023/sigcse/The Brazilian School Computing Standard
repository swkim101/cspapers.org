In the last decade many countries have introduced Computing in school curricula, most including at least basic concepts as mandatory topics. In 2017/2018 a new National Standard for School Curricula was approved in Brazil, but Computing foundations were not included. In 2022 the Brazilian National Education Council approved an appendix to the standard containing guidelines regarding Computing which define abilities that must be developed in all schools in Brazil from pre-school to high school. These guidelines were ratified by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and implementation should start in 2023. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview and analysis of these approved guidelines for Computing in schools in Brazil, as well as a comparison with standards from other countries.
