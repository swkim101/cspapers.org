As enrollment numbers grow, educators face a number of challenges. Lectures and interacting with students aren't much of our job anymore, and in the long run, our success as educators depends on our management skills.

How to recruit the best TAs and help them grow? These questions become essential for CS educators. In this poster, we'll present the revisited management structure of an introductory CS course and briefly discuss some of the lessons learned.
