Statistical tests, such as t-tests, are in widespread use in computer science education research. However, without a formal statistical background, many researchers find themselves applying statistical tests while being uncertain about the principles behind them. This in-person workshop will help any researchers who use frequentist statistics and want a firmer understanding of the underlying principles: what is a p-value, what does statistical significance really mean, what is a confidence interval, what is good practice and what should be avoided? It is suitable for anyone with an interest in using statistics in their research.
