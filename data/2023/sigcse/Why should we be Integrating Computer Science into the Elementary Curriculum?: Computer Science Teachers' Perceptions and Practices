There is growing attention to the need for computer science (CS) education. Stakeholders have emphasized the importance of teaching CS to all students and exposing CS to students at the early elementary level. However, there are relatively few investigations into approaches for integrating CS education into elementary classroom instruction. In this work, we explored elementary CS teachers' CS integration perceptions and practices as the first step of a CS-integrated curriculum co-design program.
