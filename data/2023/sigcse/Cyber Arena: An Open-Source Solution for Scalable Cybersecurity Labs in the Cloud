Numerous institutions are developing cybersecurity education and training programs to supply the considerable global demand for cybersecurity professionals. However, these institutions face barriers in building realistic laboratory environments, commonly referred to as cyber ranges, needed for hands-on skills development. Cybersecurity labs differ from traditional computing labs in both size and complexity. They often require multiple distinct components to represent network configurations, adversarial computing, and defense mechanisms. We present an open-source cloud-based cybersecurity laboratory solution, enabling broader access to cybersecurity education by reducing complexity barriers as well as costs. Our solution already serves over one thousand students each year using the Google Cloud platform in a variety of learning environments. In this paper, we describe our solution's architecture and deployment characteristics. Additionally, we discuss challenges in educational institutions when using cloud-infrastructure platforms and our approaches in addressing these challenges.
