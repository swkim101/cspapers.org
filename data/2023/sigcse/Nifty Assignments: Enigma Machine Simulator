This Nifty Assignment submission outlines a programming in which students implement a simulator for the German Enigma machine from World War II-an encryption standard successfully broken by a team of mathematicians and engineers at Bletchley Park, England. The project is organized into six milestones, each of which requires only a small amount of code, making it easily accessible to an audience familiar with defining classes and using standard dictionary and list structures. The assignment uses the Model-View-Controller pattern as its underlying structure, thereby giving students a sense of how programming patterns work. Students are responsible only for implementing the model; the graphics code for the view and controller are provided in starter files available in both Python and Java. Through this project, students gain a greater understanding of object-oriented design in the context of an important event in the early history of computing.
