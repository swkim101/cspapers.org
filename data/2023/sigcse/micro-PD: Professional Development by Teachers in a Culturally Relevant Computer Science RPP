Elementary teachers within a culturally relevant computer science researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) co-designed and facilitated short professional development opportunities to share back to the RPP members, internally labeled as micro-PD. We describe the nature of these micro-PDs and share artifacts that the teachers co-constructed and taught as a preliminary model of collaboratively building learning opportunities within an RPP.
