Pair Programming (PP) is both a common practice in professional software engineering and a valuable pedagogical tool. Disciplined user-centric research on pair programming can answer important questions about how students use and benefit from PP. We have developed a platform called Twincode that includes features to support pair programming assignments, comprehensive instrumentation to enable studying how the PP partners interact, and additional tools to help in analyzing the instrumentation, in particular for utterance tagging in discourse analysis. This demo will take the audience through the entire process of conducting research on the Twincode platform: from users pair programming on the platform, to utterance tagging of user date, to data analysis in support of research questions.
