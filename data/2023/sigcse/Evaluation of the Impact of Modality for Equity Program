In this poster, we investigate the impact of online versus in-person summer equity programs. We designed and implemented a summer bridge program from 2020 through 2022 and collected pre- and post-survey data from students to measure the program's impact on students' self-concept, science motivation, growth mindset, help-seeking and concealment attitude, science identity, and sense of belonging. Our research questions are: RQ1: How do students' indicators change from pre-survey to post-survey in the online summer program (2020 and 2021) versus the in-person program (2022)? RQ2: What indicators are most impacted (positively or negatively) in an online version of the program? These questions will help inform us about how to support students who have started their undergraduate programs during the COVID-19 remote instruction period and whether or not the additional cost of an in-person summer program is justifiable by its impact on students.
