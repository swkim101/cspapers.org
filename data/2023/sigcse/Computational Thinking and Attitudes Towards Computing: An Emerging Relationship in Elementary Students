This study analyzed the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and coding attitudes of upper elementary students after exposure to a year-long CT curriculum. Using ordinary least squares regression and controlling for student demographics (i.e., gender and English Learner (EL) status), we found that CT skills were a significant factor in modeling coding attitudes, regardless of demographic controls. Interviews of the students unveiled an interaction between coding interest and social values in a debugging process.
