The AI4GA project is developing a nine-week elective course called Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence and piloting it in several Georgia middle schools. Since we aspire to educate all students about AI, the course addresses a wide range of student abilities, levels of academic preparedness, and prior computing experience, and leaves room for teachers to adapt the material to their own students' needs and interests. The course content is primarily focused on unplugged activities and online demonstration programs. We also provide small programming projects using AI tools as an option for teachers to incorporate. In this poster we describe lessons learned from initial pilot offerings by five teachers who taught 12 sections of the course totaling 299 students. We present evidence that middle school students can successfully engage with substantive technical content about Artificial Intelligence.
