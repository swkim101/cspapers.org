Python is a very popular programming language in high schools for teaching programming. It is often used as the first text-based programming language after earlier teaching with blocks. This shift to textual syntax can prove to be a bump in the road for learners. Frame-based editing is a hybrid between blocks and text, which can thus smooth this transition. Strype is a frame-based editor for Python that can now be used to program entirely within the web browser. Strype is free and publicly available (at https://strype.org/), and in this demo we will show how it can be used to write and execute code.
