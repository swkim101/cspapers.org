Algorithms are the backbone of computer science, and the area of visualizing algorithms has been studied since the 90s. However, despite the advancements in tools and languages for programming responsive and engaging user interfaces, there is currently a lack of in-depth, visually appealing visualizations for the advanced algorithms and data structures covered in undergraduate computing curricula. In light of students who commonly struggle with such content in upper-level courses, providing supplemental visual and interactive learning materials addresses a significant gap in supporting student learning.
