The recent fast development of quantum computers breaks several computation limitations that are difficult for conventional computers. Up to the present, although many approaches and tools have been proposed to test quantum programs, the fundamental features of quantum programs, i.e., magnitude, phase, and entanglement, have been largely overlooked, leading to limited fault detection capability and reduced testing effectiveness. To address this problem, we propose an automated testing framework named QURATEST, equipped with three test case generators (including two newly proposed techniques, UCNOT and IQFT in this paper, as well as one based on Random techniques) to test quantum programs. Overall, the proposed generators enable the generation of diverse test inputs by considering the quantum features of quantum programs. In the experiments, we perform an in-depth evaluation of QURATEST from three aspects: generated test case diversity, output coverage of the program under test, and fault detection capability. The results demonstrate the potential of our newly proposed techniques in that IQFT can generate the most diverse test cases regarding magnitude, phase, and entanglement, with 66% cell coverage. Comparatively, the Random approach only has 10% cell coverage. Regarding the evaluations of the output coverage, IQFT can achieve the highest output coverage in 70.2% (33 out of 47) of all quantum programs. In terms of fault detection, UCNOT outperforms the other two techniques. Specifically, the test cases generated by UCNOT have the best mutation score in 88.4% (23 out of 26) quantum programs.
