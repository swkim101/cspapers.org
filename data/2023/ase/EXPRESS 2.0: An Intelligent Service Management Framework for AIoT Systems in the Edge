AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) which integrates AI and IoT has received rapidly growing interest from the software engineering community in recent years. It is crucial to design scalable, efficient, and reliable software solutions for large-scale AIoT systems in edge computing environments. However, the lack of effective service management including the support for service collaboration, AI application, and data security in the edge, has seriously limited the development of AIoT systems. To seal this gap, we propose EXPRESS 2.0 which is an intelligent service management framework for AI oT in the edge. Specifically, on top of the existing EXPRESS platform, EXPRESS 2.0 includes the intelligent service collaboration management module, AI application management module, and data security management module. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, we design and implement a last-mile delivery system using both UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and UGVs (Unmanned Ground Vehicles). The EXPRESS 2.0 is open-sourced at https://github.com/ISEC-AHU/EXPRESS2.0. A video demonstration of EXPRESS 2.0 is at https://youtu.be/GHKD_VvJD88.
