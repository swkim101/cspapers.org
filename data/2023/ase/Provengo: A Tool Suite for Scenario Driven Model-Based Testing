We present Provengo, a comprehensive suite of tools designed to facilitate the implementation of Scenario-Driven Model-Based Testing (SDMBT), an innovative approach that utilizes scenarios to construct a model encompassing the user's perspective and the system's business value while also defining the desired outcomes. With the assistance of Provengo, testers gain the ability to effortlessly create natural user stories and seamlessly integrate them into a model capable of generating effective tests. The demonstration illustrates how SDMBT effectively addresses the bootstrapping challenge commonly encountered in model-based testing (MBT) by enabling incremental development, starting from simple models and gradually augmenting them with additional stories.
