Let Σ be an alphabet and µ be a distribution on Σk for some k ≥ 2. Let α > 0 be the minimum probability of a tuple in the support of µ (denoted supp(µ)). Here, the support of µ is the set of all tuples in Σk that have a positive probability mass under µ. We treat the parameters Σ, k, µ, α as fixed and constant. We say that the distribution µ has a linear embedding if there exist an Abelian group G (with the identity element 0G) and mappings σi : Σ → G, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, such that at least one of the mappings is non-constant and for every (a1, a2, …, ak)∈ supp(µ), ∑i=1k σi(ai) = 0G. Let fi: Σn→ [−1,1] be bounded functions, such that at least one of the functions fi essentially has degree at least d, meaning that the Fourier mass of fi on terms of degree less than d is negligible, say at most δ. In particular, |E[fi]| ≤ δ. The Fourier representation is w.r.t. the marginal of µ on the ith co-ordinate, denoted (Σ, µi). If µ has no linear embedding (over any Abelian group), then is it necessarily the case that |E(x1, x2, …, xk)∼ µ⊗ n[f1(x1)f2(x2)⋯ fk(xk)]  = od, δ(1), where the right hand side → 0 as the degree d → ∞ and δ → 0? In this paper, we answer this analytical question fully and in the affirmative for k=3. We also show the following two applications of the result. The first application is related to hardness of approximation. We show that for every 3-ary predicate P:Σ3 → {0,1} such that P has no linear embedding, an SDP integrality gap instance of a P-CSP instance with gap (1,s) can be translated into a dictatorship test with completeness 1 and soundness s+o(1), under certain additional conditions on the instance. The second application is related to additive combinatorics. We show that if the distribution µ on Σ3 has no linear embedding, marginals of µ are uniform on Σ, and (a,a,a)∈ supp(µ) for every a∈ Σ, then every large enough subset of Σn contains a triple (x1, x2,x3) from µ⊗ n (and in fact a significant density of such triples).
