We introduce a new topological argument based on the Borsuk-Ulam theorem to prove a lower bound on sign-rank. This result implies the strongest possible separation between randomized and unbounded-error communication complexity. More precisely, we show that for a particular range of parameters, the randomized communication complexity of the Gap Hamming Distance problem is O(1) while its unbounded-error communication complexity is Ω(log(n)). Previously, it was unknown whether the unbounded-error communication complexity could be asymptotically larger than the randomized communication In connection to learning theory, we prove that, despite its learnability properties, the class of large margin half-spaces in ℝd is genuinely high-dimensional, i.e., it cannot be embedded in d−1. This result is closely related to a recent conjecture of Alon, Hanneke, Holzman, and Moran (FOCS 2021) about the VC dimension of this class. Our final application is to the theory of dimension reductions. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss theorem implies that any set of N unit vectors is embeddable in dimension O(γ−2logN) without altering the signs of those pairwise inner products that have absolute values at least γ>0. Our result establishes the tightness of this bound, which answers a question of Linial, Mendelson, Schechtman, and Shraibman (Combinatorica, 27(2007)) in the case of partial functions.
