In the classical setting of self-selection, the goal is to learn k models simultaneously, from observations (x(i), y(i)) where y(i) is the output of one of k underlying models on input x(i). In contrast to mixture models, where we observe the output of a randomly selected model (and therefore the selection of which model is observed is exogenous), in self-selection models the observed model depends on the realized outputs of the underlying models themselves, as determined by some known selection criterion (e.g., we might observe the highest output, the smallest output, or the median output of the k models), and is thus endogenous. In known-index self-selection, the identity of the observed model output is observable; in unknown-index self-selection, it is not. Self-selection has a long history in Econometrics (going back to the works of Roy, Gronau, Lewis, Heckman, and others) and many applications in various theoretical and applied fields, including treatment effect estimation, imitation learning, learning from strategically reported data, and learning from markets at disequilibrium. In this work, we present the first computationally and statistically efficient estimation algorithms for the most standard setting of this problem where the models are linear. In the known-index case, we require poly(1/ε, k, d) sample and time complexity to estimate all model parameters to accuracy ε in d dimensions, and can accommodate quite general selection criteria. In the more challenging unknown-index case, even the identifiability of the linear models (from infinitely many samples) was not known. We show three results in this case for the commonly studied max self-selection criterion: (1) we show that the linear models are indeed identifiable, (2) for general k we provide an algorithm with poly(d)· exp(poly(k)) sample and time complexity to estimate the regression parameters up to error 1/poly(k), and (3) for k = 2 we provide an algorithm for any error ε and poly(d, 1/ε) sample and time complexity.
