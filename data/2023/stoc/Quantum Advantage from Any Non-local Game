We show a general method of compiling any k-prover non-local game into a single-prover (computationally sound) interactive game maintaining the same quantum completeness and classical soundness guarantees, up to a negligible additive factor in a security parameter. Our compiler uses any quantum homomorphic encryption scheme (Mahadev, FOCS 2018; Brakerski, CRYPTO 2018) satisfying a natural form of correctness with respect to auxiliary quantum input. The homomorphic encryption scheme is used as a cryptographic mechanism to simulate the effect of spatial separation, and is required to evaluate kâˆ’1 prover strategies out of k on encrypted queries. In conjunction with the rich literature on (entangled) multi-prover non-local games starting from the celebrated CHSH game (Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt, Physical Review Letters 1969), our compiler gives a broad and rich framework for constructing protocols that classically verify quantum advantage.
