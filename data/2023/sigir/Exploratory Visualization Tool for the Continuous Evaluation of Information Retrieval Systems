This paper introduces a novel visualization tool that facilitates the exploratory analysis of continuous evaluation for information retrieval systems. We base our analysis on score standardization and meta-analysis techniques applied to Information Retrieval evaluation. We present three functionalities: evaluation overview, delta evaluation, and meta-analysis applied to three perspectives: evaluation rounds, queries, and systems. To illustrate the use of the tool, we provide an example using the TREC-COVID test collection.
