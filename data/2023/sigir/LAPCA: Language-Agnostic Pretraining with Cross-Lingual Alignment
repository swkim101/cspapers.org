Data collection and mining is a crucial bottleneck for cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR). While previous works used machine translation and iterative training, we present a novel approach to cross-lingual pretraining called LAPCA (language-agnostic pretraining with cross-lingual alignment). We train the LAPCA-LM model based on XLM-RoBERTa and Å‚exa that significantly improves cross-lingual knowledge transfer for question answering and sentence retrieval on, e.g., XOR-TyDi and Mr. TyDi datasets, and in the zero-shot cross-lingual scenario performs on par with supervised methods, outperforming many of them on MKQA.
