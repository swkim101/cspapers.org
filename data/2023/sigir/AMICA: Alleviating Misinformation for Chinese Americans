The increasing popularity of social media promotes the proliferation of misinformation, especially in the communities of Chinese-speaking diasporas, which has caused significant negative societal impacts. In addition, most of the existing efforts on misinformation mitigation have focused on English and other western languages, which makes numerous overseas Chinese a very vulnerable population to online disinformation campaigns. In this paper, we present AMICA, an information retrieval system for alleviating misinformation for Chinese Americans. AMICA dynamically collects data from popular social media platforms for Chinese Americans, including WeChat, Twitter, YouTube, and Chinese forums. The data are stored and indexed in Elasticsearch to provide advanced search functionalities. Given a user query, the ranking of social media posts considers both topical relevance and the likelihood of being misinformation.
