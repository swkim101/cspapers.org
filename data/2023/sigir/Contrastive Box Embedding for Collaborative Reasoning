Most of the existing personalized recommendation methods predict the probability that one user might interact with the next item by matching their representations in the latent space. However, as a cognitive task, it is essential for an impressive recommender system to acquire the cognitive capacity rather than to decide the users' next steps by learning the pattern from the historical interactions through matching-based objectives. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to model the recommendation as a logical reasoning task which is more in line with an intelligent recommender system. Different from the prior works, we embed each query as a box rather than a single point in the vector space, which is able to model sets of users or items enclosed and logical operators (e.g., intersection) over boxes in a more natural manner. Although modeling the logical query with box embedding significantly improves the previous work of reasoning-based recommendation, there still exist two intractable issues including aggregation of box embeddings and training stalemate in critical point of boxes. To tackle these two limitations, we propose a Contrastive Box learning framework for Collaborative Reasoning (CBox4CR). Specifically, CBox4CR combines a smoothed box volume-based contrastive learning objective with the logical reasoning objective to learn the distinctive box representations for the user's preference and the logical query based on the historical interaction sequence. Extensive experiments conducted on four publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CBox4CR over the state-of-the-art models in recommendation task.
