In this paper, we offer a new visualization tool -- Dataset Statistical View (DSV), to lower the barrier of research entry by providing easy access to the question-answering (QA) datasets that researchers can build their work upon. Our target users are new researchers to the QA domain with no prior knowledge nor programming skills. The system is populated with multiple QA datasets, which covers a wide range of QA tasks. It allows researchers to explore and compare existing QA datasets at a one-stop website. The system shows statistical graphs for each QA dataset to offer an overview and a visual comparison between datasets. Although this paper focuses mainly at the syntactic level comparison, integrating bias and semantic level analysis is our ongoing work. We believe our DSV system is a valuable contribution to the advancement of the QA field, as it provides a solid starting point for new researchers and practitioners. An overview of the framework is demonstrated in this paper and the introduction of the application system is available at https://cnchuy.github.io/images/demo.mp4.
