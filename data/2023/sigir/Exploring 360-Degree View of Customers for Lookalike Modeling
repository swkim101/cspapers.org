Lookalike models are based on the assumption that user similarity plays an important role towards product selling and enhancing the existing advertising campaigns from a very large user base. Challenges associated to these models reside on the heterogeneity of the user base and its sparsity. In this work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the customers' different behaviors or features such as demographics, buying behaviors on different platforms, customer loyalty behaviors and build a lookalike model to improve customer targeting for Rakuten Group, Inc. Extensive experiments on real e-commerce and travel datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed lookalike model for user targeting task.
