Evaluation is one of the major concerns when developing information retrieval systems. Especially in the field of conversational AI, this topic has been heavily studied in the setting of both non-task and task-oriented conversational agents (dialogue systems).[1] Recently, several automatic metrics e.g., BLEU and ROUGE, proposed for the evaluation of dialogue systems, have shown poor correlation with human judgment and are thus ineffective for the evaluation of dialogue systems. As a consequence, a significant amount of research relies on human evaluation to estimate the effectiveness of dialogue systems[1, 4}. An emerging approach for evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems (TDS) is to estimate a user's overall satisfaction with the system from explicit and implicit user interaction signals [2, 3]. Though useful and effective, overall user satisfaction does not necessarily give insights into what aspects or dimensions a TDS is performing well on. Understanding why a user is satisfied or dissatisfied helps the TDS recover from an error and optimize towards an individual aspect to avoid total dissatisfaction during an interaction session. Understanding a user's satisfaction with TDS is crucial, mainly for two reasons. First, it allows system designers to understand different user perceptions regarding satisfaction, which in turn leads to better user personalization. Secondly, it can be used to avoid total dialogue failure by the system by deploying adaptive conversational approaches, such as failure recovery or switching topics. And, thus, fine-grained evaluation of TDS gives the system an opportunity to learn an individual user's interaction preferences leading to a fulfilled user goal. Therefore in this research, we take the first initiative toward understanding user satisfaction with TDS. We mainly focus on the fine-grained evaluation of conversational systems in a task-oriented setting.
