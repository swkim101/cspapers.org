Dynamic share recommendation, which aims at recommending a friend who would like to share a particular item at a certain timestamp, has emerged as a novel task for social-oriented e-commerce platforms. Different from traditional graph-based recommendation tasks, with integrating the interconnected social interactions and fine-grained temporal information from historical share records, this novel task may encounter one unique challenge, i.e., how to deal with the dynamic social connections and asymmetric share interactions. Even worse, users may keep inactive during some periods, which results in difficulties in updating personalized profiles. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a dynamic graph share recommendation model called DynShare. Specifically, we first divide each user embedding into two parts, namely the invitation embedding and vote embedding to show the tendencies of sending and receiving items, respectively. Then, temporal graph attention networks (TGATs) based on bi-directional continuous time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) are leveraged to encode temporal neighbor information from different directions. Afterward, to estimate how different users perceive the time intervals after the last interaction, we further design a time-interval aware personalized projection operator on the foundation of temporal point processes (TPPs) to project user embedding for the next-time share prediction. Extensive experiments on a real-world e-commerce share dataset have demonstrated that our proposed DynShare can achieve better results compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods. And our code is available on the project website: https://github.com/meteor-gif/DynShare.
