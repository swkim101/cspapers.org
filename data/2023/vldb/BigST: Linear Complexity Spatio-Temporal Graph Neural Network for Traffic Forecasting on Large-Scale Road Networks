 Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) has been used as a common workhorse for traffic forecasting. However, most of them require prohibitive quadratic computational complexity to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies, thus hindering their applications to long historical sequences on large-scale road networks in the real-world. To this end, in this paper, we propose BigST, a linear complexity spatio-temporal graph neural network, to efficiently exploit long-range spatio-temporal dependencies for large-scale traffic forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a scalable long sequence feature extractor to encode node-wise long-range inputs (
 e.g.
 , thousands of time-steps in the past week) into low-dimensional representations encompassing rich temporal dynamics. The resulting representations can be pre-computed and hence significantly reduce the computational overhead for prediction. Then, we build a linearized global spatial convolution network to adaptively distill time-varying graph structures, which enables fast runtime message passing along spatial dimensions in linear complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on two large-scale real-world traffic datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BigST can scale to road networks with up to one hundred thousand nodes, while significantly improving prediction accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art traffic forecasting models.
