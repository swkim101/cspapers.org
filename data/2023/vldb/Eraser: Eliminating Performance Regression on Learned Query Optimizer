Efficient query optimization is crucial for database management systems. Recently, machine learning models have been applied in query optimizers to generate better plans, but the unpredictable performance regressions prevent them from being truly applicable. To be more specific, while a learned query optimizer commonly outperforms the traditional query optimizer on average for a workload of queries, its performance regression seems inevitable for some queries due to model under-fitting and difficulty in generalization. In this paper, we propose a system called Eraser to resolve this problem. Eraser aims at eliminating performance regressions while still attaining considerable overall performance improvement. To this end, Eraser applies a two-stage strategy to estimate the model accuracy for each candidate plan, and helps the learned query optimizer select more reliable plans. The first stage serves as a coarse-grained filter that removes all highly risky plans with feature values that are seen for the first time. The second stage clusters plans in a more fine-grained manner and evaluates each cluster according to the prediction quality of learned query optimizers for selecting the final execution plan. Eraser can be deployed as a plugin on top of any learned query optimizer. We implement Eraser and demonstrate its superiority on PostgreSQL and Spark. In our experiments, Eraser eliminates most of the regressions while bringing very little negative impact on the overall performance of learned query optimizers, no matter whether they perform better or worse than the traditional query optimizer. Meanwhile, it is adaptive to dynamic settings and generally applicable to different database systems.
