Bipartite graph embedding (BGE), as the fundamental task in bipartite network analysis, is to map each node to compact low-dimensional vectors that preserve intrinsic properties. The existing solutions towards BGE fall into two groups: metric-based methods and graph neural network-based (GNN-based) methods. The latter typically generates higher-quality embeddings than the former due to the strong representation ability of deep learning. Nevertheless, none of the existing GNN-based methods can handle billion-scale bipartite graphs due to the expensive message passing or complex modelling choices. Hence, existing solutions face a challenge in achieving both embedding quality and model scalability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel graph neural network named AnchorGNN based on global-local learning framework, which can generate high-quality BGE and scale to billion-scale bipartite graphs. Concretely, AnchorGNN leverages a novel anchor-based message passing schema for global learning, which enables global knowledge to be incorporated to generate node embeddings. Meanwhile, AnchorGNN offers an efficient one-hop local structure modelling using maximum likelihood estimation for bipartite graphs with rational analysis, avoiding large adjacency matrix construction. Both global information and local structure are integrated to generate distinguishable node embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorGNN outperforms the best competitor by up to 36% in accuracy and achieves up to 28 times speed-up against the only metric-based baseline on billion-scale bipartite graphs.
