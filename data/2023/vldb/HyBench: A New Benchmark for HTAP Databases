In this paper, we propose, HyBench, a new benchmark for HTAP databases. First, we generate the testing data by simulating a representative HTAP application. We particularly develop a time-dependent generation phase and an anomaly generation phase for testing HTAP with large cardinality and various anomalies. Second, we propose a set of hybrid workloads. Specifically, we design 18 read/write transactions, 13 analytical queries, and a mix workload of 6 analytical transactions and 6 interactive queries. We also develop a graph-based parameter curation method to control the access patterns including skew access and data contention of the hybrid workload. Third, we propose a unified metric for quantifying the overall HTAP performance. Particularly, we introduce a query-driven method that evaluates the data freshness (lag time between analytics and transactions). Then we introduce a three-phase execution rule to compute a unified metric, combining the performance of OLTP (TPS), OLAP (QPS), and OLXP (XPS) and data freshness. To verify the effectiveness of HyBench and to debunk the myth of different HTAP architectures, extensive experiments have been conducted over five HTAP databases.
