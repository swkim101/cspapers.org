An n -bit boolean function is resilient to coalitions of size q if no ﬁxed set of q bits is likely to inﬂuence the value of the function when the other n − q bits are chosen uniformly at random, even though the function is nearly balanced. We construct explicit functions resilient to coalitions of size q = n/ (log n ) O (log log n ) = n 1 − o (1) computable by linear-size circuits and linear-time algorithms. We also obtain a tight size-depth tradeoﬀ for computing such resilient functions. Constructions such as ours were not available even non-explicitly. It was known that functions resilient to coalitions of size q = n 0 . 63 ... can be computed by linear-size circuits [BL85]
