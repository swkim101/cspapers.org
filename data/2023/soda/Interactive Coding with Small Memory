In this work, we design an interactive coding scheme that converts any two party interactive protocol Π into another interactive protocol Π (cid:48) , such that even if errors are introduced during the execution of Π (cid:48) , the parties are able to determine what the outcome of running Π would be in an error-free setting. Importantly, our scheme preserves the space complexity of the protocol, in addition to the communication and computational complexities. Speciﬁcally, if the protocol Π has communication complexity T , computational complexity t , and space complexity s , the resulting protocol Π (cid:48) is resilient to a constant (cid:15) > 0 fraction of adversarial errors, and has communication complexity approaching T as (cid:15) approaches 0, computational complexity poly( t ), and space complexity O ( s log T ). Prior to this work, all known interactive coding schemes required the parties to use at least Ω( T ) space, as the parties were required to remember the transcript of the conversation thus far, or considered weaker error models.
