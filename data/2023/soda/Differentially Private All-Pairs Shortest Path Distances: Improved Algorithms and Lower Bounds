We study the problem of releasing the weights of all-pair shortest paths in a weighted undirected graph with differential privacy (DP). In this setting, the underlying graph is fixed and two graphs are neighbors if their edge weights differ by at most $1$ in the $\ell_1$-distance. We give an $\epsilon$-DP algorithm with additive error $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3} / \epsilon)$ and an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm with additive error $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} / \epsilon)$ where $n$ denotes the number of vertices. This positively answers a question of Sealfon (PODS'16), who asked whether a $o(n)$-error algorithm exists. We also show that an additive error of $\Omega(n^{1/6})$ is necessary for any sufficiently small $\epsilon, \delta>0$. Finally, we consider a relaxed setting where a multiplicative approximation is allowed. We show that, with a multiplicative approximation factor $k$, %$2k - 1$, the additive error can be reduced to $\tilde{O}\left(n^{1/2 + O(1/k)} / \epsilon\right)$ in the $\epsilon$-DP case and $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3 + O(1/k)} / \epsilon)$ in the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP case, respectively.
