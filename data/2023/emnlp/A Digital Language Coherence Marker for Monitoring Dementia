The use of spontaneous language to derive appropriate digital markers has become an emergent, promising and non-intrusive method to diagnose and monitor dementia. Here we propose methods to capture language coherence as a cost-effective, human-interpretable digital marker for monitoring cognitive changes in people with dementia. We introduce a novel task to learn the temporal logical consistency of utterances in short transcribed narratives and investigate a range of neural approaches. We compare such language coherence patterns between people with dementia and healthy controls and conduct a longitudinal evaluation against three clinical bio-markers to investigate the reliability of our proposed digital coherence marker. The coherence marker shows a significant difference between people with mild cognitive impairment, those with Alzheimer's Disease and healthy controls. Moreover our analysis shows high association between the coherence marker and the clinical bio-markers as well as generalisability potential to other related conditions.
