Unsupervised Chinese word segmentation (UCWS) has made progress by incorporating linguistic knowledge from pre-trained language models using parameter-free probing techniques. However, such approaches suffer from increased training time due to the need for multiple inferences using a pre-trained language model to perform word segmentation. This work introduces a novel way to enhance UCWS performance while maintaining training efficiency. Our proposed method integrates the segmentation signal from the unsupervised segmental language model to the pre-trained BERT classifier under a pseudo-labeling framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the seven out of eight UCWS tasks while considerably reducing the training time compared to previous approaches.
