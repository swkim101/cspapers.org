The task of scholarly keyphrase boundary classification aims at identifying keyphrases from scientific papers and classifying them with their types from a set of predefined classes (e.g., task, process, or material). Despite the importance of keyphrases and their types in many downstream applications including indexing, searching, and question answering over scientific documents, scholarly keyphrase boundary classification is still an under-explored task. In this work, we propose a novel embedding constraint on multi-task knowledge distillation which enforces the teachers (single-task models) and the student (multi-task model) similarity in the embedding space. Specifically, we enforce that the student model is trained not only to imitate the teachersâ€™ output distribution over classes, but also to produce language representations that are similar to those produced by the teachers. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms previous works and strong baselines on three datasets of scientific documents.
