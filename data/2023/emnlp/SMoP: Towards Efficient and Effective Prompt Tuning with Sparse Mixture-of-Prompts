Prompt tuning has emerged as a successful parameter-efficient alternative to the full fine-tuning of language models. However, prior works on prompt tuning often utilize long soft prompts of up to 100 tokens to improve performance, overlooking the inefficiency associated with extended inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt tuning method SMoP ( S parse M ixture-o f-P rompts) that utilizes short soft prompts for efficient training and inference while maintaining performance gains typically induced from longer soft prompts. To achieve this, SMoP employs a gating mechanism to train multiple short soft prompts specialized in handling different subsets of the data, providing an alternative to relying on a single long soft prompt to cover the entire data. Experimental results demonstrate that SMoP outperforms baseline methods while reducing training and inference costs. We release our code at https://github.com/jyjohnchoi/SMoP .
