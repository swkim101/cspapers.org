Can non-programmers annotate natural language utterances with complex programs that represent their meaning? We introduce APEL, a framework in which non-programmers select among candidate programs generated by a seed semantic parser (e.g., Codex). Since they cannot understand the candidate programs, we ask them to select indirectly by examining the programs' input-ouput examples. For each utterance, APEL actively searches for a simple input on which the candidate programs tend to produce different outputs. It then asks the non-programmers only to choose the appropriate output, thus allowing us to infer which program is correct and could be used to fine-tune the parser. As a first case study, we recruited human non-programmers to use APEL to re-annotate SPIDER, a text-to-SQL dataset. Our approach achieved the same annotation accuracy as the original expert annotators (75%) and exposed many subtle errors in the original annotations.
