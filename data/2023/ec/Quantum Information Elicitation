Information elicitation is the study of mechanisms which incentivize self-minded agents to reveal their private information. Perhaps the most fundamental scenario is the scoring rule setting, where a principal wishes to incentivize a single agent to reveal their private belief about the probability of a future outcome. Specifically given a reported probability distribution p ∈ Δy, and the realized outcome y ∈ Y, the principal wishes to design a proper scoring rule S(p, y), such that the agent will maximize their expected score by reporting their true belief. This basic setting is fundamental in statistics and machine learning [Gneiting 2011], and forms the basis of more complex mechanisms like prediction markets, wagering mechanisms, and peer prediction.
