Experimentation is prevalent in online marketplaces and social networks to assess the effectiveness of new market intervention. In an experiment, the platform exposes a (randomized) group of targeted users to the new feature or, equivalently, assigns each user to either the treatment or the control group. The platform then uses the resulting outcomes to estimate the new feature's total market effect, i.e., the difference in total user outcomes if the feature is introduced to the entire market.
