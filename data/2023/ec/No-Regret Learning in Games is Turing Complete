Many multi-agent machine learning settings can be modeled as games, from social or economic systems with algorithmic decision-makers to popular learning architectures such as generative adversarial networks (GANs). Desired outcomes in these settings are often encoded as equilibrium concepts, and therefore a primary goal is identifying machine learning algorithms with provable convergence to these equilibria. However, a growing body of negative results casts doubt on this goal by uncovering games exhibiting non-convergence, chaos, and even essentially arbitrary behaviour [Andrade et al. 2021; Bena√Øm et al. 2012; Cheung and Piliouras 2019; Chotibut et al. 2020; Flokas et al. 2020; Letcher 2021; Milionis et al. 2022; Wibisono et al. 2022].
