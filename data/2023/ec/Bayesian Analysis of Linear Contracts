We study a generalization of both the classic single-dimensional mechanism design problem, and the hidden-action principal-agent problem of contract theory [c.f., Alon et al. 2021]. In this setting, the principal seeks to incentivize an agent with a private Bayesian type to take a costly action. The goal is to design an incentive compatible menu of contracts which maximizes the expected revenue.
