In centralized market mechanisms individuals may not fully observe other individuals' type reports. Hence, the mechanism designer may deviate from the promised mechanism without the individuals being able to detect these deviations. In this paper, we develop a theory of auditability for allocation and social choice problems. Namely, we measure a mechanism's auditability by the smallest number of individuals that can jointly detect any deviation. Our theory reveals stark contrasts between prominent mechanisms' auditability properties in various applications. For priority-based allocation problems, we find that the Immediate Acceptance mechanism is maximally auditable, in a sense that any deviation can always be detected by just two individuals. On the other extreme, the Deferred Acceptance mechanism is minimally auditable, in a sense that some deviations may go undetected unless the type reports of everyone are known. For a class of mechanisms that can be implemented as Deferred Acceptance in systematically modified problems, we establish a relation between a mechanism's auditability and the uniqueness of stable outcomes in the modified problems. For single-unit auction problems, we show that under the first-price and the all-pay auction mechanisms just two individuals can detect any deviation, whereas the second-price auction mechanism requires full information for detecting an adversarial deviation. For voting problems with a binary outcome, we characterize the dictatorial rule as the unique voting mechanism under which any deviation can be detected by a single individual. Moreover, we characterize the majority voting rule as the unique most auditable anonymous voting mechanism. Finally, for the choice with affirmative action setting, we compare the auditability of two prominent reserves mechanisms, establishing the superiority of one mechanism over the other.
