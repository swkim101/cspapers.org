We consider a variation of the classic Adwords problem where the online algorithm does not know the advertisers' budgets a priori and the budget of an advertiser is revealed to the algorithm only when it is exceeded. A naïve greedy algorithm is 0.5 competitive for this setting and finding an algorithm with better performance remained an open problem. We show that no deterministic algorithm has competitive ratio better than 0.5 and give the first (randomized) algorithm with strictly better performance guarantee. We show that the competitive ratio of our algorithm is at least 0.522 but also strictly less than (1 − 1/e). We present novel applications of budget oblivious algorithms in search ads and beyond. In particular, we show that our algorithm achieves the best possible performance guarantee for deterministic online matching in the presence of multi-channel traffic.
