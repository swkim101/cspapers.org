We present a global, large-scale measurement of Internet traffic shadowing, a less-studied yet covert format of on-path manipulation. As part of pervasive monitoring, data within packets is silently observed, retained, and then leveraged to produce additional, un-solicited requests. To depict the landscape of such behaviors, we generate a collection of decoy traffic that lures on-path exhibitors, spread them via 4,364 vantage points recruited from commercial VPN providers, and capture unsolicited requests triggered by them. We find traffic shadowing against DNS, HTTP, and TLS protocols; DNS queries to several public resolvers are most susceptible, by being observed on a wide range of Internet paths. Through hop-by-hop tracerouting, we find observers of DNS queries associated with destinations, while HTTP messages are mostly observed on the wire. User data can be retained for long, e.g., over 10 days, and can be leveraged for more than once. While a notable portion of unsolicited requests originate from addresses labeled by blocklists, we find most of them are performing reconnaissance, and we see no evidence of exploits attempted in the collected traffic.
