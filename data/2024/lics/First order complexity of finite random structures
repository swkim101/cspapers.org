For a sequence of random structures with n-element domains over a relational signature, we define its FO complexity as a certain subset in the Banach space ℓ∞/c0. The well-known FO zero-one law and FO convergence law correspond to FO complexities equal to {0, 1} and a subset of R, respectively. We present a hierarchy of FO complexity classes, introduce a stochastic FO reduction that allows to transfer complexity results between different random structures, and deduce using this tool several new logical limit laws for binomial random structures. Finally, we introduce a conditional distribution on graphs, subject to a FO sentence ϕ, that generalises certain well-known random graph models, show instances of this distribution for every complexity class, and prove that the set of all ϕ validating 0--1 law is not recursively enumerable.
