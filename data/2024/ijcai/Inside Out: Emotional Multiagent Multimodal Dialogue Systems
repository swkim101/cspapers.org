Emotion recognition in conversation is important for an empathetic dialogue system to understand the userâ€™s emotion and then generate appropriate emotional responses. However, most previous researches focus on modeling conversational contexts primarily based on the textual modality or simply utilizing multimodal information through feature concatenation. In order to exploit multimodal information and contextual information more effectively, we propose a multimodal directed acyclic graph (MMDAG) network by injecting information flows inside modality and across modalities into the DAG architecture. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models. Comparative studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed modality fusion method.
