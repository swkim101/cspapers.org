Current Event Stream Super-Resolution (ESR) methods overlook the redundant and complementary information present in positive and negative events within the event stream, employing a direct mixing approach for super-resolution, which may lead to detail loss and inefficiency. To address these issues, we propose an efficient Recursive Multi-Branch Information Fusion Network (RMFNet) that separates positive and negative events for complementary information extraction, followed by mutual supplementation and refinement. Particularly, we introduce Feature Fusion Modules (FFM) and Feature Exchange Modules (FEM). FFM is designed for the fusion of contextual information within neighboring event streams, leveraging the coupling relationship between positive and negative events to alleviate the misleading of noises in the respective branches. FEM efficiently promotes the fusion and exchange of information between positive and negative branches, enabling superior local information enhancement and global information complementation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves over 17% and 31% improvement on synthetic and real datasets, accompanied by a 2.3x acceleration. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on two downstream event-driven applications, i.e., object recognition and video reconstruction, achieving remarkable results that outperform existing methods.
