As a typical visual art form, Chinese calligraphy has a long history and aesthetic value. However, current methods for generating Chinese fonts still struggle with complex character shapes and lack personalized writing styles. To address these issues, we propose a font generation method for Chinese Calligraphy based on diffusion model incorporating physical information neural network (PINN), which is named DP-Font. Firstly, the multi-attribute guidance is combined to guide the generation process of the diffusion model and introduce the critical constraint of stroke order in Chinese characters, aiming to significantly improve the quality of the generated results. We then incorporate physical constraints into the neural network loss function, utilizing physical equations to provide in-depth guidance and constraints on the learning process. By learning the movement rule of the nib and the diffusion pattern of the ink, DP-Font can generate personalized calligraphy styles. The generated fonts are very close to the calligraphers' works. Compared with existing deep learning-based techniques, DP-Font has made significant progress in enhancing the physical plausibility of the model, generating more realistic and high-quality results.
