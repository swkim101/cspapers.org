SE(3) equivariance is a fundamental property that is highly desirable to maintain in physical dynamics modeling. This property ensures neural outputs to remain robust when the inputs are translated or rotated. Recently, there have been several proposals for SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) that have shown promising results in simulating particle dynamics. However, existing works have neglected an important issue that current SE(3) equivariant GNNs cannot scale to large particle systems. Although some simple normalization techniques are already in use to stabilize the training dynamics of equivariant graph networks, they actually break the SE(3) equivariance of the architectures. In this work, we first show the numerical instability of training equivariant GNNs on large particle systems and then analyze some existing normalization strategies adopted in modern works. We propose a new normalization layer called GeoNorm, which can satisfy the SE(3) equivariance and simultaneously stabilize the training process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on N-body system simulation tasks with larger particle system sizes. The experimental results demonstrate that GeoNorm successfully preserves the SE(3) equivariance compared to baseline techniques and stabilizes the training dynamics of SE(3) equivariant GNNs on large systems.
