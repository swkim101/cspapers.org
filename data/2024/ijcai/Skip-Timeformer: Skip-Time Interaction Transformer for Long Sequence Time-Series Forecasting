Recent studies have raised questions about the suitability of the Transformer architecture for long sequence time-series forecasting. These forecasting models leverage Transformers to capture dependencies between multiple time steps in a time series, with embedding tokens composed of data from individual time steps. However, challenges arise when applying Transformers to predict long sequences with strong periodicity, leading to performance degradation and increased computational burden. Furthermore, embedding tokens formed one time step at a time may struggle to reveal meaningful information in long sequences, failing to capture correlations between different time steps. In this study, we propose Skip-Timeformer, a Transformer-based model that utilizes a skip-time interaction for long sequence time-series forecasting. Specifically, we decompose the time series into multiple subsequences based on different time intervals, embedding various time steps into variable tokens across multiple sequences. The skip-time interaction mechanism utilizes these variable tokens to capture dependencies in the skip-time dimension. Additionally, skip-time interaction is employed to learn dependencies between sequences missed by multiple skip time steps. The Skip-Timeformer model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets, further enhancing the long sequence forecasting capabilities of the Transformer variations and better adapting to arbitrary lookback windows.
