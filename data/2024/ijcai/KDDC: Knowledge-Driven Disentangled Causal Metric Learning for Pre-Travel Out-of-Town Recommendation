Pre-travel recommendation is developed to provide a variety of out-of-town Point-of-Interests (POIs) for users planning to travel away from their hometowns but have not yet decided on their destination. Existing out-of-town recommender systems work on constructing users' latent preferences and inferring travel intentions from their check-in sequences. However, there are still two challenges that hamper the performance of these approaches: i) Users' interactive data (including hometown and out-of-town check-ins) tend to be rare, and while candidate POIs that come from different regions contain various semantic information; ii) The causes for user check-in include not only interest but also conformity, which are easily entangled and overlooked. To fill these gaps, we propose a Knowledge-Driven Disentangled Causal metric learning framework (KDDC) that mitigates interaction data sparsity by enhancing POI semantic representation and considers the distributions of two causes (i.e., conformity and interest) for pre-travel recommendation. Specifically, we pretrain a constructed POI attribute knowledge graph through a segmented interaction method and POI semantic information is aggregated via relational heterogeneity. In addition, we devise a disentangled causal metric learning to model and infer userrelated representations. Extensive experiments on two real-world nationwide datasets display the consistent superiority of our KDDC over state-of-theart baselines.
