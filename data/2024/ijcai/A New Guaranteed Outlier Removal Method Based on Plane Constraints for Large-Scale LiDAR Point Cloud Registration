In this paper, we present a novel registration method based on plane constraints for large-scale LiDAR point clouds, effectively decoupling rotation estimation and translation estimation. For rotation estimation, we propose an outlier removal method that combines coarse filtering with rotation-invariant constraints and refined filtering based on computational geometric consistency checks, effectively pruning outliers and robustly estimating accurate relative rotations from plane normals. In translation estimation, we propose a component-wise method based on plane translation constraints to efficiently estimate relative translations. The robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method are empirically validated on three popular LiDAR point cloud datasets. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.
