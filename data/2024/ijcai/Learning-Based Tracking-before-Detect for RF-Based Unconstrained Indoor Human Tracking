Existing efforts on human tracking using wireless signal are primarily focused on constrained scenarios with only a few individuals in empty spaces. However, in practical unconstrained scenarios with severe interference and attenuation, accurate multi-person tracking has been intractable. In this paper, we propose NeuralTBD, utilizing the capability of deep models and advancement of Tracking-Before-Detect (TBD) methodology to achieve accurate human tracking. TBD is a classical tracking methodology from signal processing accumulating measurement in time domain to distinguish target traces from interference, which however relies on handcrafted shape/motion models, impeding efficacy in complex indoor scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we build an end-to-end learning-based TBD framework leverages the advanced modeling capabilities of deep models to significantly enhance the performance of TBD. To evaluate NeuralTBD, we collect an RF-based tracking dataset in unconstrained scenarios, which encompasses 4 million annotated radar frames with up to 19 individuals acting in 6 different scenarios. NeuralTBD realizes a 70% improvement in performance compared to conventional TBD methods. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt dealing with RF-based unconstrained human tracking. The code and dataset will be released.
