Supporting proofs of evaluations, polynomial commitment schemes (PCS) are crucial in secure distributed systems. Schemes based on fast Reed–Solomon interactive oracle proofs (RS-IOP) of proximity have recently emerged, offering transparent setup, plausible post-quantum security, efficient operations, and, notably, sublinear proof size and verification. Manifesting a new paradigm, PCS with one-to-many proof can enhance the performance of (asynchronous) verifiable secret sharing ((A)VSS), a cornerstone in distributed computing, for proving multiple evaluations to multiple verifiers. Current RS-IOP-based multivariate PCS, including HyperPlonk (Eurocrypt '23) and Virgo (S&P '20), however, only offer quasi-linear prover complexity in the polynomial size.
We propose PolyFRIM, a fast RS-IOP-based multivariate PCS with optimal linear prover complexity, 5-25× faster than prior arts while ensuring competent proof size and verification. Heeding the challenging absence of FFT circuits for multivariate evaluation, PolyFRIM surpasses Zhang et al.'s (Usenix Sec. '22) one-to-many univariate PCS, accelerating proving by 4-7× and verification by 2-4× with 25% shorter proof. Leveraging PolyFRIM, we propose an AVSS scheme FRISS with a better efficiency tradeoff than prior arts from multivariate PCS, including Bingo (Crypto '23) and Haven (FC '21).
