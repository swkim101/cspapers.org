We develop ORANalyst, the first systematic testing framework tailored for analyzing the robustness and operational integrity of Open RAN (O-RAN) implementations. O-RAN systems are composed of numerous microservice-based components. ORANalyst initially gains insights into these complex component dependencies by combining efficient static analysis with dynamic tracing. Applying these insights, ORANalyst crafts test inputs that effectively navigate these dependencies and thoroughly test each target component. We evaluate ORANalyst on two O-RAN implementations, O-RAN-SC and SD-RAN, and identify 19 previously undiscovered vulnerabilities. If exploited, these vulnerabilities could lead to various denial-of-service attacks, resulting from component crashes and disruptions in communication channels.
