We consider the problem of publicly verifiable privacy-preserving data aggregation in the presence of a malicious aggregator colluding with malicious users. State-of-the-art solutions either split the aggregator into two parties under the assumption that they do not collude, or require many rounds of interactivity and have non-constant verification time.
In this work, we propose mPVAS, the first publicly verifiable privacy-preserving data aggregation protocol that allows arbitrary collusion, without relying on trusted third parties during execution, where verification runs in constant time. We also show three extensions to mPVAS: mPVAS+, for improved communication complexity, mPVAS-IV, for the identification of malicious users, and mPVAS-UD, for graceful handling of reduced user availability without the need to redo the setup. We show that our schemes achieve the desired confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Finally, through both theoretical and experimental evaluations, we show that our schemes are feasible for real-world applications.
