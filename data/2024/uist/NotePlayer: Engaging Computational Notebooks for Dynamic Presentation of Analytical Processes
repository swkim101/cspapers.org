Diverse presentation formats play a pivotal role in effectively conveying code and analytical processes during data analysis. One increasingly popular format is tutorial videos, particularly those based on Jupyter notebooks, which offer an intuitive interpretation of code and vivid explanations of analytical procedures. However, creating such videos requires a diverse skill set and significant manual effort, posing a barrier for many analysts. To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative tool called NotePlayer, which connects notebook cells to video segments and incorporates a computational engine with language models to streamline video creation and editing. Our aim is to make the process more accessible and efficient for analysts. To inform the design of NotePlayer, we conducted a formative study and performed content analysis on a corpus of 38 Jupyter tutorial videos. This helped us identify key patterns and challenges encountered in existing tutorial videos, guiding the development of NotePlayer. Through a combination of a usage scenario and a user study, we validated the effectiveness of NotePlayer. The results show that the tool streamlines the video creation and facilitates the communication process for data analysts.
