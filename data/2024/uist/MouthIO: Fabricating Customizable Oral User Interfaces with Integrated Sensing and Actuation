This paper introduces MouthIO , the first open-source and customizable intraoral user interface that can be equipped with various sensors and output components. MouthIO consists of an SLA-printed brace that houses a flexible PCB within a bite-proof enclosure positioned between the molar teeth and inner cheeks. Our MouthIO design and fabrication technique enables makers to customize the oral user interfaces in both form and function at low cost. All parts in contact with the oral cavity are made of bio-compatible materials to ensure safety, while the design takes into account both comfort and portability. We demonstrate MouthIO through three application examples ranging from beverage consumption monitoring, health monitoring, to assistive technology. Results from our full-day user study indicate high wearability and social acceptance levels, while our technical evaluation demonstrates the deviceâ€™s ability to withstand adult bite forces.
