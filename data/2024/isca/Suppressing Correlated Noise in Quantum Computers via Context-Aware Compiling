Coherent errors, and especially those that occur in correlation among a set of qubits, are detrimental for large-scale quantum computing. Correlations in noise can occur as a result of spatial and temporal configurations of instructions executing on the quantum processor. In this paper, we perform a detailed experimental characterization of many of these error sources, and theoretically connect them to the physics of superconducting qubits and gate operations. Equipped with this knowledge, we devise compiler strategies to suppress these errors using dynamical decoupling or error compensation into the rest of the circuit. Importantly, these strategies are successful when the context at each layer of computation is taken into account: how qubits are connected, what crosstalk terms exist on the device, and what gates or idle periods occur in that layer. Our context-aware compiler thus suppresses some dominant sources of error, making further error mitigation or error correction substantially less expensive. For example, our experiments show an increase of $\mathbf{1 8. 5 \%}$ in layer fidelity for a candidate 10 -qubit circuit layer compared to context-unaware suppression. Owing to the exponential nature of error mitigation, these improvements due to error suppression translate to several orders of magnitude reduction of sampling overhead for a circuit consisting of a moderate number of layers.
