With the increasing popularity of recommendation systems (RecSys), the demand for compute resources in data-centers has surged. However, the model-wise resource allocation employed in current RecSys model serving architectures falls short in effectively utilizing resources, leading to sub-optimal total cost of ownership. We propose ElasticRec, a model serving architecture for RecSys providing resource elasticity and high memory efficiency. ElasticRec is based on a microservice-based software architecture for fine-grained resource allocation, tailored to the heterogeneous resource demands of RecSys. Additionally, ElasticRec achieves high memory efficiency via our utility-based resource allocation. Overall, ElasticRec achieves an average $3.3 \times$ reduction in memory allocation size and $8.1 \times$ increase in memory utility, resulting in an average $1.6 \times$ reduction in deployment cost compared to state-of-the-art RecSys inference serving system.
