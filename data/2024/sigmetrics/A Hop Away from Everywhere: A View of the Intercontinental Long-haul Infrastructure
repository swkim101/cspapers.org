We present a longitudinal study of intercontinental long-haul links (LHL) - links with latencies significantly higher than that of all other links in a traceroute path. Our study is motivated by the recognition of these LHLs as a network-layer manifestation of transoceanic undersea cables. We present a methodology and associated processing system for identifying long-haul links in traceroute measurements, and report on our findings from. We apply this system to a large corpus of traceroute data and report on multiple aspects of long haul connectivity including country-level prevalence, routers as international gateways, preferred long-haul destinations, and the evolution of these characteristics over a 7 year period.
