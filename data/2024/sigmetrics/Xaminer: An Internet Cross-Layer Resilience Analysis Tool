A resilient Internet infrastructure is critical in our highly interconnected society. However, the Internet faces several vulnerabilities, ranging from natural disasters to human activities, that can impact the physical layer and, in turn, the higher network layers, such as IP links. In this paper, we introduce Xaminer, the first Internet cross-layer resilience analysis tool, to evaluate the interplay between physical- and network-layer failures. Using a cross-layer Internet map and a failure event model, Xaminer generates a risk profile encompassing a cross-layer impact report, critical infrastructure identification at each layer, and the discovery of trends and patterns under different failure event settings. Xaminer's key strengths lie in its adaptability to diverse disaster scenarios, the ability to assess risks at various granularities, and the capability to generate joint risk profiles for multiple events. We demonstrate Xaminer's capabilities in cross-layer analysis across a spectrum of disaster event models and regions, showcasing its potential role in facilitating well-informed decision-making for resilience planning and deployments. The Xaminer tool is available as open-source software.
