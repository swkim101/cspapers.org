Despite a growing interest in understanding the industrial control networks that monitor and control our critical infrastructures (such as the power grid), to date, SCADA networks have been analyzed in isolation from each other. They have been treated as monolithic networks without taking into consideration their differences. In this paper, we analyze real-world data from different parts of a power grid (generation, transmission, distribution, and end-consumer) and show that these industrial networks exhibit a variety of unique behaviors and configurations that have not been documented before. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to tackle the analysis of power grid networks at this level. Our results help us dispel several misconceptions proposed by previous work, and we also provide new insights into the differences and types of SCADA networks.
