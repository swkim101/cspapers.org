We establish an explicit multi-dimensional state space collapse (SSC) for parallel-processing systems with arbitrary compatibility constraints between servers and job types. This breaks major new ground beyond the SSC results and queue length asymptotics in the literature which are largely restricted to complete resource pooling (CRP) scenarios where the steady-state queue length vector concentrates around a line in heavy traffic. The multi-dimensional SSC that we establish reveals heavy-traffic behavior which is also far more tractable than the pre-limit queue length distribution, yet exhibits a fundamentally more intricate structure than in the one-dimensional case.
