In response to the exponential surge in Video on Demand (VOD) traffic, numerous research endeavors have concentrated on optimizing and enhancing infrastructure efficiency. In contrast, this paper explores whether users' demand patterns can be shaped to reduce the pressure on infrastructure. Our main idea is to design a mechanism that alters the distribution of user requests to another distribution which is much more cache-efficient, but still remains 'close enough' (in terms of cost) to fulfil individual user's preference.
