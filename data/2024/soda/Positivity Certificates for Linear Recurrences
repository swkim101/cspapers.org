We show that for solutions of linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients of Poincar\'e type and with a unique simple dominant eigenvalue, positivity reduces to deciding the genericity of initial conditions in a precisely defined way. We give an algorithm that produces a certificate of positivity that is a data-structure for a proof by induction. This induction works by showing that an explicitly computed cone is contracted by the iteration of the recurrence.
