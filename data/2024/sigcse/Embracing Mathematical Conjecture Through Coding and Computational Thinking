Mathematics and computer science education have an intertwined history as proof undergirds both disciplines. This initial instrumental case study follows 16 different computational science students through a series of 8 linear algebra modules. Thematic analysis was used to highlight that when students learn mathematics through computation, opportunities for conjecture can be fostered alongside computational thinking.
