Embedded ethics education integrates ethical considerations into computer sciences courses in support of ethics-informed design, development, and deployment of technology. Scholarly assessment has demonstrated that such modules can influence students' attitudes about the relevance and importance of ethics to their work, as well as their perceived ability to tackle ethical issues in the workplace. In this paper, we report on a study that investigates whether embedded ethics modules have an impact beyond the classroom. Specifically, we examine whether embedded ethics modules influence students to learn more about ethics on their own, whether students are better able to recognize ethical issues when they enter the workplace for an industrial or research work experience, and whether they report that the modules they participated in helped them to navigate the ethical situations they encountered at work. While further assessment is needed to investigate these questions fully, our results suggest that embedded ethics modules can indeed have this kind of positive impact beyond the classroom.
