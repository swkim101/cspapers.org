Setting up development environments may be a complex hurdle for students who approach coding for the first time, and standardising environments among students may be an even greater challenge for teachers. Researchers and teachers tried to mitigate this issue with several solutions, all with different trade-offs, which may exclude students with limited internet access, low-powered devices, or lower computer proficiency. In this demo, we propose Interactive Code Playgrounds (ICPs), web pages displayed as slides that include a front-end component enabling code execution and code output display. This architecture simplifies the installation procedure, as students need only a web browser, and gives ICPs the chance to be a more long-lasting technology, as they have minimal external dependencies. As web pages, ICPs can be distributed as links or shared as single files, re-creating the user experience of PDF slide decks. Additional benefits of ICPs include a uniform development environment improved accessibility compared to PDFs due to HTML's underlying tree structure, the inclusion of semantic tags, and text captions.
