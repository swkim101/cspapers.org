The prevalence of data across all disciplines and the large workforce demand from industry has led to the rise in interest of data science courses. Educators are increasingly recognizing the value of building communities of practice and adapting and translating courses and programs that have been shown to be successful and sharing lessons learned in increasing diversity in data science education. We describe and analyze our experiences translating a lower-division data science curriculum from one university, University of California, Berkeley, to another setting with very different student populations and institutional context, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). We present our findings from student interviews across two semesters of the course offering at UMBC specifically focusing on the challenges and positive experiences that the students had in the UMBC course. We highlight lessons learned to reflect on the existing large scale program at UC Berkeley, its adaptation and opportunities for increasing diversity in new settings. Our findings emphasize the importance of adapting courses and programs to existing curricula, student populations, cyberinfrastructure, and faculty and staff resources. Smaller class sizes open up the possibility of more individualized assignments, tailored to the majors, career interests, and social change motivations of diverse students. While students across institutional contexts may need varying degrees of support, we found that often students from diverse backgrounds, if engaged deeply, show significant enthusiasm for data science and its applications.
