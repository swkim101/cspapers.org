In response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action, Canadian post-secondary institutions face the important, and daunting, task of decolonizing or Indigenizing curriculum across all disciplines. Computer science (CS) is not exempt from this responsibility and CS educators find themselves facing a challenging task. The field of computer science can seem very removed from Indigenous Ways of Knowing; training as an academic leaves many unprepared for the challenge of Indigenization or decolonization of curriculum or pedagogy; non-Indigenous educators are often deeply concerned with how to approach this task respectfully and authentically; and many computer science professors have had few opportunities to engage with Indigenous scholars and communities. This poster explores four themes on a journey towards preparing for authentic Indigenization of CS curriculum. The journey begins with a reflection on the settler-colonial context in which many CS educators find themselves. Indigenization includes respectfully acknowledging the traditions, peoples, and cultures of the lands on which we live and work, which have largely been silenced by the colonization process. Authentic Indigenization should include building reciprocal relationships with Indigenous communities. Finally, CS educators will benefit from an interdisciplinary approach when exploring how to respectfully adopt and incorporate different worldviews into their teaching practice. This poster provides an opportunity to reflect upon and discuss these important facets of Indigenizing and decolonizing our curriculum.
