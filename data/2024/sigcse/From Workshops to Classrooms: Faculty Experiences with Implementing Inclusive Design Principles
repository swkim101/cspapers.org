Computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) curricula are grounded in theoretical and technical skills. Topics like equity and inclusive design are rarely found in mainstream student studies. This results in graduates with outdated practices and limitations in software development. A research project was conducted to educate the faculty to integrate inclusive software design into the CS undergraduate curriculum. The objective is to produce graduates with the ability to develop inclusive software. This experience report presents the results of teaching inclusive design throughout the four-year CS and IT curriculum, focusing on the impact on faculty. This easy-to-adopt, high-impact approach improved student retention and classroom climate, broadening participation. Research questions address faculty understanding of inclusive software design, the approach's feasibility, improvement in students' ability to design equitable software, and assessment of the inclusiveness culture for students in computing programs. Faculty attended a summer workshop to learn about inclusive design and update their teaching materials to include the GenderMag method. Beginning in CS0 and CS1 and continuing through Senior Capstone, faculty used updated course assignments to include inclusive design in 10 courses for 44 sections taught. Faculty outcomes are positive, with the planning to include inclusive design and working with other department faculty most engaging. Faculty were impressed by student ownership and adoption of inclusive design methods, particularly in the culminating capstone senior project.
