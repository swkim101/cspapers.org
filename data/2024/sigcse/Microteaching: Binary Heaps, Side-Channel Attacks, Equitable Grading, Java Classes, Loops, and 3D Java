This microteaching session is like Nifty Assignments for instruction. Instead of having the presenters just talk about their teaching, they will simulate how they would actually teach something. Covering a range of topics and grade levels, six educators will demo how they would teach a specific topic. To help identify the pedagogical practices that cut across grade bands and topics, the moderator, Colleen Lewis, will describe how their pedagogical practices connect with education research. The goal of the session is to inspire SIGCSE attendees by highlighting innovative instruction by exceptional educators. Attendees can adopt the content and/or pedagogical practices from each microteaching example.
