Not all degree programs are created equal. Indeed, the structure, prerequisites and overall complexity of some programs create barriers that impede student success. Inspired by the methodology of previous papers investigating the inverse relationship between curricular complexity and program quality, in this paper we investigate the relationship between curricular complexity and the representation of women earning CS degrees. We created curricular maps of 60 computer science degrees and calculated measures such as program complexity, course blocking, delay factor, and total math/CS credits to understand complexity's correlation with the representation of women CS majors. Our results show that degree complexity, blocking factor, and delay factor are all inversely related to the representation of women. In addition, we present the courses that most commonly impede student progress and provide suggestions to enhance degree programs based on the insights gained.
