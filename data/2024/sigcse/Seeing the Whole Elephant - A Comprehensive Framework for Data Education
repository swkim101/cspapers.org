While there has been exciting recent progress in developing curricula for data education, more work is needed to establish connection points between data science, computer science, and other disciplines. This position paper argues for a broader, more all-encompassing perspective on data education to ensure opportunities are not missed. Our primary contribution is a comprehensive framework to visualize the data education landscape with the goal of improving understanding of how the various data education disciplines, work roles, core competencies, and skills fit together. Students and educators could benefit from such a framework, and all constituents of data education might better communicate requirements and more effectively make use of data and the data workforce.
