Although many undergraduate computing students participate in internships, little research explores these experiences. Using survey data from 1,018 undergraduate computing students at 15 U.S. research institutions and Social Cognitive Career Theory as a theoretical framework, this study explores the experiences of computing undergraduates who participated in computing internships and the extent to which their internship experiences shaped their reported interest in pursuing computing-related careers after graduation. The study investigates how students' experiences in their primary computing internship may vary by gender and racial/ethnic identities. Findings indicate that a large majority of computing students felt that their internship experiences increased their professional skills and awareness of the skills most valued in the workplace; these findings held across gender and racial/ethnic groups. However, women, particularly white and Asian women, were more likely to report that their internship helped them increase their technical skills than their male peers. Indeed, growth in one's professional skillset was the strongest predictor of students' increased interest in a computing career. Also, identifying as a woman or gender non-conforming individual, working in an internship environment with same-gender peers, and having strong computing self-efficacy were positively associated with increased interest in a computing career. These findings highlight the key role that internships can play in retaining undergraduate women and non-binary students in computing as they transition from college to career.
