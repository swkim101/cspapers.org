In the United States 1 in 5 people live in a rural area, and many other countries also have large rural populations. These rural populations face many challenges that make them less likely to engage with computer science education. Studies with specific rural populations have demonstrated that those students have less access to and engagement with educational opportunities involving computer science, and that these disparities are even greater for intersectional populations who are both rural and from a recognized group underrepresented in computer science. Moreover recent sociological research has suggested that rural populations share a complex and cohesive group identity that goes beyond "living in a rural area". While many universities and institutions are making inroads in understanding and engaging our rural populations, these efforts are often in their infancy and there is much for us to learn. In this session, we will facilitate a discussion of the challenges facing our varied rural populations and how the members of this community are seeking to address them. We invite anyone who wants to learn and/or share about ongoing efforts, identify challenges (and potential research questions), disseminate best practices, and forge new collaborations to join us.
