The demand for computing talent is at an all-time high, but not everyone feels equally welcome or has equal access to pursue opportunities in technology fields. Women, non-binary, Black, Hispanic/Latino/a/x, and first-generation students are the least likely to have access to paid undergraduate internships that lead to job opportunities in technology companies. This experience report discusses two programs designed to address the lack of internships among historically excluded populations: a micro-internship program and a career program. We present data showing the role that each program played in creating professional pathways for racially diverse undergraduate women and non-binary students. Both programs prepare these undergraduates for professional environments by exposing them to tech careers and developing their social capital through professional networking. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected as well as summer employment plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. We present the short- and long-term impact of each program on students' career interests and sense of belonging in computing. A summary of lessons learned from implementing each program are also shared for stakeholders interested in designing similar programs.
