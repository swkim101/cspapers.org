Many SIGCSE attendees are either developing or using online educational tools, and all will benefit from better interoperability among these tools and better analysis of the clickstream data coming from those tools. New tools for analyzing big data leveraged by AI (e.g., deep learning for assessment) in turn improve both content and pedagogy, thus setting up a virtuous cycle fueling learning discoveries and leveraging innovation in AI: Online technologies → big data analysis → better online technologies. This NSF-supported workshop is the latest in a series of SPLICE workshops, and is a continuation of our event at SIGCSE 2023, where the SPLICE-Portal, a dedicated socio-technical research infrastructure for Computing Education Research, was presented. This year, we continue the work with several new SPLICE community working groups, including those on Dashboards, Large Language Models, Parsons Problems, and Smart Learning Content Protocols. We continue to build upon our existing collaborations developed over the course of the project to engage more members of the community in tasks that will advance the project agenda.
