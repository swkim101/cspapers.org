Computing Ethics (CE) courses are an increasingly important component of the undergraduate computing curriculum because of the outsized influence of computing on society. CE encompasses topics from multiple disciplines including the humanities; however, it is typically taught by educators within a Computer Science (CS) department in most undergraduate institutions in the United States, potentially leading to a less than comprehensive CE education for students. We surveyed 318 computing educators in US higher education to investigate CS educators' perceptions of how CE topics should ideally be taught. Most of our respondents thought that CE should be taught by a multidisciplinary team of instructors, and further that it should be taught both as a standalone course and embedded in other courses. Our research provides insights into ways to improve CE education that result in a better student experience.
