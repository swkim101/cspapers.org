Educators should provide access to all students with inclusive and equitable computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) learning outcomes. Yet access to CS and CT is not always available for students with disabilities. This qualitative cross-case study examined the barriers and strengths three exemplar teachers faced, explored the supports and resources they provided, and presented how these teachers defined successful inclusive CS learning outcomes for their students. The data set included analysis of the semistructured teachers' interviews and teaching materials. The results included seven successful strategies the teachers identified: 1) using physical computing, 2) pair programming, 3)connecting CS and Individual Education Plans (IEP), 4)applying hands-on activities, 5) CT integration, 6) using CS vocabulary, and 7)open-ended pedagogy. Three resources and supports the teacher provided emerged from the data set as follows: 1) accessible instructional materials, 2) projects with multiple entry points, and 3) essential scaffolding supports. Whereas four barriers teachers faced; 1. subject matter, 2) accessible tools, 3) students receiving support, 3) the role of CS in instruction, and 4) the role of time served as additional findings. The results suggested that school-based practitioners, including administrators, can overcome the barriers and promote successful strategies that lead to asset-based CS-inclusion in the classroom.
