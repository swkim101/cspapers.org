Computational thinking is gradually being introduced into elementary school curricula, usually accompanied by some form of programming activity. However, even a creative and hands-on activity such as programming Ozobot robots with color codes requires elementary school teachers to provide adequate help. We therefore developed hint cards based on criteria for effective feedback and common color code mode issues. Based on our experience of using the hint cards in 17 workshops in elementary schools with 328 children and 21 educators, we identify how the hint cards (1) address feedback challenges, (2) support learning, and (3) can be adapted for broader use. We find that hint cards provide benefits at the teacher, learner and organizational level, but also identify possible disadvantageous circumstances. Although the hint cards support learning regarding affective, cognitive and meta-cognitive aspects, strategies for adaptation are needed. We discuss how the hint cards can be used in other contexts, and give recommendations on how to use the knowledge of common issues and hint cards for supporting elementary school teachers with teaching programming.
