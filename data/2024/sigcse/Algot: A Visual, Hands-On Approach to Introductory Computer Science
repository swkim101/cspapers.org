Algot is a newly developed visual programming language that seeks to bridge the syntax-semantics gap in programming via a novel implementation of programming by demonstration. Preliminary research, which will be presented separately at SIGCSE this year, suggests that Algot may be useful for teaching foundational computer science concepts at both secondary and tertiary levels. In this proposed SIGCSE demo session, attendees will have a chance to interact with Algot and learn about its potential benefits in their own classrooms.
