In 1913, Pólya asked for which (0,1)-matrices A it is possible to create a new matrix A′ by changing some of the signs such that the permanent of A equals the determinant of A′. A combinatorial solution to this problem was found by Little in 1975; he found these matrices to be exactly the biadjacency matrices of bipartite graphs excluding K3,3 as a matching minor. Utilising ideas from graph minors theory, this characterisation was later shown to yield a polynomial time algorithm to compute the permanent of matrices which satisfy Little’s condition. By a seminal result of Valiant, computing the permanent of (0,1)-matrices in general is #P-hard; however, it can be observed that the tractability of the permanent is closely related to the exclusion of matchings minors in bipartite graphs. Building on the results of Robertson’s and Seymour’s graph minors theory it was shown that the permanent remains tractable under the exclusion of a planar or a single-crossing matching minor. In this paper, we provide an essential next step in the form of a matching theoretic analogue of the Flat Wall Theorem for bipartite graphs, describing the local structure of bipartite graphs excluding Kt,t as a matching minor. Our result builds on a tight relationship between structural digraph theory and matching theory and allows us to deduce a Flat Wall Theorem for digraphs which substantially differs from a previously established directed variant of this theorem.
