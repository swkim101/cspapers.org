Extracting finite state automata (FSAs) fromblack-box models offers a powerful approachto gaining interpretable insights into complexmodel behaviors. To support this pursuit, wepresent a weighted variant of Angluinâ€™s (1987)L* algorithm for learning FSAs. We stay faithful to the original formulation, devising a wayto exactly learn deterministic weighted FSAswhose weights support division. Furthermore,we formulate the learning process in a mannerthat highlights the connection with FSA minimization, showing how L* directly learns aminimal automaton for the target language.
