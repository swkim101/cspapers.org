As large language models (LLMs) evolve, evaluating their output reliably becomes increasingly difficult due to the high cost of human evaluation. To address this, we introduce FLAMe, a family of Foundational Large Autorater Models. FLAMe is trained on a diverse set of over 100 quality assessment tasks, incorporating 5M+ human judgments curated from publicly released human evaluations. FLAMe outperforms models like GPT-4 and Claude-3 on various held-out tasks, and serves as a powerful starting point for fine-tuning, as shown in our reward model evaluation case study (FLAMe-RM). On Reward-Bench, FLAMe-RM-24B achieves 87.8% accuracy, surpassing GPT-4-0125 (85.9%) and GPT-4o (84.7%). Additionally, we introduce FLAMe-Opt-RM, an efficient tail-patch fine-tuning approach that offers competitive RewardBench performance using 25Ã—fewer training datapoints. Our FLAMe variants outperform popular proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge models on 8 of 12 autorater benchmarks, covering 53 quality assessment tasks, including RewardBench and LLM-AggreFact. Finally, our analysis shows that FLAMe is significantly less biased than other LLM-as-a-Judge models on the CoBBLEr autorater bias benchmark.
