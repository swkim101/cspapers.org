Retrieving accurate domain knowledge and providing helpful information are crucial in developing an effective end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system (E2ETOD). The field has witnessed numerous methods following the retrieve-then-generate paradigm and training their systems on one specific domain. However, existing approaches still suffer from the Distractive Attributes Problem (DAP): struggling to deal with false but similar knowledge (hard negative entities), which is even more intractable when countless pieces of knowledge from different domains are blended in a real-world scenario. To alleviate DAP, we propose the Relevance-aware Adaptive Learning (ReAL) method, a two-stage training framework that eliminates hard negatives step-by-step and aligns retrieval with generation. In the first stage, we introduce a top-k adaptive contrastive loss and utilize the divergence-driven feedback from the frozen generator to pre-train the retriever. In the second stage, we propose using the metric score distribution as an anchor to align retrieval with generation. Thorough experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate ReALâ€™s superiority over existing methods, with extensive analysis validating its strong capabilities of overcoming in- and cross-domain distractions.
