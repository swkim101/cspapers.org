Word Usage Graphs (WUGs) represent human semantic proximity judgments for pairs of word uses in a weighted graph, which can be clustered to infer word sense clusters from simple pairwise word use judgments, avoiding the need for word sense definitions. SemEval-2020 Task 1 provided the first and to date largest manually annotated, diachronic WUG dataset. In this paper, we check the robustness and correctness of the annotations by continuing the SemEval annotation algorithm for two more rounds and comparing against an established annotation paradigm. Further, we test the reproducibility by resampling a new, smaller set of word uses from the SemEval source corpora and annotating them. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the problems and opportunities of the WUG annotation paradigm and points to future improvements.
