We introduce 'FactCheck Editor', an advanced text editor designed to automate fact-checking and correct factual inaccuracies. Given the widespread issue of misinformation, often a result of unintentional mistakes by content creators, our tool aims to address this challenge. It supports over 90 languages and utilizes transformer models to assist humans in the labor-intensive process of fact verification. This demonstration showcases a complete workflow that detects text claims in need of verification, generates relevant search engine queries, and retrieves appropriate documents from the web. It employs Natural Language Inference (NLI) to predict the veracity of claims and uses LLMs to summarize the evidence and suggest textual revisions to correct any errors in the text. Additionally, the effectiveness of models used in claim detection and veracity assessment is evaluated across multiple languages.
