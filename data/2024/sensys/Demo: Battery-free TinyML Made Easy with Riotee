This demo uses a machine-learning-based hot word detection application to showcase the capabilities of Riotee, an open-source and commercially available hardware-software platform for the battery-free Internet of Things. We describe the Riotee hardware consisting of a base module, a debug probe for easy firmware updates, and several expansion boards that enhance functionality without the need for custom-designed printed circuit boards (PCBs). The demo features the classification of live audio recordings using TinyML deep neural network inference aboard a Riotee device. The Riotee device transmits the classification results via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a smartphone given to visitors. Visitors can also observe how the Riotee software checkpoints and restores critical state in case of power failures via the visualization of logic analyzer traces.
