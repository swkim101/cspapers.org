In the era of large language models (LLMs), hallucination (i.e., the tendency to generate factually incorrect content) poses great challenge to trustworthy and reliable deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. To tackle the LLM hallucination, three key questions should be well studied: how to detect hallucinations (detection), why do LLMs hallucinate (source), and what can be done to mitigate them (mitigation). To address these challenges, this work presents a systematic empirical study on LLM hallucination, focused on the the three aspects of hallucination detection, source and mitigation. Specially, we construct a new hallucination benchmark HaluEval 2.0, and designs a simple yet effective detection method for LLM hallucination. Furthermore, we zoom into the different training or utilization stages of LLMs and extensively analyze the potential factors that lead to the LLM hallucination. Finally, we implement and examine a series of widely used techniques to mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our work has led to several important findings to understand the hallucination origin and mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/HaluEval-2.0.
