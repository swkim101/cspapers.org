Hierarchical Text Classification poses the dif-001 ficult challenge of classifying documents into 002 multiple labels organized in a hierarchy. The 003 vast majority of works aimed to address this 004 problem relies on supervised methods which 005 are difficult to implement due to the scarcity of 006 labeled data in many real world applications. 007 This paper focuses on strict Zero-Shot Classi-008 fication, the setting in which the system lacks 009 both labeled instances and training data. We 010 propose a novel approach that uses a Large 011 Language Model to augment the deepest layer 012 of the labels hierarchy in order to enhance its 013 specificity. We achieve this by generating se-014 mantically relevant labels as children connected 015 to the existing branches, creating a deeper tax-016 onomy that better overlaps with the input texts. 017 We leverage the enriched hierarchy to perform 018 Zero-Shot Hierarchical Classification by using 019 the Upward score Propagation technique. We 020 test our method on four public datasets, obtain-021 ing new state-of-the art results on three of them. 022 We introduce two cosine similarity-based met-023 rics to quantify the density and granularity of 024 a label taxonomy and we show a strong corre-025 lation between the metric values and the clas-026 sification performance of our method on the 027 datasets. 028
