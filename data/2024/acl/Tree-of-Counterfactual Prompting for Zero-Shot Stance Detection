Stance detection enables the inference of atti-001 tudes from human communications. Automatic 002 stance identification was mostly cast as a classi-003 fication problem. However, stance decisions in-004 volve complex judgments, which can be nowa-005 days generated by prompting Large Language 006 Models (LLMs). In this paper we present a 007 new method for stance identification which (1) 008 relies on a new prompting framework, called 009 Tree-of-Counterfactual prompting; (2) operates 010 not only on textual communications, but also on 011 images; (3) allows more than one stance object 012 type; and (4) requires no examples of stance 013 attribution, thus it is a "Tabula Rasa" Zero-Shot 014 Stance Detection (TR-ZSSD) method. Our ex-015 periments indicate surprisingly promising re-016 sults, outperforming fine-tuned stance detection 017 systems. 018
