The current charge prediction datasets mostly focus on single-defendant criminal cases. However, real-world criminal cases usually involve multiple defendants whose criminal facts are intertwined. In an early attempt to fill this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that encompasses legal cases involving multiple de-fendants, where each defendant is labeled with a charge and four types of crime elements, i.e., Object Element , Objective Element , Subject Element , and Subjective Element . Based on the dataset, we further develop an inter-pretable model called EJudge that incorporates crime elements and legal rules to infer charges. We observe that predicting crime charges while providing corresponding ratio-nales benefits the interpretable AI system. Extensive experiments show that EJudge significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, which verify the importance of crime elements and legal rules in multi-defendant charge prediction.
