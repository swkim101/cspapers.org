Generics are expressions used to communicate 001 abstractions about categories. While conveying 002 general truths (e.g., Birds fly ), generics have the 003 interesting property to admit exceptions (e.g., 004 penguins do not fly). Statements of this type 005 help us organizing our knowledge of the world, 006 and form the basis of how we express it (Hamp-007 ton, 2012; Leslie, 2014). 008 This study investigates how Large Language 009 Models (LLMs) interpret generics, drawing 010 upon psycholinguistic experimental method-011 ologies. Understanding how LLMs interpret 012 generic statements serves not only as a mea-013 sure of their ability to abstract but also arguably 014 plays a role in their encoding of stereotypes. 015 Given that generics interpretation necessitates 016 a comparison with explicitly quantified sen-017 tences, we explored i.) whether LLMs can 018 correctly associate a quantifier with the generic 019 structure, and ii.) whether the presence of a 020 generic sentence as context influences the out-021 comes of quantifiers. We evaluated LLMs us-022 ing both Surprisal distributions and prompting 023 techniques. The findings indicate that mod-024 els do not exhibit a strong sensitivity to quan-025 tification. Nevertheless, they seem to encode 026 a meaning linked with the generic structure, 027 which leads them to adjust their answers ac-028 cordingly when a generalization is provided as 029 context. 030
