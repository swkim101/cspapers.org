Assessing the quality of summarizers poses significant challenges. In response, we propose a novel task-oriented evaluation approach that assesses summarizers based on their capacity to produce summaries that are useful for downstream tasks, while preserving task outcomes. We theoretically establish a direct relationship between the resulting error probability of these tasks and the mutual information between source texts and generated summaries. We introduce $\texttt{COSMIC}$ as a practical implementation of this metric, demonstrating its strong correlation with human judgment-based metrics and its effectiveness in predicting downstream task performance. Comparative analyses against established metrics like $\texttt{BERTScore}$ and $\texttt{ROUGE}$ highlight the competitive performance of $\texttt{COSMIC}$.
