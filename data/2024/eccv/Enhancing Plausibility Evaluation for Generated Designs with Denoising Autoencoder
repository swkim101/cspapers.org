A great interest has arisen in using Deep Generative Models (DGM) for generative design. When assessing the quality of the generated designs, human designers focus more on structural plausibility, e.g., no missing component, rather than visual artifacts, e.g., noises or blurriness. Meanwhile, commonly used metrics such as Fre\'chet Inception Distance (FID) may not evaluate accurately because they are sensitive to visual artifacts and tolerant to semantic errors. As such, FID might not be suitable to assess the performance of DGMs for a generative design task. In this work, we propose to encode the to-be-evaluated images with a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) and measure the distribution distance in the resulting latent space. Hereby, we design a novel metric Fre\'chet Denoised Distance (FDD). We experimentally test our FDD, FID and other state-of-the-art metrics on multiple datasets, e.g., BIKED, Seeing3DChairs, FFHQ and ImageNet. Our FDD can effectively detect implausible structures and is more consistent with structural inspections by human experts.
