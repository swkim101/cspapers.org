Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse video generations. Given a set of video clips of the same motion concept, the task of Motion Customization is to adapt existing text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos with this motion. For example, generating a video with a car moving in a prescribed manner under specific camera movements to make a movie, or a video illustrating how a bear would lift weights to inspire creators. Adaptation methods have been developed for customizing appearance like subject or style, yet unexplored for motion. It is straightforward to extend mainstream adaption methods for motion customization, including full model tuning, parameter-efficient tuning of additional layers, and Low-Rank Adaptions (LoRAs). However, the motion concept learned by these methods is often coupled with the limited appearances in the training videos, making it difficult to generalize the customized motion to other appearances. To overcome this challenge, we propose MotionDirector, with a dual-path LoRAs architecture to decouple the learning of appearance and motion. Further, we design a novel appearance-debiased temporal loss to mitigate the influence of appearance on the temporal training objective. Experimental results show the proposed method can generate videos of diverse appearances for the customized motions. Our method also supports various downstream applications, such as the mixing of different videos with their appearance and motion respectively, and animating a single image with customized motions. Our code and model weights will be released.
