Contemporary Video Object Segmentation (VOS) approaches typically consist stages of feature extraction, matching, memory management, and multiple objects aggregation. Recent advanced models either employ a discrete modeling for these components in a sequential manner, or optimize a combined pipeline through substructure aggregation. However, these existing explicit staged approaches prevent the VOS framework from being optimized as a unified whole, leading to the limited capacity and suboptimal performance in tackling complex videos. In this paper, we propose OneVOS, a novel framework that unifies the core components of VOS with All-in-One Transformer. Specifically, to unify all aforementioned modules into a vision transformer, we model all the features of frames, masks and memory for multiple objects as transformer tokens, and integrally accomplish feature extraction, matching and memory management of multiple objects through the flexible attention mechanism. Furthermore, a Unidirectional Hybrid Attention is proposed through a double decoupling of the original attention operation, to rectify semantic errors and ambiguities of stored tokens in OneVOS framework. Finally, to alleviate the storage burden and expedite inference, we propose the Dynamic Token Selector, which unveils the working mechanism of OneVOS and naturally leads to a more efficient version of OneVOS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of OneVOS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 7 datasets, particularly excelling in complex LVOS and MOSE datasets with 70.1% and 66.4% $J \&F$ scores, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by 4.2% and 7.0%, respectively. And our code will be available for reproducibility and further research.
