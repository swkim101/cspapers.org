In real-world recommender systems, user engagement and subjective feedback play pivotal roles in shaping the content distribution mechanism of the platform. When platforms reach a certain scale, they often gather valuable questionnaire feedback data from users to evaluate their satisfactionwith recommendeditems. Compared to traditional user feedback such as likes, questionnaires explicitly capture both satisfaction and dissatisfaction and are unaffected by other users’ questionnaires, thus better expressing users’ true preferences. In this paper, we aim to leverage the questionnaire feedback to align the recommendation model with users’ true preferences. However, due to the platform distribution mechanism and divergent user attitudes toward questionnaires, the questionnaire feedback data frequently becomes sparse and exhibits selection biases, resulting in challenges in feature integration and training process. To address these issues, we introduce a novel user S atisfaction A lignment framework that effectively leverages Q uestionnaire feedback to enhance Rec ommendation, named SAQRec . SAQRec begins by training an unbiased satisfaction model to impute satisfaction, addressing selection bias and data sparsity. Then, SAQRec aligns features with users’ true preferences by disentangling satisfaction and dissatisfaction from click history and categorizing clicked items into multiple satisfaction levels through the imputed satisfactions. Additionally, the imputed satisfactions from the pre-trained unbiased satisfaction model serve as pseudo-labels to align the model’s outputs with users’ true preferences. Extensive experiments on both
