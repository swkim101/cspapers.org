Conversational assistants are becoming prevalent among the wider population due to their simplicity and increasing utility. However, the shortcomings of these tools are as renowned as their benefits. In this work, we present a “first look” at an extensive collection of conversational queries, aiming to identify limitations and improvement opportunities specifically related to information access (i.e., search interactions). We explore over 600 , 000 Google Assistant interactions from 173 unique users, examining usage trends and the resulting deficiencies and strengths of these assistants. We aim to provide a balanced assessment, highlighting the assistant’s shortcomings in supporting users and delivering relevant information to user needs and areas where it demonstrates a reasonable response to user inputs. Our analysis shows that, although most users conduct information-seeking tasks, there is little evidence of complex information-seeking behaviour, with most interactions consisting of simple, imperative instructions. Finally, we find that conversational devices allow users to benefit from increased naturalistic interactions and the ability to apply acquired information in situ, a novel observation for conversational information seeking.
