Image inpainting, the task of reconstructing missing segments in corrupted images using available data, faces challenges in ensuring consistency and fidelity, especially under information-scarce conditions. Traditional evaluation methods, heavily dependent on the existence of unmasked reference images, inherently favor certain inpainting outcomes, introducing biases. Addressing this issue, we introduce an innovative evaluation paradigm that utilizes a self-supervised metric based on multiple re-inpainting passes. This approach, diverging from conventional reliance on direct comparisons in pixel or feature space with original images, emphasizes the principle of self-consistency to enable the exploration of various viable inpainting solutions, effectively reducing biases. Our extensive experiments across numerous benchmarks validate the alignment of our evaluation method with human judgment.
