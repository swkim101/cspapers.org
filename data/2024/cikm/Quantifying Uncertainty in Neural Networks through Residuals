Regression models are of fundamental importance in explicitly explaining the response variable in terms of covariates. However, point predictions of these models limit them from many real world applications. Heteroscedasticity is common in most real-world scenarios and is hard to model due to its randomness. The Gaussian process generally captures epistemic (model) uncertainty but fails to capture heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty. The framework of HetGP inherently captures both epistemic and aleatoric by placing independent GPâ€™s priors on both mean function and error term. We propose the posthoc HetGP on the residuals of the trained deterministic neural network to obtain both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. The advantage of posthoc HetGP on residuals is that it can be extended to any type of model, since the model is assumed to be black-box that gives point predictions. We demonstrate our approach through simulation studies and UCI regression datasets. The code is available at https://visdomlab.github.io/HetGP/.
