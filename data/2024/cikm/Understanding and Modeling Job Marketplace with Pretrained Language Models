Job marketplace is a heterogeneous graph composed of interactions among members (job-seekers), companies, and jobs. Understanding and modeling job marketplace can benefit both job seekers and employers, ultimately contributing to the greater good of the society. However, existing graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have shallow understandings of the associated textual features and heterogeneous relations. To address the above challenges, we propose PLM4Job, a job marketplace foundation model that tightly couples pretrained language models (PLM) with job market graph, aiming to fully utilize the pretrained knowledge and reasoning ability to model member/job textual features as well as various member-job relations simultaneously. In the pretraining phase, we propose a heterogeneous ego-graph-based prompting strategy to model and aggregate member/job textual features based on the topological structure around the target member/job node, where entity type embeddings and graph positional embeddings are introduced accordingly to model different entities and their heterogeneous relations. Meanwhile, a proximity-aware attention alignment strategy is designed to dynamically adjust the attention of the PLM on ego-graph node tokens in the prompt, such that the attention can be better aligned with job marketplace semantics. Extensive experiments at LinkedIn demonstrate the effectiveness of PLM4Job.
