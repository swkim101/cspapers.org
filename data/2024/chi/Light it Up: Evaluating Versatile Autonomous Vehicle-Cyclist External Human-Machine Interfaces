The social cues drivers exchange with cyclists to negotiate space-sharing will disappear as autonomous vehicles (AVs) join our roads, leading to safety concerns. External Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) on vehicles can replace driver social signals, but how these should be designed to communicate with cyclists is unknown. We evaluated three eHMIs across multiple traffic scenarios in two stages. First, we compared eHMI versatility, acceptability and usability in a VR cycling simulator. Cyclists preferred colour-coded signals communicating AV intent, easily seen through quick glances. Second, we refined the interfaces based on our findings and compared them outdoors. Participants cycled around a moving car with real eHMIs. They preferred eHMIs using large surfaces on the vehicle and animations reinforcing colour changes. We conclude with novel design guidelines for versatile eHMIs based on first-hand interaction feedback. Our findings establish the factors that enable AVs to operate safely around cyclists across different traffic scenarios.
