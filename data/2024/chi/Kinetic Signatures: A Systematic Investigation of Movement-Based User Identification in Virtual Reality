Behavioral Biometrics in Virtual Reality (VR) enable implicit user identification by leveraging the motion data of usersâ€™ heads and hands from their interactions in VR. This spatiotemporal data forms a Kinetic Signature, which is a user-dependent behavioral biometric trait. Although kinetic signatures have been widely used in recent research, the factors contributing to their degree of identifiability remain mostly unexplored. Drawing from existing literature, this work systematically examines the influence of static and dynamic components in human motion. We conducted a user study (N = 24) with two sessions to reidentify users across different VR sports and exercises after one week. We found that the identifiability of a kinetic signature depends on its inherent static and dynamic factors, with the best combination allowing for 90.91% identification accuracy after one week had passed. Therefore, this work lays a foundation for designing and refining movement-based identification protocols in immersive environments.
