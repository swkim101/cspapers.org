Advances in ubiquitous computing have enabled end-user authoring of context-aware policies (CAPs) that control smart devices based on specific contexts of the user and environment. However, authoring CAPs accurately and avoiding run-time errors is challenging for end-users as it is difficult to foresee CAP behaviors under complex real-world conditions. We propose Fast-Forward Reality, an Extended Reality (XR) based authoring workflow that enables end-users to iteratively author and refine CAPs by validating their behaviors via simulated unit test cases. We develop a computational approach to automatically generate test cases based on the authored CAP and the userâ€™s context history. Our system delivers each test case with immersive visualizations in XR, facilitating users to verify the CAP behavior and identify necessary refinements. We evaluated Fast-Forward Reality in a user study (N=12). Our authoring and validation process improved the accuracy of CAPs and the users provided positive feedback on the system usability.
