In a rapidly evolving UX/UI design landscape marked by technological advancements and shifts toward hybrid work, understanding the implications of these changes on software prototyping practices is crucial. This study investigates the influence of evolving work practices, tool advancements, and designers’ attitudes on prototyping practices and design processes in the contemporary software industry. Based on in-depth interviews with 10 practitioners and educators, we explore the factors contributing to the preference for digital-first prototypes and the diminishing appeal of low-fidelity prototyping methods. Our findings reveal how digital prototypes outshine physical counterparts in hybrid work, the role of all-in-one digital tools in centralizing designers’ workflows and encouraging high-fidelity prototyping, corporate preferences for visually appealing prototypes, and the impact of designers’ educational backgrounds, generational differences, and professional maturity. This research offers valuable insights to inform decision-making and strategies for design practitioners, educators, and organizations in adapting to current and future prototyping practices.
