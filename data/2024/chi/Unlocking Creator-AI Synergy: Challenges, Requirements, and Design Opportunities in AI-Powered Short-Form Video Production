The emergence of AI-Powered Short-Form Video Generators (ASVG) has showcased the potential to streamline production time and foster creative ideas. Despite their widespread adoption, research has underexplored ASVG, especially from creators’ perspectives. To evaluate the role of ASVG as creator-centered collaborators, we conducted mixed-method research: (1) interviews (N = 17) and (2) a participatory design workshop (N = 12) with short-form video creators. In our interviews, we investigated creators’ production process and challenges in creating short-form videos. In participatory workshops, short-form video creators envisioned AI-powered video tools, addressing their requirements and AI collaboration perceptions. Our findings indicate ASVGs can provide various advantages including inspiration, swift access to video sources, and automated highlight generation. To put things in perspective, we also underscore concerns arising from AI collaboration, including potential creator identity dilution, reduced creative output, and information bubble. We also discuss design considerations when designing ASVG to retain their creative values.
