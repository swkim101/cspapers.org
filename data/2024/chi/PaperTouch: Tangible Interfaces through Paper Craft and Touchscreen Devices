Paper and touchscreen devices are two common objects found around us, and we investigated the potential of their intersection for tangible interface design. In this research, we developed PaperTouch, an approach to design paper based mechanisms that translate a variety of physical interactions to touch events on a capacitive touchscreen. These mechanisms act as switches that close during interaction, connecting the touchscreen to the deviceâ€™s ground bus. To develop PaperTouch, we explored different types of paper along with the making process around them. We also built a range of applications to showcase different tangible interfaces facilitated with PaperTouch, including music instruments, educational dioramas, and playful products. By reflecting on this exploration, we uncovered the emerging design dimensions that considers the interactions, materiality, and embodiment of PaperTouch interfaces. We also surfaced the tacit know-how that we gained through our design process through annotations for others to refer to.
