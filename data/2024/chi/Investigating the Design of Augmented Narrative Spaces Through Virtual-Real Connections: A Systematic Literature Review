Augmented Reality (AR) is regarded as an innovative storytelling medium that presents novel experiences by layering a virtual narrative space over a real 3D space. However, understanding of how the virtual narrative space and the real space are connected with one another in the design of augmented narrative spaces has been limited. For this, we conducted a systematic literature review of 64 articles featuring AR storytelling applications and systems in HCI, AR, and MR research. We investigated how virtual narrative spaces have been paired, functionalized, placed, and registered in relation to the real spaces they target. Based on these connections, we identified eight dominant types of augmented narrative spaces that are primarily categorized by whether they virtually narrativize reality or realize the virtual narrative. We discuss our findings to propose design recommendations on how virtual-real connections can be incorporated into a more structured approach to AR storytelling.
