This paper introduces CeraMetal, a low-cost and robust approach to desktop metal 3D printing based on a custom "metal clay". We present three recipes for 3D printable bronze clay along with a workflow that includes print parameters and a sintering schedule. We introduce custom slicing software that generates continuous extrusion toolpaths for metal clay printing. We analyze the shrinkage, density, tensile strength and flexibility of prints produced with Cerametal and find the materialâ€™s performance comparable to parts produced via other bronze 3D printing methods. Finally, we provide several examples of 3D printed metal objects and a discussion of limitations and future research opportunities.
