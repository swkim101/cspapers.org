Educational technologies have been argued to enhance specific aspects of affect, such as motivation, and through that learner experiences and outcomes. Until recently, affect has been considered separately from cognition. In this study, we investigated how learner affect (valence and activation) was tied to learner cognitive load and behaviours during game-based literacy activities. We employed experience sampling as part of a lab-based case study where 35 English language learners used an adaptive educational game. The results indicated that both positive and negative affect predicted learner cognitive load, with negative affect predicting extraneous (unnecessary) load. These results and the newly identified interaction patterns that accompanied learner affect and cognitive-load trajectories provide insight into the role of affect during learning. They show a need for considering affect when studying cognitive load and have implications for how systems should adapt to learners.
