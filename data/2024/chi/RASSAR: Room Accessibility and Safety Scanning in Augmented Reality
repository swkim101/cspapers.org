The safety and accessibility of our homes is critical to quality of life and evolves as we age, become ill, host guests, or experience life events such as having children. Researchers and health professionals have created assessment instruments such as checklists that enable homeowners and trained experts to identify and mitigate safety and access issues. With advances in computer vision, augmented reality (AR), and mobile sensors, new approaches are now possible. We introduce RASSAR, a mobile AR application for semi-automatically identifying, localizing, and visualizing indoor accessibility and safety issues such as an inaccessible table height or unsafe loose rugs using LiDAR and real-time computer vision. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with 18 participants across five stakeholder groups to inform the design of RASSAR, a technical performance evaluation across ten homes demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, and a user study with six stakeholders. We close with a discussion of future AI-based indoor accessibility assessment tools, RASSARâ€™s extensibility, and key application scenarios.
