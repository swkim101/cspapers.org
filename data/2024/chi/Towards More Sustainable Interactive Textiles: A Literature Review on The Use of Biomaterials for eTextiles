The development of functional fibres, active materials, and flexible electrical components has introduced new ways of embedding interactive capabilities within textiles. However, this seamless integration poses challenges in terms of materials, disassembly, and disposal, revealing an urgent need to address the issue of sustainability when creating new electronic textiles. Authors have proposed eco-design guidelines that emphasise the use of renewable and biodegradable materials. Despite these recommendations, the potential of biomaterials in eTextiles remains largely unexplored. This integrative literature review showcases how biomaterials emerged as catalysts for expanding possibilities within eTextiles and HCI, not only through their environmental sustainability but also through their dynamic and transformative nature, fostering a realm of novel interactive experiences. We suggest the potential of developing fully bio-based eTextile systems, the need for broader sustainability and aesthetic studies, the relevance of DIY methods, and the urgency of textile knowledge integration.
