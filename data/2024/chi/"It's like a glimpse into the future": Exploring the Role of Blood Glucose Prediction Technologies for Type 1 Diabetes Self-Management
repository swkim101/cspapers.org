Self-management of type 1 diabetes (T1D) involves multiple factors, frequent anticipation of changes in blood glucose, and complex decision-making. ML-based blood glucose predictions (BGP) may be valuable in supporting T1D management. However, it may be difficult for people with T1D to integrate BGP into their decision-making due to prediction uncertainty and interpretation. In this study, we investigate the lived experience of people with T1D focusing on their needs and expectations in using apps that provide BGP. We designed MOON-T1D, an app that shows simulated BGP and conducted a five-day study using the Experience Sampling Method coupled with semi-structured interviews with 15 individuals with T1D who used MOON-T1D. A reflexive thematic analysis of our data revealed implications for the design and use of BGP, including the complex role of emotions and trust surrounding predictions, and ways in which BGP may ease or complicate T1D management.
