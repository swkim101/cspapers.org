Motivating children to learn is a major challenge in education. One way to inspire motivation to learn is through immersion. We combine the immersive potential of augmented reality (AR), narrative, and large language models (LLMs) to bridge fantasy with reality in a mobile application, Moon Story, that teaches elementary schoolers astronomy and environmental science. Our system also builds upon learning theories such as culturally-relevant pedagogy. Using our application, a child embarks on a journey inspired by Chinese mythology, engages in real-world AR activities, and converses with a fictional character powered by an LLM. We conducted a controlled experiment (N = 50) with two conditions: one using an LLM and one that was hard-coded. Both conditions resulted in learning gains, high engagement levels, and increased science learning motivation. Participants in the LLM condition also wrote more relevant answers. Finally, participants of both Chinese and non-Chinese heritage found the culturally-based narrative compelling.
