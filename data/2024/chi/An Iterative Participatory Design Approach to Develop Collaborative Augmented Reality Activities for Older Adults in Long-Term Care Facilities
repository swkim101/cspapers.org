Over four million older adults living in long-term care (LTC) communities experience loneliness, adversely impacting their health. Increased contact with friends and family is an evidence-based intervention to reduce loneliness, but in-person visits are not always possible. Augmented Reality (AR)-based telepresence activities can offer viable alternatives with increased immersion and presence compared to video calls. However, its feasibility as an interaction technology for older adults is not known. In this paper, we detail the design of two dyadic collaborative AR activities that accommodate diminished physical and cognitive abilities of older adults. The findings include a general design framework based on an iterative participatory design focusing on preferred activities, modes of interaction, and overall AR experience of eight older adults, two family members, and five LTC staff. Results demonstrate the potential of collaborative AR as an effective means of interaction for older adults with their family, if designed to cater to their needs.
