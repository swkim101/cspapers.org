When users wear a virtual reality (VR) headset, they lose access to their smartphone and accompanying apps. Past work has proposed smartphones as enhanced VR controllers, but little work has explored using existing smartphone apps and performing traditional smartphone interactions while in VR. In this paper, we consider three potential spatial anchorings for rendering smartphones in VR: On top of a tracked physical smartphone which the user holds (Phone-locked), on top of the userâ€™s empty hand, as if holding a virtual smartphone (Hand-locked), or in a static position in front of the user (World-locked). We conducted a comparative study of target acquisition, swiping, and scrolling tasks across these anchorings using direct Touch or above-the-surface Pinch. Our findings indicate that physically holding a smartphone with Touch improves accuracy and speed for all tasks, and Pinch performed better with virtual smartphones. These findings provide a valuable foundation to enable smartphones in VR.
