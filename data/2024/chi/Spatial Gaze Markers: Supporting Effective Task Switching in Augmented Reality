Task switching can occur frequently in daily routines with physical activity. In this paper, we introduce Spatial Gaze Markers, an augmented reality tool to support users in immediately returning to the last point of interest after an attention shift. The tool is task-agnostic, using only eye-tracking information to infer distinct points of visual attention and to mark the corresponding area in the physical environment. We present a user study that evaluates the effectiveness of Spatial Gaze Markers in simulated physical repair and inspection tasks against a no-marker baseline. The results give insights into how Spatial Gaze Markers affect user performance, task load, and experience of users with varying levels of task type and distractions. Our work is relevant to assist physical workers with simple AR techniques and render task switching faster with less effort.
