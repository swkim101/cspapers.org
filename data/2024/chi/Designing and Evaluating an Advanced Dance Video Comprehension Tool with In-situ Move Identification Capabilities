Analyzing dance moves and routines is a foundational step in learning dance. Videos are often utilized at this step, and advancements in machine learning, particularly in human-movement recognition, could further assist dance learners. We developed and evaluated a Wizard-of-Oz prototype of a video comprehension tool that offers automatic in-situ dance move identification functionality. Our system design was informed by an interview study involving 12 dancers to understand the challenges they face when trying to comprehend complex dance videos and taking notes. Subsequently, we conducted a within-subject study with 8 Cuban salsa dancers to identify the benefits of our system compared to an existing traditional feature-based search system. We found that the quality of notes taken by participants improved when using our tool, and they reported a lower workload. Based on participantsâ€™ interactions with our system, we offer recommendations on how an AI-powered span-search feature can enhance dance video comprehension tools.
