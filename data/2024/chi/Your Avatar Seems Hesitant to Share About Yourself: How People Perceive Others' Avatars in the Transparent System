In avatar-mediated communications, users often cannot identify how others’ avatars are created, which is one of the important information they need to evaluate others. Thus, we tested a social virtual world that is transparent about others’ avatar-creation methods and investigated how knowing about others’ avatar-creation methods shapes users’ perceptions of others and their self-disclosure. We conducted a 2x2 mixed-design experiment with system design (nontransparent vs. transparent system) as a between-subjects and avatar-creation method (customized vs. personalized avatar) as a within-subjects variable with 60 participants. The results revealed that personalized avatars in the transparent system were viewed less positively than customized avatars in the transparent system or avatars in the nontransparent system. These avatars appeared less comfortable and honest in their self-disclosure and less competent. Interestingly, avatars in the nontransparent system attracted more followers. Our results suggest being cautious when creating a social virtual world that discloses the avatar-creation process.
