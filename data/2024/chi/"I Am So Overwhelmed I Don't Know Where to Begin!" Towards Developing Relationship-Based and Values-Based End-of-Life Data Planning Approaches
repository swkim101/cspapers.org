To support people at the end of life as they create management plans for their assets, planning approaches like estate planning are increasingly considering data. HCI scholarship has argued that developing more effective planning approaches to support end-of-life data planning is important. However, empirical research is needed to evaluate specific approaches and identify design considerations. To support end-of-life data planning, this paper presents a qualitative study evaluating two approaches to co-designing end-of-life data plans with participants. We find that asset-first inventory-centric approaches, common in material estate planning, may be ineffective when making plans for data. In contrast, heavily facilitated, mission-driven, relationship-centric approaches were more effective. This study expands previous research by validating the importance of starting end-of-life data planning with relationships and values, and highlights collaborative facilitation as a critical part of successful data planning approaches.
