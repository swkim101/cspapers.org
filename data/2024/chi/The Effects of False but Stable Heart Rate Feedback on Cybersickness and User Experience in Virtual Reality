Virtual reality (VR) offers a compelling and immersive experience; however, cybersickness (or VR sickness) stands as a significant obstacle to its widespread adoption. When a user experiences cybersickness, one’s physical condition deteriorates with various symptoms, often accompanied by an increased and destabilized heart rate and even altered perception of one’s state. In this paper, we propose to provide “False but Stable Heart rate (FSH)” feedback through auditory and vibrotactile stimulation to reversely induce a stably perceived heart rate and, thereby, alleviate cybersickness while navigating a sickness-inducing VR content. The validation of the human experiment confirmed the intended effect in a statistically significant way. Furthermore, it was found that the lesser compatible FSH feedback had a more substantial sickness reduction effect but distracted the user with the reduced immersive experience. The compatible FSH feedback still showed moderate sickness reduction with the maintained sense of presence and immersion.
