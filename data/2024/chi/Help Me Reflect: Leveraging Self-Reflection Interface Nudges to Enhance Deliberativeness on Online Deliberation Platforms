The deliberative potential of online platforms has been widely examined. However, little is known about how various interface-based reflection nudges impact the quality of deliberation. This paper presents two user studies with 12 and 120 participants, respectively, to investigate the impacts of different reflective nudges on the quality of deliberation. In the first study, we examined five distinct reflective nudges: persona, temporal prompts, analogies and metaphors, cultural prompts and storytelling. Persona, temporal prompts, and storytelling emerged as the preferred nudges for implementation on online deliberation platforms. In the second study, we assess the impacts of these preferred reflectors more thoroughly. Results revealed a significant positive impact of these reflectors on deliberative quality. Specifically, persona promotes a deliberative environment for balanced and opinionated viewpoints while temporal prompts promote more individualised viewpoints. Our findings suggest that the choice of reflectors can significantly influence the dynamics and shape the nature of online discussions.
