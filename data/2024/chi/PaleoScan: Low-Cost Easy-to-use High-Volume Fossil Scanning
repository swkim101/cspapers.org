Fossils are crucial for understanding our natural history and the digitalization of fossils has paved the way for paleontologists to share and study them in greater detail. Yet, many fossil-dense regions, in particular low- and middle-income countries, lack the resources to digitalize their vast collections. This project reports on a collaboration between paleontologists and computer scientists to design, build, and operate a device that can be deployed in the field for digitizing a collection of thousands of fossils. We introduce PaleoScan, a user-friendly, cost-effective, high-volume scanner designed to expedite the digitization of extensive fossil collections. PaleoScan is a self-contained 3D scanning system consisting of a light and compact mirrorless camera, a microcontroller, a ChArUco calibration board, and user-controlled LEDs. Software and data processing is cloud-based, where the user interacts with the system through a web application. We deployed PaleoScan in a museum in Brazil with a world-class fossil collection. Our early results reveal its potential to revolutionize the scanning process for fossils.
