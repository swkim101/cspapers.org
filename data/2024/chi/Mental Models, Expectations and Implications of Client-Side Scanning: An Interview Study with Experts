Client-Side Scanning (CSS) is discussed as a potential solution to contain the dissemination of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). A significant challenge associated with this debate is that stakeholders have different interpretations of the capabilities and frontiers of the concept and its varying implementations. In this paper, we explore stakeholdersâ€™ understandings of the technology and the expectations and potential implications in the context of CSAM by conducting and analyzing 28 semi-structured interviews with a diverse sample of experts. We identified mental models of CSS and the expected challenges. Our results show that CSS is often a preferred solution in the child sexual abuse debate due to the lack of an alternative. Our findings illustrate the importance of further interdisciplinary discussions to define and comprehend the impact of CSS usage on society, particularly vulnerable groups such as children.
