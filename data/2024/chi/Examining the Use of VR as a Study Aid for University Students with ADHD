Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by patterns of inattention and impulsivity, which lead to difficulties maintaining concentration and motivation while completing academic tasks. University settings, characterized by a high student-to-staff ratio, make treatments relying on human monitoring challenging. One potential replacement is Virtual Reality (VR) technology, which has shown potential to enhance learning outcomes and promote flow experience. In this study, we investigate the usage of VR with 27 university students with ADHD in an effort to improve their performance in completing homework, including an exploration of automated feedback via a technology probe. Quantitative results show significant increases in concentration, motivation, and effort levels during these VR sessions and qualitative data offers insight into considerations like comfort and deployment. Together, the results suggest that VR can be a valuable tool in leveling the playing field for university students with ADHD.
