Real-world data generally follows a long-tailed distribution, which makes traditional high-performance training strategies unable to show their usual effects. Various insights have been proposed to alleviate this challenging distribution. However, some observations indicate that models trained on long-tailed distributions always show a trade-off between the performance of head and tail classes. For a profound understanding of the trade-off, we first theoretically analyze the trade-off problem in long-tailed learning and cre-atively transform the trade-off problem in long-tailed learning into a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Motivated by these analyses, we propose the idea of strategy fusion for MOO long-tailed learning and point out the potential conflict problem. We further design a Multi-Objective Optimization based Strategy Fusion (MOOSF), which effectively resolves conflicts, and achieves an efficient fusion of heterogeneous strategies. Comprehensive experiments on main-stream datasets show that even the simplest strategy fusion can outperform complex long-tailed strategies. More importantly, it provides a new perspective for generalized long-tailed learning. The code is available in the accompanying supplementary materials. Code is available at here.
