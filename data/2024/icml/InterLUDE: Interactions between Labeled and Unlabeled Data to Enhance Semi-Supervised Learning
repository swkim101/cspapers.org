Hand gesture recognition is pivotal in facilitating human–machine interaction within the Internet of Things. Nevertheless, it encounters challenges, including labeling expenses and robustness. To tackle these issues, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework guided by pseudo-label consistency. This framework utilizes a dual-branch structure with a mean-teacher network. Within this setup, a global and locally guided self-supervised learning encoder acts as a feature extractor in a teacher–student network to efficiently extract features, maximizing data utilization to enhance feature representation. Additionally, we introduce a pseudo-label Consistency-Guided Mean-Teacher model, where simulated noise is incorporated to generate newly unlabeled samples for the teacher model before advancing to the subsequent stage. By enforcing consistency constraints between the outputs of the teacher and student models, we alleviate accuracy degradation resulting from individual differences and interference from other body parts, thereby bolstering the network’s robustness. Ultimately, the teacher model undergoes refinement through exponential moving averages to achieve stable weights. We evaluate our semi-supervised method on two publicly available hand gesture datasets and compare it with several state-of-the-art fully-supervised algorithms. The results demonstrate the robustness of our method, achieving an accuracy rate exceeding 99% across both datasets.
