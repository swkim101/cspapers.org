Artificial Intelligence (AI) could encourage simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and even decision-making. Previous studies noted the importance of assessing the use of technology in education considering its potential implications in the student’s learning and development processes. Hence, this study explored the potential implications of AI particularly in science, mathematics, and technical-vocational education. Educators (n=20) were purposively sampled to be interviewed about their experiences in using AI in their classrooms. The findings suggested a positive perception of generative AI among educators, with many acknowledging its potential to enhance educational practices and outcomes especially in aiding the understanding science concepts, facilitating analytical skills development, and personalizing learning experiences. However, alongside their positive perceptions, educators expressed concerns about potential drawbacks associated with AI use in education. These concerns included the risk of overreliance, plagiarism, and inaccuracies in AI-generated content. To mitigate these negative impacts, educators emphasized the importance of implementing effective policies and guidelines for AI use in classrooms such as guiding students on ethical use, ensuring transparency in AI tool usage, and establishing clear instructions for ethical AI utilization. Transparency emerged as a key theme, with educators emphasizing the need for transparency regarding students' outputs and the extent of AI use. This study calls for further analysis about the level of acceptance of educators in AI use and assess its impacts on students’ short-term and long-term learning outcomes.
