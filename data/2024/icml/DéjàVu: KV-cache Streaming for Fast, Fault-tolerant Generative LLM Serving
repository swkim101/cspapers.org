Distributed LLM serving is costly and often underutilizes hardware accelerators due to three key challenges: bubbles in pipeline-parallel deployments caused by the bimodal latency of prompt and token processing, GPU memory overprovisioning, and long recovery times in case of failures. In this paper, we propose D\'ej\`aVu, a system to address all these challenges using a versatile and efficient KV cache streaming library (D\'ej\`aVuLib). Using D\'ej\`aVuLib, we propose and implement efficient prompt-token disaggregation to reduce pipeline bubbles, microbatch swapping for efficient GPU memory management, and state replication for fault-tolerance. We highlight the efficacy of these solutions on a range of large models across cloud deployments.
