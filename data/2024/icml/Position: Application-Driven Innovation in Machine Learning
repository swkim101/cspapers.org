Abstract Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been a focus of medical research for decades, in the last decade, the field of radiology has seen tremendous innovation and also public focus due to development and application of machine-learning techniques to develop new algorithms. Interestingly, this innovation is driven simultaneously by academia, existing global medical device vendors, and—fueled by venture capital—recently founded startups. Radiologists find themselves once again in the position to lead this innovation to improve clinical workflows and ultimately patient outcome. However, although the end of today's radiologists' profession has been proclaimed multiple times, routine clinical application of such AI algorithms in 2020 remains rare. The goal of this review article is to describe in detail the relevance of appropriate imaging data as a bottleneck for innovation, provide insights into the many obstacles for technical implementation, and give additional perspectives to radiologists who often view AI solely from their clinical role. As regulatory approval processes for such medical devices are currently under public discussion and the relevance of imaging data is transforming, radiologists need to establish themselves as the leading gatekeepers for evolution of their field and be aware of the many stakeholders and sometimes conflicting interests.
