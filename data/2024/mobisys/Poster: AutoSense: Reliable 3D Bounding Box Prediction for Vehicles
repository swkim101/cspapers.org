We propose AutoSense, a millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signal-based system for predicting 3D bounding boxes of vehicles. While cameras and LiDAR can be adversely affected by challenging weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, or snow, mmWave signals are less susceptible to these environmental factors, making them more resilient. As a result, AutoSense can complement other sensors for accurate 3D bounding box predictions in all weather conditions.
