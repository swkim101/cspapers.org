Ubiquitous sensing technologies, leveraging a network of interconnected sensors and devices, offer multifaceted benefits to society. However, the use of batteries has persistently posed a challenge to their advancement. In recent years, researchers have explored establishing communication between battery-free nodes. The primary objective of this work is to expedite the testing of algorithms for multiple battery-free interconnected nodes by isolating the algorithm from the underlying hardware. Isolating the hardware allows faster tuning of algorithms, and enables testing on a large scale. We developed a novel python-based simulation framework, HarvNet. Simulations using real-world power traces demonstrated a success rate of 81% in establishing connections between nodes which closely emulates the success rate achieved using hardware.
