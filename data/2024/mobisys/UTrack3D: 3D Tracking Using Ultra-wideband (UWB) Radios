Recording 3D movements of a user's hand, robotic arms, or an object, even in a small confined space, has several applications in AR/VR, robotics, movement science, and 3D modeling and rendering. Existing camera-based tracking systems, though extremely accurate, are quite expensive and suffer from issues of occlusion and face difficulties when operating in extremely dark or extremely bright environments. We contend that trading-off a bit of accuracy while reducing costs and enabling more flexible operating environment might be worth exploring. This paper presents UTrack3D, a table-top setup that tracks the movements of an object in 3D space using embedded low-cost ultra-wideband (UWB) radios. The core idea is to continuously track the changes in phase as captured from UWB signal's channel impulse response (CIR) derived from the UWB messages received at a set of dual-antenna UWB receivers. Each of our custom dual-antenna receivers captures the UWB signal from two corners of a cuboid allowing us to perform relative phase measurements. The main challenges in the solution are caused by a location-dependant large variation in the signal amplitudes and corruption of the CIR due to multipath. UTrack3D tackles these challenges via a signal processing pipeline fusing a forward localization process which tracks the object's location using UWB CIR phase, and a posterior location check process, which validates the estimated location. UTrack3D is implemented on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) UWB chips, and provides a 90th percentile accuracy of 9 mm in a table-top 3D region (1.5m × 0.8m × 0.8m). We evaluate the effects of additional UWB receivers, effect of different movement speeds, and effect of small-scale signal blocking using different materials. We expect UTrack3D to allow researchers a rich new environment for further advancing UWB-based 3D tracking.
