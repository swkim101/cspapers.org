Foldable phones are a recent trend in mobile devices, with manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola releasing newer models. While physical hardware issues are still affecting foldable devices, software vulnerabilities have yet to be addressed [4]. Our study focuses on three distinct foldable phone models and varied app behavior across different popular apps and versions. We found 15 apps with inconsistent behavior and state loss on different devices and highlight this as a potential issue with how apps are being adapted to multi-screen displays. Our work observes possible vulnerabilities regarding foldable phones in order to provide developers with guidance for best practices.
