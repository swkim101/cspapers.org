The accurate location of objects and people is central to providing contextual information for various AR/VR applications. We developed XRLoc [2], a compact localization module, sized less than 1 m, which can be integrated with television screens, soundbars or independently deployed in rooms to provide accurate locations of these assets. In this demo, we showcase the capability of XRLoc to localize and track UWB tags with cm-level accuracy in realistic room-level scenarios. We will additionally compare the location accuracy of XRLoc with visual-based HTC Vive trackers.
