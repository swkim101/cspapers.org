WiFi-based human sensing has exhibited remarkable potential to analyze user behaviors in a non-intrusive and device-free manner. However, most previous works focus on single-user sensing, which has limited practicability in scenarios involving multiple users. In this paper, we introduce YOSO a novel system employing a multi-label multi-view Transformer-based architecture to address these issues, enabling simultaneous localization and activity recognition. By applying advanced preprocessing techniques and utilizing the Transformer's self-attention mechanism, our system effectively learns high-dimensional representations of human activities and locations from CSI data. This approach overcomes traditional sequential data processing limitations, offering precise activity recognition and localization in multiperson environments. Our experimental results showcase superior performance in both localization and activity recognition tasks, surpassing existing methods. The real-time processing capability of our system paves the way for applications in smart environments, security, and healthcare monitoring, providing an efficient tool for situational awareness and advancing wireless sensing technology.
