The recent development of DNN and hardware has created new opportunities for mixed-reality applications. These applications demand the ability to analyze the real world and simulate realistic virtual content. However, designing mixed-reality applications faces diverse challenges due to the absence of a unified framework, such as huge programming effort and inconsistencies between the real scene and virtual content induced by end-to-end latency. This paper proposes Maestro, an analysis-simulation integrated framework for mixed-reality applications. Maestro provides a programming model for effective application representation and control, aiding runtime optimization. Maestro runtime takes an object-level execution approach to minimize misalignment, integrating both simulation and analysis pipelines for applications to process individual objects based on their latency sensitivity.
