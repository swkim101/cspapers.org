In a Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) environment, an application will be composed of multiple containers running on edge servers, and a container orchestration method determines which containers should be deployed on which edge servers. This paper proposes a container orchestration method considering shared containers. These containers will be introduced in an MEC environment to reduce application resource usage, similar to a shared library in an operating system. The proposed method adopts a multi-stage grouping of edge servers to aggregate computation resource information and network information of the edge servers for efficient orchestration calculation. The formulation of the proposed orchestration method has been successfully completed, marking a significant milestone in this research. Evaluation will be conducted assuming an environment that contains 2,048 edge servers and 200 user terminals.
