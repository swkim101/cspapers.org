This paper introduces a novel multi-directional speaker, named MuDiS, which utilizes a parametric array to generate highly focused sound beams in multiple directions. The system capitalizes on air nonlinearity to reproduce sound from ultrasounds, successfully overcoming challenges inherent in traditional parametric arrays, such as transducer size and wavefront shape. It supports three important features simultaneously: independent beams, wide-angle digital steering, and unintended leakage suppression. To address these challenges, we designed a specialized cell structure that connects ultrasonic transducers, redirecting an approximately omnidirectional wavefront with optimal interspacing. An optimization-based algorithm is developed to minimize unintended leakages, and a nonlinear distortion reduction scheme is proposed to enhance sound quality. The paper showcases a prototype demonstrating the system's capabilities as a multidirectional speaker with a wide sound projection angle. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed multi-beam projection system rivals the performance of commercially available single-beam projection directional speakers, and improved steering angle and sound fidelity compared to multi-beamforming performance using traditional parametric arrays.
