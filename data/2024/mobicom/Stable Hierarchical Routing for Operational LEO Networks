Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations promise ubiquitous network services to "unconnected" users. But their upcoming global routing for Earth will be unstable due to exhaustive topology updates between satellites and Earth, inside an orbital shell, and across heterogeneous orbital shells. In real LEO networks, these multi-dimensional dynamics are interleaved and complicated by chaotic orbital maneuvers and random failures. They are less predictable than most satellite routing proposals expect and threaten these proposals' availability, efficiency, or resiliency at scale. We propose SHORT, a Stable Hierarchical Orbital Routing Technique to decouple, localize, and mask multi-dimensional dynamics from operational LEO networks. SHORT takes a geographic paradigm to organize the LEO network as stable hierarchical routing domains, split heterogeneous LEO dynamics into each domain, mask them with domain-specific routing via orbital-geodetic coordinates, and localize adaptions to orbital maneuvers, random failures, and partial deployments. SHORT can work incrementally as a control-plane overlay to enhance existing LEO routing proposals. Our evaluations with the U.S. Space Surveillance Network datasets and prototype validate SHORT's near-optimal availability, efficiency, and resiliency in operational LEO networks.
