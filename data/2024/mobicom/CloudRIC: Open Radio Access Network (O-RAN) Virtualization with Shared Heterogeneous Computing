Open and virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRANs) are breeding a new market with unprecedented opportunities. However, carrier-grade vRANs today are expensive and energy-hungry, as they rely on hardware accelerators (HAs) that are dedicated to individual distributed units (DUs). In this paper, we argue that sharing pools of heterogeneous processors among DUs leads to more cost- and energy-efficient vRANs. We then design CloudRIC, a system that, powered by lightweight data-driven models, meets specific reliability targets while (i) coordinating access between DUs and heterogeneous computing infrastructure; and (ii) assisting DUs with compute-aware radio scheduling procedures. Experiments on a GPU-accelerated O-Cloud show that CloudRIC can achieve, respectively, 3x and 15x mean gains in energy- and cost-efficiency under real RAN workloads while ensuring 99.999% reliability even in dense scenarios.
