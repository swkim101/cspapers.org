Volumetric videos offer a unique interactive experience and have the potential to enhance social virtual reality and telepresence. Streaming volumetric videos to multiple users remains a challenge due to its tremendous requirements of network and computation resources. In this paper, we develop MuV2, an edge-assisted multi-user mobile volumetric video streaming system to support important use cases such as tens of students simultaneously consuming volumetric content in a classroom. MuV2 achieves high scalability and good streaming quality through three orthogonal designs: hybridizing direct streaming of 3D volumetric content with remote rendering, dynamically sharing edge-transcoded views across users, and multiplexing encoding tasks of multiple transcoding sessions into a limited number of hardware encoders on the edge. MuV2 then integrates the three designs into a holistic optimization framework. We fully implement MuV2 and experimentally demonstrate that MuV2 can deliver high-quality volumetric videos to over 30 concurrent untethered mobile devices with a single WiFi access point and a commodity edge server.
