While out-vehicle sensing has achieved great success with the development of vehicle radar and Lidar systems, invehicle sensing attracts a lot of attention recently. However, the popular camera-based solutions raise privacy concerns and pose requirement on lighting conditions. Researchers recently utilize wireless signals for sensing. However, besides requiring dedicated hardware, the rich multipath in a small cabin space causes severe interference, degrading the sensing reliability. In this paper, we propose a new sensing modality for in-vehicle sensing, leveraging the leaked EM signals from electric vehicles. The key observation is that the human body can capture the leaked signals, and body motions affect the signal variation patterns. Our solution involves designing conductive cloth tags on the seat to effectively collect body-captured signals and adopting a reference tag to deal with interference. Through extensive experiments conducted over 100 hours, covering a driving distance of 4000 kilometers on various real roads, our system, EVLeSen, can achieve over 90% accuracy in recognizing body motions utilizing just the leaked ambient signals.
