Video-based facial analysis is important for autonomous agents to understand human expressions and sentiments. However, limited labeled data is available to learn effective facial representations. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised face-centric pretraining framework, called PrefAce, which learns transferable video facial representation without labels. The self-supervised learning is performed with an effective landmark-guided global-local tube distillation. Meanwhile, a novel instance-wise update FaceFeat Cache is built to enforce more discriminative and diverse representations for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework learns universal instance-aware facial representations with fine-grained landmark details from videos. The point is that it can transfer across various facial analysis tasks, e.g., Facial Attribute Recognition (FAR), Facial Expression Recognition (FER), DeepFake Detection (DFD), and Lip Synchronization (LS). Our framework also outperforms the state-of-the-art on various downstream tasks, even in low data regimes. Code is available at https://github.com/siyuan-h/PrefAce.
