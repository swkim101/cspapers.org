Expanding on a 2017 paper by Siler that introduced tiered coalition formation games, I have introduced a variant game and examined the stabilizability of both the original game and its variant. My thesis will contain further theoretical stability findings and the results and interpretation of a simulation based upon real data from video game matchups.
