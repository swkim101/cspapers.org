In this paper, we introduce the problem of rewriting finite formal languages using syntactic macros such that the rewriting is minimal in size. We present polynomial-time algorithms to solve variants of this problem and show their correctness. To demonstrate the practical relevance of the proposed problems and the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithms in practice, we apply these to biomedical ontologies authored in OWL. We find that such rewritings can significantly reduce the size of ontologies by capturing repeated expressions with macros. This approach not only offers valuable assistance in enhancing ontology quality and comprehension but can also be seen as a general methodology for evaluating features of rewriting systems (including syntactic macros, templates, or other forms of rewriting rules), which can be analyzed in terms of their influence on computational problems.
