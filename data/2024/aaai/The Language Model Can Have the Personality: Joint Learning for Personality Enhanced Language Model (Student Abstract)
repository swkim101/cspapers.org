With the introduction of large language models, chatbots are becoming more conversational to communicate effectively and capable of handling increasingly complex tasks. To make a chatbot more relatable and engaging, we propose a new language model idea that maps the human-like personality.
In this paper, we propose a systematic Personality-Enhanced Language Model (PELM) approach by using a joint learning mechanism of personality classification and language generation tasks. The proposed PELM leverages a dataset of defined personality typology, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and produces a Personality-Enhanced Language Model by using a joint learning and cross-teaching structure consisting of a classification and language modelling to incorporate personalities via both distinctive types and textual information. The results show that PELM can generate better personality-based outputs than baseline models.
