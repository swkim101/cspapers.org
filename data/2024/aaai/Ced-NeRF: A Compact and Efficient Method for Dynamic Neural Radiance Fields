Rendering photorealistic dynamic scenes has been a focus of recent research, with applications in virtual and augmented reality. While the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has shown remarkable rendering quality for static scenes, achieving real-time rendering of dynamic scenes remains challenging due to expansive computation for the time dimension. The incorporation of explicit-based methods, specifically voxel grids, has been proposed to accelerate the training and rendering of neural radiance fields with hybrid representation. However, employing a hybrid representation for dynamic scenes results in overfitting due to fast convergence, which can result in artifacts (e.g., floaters, noisy geometric) on novel views. To address this, we propose a compact and efficient method for dynamic neural radiance fields, namely Ced-NeRF which only require a small number of additional parameters to construct a hybrid representation of dynamic NeRF. Evaluation of dynamic scene datasets shows that our Ced-NeRF achieves fast rendering speeds while maintaining high-quality rendering results. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality, training and rendering speed.
