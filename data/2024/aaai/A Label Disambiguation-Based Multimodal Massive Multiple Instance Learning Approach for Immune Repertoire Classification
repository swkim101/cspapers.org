One individual human’s immune repertoire consists of a huge set of adaptive immune receptors at a certain time point, representing the individual's adaptive immune state. Immune repertoire classification and associated receptor identification have the potential to make a transformative contribution to the development of novel vaccines and therapies. The vast number of instances and exceedingly low witness rate pose a great challenge to the immune repertoire classification, which can be formulated as a Massive Multiple Instance Learning (MMIL) problem. Traditional MIL methods, at both bag-level and instance-level, confront the issues of substantial computational burden or supervision ambiguity when handling massive instances. To address these issues, we propose a novel label disambiguation-based multimodal massive multiple instance learning approach (LaDM³IL) for immune repertoire classification. LaDM³IL adapts the instance-level MIL paradigm to deal with the issue of high computational cost and employs a specially-designed label disambiguation module for label correction, mitigating the impact of misleading supervision. To achieve a more comprehensive representation of each receptor, LaDM³IL leverages a multimodal fusion module with gating-based attention and tensor-fusion to integrate the information from gene segments and amino acid (AA) sequences of each immune receptor. Extensive experiments on the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Cancer datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed LaDM³IL for both immune repertoire classification and associated receptor identification tasks.
