Incomplete multi-view clustering has attracted much attention due to its ability to handle partial multi-view data. Recently, similarity-based methods have been developed to explore the complete relationship among incomplete multi-view data. Although widely applied to partial scenarios, most of the existing approaches are still faced with two limitations. Firstly, fusing similarities constructed individually on each view fails to yield a complete unified similarity. Moreover, incomplete similarity generation may lead to anomalous similarity values with column sum constraints, affecting the final clustering results. To solve the above challenging issues, we propose a Sample-level Cross-view Similarity Learning (SCSL) method for Incomplete Multi-view Clustering. Specifically, we project all samples to the same dimension and simultaneously construct a complete similarity matrix across views based on the inter-view sample relationship and the intra-view sample relationship. In addition, a simultaneously learning consensus representation ensures the validity of the projection, which further enhances the quality of the similarity matrix through the graph Laplacian regularization. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the ability of SCSL in processing incomplete multi-view clustering tasks.
