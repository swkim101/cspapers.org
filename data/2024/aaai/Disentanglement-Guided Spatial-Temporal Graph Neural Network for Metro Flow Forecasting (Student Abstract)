In recent intelligent transportation applications, metro flow forecasting has received much attention from researchers. Most prior arts endeavor to explore spatial or temporal dependencies while ignoring the key characteristic patterns underlying historical flows, e.g., trend and periodicity. Although the multiple granularity distillations or spatial dependency correlation can promote the flow estimation. However, the potential noise and spatial dynamics are under-explored. To this end, we propose a novel Disentanglement-Guided Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network or DGST to address the above concerns. It contains a Disentanglement Pre-training procedure for characteristic pattern disentanglement learning, a Characteristic Pattern Prediction for different future characteristic explorations, and a Spatial-Temporal Correlation for spatial-temporal dynamic learning. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of our DGST.
