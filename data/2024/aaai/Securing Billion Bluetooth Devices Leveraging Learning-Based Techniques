As the most popular low-power communication protocol, cybersecurity research on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has garnered significant attention. Due to BLEâ€™s inherent security limitations and firmware vulnerabilities, spoofing attacks can easily compromise BLE devices and tamper with privacy data. In this paper, we proposed BLEGuard, a hybrid detection mechanism combined cyber-physical features with learning-based techniques. We established a physical network testbed to conduct attack simulations and capture advertising packets. Four different network features were utilized to implement detection and classification algorithms. Preliminary results have verified the feasibility of our proposed methods.
