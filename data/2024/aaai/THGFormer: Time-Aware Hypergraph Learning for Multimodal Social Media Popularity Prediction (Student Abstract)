Social media popularity prediction of multimodal user-generated content (UGC) is a crucial task for many real-world applications. However, existing efforts are often limited by missing inter-instance correlations and UGC temporal patterns. To address these issues, we propose a novel time-aware hypergraph Transformer framework, THGFormer. It fully represents inter-instance and intra-instance relations by hypergraphs, captures the temporal dependencies with a time encoder, and enhances UGC's representations via a neighborhood knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that THGFormer outperforms state-of-the-art popularity prediction models across several settings.
