Correspondence pruning aims to establish reliable correspondences between two related images and recover relative camera motion. Existing approaches often employ a progressive strategy to handle the local and global contexts, with a prominent emphasis on transitioning from local to global, resulting in the neglect of interactions between different contexts. To tackle this issue, we propose a parallel context learning strategy that involves acquiring bilateral consensus for the two-view correspondence pruning task. In our approach, we design a distinctive self-attention block to capture global context and parallel process it with the established local context learning module, which enables us to simultaneously capture both local and global consensuses. By combining these local and global consensuses, we derive the required bilateral consensus. We also design a recalibration block, reducing the influence of erroneous consensus information and enhancing the robustness of the model. The culmination of our efforts is the Bilateral Consensus Learning Network (BCLNet), which efficiently estimates camera pose and identifies inliers (true correspondences). Extensive experiments results demonstrate that our network not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets but also showcases robust generalization abilities across various feature extraction techniques. Noteworthily, BCLNet obtains significant improvement gains over the second best method on unknown outdoor dataset, and obviously accelerates model training speed.
