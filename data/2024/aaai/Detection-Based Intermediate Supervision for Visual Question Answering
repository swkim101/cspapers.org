Recently, neural module networks (NMNs) have yielded ongoing success in answering compositional visual questions, especially those involving multi-hop visual and logical reasoning. NMNs decompose the complex question into several sub-tasks using instance-modules from the reasoning paths of that question and then exploit intermediate supervisions to guide answer prediction, thereby improving inference interpretability. However, their performance may be hindered due to sketchy modeling of intermediate supervisions. For instance, (1) a prior assumption that each instance-module refers to only one grounded object yet overlooks other potentially associated grounded objects, impeding full cross-modal alignment learning; (2) IoU-based intermediate supervisions may introduce noise signals as the bounding box overlap issue might guide the model's focus towards irrelevant objects. To address these issues, a novel method, Detection-based Intermediate Supervision (DIS), is proposed, which adopts a generative detection framework to facilitate multiple grounding supervisions via sequence generation. As such, DIS offers more comprehensive and accurate intermediate supervisions, thereby boosting answer prediction performance. Furthermore, by considering intermediate results, DIS enhances the consistency in answering compositional questions and their sub-questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DIS, showcasing both improved accuracy and state-of-the-art reasoning consistency compared to prior approaches.
