Despite many breakthroughs in recent years, it is still hard for MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms to directly solve complex tasks in MultiAgent Systems (MASs) from scratch. In this work, we study how to use Automatic Curriculum Learning (ACL) to reduce the number of environmental interactions required to learn a good policy. In order to solve a difficult task, ACL methods automatically select a sequence of tasks (i.e., curricula). The idea is to obtain maximum learning progress towards the final task by continuously learning on tasks that match the current capabilities of the learners. The key question is how to measure the learning progress of the learner for better curriculum selection. We propose a novel ACL framework, PrOgRessive mulTiagent Automatic curricuLum (PORTAL), for MASs. PORTAL selects curricula according to two critera: 1) How difficult is a task, relative to the learnersâ€™ current abilities? 2) How similar is a task, relative to the final task? By learning a shared feature space between tasks, PORTAL is able to characterize different tasks based on the distribution of features and select those that are similar to the final task. Also, the shared feature space can effectively facilitate the policy transfer between curricula. Experimental results show that PORTAL can train agents to master extremely hard cooperative tasks, which can not be achieved with previous state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.
