Low-light images frequently occur due to unavoidable environmental influences or technical limitations, such as insufficient lighting or limited exposure time. To achieve better visibility for visual perception, low-light image enhancement is usually adopted. Besides, lossy image compression is vital for meeting the requirements of storage and transmission in computer vision applications. To touch the above two practical demands, current solutions can be categorized into two sequential manners: ``Compress before Enhance (CbE)'' or ``Enhance before Compress (EbC)''. However, both of them are not suitable since: (1) Error accumulation in the individual models plagues sequential solutions. Especially, once low-light images are compressed by existing general lossy image compression approaches, useful information (e.g., texture details) would be lost resulting in a dramatic performance decrease in low-light image enhancement. (2) Due to the intermediate process, the sequential solution introduces an additional burden resulting in low efficiency. We propose a novel joint solution to simultaneously achieve a high compression rate and good enhancement performance for low-light images with much lower computational cost and fewer model parameters. We design an end-to-end trainable architecture, which includes the main enhancement branch and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) aware branch. Experimental results show that our proposed joint solution achieves a significant improvement over different combinations of existing state-of-the-art sequential ``Compress before Enhance'' or ``Enhance before Compress'' solutions for low-light images, which would make lossy low-light image compression more meaningful.
