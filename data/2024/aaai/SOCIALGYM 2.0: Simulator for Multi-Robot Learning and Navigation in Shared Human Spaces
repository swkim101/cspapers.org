We present Social Gym 2.0, a simulator for multi-agent navigation research. Our simulator enables navigation for multiple autonomous agents, replicating real-world dynamics in complex indoor environments, including doorways, hallways, intersections, and roundabouts. Unlike current simulators that concentrate on single robots in open spaces, Social Gym 2.0 employs multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop optimal navigation policies for multiple robots with diverse, dynamic constraints in complex environments. Social Gym 2.0 also departs from the accepted software design standards by employing a configuration-over-convention paradigm providing the capability to benchmark different MARL algorithms, as well as customize observation and reward functions. Users can additionally create their own environments and evaluate various algorithms, based on both deep reinforcement learning as well as classical navigation, using a broad range of social navigation metrics.
