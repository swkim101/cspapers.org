With the flourishing of the Internet, sharing one's photos or automated processing of faces using computer vision technology has become an everyday occurrence. While enjoying the convenience, the concern for identity privacy is also emerging. Therefore, some efforts introduced the concept of ``password'' from traditional cryptography such as RSA into the face anonymization and deanonymization task to protect the facial identity without compromising the usability of the face image. However, these methods either suffer from the poor visual quality of the synthesis results or do not possess the full cryptographic properties, resulting in compromised security. In this paper, we present the first facial identity cryptography framework with full properties analogous to RSA. Our framework leverages the powerful generative capabilities of StyleGAN to achieve megapixel-level facial identity anonymization and deanonymization. Thanks to the great semantic decoupling of StyleGAN's latent space, the identity encryption and decryption process are performed in latent space by a well-designed password mapper in the manner of editing latent code. Meanwhile, the password-related information is imperceptibly hidden in the edited latent code owing to the redundant nature of the latent space. To make our cryptographic framework possesses all the properties analogous to RSA, we propose three types of loss functions: single anonymization loss, sequential anonymization loss, and associated anonymization loss. Extensive experiments and ablation analyses demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of the quality of synthesis results, identity-irrelevant attributes preservation, deanonymization accuracy, and completeness of properties analogous to RSA.
