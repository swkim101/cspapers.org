We investigate two notions of correlated equilibrium for extensive-form games: the extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) and the behavioral correlated equilibrium (BCE). We show that the two are outcome-equivalent, in the sense that every outcome distribution achievable under one notion is achievable under the other. Our result implies, to our knowledge, the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing a BCE.
