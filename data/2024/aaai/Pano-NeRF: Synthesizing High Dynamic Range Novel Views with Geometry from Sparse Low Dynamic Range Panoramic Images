Panoramic imaging research on geometry recovery and High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction becomes a trend with the development of Extended Reality (XR). Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) provide a promising scene representation for both tasks without requiring extensive prior data. How- ever, in the case of inputting sparse Low Dynamic Range (LDR) panoramic images, NeRF often degrades with under-constrained geometry and is unable to reconstruct HDR radiance from LDR inputs. We observe that the radiance from each pixel in panoramic images can be modeled as both a signal to convey scene lighting information and a light source to illuminate other pixels. Hence, we propose the irradiance fields from sparse LDR panoramic images, which increases the observation counts for faithful geometry recovery and leverages the irradiance-radiance attenuation for HDR reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the irradiance fields outperform state-of-the-art methods on both geometry recovery and HDR reconstruction and validate their effectiveness. Furthermore, we show a promising byproduct of spatially-varying lighting estimation. The code is available at https://github.com/Lu-Zhan/Pano-NeRF.
