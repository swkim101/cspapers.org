In recent years, the increasing emphasis on sustainability and carbon footprint reduction has required the exploration of innovative optimization techniques for data center operators. In this paper, we introduce a Concurrent Carbon Footprint Reduction (C2FR) Reinforcement Learning framework, designed to optimize data center energy consumption, load shifting, and battery operation decisions in real time. The C2FR framework utilizes short-term forecasts and incorporates Reinforcement Learning Energy ($A_{E}$), Battery ($A_{BAT}$) and Load-Shifting ($A_{LS}$) agents to optimize and effectively manage the intricate dependencies and information exchange between these individual optimization strategies, thus overcoming the limitations of existing isolated approaches. When compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the C2FR framework demonstrates its effectiveness across various data center scenarios. The AE agent achieves a 7.9% reduction in pollutant emissions and a 7.8% reduction in energy cost on average. Moreover, the C2FR framework enables further emission reductions through the application of the battery and load-shifting optimization, leading to a total reduction of 10.17% in pollutant emissions on average over different data center configurations. This highlights the potential of the C2FR framework in addressing data center sustainability challenges and improving real-time carbon footprint optimization.
