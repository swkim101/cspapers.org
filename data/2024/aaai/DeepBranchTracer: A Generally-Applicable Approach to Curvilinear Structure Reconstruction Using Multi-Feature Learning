Curvilinear structures, which include line-like continuous objects, are fundamental geometrical elements in image-based applications. Reconstructing these structures from images constitutes a pivotal research area in computer vision. However, the complex topology and ambiguous image evidence render this process a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce DeepBranchTracer, a novel method that learns both external image features and internal geometric characteristics to reconstruct curvilinear structures. Firstly, we formulate the curvilinear structures extraction as a geometric attribute estimation problem. Then, a curvilinear structure feature learning network is designed to extract essential branch attributes, including the image features of centerline and boundary, and the geometric features of direction and radius. Finally, utilizing a multi-feature fusion tracing strategy, our model iteratively traces the entire branch by integrating the extracted image and geometric features. We extensively evaluated our model on both 2D and 3D datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing segmentation and reconstruction methods in terms of accuracy and continuity.
