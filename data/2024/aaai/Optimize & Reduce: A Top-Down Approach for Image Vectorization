Vector image representation is a popular choice when editability and flexibility in resolution are desired. However, most images are only available in raster form, making raster-to-vector image conversion (vectorization) an important task. Classical methods for vectorization are either domain-specific or yield an abundance of shapes which limits editability and interpretability. Learning-based methods, that use differentiable rendering, have revolutionized vectorization, at the cost of poor generalization to out-of-training distribution domains, and optimization-based counterparts are either slow or produce non-editable and redundant shapes. In this work, we propose Optimize & Reduce (O&R), a top-down approach to vectorization that is both fast and domain-agnostic. O&R aims to attain a compact representation of input images by iteratively optimizing Bezier curve parameters and significantly reducing the number of shapes, using a devised importance measure. We contribute a benchmark of five datasets comprising images from a broad spectrum of image complexities - from emojis to natural-like images. Through extensive experiments on hundreds of images, we demonstrate that our method is domain agnostic and outperforms existing works in both reconstruction and perceptual quality for a fixed number of shapes. Moreover, we show that our algorithm is x10 faster than the state-of-the-art optimization-based method. Our code is publicly available: https://github.com/ajevnisek/optimize-and-reduce
