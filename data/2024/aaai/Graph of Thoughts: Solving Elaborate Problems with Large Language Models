We introduce Graph of Thoughts (GoT): a framework that
advances prompting capabilities in large language models
(LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms such as 
Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea and 
primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information 
generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of 
information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices, and edges correspond
to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables 
combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, 
distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts,
or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate
that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different
tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62%
over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by >31%.
We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought 
transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting
schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human 
thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both
of which form complex networks
