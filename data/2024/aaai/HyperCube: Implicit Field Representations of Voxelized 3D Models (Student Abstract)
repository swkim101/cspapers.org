Implicit field representations offer an effective way of generating 3D object shapes. They leverage an implicit decoder (IM-NET) trained to take a 3D point coordinate concatenated with a shape encoding and to output a value indicating whether the point is outside the shape. This approach enables the efficient rendering of visually plausible objects but also has some significant limitations, resulting in a cumbersome training procedure and empty spaces within the rendered mesh. In this paper, we introduce a new HyperCube architecture based on interval arithmetic that enables direct processing of 3D voxels, trained using a hypernetwork paradigm to enforce model convergence.
