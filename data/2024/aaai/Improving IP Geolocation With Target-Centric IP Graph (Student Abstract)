Accurate IP geolocation is indispensable for location-aware applications. While recent advances based on router-centric IP graphs are considered cutting-edge, one challenge remain: the prevalence of sparse IP graphs (14.24% with fewer than 10 nodes, 9.73% isolated) limits graph learning. To mitigate this issue, we designate the target host as the central node and aggregate multiple last-hop routers to construct the target-centric IP graph, instead of relying solely on the router with the smallest last-hop latency as in previous works. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the geolocation accuracy compared to existing baselines.
