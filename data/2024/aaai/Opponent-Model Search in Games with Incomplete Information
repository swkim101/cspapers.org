Games with incomplete information are games that model situations where players do not have common knowledge about the game they play, e.g. card games such as poker or bridge. Opponent models can be of crucial importance for decision-making in such games. We propose algorithms for computing optimal and/or robust strategies in games with incomplete information, given various types of knowledge about opponent models. As an application, we describe a framework for reasoning about an opponent's reasoning in such games, where opponent models arise naturally.
