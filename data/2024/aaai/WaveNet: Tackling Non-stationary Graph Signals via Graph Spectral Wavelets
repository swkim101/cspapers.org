In the existing spectral GNNs, polynomial-based methods occupy the mainstream in designing a filter through the Laplacian matrix. However, polynomial combinations factored by the Laplacian matrix naturally have limitations in message passing (e.g., over-smoothing). Furthermore, most existing spectral GNNs are based on polynomial bases, which struggle to capture the high-frequency parts of the graph spectral signal. Additionally, we also find that even increasing the polynomial order does not change this situation, which means polynomial-based models have a natural deficiency when facing high-frequency signals. To tackle these problems, we propose WaveNet, which aims to effectively capture the high-frequency part of the graph spectral signal from the perspective of wavelet bases through reconstructing the message propagation matrix. We utilize Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) to model this question, and our proposed method can reconstruct arbitrary filters theoretically. We also conduct node classification experiments on real-world graph benchmarks and achieve superior performance on most datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Bufordyang/WaveNet
