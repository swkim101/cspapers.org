In neural memory decoding, a concept being mentally recalled is identified using brain data. Recently, the feasibility of neural memory decoding with EEG data has been demonstrated. Here we propose a new application – neural information retrieval – that uses neural memory decoding to allow a document to be retrieved merely by thinking about it. In this paper we describe neural memory decoding, define the application of neural information retrieval, present experimental results related to the practicality of the application, and discuss issues of deployment and data privacy.
