We introduce SciSpace Copilot, an AI research assistant that helps in understanding and reading research papers faster by providing a plethora of features. Answering questions from a document has recently become popular using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our tool uses an advanced question-answering pipeline to get accurate answers and also provide exact citations for the same. We provide many more valuable features on scientific text, including generating explanations, generating summaries, adding notes and highlights, and finding related papers from our 200 million corpus. Our tool supports 100+ languages, making research more accessible across language barriers. Thousands of users use SciSpace Copilot on a daily basis by uploading their articles to understand research faster and better. Our tool can be accessed at this link: https://typeset.io.
