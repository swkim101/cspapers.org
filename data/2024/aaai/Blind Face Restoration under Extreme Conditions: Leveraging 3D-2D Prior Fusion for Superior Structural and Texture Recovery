Blind face restoration under extreme conditions involves reconstructing high-quality face images from severely degraded inputs. These input images are often in poor quality and have extreme facial poses, leading to errors in facial structure and unnatural artifacts within the restored images. In this paper, we show that utilizing 3D priors effectively compensates for structure knowledge deficiencies in 2D priors while preserving the texture details. Based on this, we introduce FREx (Face Restoration under Extreme conditions) that combines structure-accurate 3D priors and texture-rich 2D priors in pretrained generative networks for blind face restoration under extreme conditions. To fuse the different information in 3D and 2D priors, we introduce an adaptive weight module that adjusts the importance of features based on the input image's condition. With this approach, our model can restore structure-accurate and natural-looking faces even when the images have lost a lot of information due to degradation and extreme pose. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods.
