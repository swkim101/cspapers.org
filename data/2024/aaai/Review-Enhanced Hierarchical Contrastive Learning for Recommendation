Designed to establish potential relations and distill high-order representations, graph-based recommendation systems continue to reveal promising results by jointly modeling ratings and reviews. However, existing studies capture simple review relations, failing to (1) completely explore hidden connections between users (or items), (2) filter out redundant information derived from reviews, and (3) model the behavioral association between rating and review interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a review-enhanced hierarchicalÂ contrastive learning, namely ReHCL. First, ReHCL constructs topic and semantic graphs to fully mine review relations from different views. Moreover, a cross-view graph contrastive learning is used to achieve enhancement of node representations and extract useful review knowledge. Meanwhile, we design a neighbor-based positive sampling to capture the graph-structured similarity between topic and semantic views, further performing efficient contrast and reducing redundant noise. Next, we propose a cross-modal contrastive learning to match the rating and review representations, by exploring the association between ratings and reviews. Lastly, these two contrastive learning modes form a hierarchical contrastive learning task, which is applied to enhance the final recommendation task. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of ReHCL compared with state-of-the-arts.
