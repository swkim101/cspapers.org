Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have made significant strides in the modeling and rendering of 3D scenes. However, due to the complexity of luminance information, existing NeRF methods often struggle to produce satisfactory renderings when dealing with high and low exposure images. To address this issue, we propose an innovative approach capable of effectively modeling and rendering images under multiple exposure conditions. Our method adaptively learns the characteristics of images under different exposure conditions through an unsupervised evaluator-simulator structure for HDR (High Dynamic Range) fusion. This approach enhances NeRF's comprehension and handling of light variations, leading to the generation of images with appropriate brightness. Simultaneously, we present a bilevel optimization method tailored for novel view synthesis, aiming to harmonize the luminance information of input images while preserving their structural and content consistency. This approach facilitates the concurrent optimization of multi-exposure correction and novel view synthesis, in an unsupervised manner. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on the LOM and LOL datasets, our approach surpasses existing methods, markedly enhancing the task of novel view synthesis for multi-exposure environments and attaining state-of-the-art results.
