Existing cold-start recommendation methods often adopt item-level alignment strategies to align the content feature and the collaborative feature of warm items for model training, however, cold items in the test stage have no historical interactions with users to obtain the collaborative feature. These existing models ignore the aforementioned condition of cold items in the training stage, resulting in the performance limitation. In this paper, we propose a preference aware dual contrastive learning based recommendation model (PAD-CLRec), where the user preference is explored to take into account the condition of cold items for feature alignment. Here, the user preference is obtained by aggregating a group of collaborative feature of the warm items in the user's purchase records. Then, a group-level alignment between the user preference and the item's content feature can be realized via a proposed preference aware contrastive function for enhancing cold-item recommendation. In addition, a joint objective function is introduced to achieve a better trade-off between the recommendation performance of warm items and cold items from both item-level and group-level perspectives, yielding better overall recommendation performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show the superiority of our method, as compared with the state-of-the-arts.
