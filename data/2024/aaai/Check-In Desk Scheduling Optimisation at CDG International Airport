More than ever, air transport players (i.e., airline and airport companies) in an intensely competitive climate need to benefit from a carefully optimized management of airport resources to improve the quality of service and control the induced costs.
In this paper, we investigate the Airport Check-in Desk Assignment Problem.
We propose a Constraint Programming (CP) model for this problem, and present some promising experimental results from data coming from ADP (AÃ©roport de Paris).
Our works are deployed in a preprod environment since 1 year.
