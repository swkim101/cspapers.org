Pain, a primary reason for seeking medical help, requires essential pain assessment for effective management. Studies have recognized electrodermal activity (EDA) signaling's potential for automated pain assessment, but traditional algorithms often ignore the noise and uncertainty inherent in pain data. To address this, we propose a learning framework predicated on data uncertainty, introducing two forms: a) subject-level stimulation-reaction drift; b) ambiguity in self-reporting scores. We formulate an uncertainty assessment using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features to guide the selection of responsive pain profiles and reweight subtask importance based on the vagueness of self-reported data. These methods are integrated within an end-to-end neural network learning paradigm, focusing the detector on more accurate insights within the uncertainty domain. Extensive experimentation on both the publicly available biovid dataset and the proprietary Apon dataset demonstrates our approach's effectiveness. In the biovid dataset, we achieved a 6% enhancement over the state-of-the-art methodology, and on the Apon dataset, our method outperformed baseline approaches by over 20%.
