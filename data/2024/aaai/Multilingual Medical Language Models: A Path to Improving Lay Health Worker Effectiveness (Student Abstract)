The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the challenges faced by healthcare delivery in developing nations, placing additional strain on already fragile infrastructure and healthcare systems. This has prompted an increased reliance on lay healthcare workers (LHWs) to meet the surging demand for services. Due to limited formal training, many LHWs have resorted to using unreliable sources, such as internet searches, to access medical information.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising opportunity to support LHWs by providing accurate, context-sensitive information for improving healthcare delivery, provided they are appropriately fine-tuned on domain-specific multilingual data. This paper delves into critical issues and presents potential solutions for developing LLM-powered virtual assistants tailored to LHWs serving Telugu and Hindi-speaking populations. Key focal points include the customization of language and content to suit local contexts, the integration of feedback mechanisms to continuously enhance assistance quality, and the delicate balance between automation and human oversight.
