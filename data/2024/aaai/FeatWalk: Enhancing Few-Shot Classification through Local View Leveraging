Few-shot learning is a challenging task due to the limited availability of training samples. Recent few-shot learning studies with meta-learning and simple transfer learning methods have achieved promising performance. However, the feature extractor pre-trained with the upstream dataset may neglect the extraction of certain features which could be crucial for downstream tasks. In this study, inspired by the process of human learning in few-shot tasks, where humans not only observe the whole image (`global view') but also attend to various local image regions (`local view') for comprehensive understanding of detailed features, we propose a simple yet effective few-shot learning method called FeatWalk which can utilize the complementary nature of global and local views, therefore providing an intuitive and effective solution to the problem of insufficient local information extraction from the pre-trained feature extractor. Our method can be easily and flexibly combined with various existing methods, further enhancing few-shot learning performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.The source code is available at https://github.com/exceefind/FeatWalk.
