Despite achieving impressive improvement in accuracy, most existing monocular 3D human mesh reconstruction methods require large-scale 2D/3D ground-truths for supervision, which limits their applications on unlabeled in-the-wild data that is ubiquitous. To alleviate the reliance on 2D/3D ground-truths, we present a self-supervised 3D human pose and shape reconstruction framework that relies only on self-consistency between intermediate representations of images and projected 2D predictions. Specifically, we extract 2D joints and depth maps from monocular images as proxy inputs, which provides complementary clues to infer accurate 3D human meshes. Furthermore, to reduce the impacts from noisy and ambiguous inputs while better concentrate on the high-quality information, we design an uncertainty-aware module to automatically learn the reliability of the inputs at body-joint level based on the consistency between 2D joints and depth map. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods at similar supervision levels.
