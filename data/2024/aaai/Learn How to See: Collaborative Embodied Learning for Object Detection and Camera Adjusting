Passive object detectors, trained on large-scale static datasets, often overlook the feedback from object detection to image acquisition. Embodied vision and active detection mitigate this issue by interacting with the environment. Nevertheless, the materialization of activeness hinges on resource-intensive data collection and annotation. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative student-teacher framework. Technically, a replay buffer is built based on the trajectory data to encapsulate the relationship of state, action, and reward. In addition, the student network diverges from reinforcement learning by redefining sequential decision pathways using a GPT structure enriched with causal self-attention. Moreover, the teacher network establishes a subtle state-reward mapping based on adjacent benefit differences, providing reliable rewards for student adaptively self-tuning with the vast unlabeled replay buffer data. Additionally, an innovative yet straightforward benefit reference value is proposed within the teacher network, adding to its effectiveness and simplicity. Leveraging a flexible replay buffer and embodied collaboration between teacher and student, the framework learns to see before detection with shallower features and shorter inference steps. Experiments highlight significant advantages of our algorithm over state-of-the-art detectors. The code is released at https://github.com/lydonShen/STF.
