In the digital age, cybercrimes, particularly cyber harassment, have become pressing issues, targeting vulnerable individuals like children, teenagers, and women. Understanding the experiences and needs of the victims is crucial for effective support and intervention. Online conversations between victims and virtual harassment counselors (chatbots) offer valuable insights into cyber harassment manifestations (CHMs) and determinants (CHDs). However, the distinction between CHMs and CHDs remains unclear. This research is the first to introduce concrete definitions for CHMs and CHDs, investigating their distinction through automated methods to enable efficient cyber-harassment dialogue comprehension. We present a novel dataset, Cyber-MaD that contains Cyber harassment dialogues manually annotated with Manifestations and Determinants. Additionally, we design an Emotion-informed Contextual Dual attention Convolution Transformer (E-ConDuCT) framework to extract CHMs and CHDs from cyber harassment dialogues. The framework primarily: a) utilizes inherent emotion features through adjective-noun pairs modeled by an autoencoder, b) employs a unique Contextual Dual attention Convolution Transformer to learn contextual insights; and c) incorporates a demarcation module leveraging task-specific emotional knowledge and a discriminator loss function to differentiate manifestations and determinants. E-ConDuCT outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on the Cyber-MaD corpus, showcasing its potential in the extraction of CHMs and CHDs. Furthermore, its robustness is demonstrated on the emotion cause extraction task using the CARES_CEASE-v2.0 dataset of suicide notes, confirming its efficacy across diverse cause extraction objectives.
