Multi-label few-shot aspect category detection (FS-ACD) is a challenging sentiment analysis task, which aims to learn a multi-label learning paradigm with limited training data. The difficulty of this task is how to use limited data to generalize effective discriminative representations for different categories. Nowadays, all advanced FS-ACD works utilize the prototypical network to learn label prototypes to represent different aspects. However, such point-based estimation methods are inherently noise-susceptible and bias-vulnerable. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Variational Hybrid-Attention Framework (VHAF) for the FS-ACD task. Specifically, to alleviate the data noise, we adopt a hybrid-attention mechanism to generate more discriminative aspect-specific embeddings. Then, based on these embeddings, we introduce the variational distribution inference to obtain the aspect-specific distribution as a more robust aspect representation, which can eliminate the scarce data bias for better inference. Moreover, we further leverage an adaptive threshold estimation to help VHAF better identify multiple relevant aspects. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our VHAF over other state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/chengzju/VHAF.
