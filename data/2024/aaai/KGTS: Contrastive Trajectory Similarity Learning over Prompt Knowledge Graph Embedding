Trajectory similarity computation serves as a fundamental functionality of various spatial information applications. Although existing deep learning similarity computation methods offer better efficiency and accuracy than non-learning solutions, they are still immature in trajectory embedding and suffer from poor generality and heavy preprocessing for training. Targeting these limitations, we propose a novel framework named KGTS based on knowledge graph grid embedding, prompt trajectory embedding, and unsupervised contrastive learning for improved trajectory similarity computation. Specifically, we first embed map grids with a GRot embedding method to vigorously grasp the neighbouring relations of grids. Then, a prompt trajectory embedding network incorporates the resulting grid embedding and extracts trajectory structure and point order information. It is trained by unsupervised contrastive learning, which not only alleviates the heavy preprocessing burden but also provides exceptional generality with creatively designed strategies for positive sample generation. The prompt trajectory embedding adopts a customized prompt paradigm to mitigate the gap between the grid embedding and the trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KGTS over state-of-the-art methods.
