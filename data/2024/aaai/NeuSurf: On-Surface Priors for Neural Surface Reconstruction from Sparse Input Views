Recently, neural implicit functions have demonstrated remarkable results in the field of multi-view reconstruction. However, most existing methods are tailored for dense views and exhibit unsatisfactory performance when dealing with sparse views. Several latest methods have been proposed for generalizing implicit reconstruction to address the sparse view reconstruction task, but they still suffer from high training costs and are merely valid under carefully selected perspectives. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse view reconstruction framework that leverages on-surface priors to achieve highly faithful surface reconstruction. Specifically, we design several constraints on global geometry alignment and local geometry refinement for jointly optimizing coarse shapes and fine details. To achieve this, we train a neural network to learn a global implicit field from the on-surface points obtained from SfM and then leverage it as a coarse geometric constraint. To exploit local geometric consistency, we project on-surface points onto seen and unseen views, treating the consistent loss of projected features as a fine geometric constraint. The experimental results with DTU and BlendedMVS datasets in two prevalent sparse settings demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.
