Due to the efficiency of integrating semantic consensus and complementary information across different views, multi-view classification methods have attracted much attention in recent years. However, multi-view data often suffers from both the miss of view features and insufficient label information, which significantly decrease the performance of traditional multi-view classification methods in practice. Learning for such simultaneous lack of feature and label is crucial but rarely studied. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Deep Incomplete Multi-view Learning Network (DIMvLN) by incorporating graph networks and semi-supervised learning in this paper. Specifically, DIMvLN firstly designs the deep graph networks to effectively recover missing data with assigning pseudo-labels of large amounts of unlabeled instances and refine the incomplete feature information. Meanwhile, to enhance the label information, a novel pseudo-label generation strategy with the similarity constraints of unlabeled instances is proposed to exploit additional supervisory information and guide the completion module to preserve more semantic information of absent multi-view data. Besides, we design view-specific representation extractors with the autoencoder structure and contrastive loss to learn high-level semantic representations for each view, promote cross-view consistencies and augment the separability between different categories. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DIMvLN, attaining noteworthy performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art competitors on several public benchmark datasets. Code will be available at GitHub.
