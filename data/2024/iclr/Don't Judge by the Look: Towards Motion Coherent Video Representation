Current training pipelines in object recognition neglect Hue Jittering when doing data augmentation as it not only brings appearance changes that are detrimental to classification, but also the implementation is inefficient in practice. In this study, we investigate the effect of hue variance in the context of video understanding and find this variance to be beneficial since static appearances are less important in videos that contain motion information. Based on this observation, we propose a data augmentation method for video understanding, named Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA), that introduces appearance variation in videos and implicitly encourages the model to prioritize motion patterns, rather than static appearances. Concretely, we propose an operation SwapMix to efficiently modify the appearance of video samples, and introduce Variation Alignment (VA) to resolve the distribution shift caused by SwapMix, enforcing the model to learn appearance invariant representations. Comprehensive empirical evaluation across various architectures and different datasets solidly validates the effectiveness and generalization ability of MCA, and the application of VA in other augmentation methods.
