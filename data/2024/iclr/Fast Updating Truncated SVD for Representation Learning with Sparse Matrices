Updating a truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is crucial in representation learning, especially when dealing with large-scale data matrices that continuously evolve in practical scenarios. Aligning SVD-based models with fast-paced updates becomes increasingly important. Existing methods for updating truncated SVDs employ Rayleigh-Ritz projection procedures, where projection matrices are augmented based on original singular vectors. However, these methods suffer from inefficiency due to the densification of the update matrix and the application of the projection to all singular vectors. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel method for dynamically approximating the truncated SVD of a sparse and temporally evolving matrix. Our approach leverages sparsity in the orthogonalization process of augmented matrices and utilizes an extended decomposition to independently store projections in the column space of singular vectors. Numerical experiments demonstrate a remarkable efficiency improvement of an order of magnitude compared to previous methods. Remarkably, this improvement is achieved while maintaining a comparable precision to existing approaches.
