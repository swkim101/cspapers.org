Optimal Control of dynamic systems involving hybrid actions is a challenging task in robotics. To address this, we present a novel algorithm called Generalized Policy Iteration using Tensor Train (TTPI) that belongs to the class of Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). We use a low-rank tensor approximation technique called Tensor Train (TT) to approximate the state-value and advantage function which enables us to efficiently handle hybrid action space. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over previous baselines for some benchmark problems with hybrid action spaces. Additionally, the robustness and generalization of the policy for hybrid systems are showcased through a real-world robotics experiment involving a non-prehensile manipulation task.
