To achieve high-accuracy manipulation in the presence of unknown disturbances, we propose two novel efficient and robust motion control schemes for high-dimensional robot manipulators. Both controllers incorporate an unknown system dynamics estimator (USDE) to estimate disturbances without requiring acceleration signals and the inverse of inertia matrix. Then, based on the USDE framework, an adaptive-gain controller and a super-twisting sliding mode controller are designed to speed up the convergence of tracking errors and strengthen anti-perturbation ability. The former aims to enhance feedback portions through error-driven control gains, while the latter exploits finite-time convergence of discontinuous switching terms. We analyze the boundedness of control signals and the stability of the closed-loop system in theory, and conduct real hardware experiments on a robot manipulator with seven degrees of freedom (DoF). Experimental results verify the effectiveness and improved performance of the proposed controllers, and also show the feasibility of implementation on high-dimensional robots.
