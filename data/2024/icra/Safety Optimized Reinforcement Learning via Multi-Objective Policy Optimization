Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) refers to a class of techniques that aim to prevent RL algorithms from violating constraints in the process of decision-making and exploration during trial and error. In this paper, a novel model-free Safe RL algorithm, formulated based on the multi-objective policy optimization framework is introduced where the policy is optimized towards optimality and safety, simultaneously. The optimality is achieved by the environment reward function that is subsequently shaped using a safety critic. The advantage of the Safety Optimized RL (SORL) algorithm compared to the traditional Safe RL algorithms is that it omits the need to constrain the policy search space. This allows SORL to find a natural tradeoff between safety and optimality without compromising the performance in terms of either safety or optimality due to strict search space constraints. Through our theoretical analysis of SORL, we propose a condition for SORLâ€™s converged policy to guarantee safety and then use it to introduce an aggressiveness parameter that allows for fine-tuning the mentioned tradeoff. The experimental results obtained in seven different robotic environments indicate a considerable reduction in the number of safety violations along with higher, or competitive, policy returns, in comparison to six different state-of-the-art Safe RL methods. The results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed SORL algorithm in safety-critical applications.
