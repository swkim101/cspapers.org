Landing safety is a challenge heavily engaging the research community recently, due to the increasing interest in applications availed by aerial vehicles. In this paper, we propose a landing safety pipeline based on state of the art object detectors and OctoMap. First, a point cloud of surface obstacles is generated, which is then inserted in an OctoMap. The unoccupied areas are identified, thus resulting to a sum of safe landing points. Due to the low processing time achieved by state of the art object detectors and the efficient point cloud manipulation using OctoMap, it is feasible for our approach to deploy on low-weight embedded systems. The proposed pipeline has been evaluated in many simulation scenarios, varying in people density, number, and movement. Simulations were executed with an Nvidia Jetson Nano in the loop to confirm the pipelineâ€™s performance and robustness in a low computing power hardware. The experiments yielded promising results with a 87% success rate.
