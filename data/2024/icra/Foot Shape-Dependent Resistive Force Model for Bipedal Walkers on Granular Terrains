Legged robots have demonstrated high efficiency and effectiveness in unstructured and dynamic environments. However, it is still challenging for legged robots to achieve rapid and efficient locomotion on deformable, yielding substrates, such as granular terrains. We present an enhanced resistive force model for bipedal walkers on soft granular terrains by introducing effective intrusion depth correction. The enhanced force model captures fundamental kinetic results considering the robot foot shape, walking gait speed variation, and energy expense. The model is validated by extensive foot intrusion experiments with a bipedal robot. The results confirm the model accuracy on the given type of granular terrains. The model can be further integrated with the motion control of bipedal robotic walkers.
