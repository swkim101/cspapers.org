Bin picking is an important building block for many robotic systems, in logistics, production or in household use-cases. In recent years, machine learning methods for the prediction of 6-DoF grasps on diverse and unknown objects have shown promising progress. However, existing approaches only consider a single ground truth grasp orientation at a grasp location during training and therefore can only predict limited grasp orientations which leads to a reduced number of feasible grasps in bin picking with restricted reachability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning dense and diverse 6-DoF grasps for parallel-jaw grippers in robotic bin picking. We introduce a parameterized grasp distribution model based on Power-Spherical distributions that enables a training based on all possible ground truth samples. Thereby, we also consider the grasp uncertainty enhancing the model’s robustness to noisy inputs. As a result, given a single top-down view depth image, our model can generate diverse grasps with multiple collision-free grasp orientations. Experimental evaluations in simulation and on a real robotic bin picking setup demonstrate the model’s ability to generalize across various object categories achieving an object clearing rate of around 90% in simulation and real-world experiments. We also outperform state of the art approaches. Moreover, the proposed approach exhibits its usability in real robot experiments without any refinement steps, even when only trained on a synthetic dataset, due to the probabilistic grasp distribution modeling.
