Multi-robot systems have increasingly become instrumental in tackling coverage problems. However, the challenge of optimizing task efficiency without compromising task success still persists, particularly in expansive, unstructured scenarios with dense obstacles. This paper presents an innovative, decentralized Voronoi-based coverage control approach to reactively navigate these complexities while guaranteeing safety. This approach leverages the active sensing capabilities of multi-robot systems to supplement GIS (Geographic Information System), offering a more comprehensive and real-time understanding of environments like post-disaster. Based on point cloud data, which is inherently non-convex and unstructured, this method efficiently generates collision-free Voronoi regions using only local sensing information through spatial decomposition and spherical mirroring techniques. Then, deadlock-aware guided map integrated with a gradient-optimized, centroid Voronoi-based coverage control policy, is constructed to improve efficiency by avoiding exhaustive searches and local sensing pitfalls. The effectiveness of our algorithm has been validated through extensive numerical simulations in high-fidelity environments, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate, coverage ratio, and task execution time compared with others.
