Safety is a fundamental requirement of many robotic systems. Control barrier function (CBF)-based approaches have been proposed to guarantee the safety of robotic systems. However, the effectiveness of these approaches highly relies on the choice of CBFs. Inspired by the universal approximation power of neural networks, there is a growing trend toward representing CBFs using neural networks, leading to the notion of neural CBFs (NCBFs). Current NCBFs, however, are trained and deployed in benign environments, making them ineffective for scenarios where robotic systems experience sensor faults and attacks. In this paper, we study safety-critical control synthesis for robotic systems under sensor faults and attacks. Our main contribution is the development and synthesis of a new class of CBFs that we term fault tolerant neural control barrier function (FT-NCBF). We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for FT-NCBFs to guarantee safety, and develop a data-driven method to learn FT-NCBFs by minimizing a loss function constructed using the derived conditions. Using the learned FT-NCBF, we synthesize a control input and formally prove the safety guarantee provided by our approach. We demonstrate our proposed approach using two case studies: obstacle avoidance problem for an autonomous mobile robot and spacecraft rendezvous problem, with code available via https://github.com/HongchaoZhang-HZ/FTNCBF.
