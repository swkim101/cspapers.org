While surgical robots, such as the da Vinci Surgical System, have become prevalent in minimally invasive surgery, they are predominantly used by the human operator to directly teleoperate the tools. This paper aims to analyse the different methods of human robot shared control in the surgical domain. We propose a reinforcement learning algorithm, transverse generative adversarial imitation learning (tGAIL), which is employed to train the robot from the expert’s demonstration and show competitive generalization ability compared to inverse reinforcement learning and conventional GAIL. We then propose a priority-changing shared control method to effectively combine the surgeon and robot’s strengths by dynamically adjusting control priority based on the deviation distance. We show that using this method in a supervision framework boosts the performance of the human operator when completing the peg transfer task. By learning from the expert and collaborating with the human during the task, the intelligent agent can help to reduce operation time by 31.7% and the human input by 60.5% compared to direct teleoperation.
