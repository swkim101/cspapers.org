This paper explores the feasibility of employing EEG-based intention detection for real-time robot assistive control. We focus on predicting and distinguishing motor intentions of left/right arm movements by presenting: i) an offline data collection and training pipeline, used to train a classifier for left/right motion intention prediction, and ii) an online real-time prediction pipeline leveraging the trained classifier and integrated with an assistive robot. Central to our approach is a rich feature representation composed of the tangent space projection of time-windowed sample covariance matrices from EEG filtered signals and derivatives; allowing for a simple SVM classifier to achieve unprecedented accuracy and real-time performance. In pre-recorded real-time settings (160 Hz), a peak accuracy of 86.88% is achieved, surpassing prior works. In robot-in-the-loop settings, our system successfully detects intended motion solely from EEG data with 70% accuracy, triggering a robot to execute an assistive task. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed classifier.
