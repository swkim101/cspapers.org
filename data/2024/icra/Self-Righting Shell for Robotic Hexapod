Decimeter scale robots in human environments are small relative to obstacles they encounter, making them prone to flipping over and needing to self-right. We present a multifaceted shell that by its geometry alone enables the hexapedal robot MediumANT to passively self-right without the need for additional sensory feedback. We designed the shell by specifying the cross-sectional geometry in the yz and xy planes such that the robot returns to an upright position by rolling around the longitudinal (x) axis, and then tweaked the design to reduce the number of faces. We then attached the shell to the robot by modifying some of its chassis structural plates to extend to and support the shell. We evaluated the effectiveness of the shell in two experimental scenarios: passive righting – balancing the robot on each face of the shell before releasing the robot – and an intentional fall – walking the robot off a ledge at various approach angles. As intended by our design, the robot recovered the upright orientation from all starting faces in the passive righting test and righted itself and continued walking in all falling trials. This work presents an example of using biologically inspired simplicity to solve what would otherwise be a technically challenging problem.
