Collision is typically avoided in robot navigation for safety guarantee. However, when a robotâ€™s exteroceptive sensors fail, which means it becomes "blind", collision can actually be leveraged to improve localization performance. Our research demonstrates the informative nature of collisions in this context. Moreover, we show that a robot is able to navigate in a known environment with only proprioceptive sensors by actively colliding with its surroundings for more reliable localization. Firstly, we design a collision-based observation model, which is differentiable and can be easily applied to various estimators. Secondly, we integrate this model into a collision-aided localization framework and implement it in two widely used estimators, the Kalman filter and the particle filter. Thirdly, we propose an active collision path planning method, which effectively reduces localization uncertainty.
