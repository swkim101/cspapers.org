The synergic orchestration of the cognitive and psychological dimensions characterizes human intelligence. Accordingly, carefully designing this mechanism in artificial intelligence can be a successful strategy to increase human likeness in a robot, enhancing mutual understanding and building a more natural and intuitive interaction. For this purpose, the main contribution of this work is a psychological and cognitive architecture tailored for HRI based on the interplay between robotic personality and memory-based cognitive processes. Indeed, the artificial personality manifests itself not only in various aspects of the behavior but also within the action selection process, which is closely intertwined with personality-dependent hedonic experiences linked to memories. Within this paper, we propose a task- and platform-independent framework, evaluated in a multiparty collaborative scenario. Obtained results show that a robot connected to our proposed framework is perceived as a cognitive agent capable of manifesting perceivable and distinguishable personality traits.
