In response to the need for sustainable energy solutions, solar panels have gained significant traction. One way to increase the energy capture of solar systems is through solar tracking, a means of reorienting solar panels throughout the day in order to face the sun. The energy consumption increase that comes with solar tracking often far outweighs the amount of energy required to move the panel, which makes it a compelling strategy for improving solar systems. Unfortunately, while solar trackers are commonly used in large solar farms, they are rarely used on rooftops, an area where solar panels are commonly installed. This is for two primary reasons: (1) most commercially available solar trackers are too large to be installed on roofs and (2) even if traditional solar trackers were made in a more compact form-factor it would be difficult to densely lay them out on a roof without the trackers substantially shading each other. In order to address these issues, we introduce OriTrack, a small three-degree-of-freedom (3 DOF) solar tracker which reduces the area of its shadow by reducing its height as it tracks the sun. In this paper we discuss the design, manufacturing, and control of OriTrack. We then compare OriTrack to a flat reference panel, the solar energy solution commonly used on roofs today, and find that OriTrack demonstrates 23% increased energy production. This result suggests OriTrack could be used as a future solution for solar tracking on rooftops.
