Automated positioning systems play a pivotal role in micro-scale cell manipulation. In clinical intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, a motile sperm needs to be immobilized by glass micropipette tapping for subsequent surgical steps. The process requires accurate tracking of the target sperm and precise alignment between the sperm tail and the micropipette. Manual sperm immobilization suffers from inconsistent success rates, and current robotic systems developed for the task fail to comply with the standard clinical setup. Instead of using a motorized micromanipulator as in existing robotic systems, this paper presents an automated, compact three-dimensional positioning stage for sperm immobilization that can be seamlessly integrated into standard clinical platforms. Based on the analysis of the sperm head orientation, an adaptive tail tapping planning strategy is established to avoid the risk of touching the sperm head where DNA is contained. A visual servo controller equipped with a dynamic sperm motion observer is employed to achieve precise tracking and positioning of the target sperm three-dimensionally. Experimental results revealed the system achieved a success rate of 93.5% and a time cost of 5.5 s for automated sperm immobilization.
