Bowden cables serve as essential components in various mechanical systems, facilitating power transmission from remote actuators to specific destinations. The pretension of Bowden cables profoundly influences system performance, notably in terms of friction. This study investigates the effects of cable pretension and shape on friction and torque efficiency. A custom self-designed testbed, comprising integrated actuator units, pulleys, and a novel pretension mechanism connected by Bowden cables, is utilized to conduct experimental tests under varying parameters. This work adopts an integrated approach of experimentation, modeling, and validation, offering preliminary insights into the torque transmission characteristics of tendon driven actuator systems. Additionally, the precise model exhibits excellent conformity across a broad range of shapes and provides initial insights into hysteresis modeling attributable to cable material properties.
