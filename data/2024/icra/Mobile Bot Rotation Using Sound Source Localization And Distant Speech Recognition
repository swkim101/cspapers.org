In the last few years, mobile robots such as floor cleaners, assistive robots, and home telepresence have become an essential part of our day-to-day activities. In human-robot interaction, speech is the preferred way of communication, especially in indoor environments. This paper proposes a speech module to rotate the mobile robot. It has two components, namely, a distant automatic speech recognizer and a sound source localizer. To build distant speech recognizer, far-field speech data is collected at 1, 3, and 5-meters distances. The model performs well even at a 5-meters distance with a Word Error Rate of 40.38% and a Character Error Rate of 28.85%. The direction of arrival of the speech signal is computed from the 4-mic circular array microphone. The speech module is integrated with the Robot Operating System and physically demonstrated on Turtlebot3 Waffle Pi. It is observed that the speech recognizer and sound source localizer work well in the reverberant indoor environment with a small single-board computer.
