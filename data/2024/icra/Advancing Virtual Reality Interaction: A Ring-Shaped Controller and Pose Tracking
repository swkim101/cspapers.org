Ensuring robust tracking of controllers’ movement is critical for human-robot interaction in virtual reality (VR) scenarios. This paper proposes a robust tracking algorithm based on a novel wearable ring-shaped controller equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a light-emitting diode (LED). This novel controller design allows users to free up their hands for more immersive experiences. To track the controller’s motion accurately and robustly, we resort to various forms of visual measurements, including 6 DoF and 5 DoF pose measurements from hand gesture detection, as well as 3 DoF position measurement and 2 DoF image measurement derived from the LED. We theoretically analyze the performances of these observation models and propose an optimal observation model combination scheme. Moreover, the necessity and rationale of online estimating system gravity are illustrated. The effectiveness of our tracking method is validated through extensive experiments.
