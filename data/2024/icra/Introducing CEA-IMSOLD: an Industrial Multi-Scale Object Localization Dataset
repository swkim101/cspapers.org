We introduce the CEA Industrial Multi-Scale Object Localization Dataset (CEA-IMSOLD), a new BOP format dataset for 6-DoF object localization, crucial for robotics. This dataset aims to evaluate the current localization methods with respect to a new difficulty: large variations in observation distance and, consequently, large variations in image appearance. Compared to the other publicly available datasets, our dataset provides both images with objects small and completely visible in the image, and images where objects are observed close enough so they appear larger than the field of view of the camera. We also propose to consider the observation distance in the evaluation process and introduce new metrics to do so. Finally, our dataset contains a large variety of industrial objects, from small and simple objects such as bolts to sizable and complex ones such as large car parts. We provide baseline results and the dataset is made publicly available to support the community at https://cea-list.github.io/CEA-IMSOLD/.
