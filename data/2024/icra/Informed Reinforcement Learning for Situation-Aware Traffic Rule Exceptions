Reinforcement Learning is a highly active research field with promising advancements. In the field of autonomous driving, however, often very simple scenarios are being examined. Common approaches use non-interpretable control commands as the action space and unstructured reward designs, which are unsuitable for complex scenarios. In this work, we introduce Informed Reinforcement Learning, where a structured rulebook is integrated as a knowledge source. We learn trajectories and asses them with a situation-aware reward design, leading to a dynamic reward that allows the agent to learn situations that require controlled traffic rule exceptions. Our method is applicable to arbitrary RL models. We successfully demonstrate high completion rates of complex scenarios with recent model-based agents.
