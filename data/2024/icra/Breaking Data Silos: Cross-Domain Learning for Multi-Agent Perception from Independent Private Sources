The diverse agents in multi-agent perception systems may be from different companies. Each company might use the identical classic neural network architecture based encoder for feature extraction. However, the data source to train the various agents is independent and private in each company, leading to the Distribution Gap of different private data for training distinct agents in multi-agent perception system. The data silos by the above Distribution Gap could result in a significant performance decline in multi-agent perception. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the impact of the distribution gap on existing multi-agent perception systems. To break the data silos, we introduce the Feature Distribution-aware Aggregation (FDA) framework for cross-domain learning to mitigate the above Distribution Gap in multi-agent perception. FDA comprises two key components: Learnable Feature Compensation Module and Distribution-aware Statistical Consistency Module, both aimed at enhancing intermediate features to minimize the distribution gap among multi-agent features. Intensive experiments on the public OPV2V and V2XSet datasets underscore FDAâ€™s effectiveness in point cloud-based 3D object detection, presenting it as an invaluable augmentation to existing multi-agent perception systems.
