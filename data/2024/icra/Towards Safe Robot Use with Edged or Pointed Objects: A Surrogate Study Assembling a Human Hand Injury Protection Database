The use of pointed or edged tools or objects is one of the most challenging aspects of todayâ€™s application of physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). One reason for this is that the severity of harm caused by such edged or pointed impactors is less well studied than for blunt impactors. Consequently, the standards specify well-reasoned force and pressure thresholds for blunt impactors and advise avoiding any edges and corners in contacts. Nevertheless, pointed or edged impactor geometries cannot be completely ruled out in real pHRI applications. For example, to allow edged or pointed tools such as screwdrivers near human operators, the knowledge of injury severity needs to be extended so that robot integrators can perform well-reasoned, time-efficient risk assessments. In this paper, we provide the initial datasets on injury prevention for the human hand based on drop tests with surrogates for the human hand, namely pig claws and chicken drumsticks. We then demonstrate the ease and efficiency of robot use using the dataset for contact on two examples. Finally, our experiments provide a set of injuries that may also be expected for human subjects under certain robot mass-velocity constellations in collisions. To extend this work, testing on human samples and a collaborative effort from research institutes worldwide is needed to create a comprehensive human injury avoidance database for any pHRI scenario and thus for safe pHRI applications including edged and pointed geometries.
