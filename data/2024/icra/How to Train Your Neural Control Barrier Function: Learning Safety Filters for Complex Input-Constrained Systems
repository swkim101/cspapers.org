Control barrier functions (CBFs) have become popular as a safety filter to guarantee the safety of nonlinear dynamical systems for arbitrary inputs. However, it is difficult to construct functions that satisfy the CBF constraints for high relative degree systems with input constraints. To address these challenges, recent work has explored learning CBFs using neural networks via neural CBFs (NCBFs). However, such methods face difficulties when scaling to higher dimensional systems under input constraints. In this work, we first identify challenges that NCBFs face during training. Next, to address these challenges, we propose policy neural CBFs (PNCBFs), a method of constructing CBFs by learning the value function of a nominal policy, and show that the value function of the maximum-over-time cost is a CBF. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulation on a variety of systems ranging from toy linear systems to a jet aircraft with a 16-dimensional state space. Finally, we validate our approach on a two-agent quadcopter system on hardware under tight input constraints.
