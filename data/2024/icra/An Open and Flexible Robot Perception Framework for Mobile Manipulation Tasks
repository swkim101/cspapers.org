Over the last years, powerful methods for solving specific perception problems such as object detection, pose estimation or scene understanding have been developed. While performing mobile manipulation actions, a robot’s perception framework needs to execute a series of these methods in a specific sequence each time it receives a new perception task. Generating proficient combinations of vision methods to solve individual perception tasks remains a challenge, as the combination depends on the requirements of the task and the capabilities of the robot’s hardware.In this paper, we propose RoboKudo, an open-source knowledge-enabled perception framework that leverages the strengths of the Unstructured Information Management (UIM) principle and the flexibility of Behavior Trees to model task-specific perception processes. The framework can combine state-of-the-art computer vision methods to satisfy the requirements of each perception task and scales to different robot platforms. The generality and effectiveness of the framework are evaluated in real world experiments where it solves various perception tasks in the context of mobile manipulation actions in a household domain.
