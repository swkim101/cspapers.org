Tracking dynamic targets poses a significant challenge for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs). Existing methods often lack research on multi-disturbed conditions. To address this issue, we propose a trajectory-prediction-based dynamic tracking scheme, which includes target localization, trajectory prediction, and UGV control. Firstly, an estimation algorithm based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is employed to mitigate noise and estimate the absolute states of the target accurately. To enhance robustness, we present an Adaptive Trajectory Prediction (ATP) algorithm based on prediction anchors. In this method, a quantization standard for trajectory disturbance is designed for adaptive control. Subsequently, we iteratively solve prediction anchor points based on two motion models to robustly predict the target trajectory even in the presence of unknown disturbances. Finally, the Linear Time-Varying Model Predictive Control (LTV-MPC) is utilized in the UGV controller for dynamic tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that the ATP exhibits superior prediction robustness and accuracy in perturbed environments compared to other prediction algorithms. In addition, the proposed scheme effectively achieves dynamic tracking of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) by the UGV under multi-disturbed conditions. Specifically, when the target moves at a speed of 1.0 m/s, the UGV can maintain a tracking error within 0.346 m.
