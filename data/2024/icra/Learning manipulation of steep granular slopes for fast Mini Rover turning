Future planetary exploration missions will require reaching challenging regions such as craters and steep slopes. Such regions are ubiquitous and present science-rich targets potentially containing information regarding the planet’s internal structure. Steep slopes consisting of low-cohesion regolith are prone to flow downward under small disturbances, making it challenging for autonomous rovers to traverse. Moreover, the navigation trajectories of rovers are heavily limited by the terrain topology and future systems will need to maneuver on flowable surfaces without getting trapped, allowing them to further expand their reach and increase mission efficiency.In this work, we used a robophysical rover model and performed maneuvering experiments on a steep granular slope of poppy seeds to explore the rover’s turning capabilities. The rover is capable of lifting, sweeping, and spinning its wheels, allowing it to execute leg-like gait patterns. The high-dimensional actuation capabilities of the rover facilitate effective manipulation of the underlying granular surface. We used Bayesian Optimization (BO) to gain insight into successful turning gaits in high dimensional search space and found strategies such as differential wheel spinning and pivoting around a single sweeping wheel. We then used these insights to further fine-tune the turning gait, enabling the rover to turn nearly 90 degrees at just above 4 seconds with minimal downhill slip. Combining gait optimization and human-tuning approaches, we found that fast turning is empowered by creating anisotropic torques with the sweeping wheel.
