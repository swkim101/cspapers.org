Cleaning glass surfaces is a prevailing maintenance problem in high-rise buildings. In the traditional methods of cleaning windows, hanging on ropes poses significant occupational hazards to workers. Furthermore, most glass facades feature window frames to securely fasten the glass panels to the building structure, ensuring durability and elegance. In this context, existing robotic cleaning methods are limited by their capability to move-over window frames and need more flexibility to access tight corners and curved surfaces. This paper presents a novel reconfigurable glass cleaning robot called "WiBot" to address these limitations. WiBot is a kinematic chain comprising modular linkages with a prismatic joint and two revolute joints at each end. Each revolute joint has a suction unit that enables locomotion and adhesion. Window frames are detected using image processing with an onboard camera, and design optimizations were performed to improve the robotâ€™s capabilities. The prototype WiBot 1.0 was developed, and several experiments were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system focusing on robot motion, window frame detection and move-over mechanism. The results show that WiBot can overcome the limitations of existing window cleaning solutions. Finally, several promising research directions are mentioned involving the proposed reconfigurable robot architecture in cleaning operations.
