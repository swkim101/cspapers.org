In recent years, there has been a growing demand for robotic manipulators to perform tasks in various unstructured environments and situations requiring precision and force control. However, traditional robotic arms have limitations in fully leveraging their advantages in such scenarios. To address this demand, we have designed a cable-driven serpentine manipulator (CDSM) that combines force and precision motion control. This control method allows for precise manipulation of forces and torques at the end-effector, particularly in applications like electric vehicle charging and narrow-space exploration. It also enables independent control in multiple configurations. We achieve force-position hybrid control in task space, ensuring accurate control of end-effector force while achieving precise position control in other directions. Additionally, we implement joint angle closed-loop control in joint space to reduce the impact of cable elasticity deformation and friction on joint motion accuracy. Finally, servo control is applied at the lowest motor level. This paper investigates the modeling, sensing, and control of CDSM within a unified framework of hybrid motion/force control. Through experiments and simulations, we demonstrate the high accuracy and practicality of this control method in various scenarios.
