Image-goal navigation in unknown environments with sensor error is of considerable difficulty for autonomous robots. In this paper, we propose a drift-resisting topo-metric graph to map the environment and localize the robot using only relative poses. The error-sharing mechanism under this representation effectively reduces the impact of accumulated drifts commonly encountered in navigation tasks. A Reinforcement Learning based policy was proposed for sub-goal selection on this topo-metric graph, which improves navigation efficiency by handling task-driven features taking both image correlation and topological layout into account. We adopt a modular system design with this map representation and graph policy, leaving the low-level motion planning problems to classical controllers for better stability and generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve robust navigation performance in a variety of unknown environments and even 50% higher success rate over existing methods in complex environments with odometry drift.
