The Chiplet architecture has achieved great success in recent years. However, chiplet-based networks are significantly different from traditional networks, thus presenting new challenges in evaluation. On the one hand, on-chiplet and off-chiplet networks are tightly coupled; therefore, the entire heterogeneous network must be designed and evaluated jointly rather than separately. On the other hand, existing network simulators cannot efficiently evaluate large-scale chiplet-based networks with cycle-accurate accuracy.

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the Chiplet Network Simulator (CNSim), a cycle-accurate packet-parallel simulator supporting efficient simulation for large-scale chiplet-based (shared-memory) networks. In CNSim, a packet-centric simulation architecture and an atomic-based hyper-threading mechanism are adopted, accelerating simulation speed by 11× ~ 14× compared with existing cycle-accurate simulators. Besides, we implement the heterogeneous router/link microarchitecture and many other features, including hierarchical topologies, adaptive routing, and real workload traces integration. Based on CNSim, two typical chiplet-based networks, which cannot be efficiently simulated by existing simulators, are systematically evaluated. The advantages and limitations of chiplet-based networks are revealed through systematical cycle-accurate simulations. The simulator and evaluation framework are open-sourced to the community.
