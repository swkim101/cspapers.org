Cache management is a critical aspect of computer architecture, encompassing techniques such as cache replacement, bypassing, and prefetching. Existing research has often focused on individual techniques, overlooking the potential benefits of joint optimization. Moreover, many of these approaches rely on static and intuition-driven policies, limiting their performance under complex and dynamic workloads. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CHROME, a novel concurrencyaware cache management framework. CHROME takes a holistic approach by seamlessly integrating intelligent cache replacement and bypassing with pattern-based prefetching. By leveraging online reinforcement learning, CHROME dynamically adapts cache decisions based on multiple program features and applies a reward for each decision that considers the accuracy of the action and the system-level feedback information. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that CHROME outperforms current state-of-the-art schemes, exhibiting significant improvements in cache management. Notably, CHROME achieves a remarkable performance boost of up to 13.7% over the traditional LRU method in multi-core systems with only modest overhead.
