To enable high-performance, programmable, and resilient distributed systems, Distributed Data Persistency (DDP) models provide specific data consistency and persistency guarantees. Since these models target leaderless systems (i.e., systems where any node can initiate requests), they deliver high performance and are scalable. However, they are also more complex. In this paper, we develop detailed distributed algorithms for DDP models. They support Linearizable consistency with five different types of persistency. We call these algorithms MINOSBaseline (MINOS-B) and evaluate them on a 5-node distributed machine. Additionally, to improve performance, we also redesign the algorithms to offload them to a new SmartNIC architecture. The resulting system is called MINOS-Offload (MINOS-O). The MINOS-O SmartNIC introduces optimizations such as selective data coherence in hardware between host and SmartNIC, message batching, and message broadcasting. Our evaluation shows that offloading is very beneficial. It substantially reduces request latency and increases request throughput for various workloads and number of nodes. For example, compared to MINOS-B, MINOS-O reduces the average end-to-end latency of two microservice functions by 35%.
