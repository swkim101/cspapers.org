Threshold signatures, notably ECDSA, are fundamental for securing decentralized applications. Their non-linear structure poses challenges in distributed signing, often tackled by pairwise multiplicative-to-additive share conversion, leading to O(n) communication and O(n2) verification costs for each of n signers. Moreover, most schemes lack robustness, necessitating a complete restart upon fault. A pioneering work by Wong et al. (NDSS '23) still requires rolling back to the preceding round to resume signing after another round to convince all other signers.
