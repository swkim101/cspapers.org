In the last decade, a series of papers were published on using static analysis to detect cryptographic API misuse. In each paper, apps are checked against a set of rules to see if violations exist. A common theme among these papers is that rule violations are plentiful, often at the scale of thousands. Interestingly, while much effort went into tackling false negatives, curiously, not much has been said on (1) whether the misuse alarms are indeed correct and meaningful, and (2) what can future work improve upon apart from finding more misuses.
