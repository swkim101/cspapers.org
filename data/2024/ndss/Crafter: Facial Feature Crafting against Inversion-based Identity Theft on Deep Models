With the increased capabilities at the edge (e.g., mobile device)  and more stringent privacy requirement, it becomes a recent trend for deep learning-enabled applications to pre-process sensitive raw data at the edge and transmit the features to the backend cloud for further processing. A typical application is to run machine learning (ML) services on facial images collected from different individuals. To prevent identity theft, conventional methods commonly rely on an adversarial game-based approach to shed the identity information from the feature. However, such methods can not defend against adaptive attacks, in which an attacker takes a countermove against a known defence strategy.
