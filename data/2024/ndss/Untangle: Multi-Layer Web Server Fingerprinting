Web server fingerprinting is a common activity in vulnerability management and security testing, with network scanners offering the capability for over two decades. All known fingerprinting techniques are designed for probing a single, isolated web server. However, the modern Internet is made up of complex layered architectures, where chains of CDNs, reverse proxies, and cloud services front origin servers. That renders existing fingerprinting tools and techniques utterly ineffective.
