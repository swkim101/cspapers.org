Large language models (LLMs), such as chatbots, have made significant strides in various fields but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which aim to elicit inappropriate responses. Despite efforts to identify these weaknesses, current strategies are ineffective against mainstream LLM chatbots, mainly due to undisclosed defensive measures by service providers. Our paper introduces MASTERKEY, a framework exploring the dynamics of jailbreak attacks and countermeasures. We present a novel method based on time-based characteristics to dissect LLM chatbot defenses. This technique, inspired by time-based SQL injection, uncovers the workings of these defenses and demonstrates a proof-of-concept attack on several LLM chatbots.
