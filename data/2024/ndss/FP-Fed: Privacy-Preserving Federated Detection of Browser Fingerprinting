Browser fingerprinting often provides an attractive alternative to third-party cookies for tracking users across the web. In fact, the increasing restrictions on third-party cookies placed by common web browsers and recent regulations like the GDPR may accelerate the transition.

However, most – if not all – of those techniques rely on 1) centralized web crawls and/or 2) computationally-intensive operations to extract and process signals (e.g., information-flow and static analysis).
