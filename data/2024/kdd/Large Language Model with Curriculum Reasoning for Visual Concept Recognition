Visual concept recognition aims to capture the basic attributes of an image and reason about the relationships among them to determine whether the image satisfies a certain concept, and has been widely used in various tasks such as human action recognition and image risk warning. Most existing works adopt deep neural networks for visual concept recognition, which are black-box and incompre-hensible to humans, thus making them unacceptable for sensitive domains such as prohibited event detection and risk early warning etc. To address this issue, we propose to combine large language model (LLM) with explainable symbolic reasoning via curriculum reweighting to increase the interpretability and accuracy of visual concept recognition in this paper. However, realizing this goal is challenging given that i) the performance of symbolic representations are limited by the lack of annotated reasoning symbols and rules for most tasks, and ii) the LLMs may suffer from knowlege hallucination and dynamic open environment. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose CurLLM-Reasoner, a curriculum reasoning method based on symbolic reasoning and large language model for visual concept recognition. Specifically, we propose a novel rule enhancement module with a tool library, which fully leverage the reasoning capability of large language models and can generate human-understandable rules without any annotation. We further propose a curriculum data resampling methodology to help the large language model accurately extract from easy to complex rules at different reasoning stages. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CurLLM-Reasoner can achieve the
