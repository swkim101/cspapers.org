The quest to identify local dense communities closely connected to predetermined seed nodes is vital across numerous applications. Given the seed nodes 𝑅 , the R-subgraph density of a subgraph 𝑆 is defined as traditional graph density of 𝑆 with penalties on the nodes in 𝑆 \ 𝑅 . The state-of-the-art (SOTA) anchored densest subgraph model, which is based on R-subgraph density, is designed to address the community search problem. However, it often struggles to efficiently uncover truly dense communities. To eliminate this issue, we propose a novel NR-subgraph density metric, a nuanced measure that identifies communities intimately linked to seed nodes and also exhibiting overall high graph density. We redefine the anchored densest subgraph search problem through the lens of NR-subgraph density and cast it as a Linear Programming (LP) problem. This allows us to transition into a dual problem, tapping into the efficiency and effectiveness of convex programming-based iterative algorithm. To solve this redefined problem, we propose two algorithms: FDP , an iterative method that swiftly attains near-optimal solutions, and FDPE , an exact approach that ensures full convergence. We perform extensive experiments on 12 real-world networks. The results show that our proposed algorithms not only outperform the SOTA meth-ods by 3.6~14.1 times in terms of running time, but also produce subgraphs with superior internal quality.
