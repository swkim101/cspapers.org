Temporal graph representation learning has drawn considerable attention in recent years. Most existing works mainly focus on modeling local structural dependencies of temporal graphs. However, underestimating the inherent global structural role information in many real-world temporal graphs inevitably leads to sub-optimal graph representations. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel R ole-based T emporal G raph C onvolution N etwork ( RTGCN ) that fully leverages the global structural role information in temporal graphs. Specifically, RTGCN can effectively capture the static global structural roles by using hypergraph convolution neural networks. To capture the evolution of nodesâ€™ structural roles, we further de-sign structural role-based gated recurrent units. Finally, we integrate structural role proximity in our objective function to preserve global structural similarity, further promoting temporal graph representation learning. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that RTGCN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
