Data analytics is a core part of modern decision making, especially in public policy. However, there exists a tension between data privacy and otherwise socially beneficial analytics when data sources contain personal information. We design Synq, a system that supports analytics over encrypted data while accounting for the usability considerations institutions may have when conducting studies that affect public policy. We specifically use an application-centric approach and model Synqâ€™s design requirements from a large-scale series of studies conducted on the opioid epidemic in Massachusetts. We systematize the design considerations of the public policy context and demonstrate how the combination of design considerations that Synq addresses is novel through a survey of the literature. We then present our protocol which combines structured encryption, somewhat homomorphic encryption, and oblivious pseudorandom functions to support a complex query language that includes filtering (retrieving rows by attribute/value pairs), linking (merging rows from different tables that represent the same individual) and aggregate functions (sum, count, average, variance, regression). We formally express the security of our protocol and show that Synq is efficient in practice while satisfying usability considerations that are critical to deployment in the setting of public policy studies.
