Zero-knowledge range proofs play a critical role in confidential transactions (CT) on blockchain systems. They are used to prove the non-negativity of committed transaction payments without disclosing the exact values. Logarithmicsized range proofs with transparent setups, e.g., Bulletproofs, which aim to prove a committed value lies in the range [0, 2 -1] where is the bit length of the range, have gained growing popularity for communication-critical blockchain systems as they increase scalability by allowing a block to accommodate more transactions. In this paper, we propose SwiftRange, a new type of logarithmic-sized zero-knowledge range argument with a transparent setup in the discrete logarithm setting. Our argument can be a drop-in replacement for range proofs in blockchain-based confidential transactions. Compared with Bulletproofs, our argument has higher computational efficiency and lower round complexity while incurring comparable communication overheads for CT-friendly ranges, where N ∈ {32, 64}. Specifically, a single SwiftRange achieves 1.73× and 1.37× proving efficiency with no more than 1.1× communication costs for both ranges, respectively. More importantly, our argument is doubly efficient in verification efficiency. Furthermore, our argument has a smaller size when N ≤ 16, making it competitive for many other communication-critical applications. Our argument supports the aggregation of multiple single arguments for greater efficiency in communication and verification. Finally, we benchmarked our argument against the state-of-the-art range proofs to demonstrate its practicality.
