We propose a novel mechanism of defining data structures using intrinsic definitions that avoids recursion and instead utilizes monadic maps satisfying local conditions. We show that intrinsic definitions are a powerful mechanism that can capture a variety of data structures naturally. We show that they also enable a predictable verification methodology that allows engineers to write ghost code to update monadic maps and perform verification using reduction to decidable logics. We evaluate our methodology using Boogie and prove a suite of data structure manipulating programs correct.
