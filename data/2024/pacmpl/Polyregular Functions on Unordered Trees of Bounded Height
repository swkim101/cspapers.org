We consider injective first-order interpretations that input and output trees of bounded height. The corresponding functions have polynomial output size, since a first-order interpretation can use a k-tuple of input nodes to represent a single output node. We prove that the equivalence problem for such functions is decidable, i.e.â€„given two such interpretations, one can decide whether, for every input tree, the two output trees are isomorphic. We also give a calculus of typed functions and combinators which derives exactly injective first-order interpretations for unordered trees of bounded height. The calculus is based on a type system, where the type constructors are products, coproducts and a monad of multisets. Thanks to our results about tree-to-tree interpretations, the equivalence problem is decidable for this calculus. As an application, we show that the equivalence problem is decidable for first-order interpretations between classes of graphs that have bounded tree-depth. In all cases studied in this paper, first-order logic and MSO have the same expressive power, and hence all results apply also to MSO interpretations.
