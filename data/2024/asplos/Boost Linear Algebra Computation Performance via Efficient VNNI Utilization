Intel’s Vector Neural Network Instruction (VNNI) provides higher efficiency on calculating dense linear algebra (DLA) computations than conventional SIMD instructions. However, existing auto-vectorizers frequently deliver suboptimal utilization of VNNI by either failing to recognize VNNI’s unique computation pattern at the innermost loops/basic blocks, or producing inferior code through constrained and rudimentary peephole optimizations/pattern matching techniques. Auto-tuning frameworks might generate proficient code but are hampered by the necessity for sophisticated pattern templates and extensive search processes. This paper introduces a novel compilation methodology that generates high-performance VNNI-enabled code. By leveraging DLA’s salient characteristics to identify VNNI’s utilization opportunities, it proceeds to pinpoint the most effective strategies for feeding VNNI’s inputs and hinding VNNI’s execution latency via efficient memory access and register/cache reuse and exploited instruction-level parallelism. A tailored static cost analysis model guides this exploration, determining critical parameters for effective code transformation and generation. The evaluation on DLA and DNN workloads show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art industrial compilers and research works.
