With the emergence of chiplet technology, the scale of IC packaging design has been steadily increasing, making the utilization of traditional design rule checking (DRC) methods more time-consuming. In this paper, we propose PDRC, a package-level design rule checker for non-manhattan geometry with GPU acceleration. PDRC employs hierarchical interval lists within an iterative parallel sweepline framework to implement the geometric intersection algorithm, thereby finishing design rule checking tasks. Experimental results have demonstrated 30 - 50 times speedup achieved by PDRC compared with two CPU-based checkers
