Control channels on microfluidic large-scale integration (mLSI) chips are prone to blockage and leakage defects. In this work, we propose a built-in self-test (BIST) method that drastically improves the test efficiency. Given 𝑛 to-be-tested control channels, we reduced the number of test patterns for blockage and leakage tests from ⌈ 𝑛 2 ⌉ to 1, and from ⌈ log 2 ( 𝑛 + 1 )⌉ to ⌈ log 2 ( 𝜒 ( 𝐺 ) + 1 )⌉ , respectively, where 𝜒 ( 𝐺 ) denotes the vertex chromatic number of a graph 𝐺 consisting of 𝑛 vertices. We fabricated our design and demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of our method.
