The ever-expanding scale of integrated circuits has brought about a significant rise in the design risks associated with radiation-resistant integrated circuit chips. Traditional single-particle experimental methods, with their iterative design approach, are increasingly ill-suited for the challenges posed by large-scale integrated circuits. In response, this article introduces a novel sensitivity-aware single-particle radiation effects simulation framework tailored for System-on-Chip platforms. Based on SVM algorithm we have implemented fast finding and classification of sensitive circuit nodes. Additionally, the methodology automates soft error analysis across the entire software stack. The study includes practical experiments focusing on RISC-V architecture, encompassing core components, buses, and memory systems. It culminates in the establishment of databases for Single Event Upsets (SEU) and Single Event Transients (SET), showcasing the practical efficacy of the proposed methodology in addressing radiation-induced challenges at the scale of contemporary integrated circuits. Experimental results have shown up to 12.78X speed-up on the basis of achieving 94.58% accuracy.
