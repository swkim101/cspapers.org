Environmental sustainability is crucial for Integrated Circuits (ICs) across their lifecycle, particularly in manufacturing and use. Meanwhile, ICs using 3D/2.5D integration technologies have emerged as promising solutions to meet the growing demands for computational power. However, there is a distinct lack of carbon modeling tools for 3D/2.5D ICs. Addressing this, we propose 3D-Carbon, an analytical carbon modeling tool designed to quantify the carbon emissions of 3D/2.5D ICs throughout their life cycle. 3D-Carbon factors in both potential savings and overheads from advanced integration technologies, considering practical deployment constraints like bandwidth. We validate 3D-Carbon's accuracy against established baselines and illustrate its utility through case studies in autonomous vehicles. We believe that 3D-Carbon lays the initial foundation for future innovations in developing environmentally sustainable 3D/2.5D ICs.
