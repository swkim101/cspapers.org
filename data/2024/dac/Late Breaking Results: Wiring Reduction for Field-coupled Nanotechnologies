The emergence of Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) as a green and atomically-sized post-CMOS technology introduces a unique challenge for the development of physical design methods: unlike conventional computing, wire segments in FCN entail the same area and delay costs as standard gates. Hence, it is imperative to reconsider physical design strategies tailored for FCN to effectively address this distinctive characteristic. This paper unveils a recent breakthrough in minimizing the number of wire segments by an average of 20 . 13%, which, due to the high cost associated with wires, also leads to an average decrease of 34 . 10% in overall area and 19 . 84% in critical path length. Furthermore, unlike existing post-layout optimization algorithms, the proposed method maintains scalability even for layouts encompassing millions of tiles.
