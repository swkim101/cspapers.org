The popularity of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) both in industry and academia owes credit to their flexible data model, suitable for data integration from multiple sources. Several KG-based applications such as trust assessment or view maintenance on dynamic data rely on the ability to compute provenance explanations for query results. The how-provenance of a query result is an expression that encodes the records (triples or facts) that explain its inclusion in the result set. This article proposes NPCS, a Native Provenance Computation approach for SPARQL queries. NPCS annotates query results with their how-provenance. By building upon spm-provenance semirings, NPCS supports both monotonic and non-monotonic SPARQL queries. Thanks to its reliance on query rewriting techniques, the approach is directly applicable to already deployed SPARQL engines using different reification schemes - including RDF-star. Our experimental evaluation on two popular SPARQL engines (GraphDB and Stardog) shows that our novel query rewriting brings a significant runtime improvement over existing query rewriting solutions, scaling to RDF graphs with billions of triples.
