The results of information retrieval (IR) are usually presented in the form of a ranking list of candidate documents, such as web search for humans and retrieval-augmented generation for large language models (LLMs). List-aware retrieval aims to capture the list-level contextual features to return a better list, mainly including reranking and truncation. Reranking finely re-scores the documents in the list. Truncation dynamically determines the cut-off point of the ranked list to achieve the trade-off between overall relevance and avoiding misinformation from irrelevant documents. Previous studies treat them as two separate tasks and model them separately. However, the separation is not optimal. First, it is hard to share the contextual information of the ranking list between the two tasks. Second, the separate pipeline usually meets the error accumulation problem, where the small error from the reranking stage can largely affect the truncation stage. To solve these problems, we propose a Reranking-Truncation joint model (GenRT) that can perform the two tasks concurrently. GenRT integrates reranking and truncation via a generative paradigm based on an encoder-decoder architecture with novel loss functions for joint optimization to learn both tasks. Sharing parameters by the joint model is conducive to making full use of the common modeling information of the two tasks. Besides, the two tasks are performed concurrently and co-optimized to solve the error accumulation problem between separate stages. Experiments on public learning-to-rank benchmarks and open-domain Q&A tasks show that our method achieves SOTA performance on both reranking and truncation tasks for web search and retrieval-augmented LLMs.
