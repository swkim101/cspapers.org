The vanilla Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) uses a low-pass filter to extract low-frequency signals from graph topology, which may lead to the over-smoothing problem when GCN goes deep. To this end, various methods have been proposed to create an adaptive filter by incorporating an extra filter (e.g., a high-pass filter) extracted from the graph topology. However, these methods heavily rely on topological information and ignore the node attribute space, which severely sacrifices the expressive power of the deep GCNs, especially when dealing with disassortative graphs. In this paper, we propose a cross-space adaptive filter, called CSF, to produce the adaptive-frequency information extracted from both the topology and attribute spaces. Specifically, we first derive a tailored attribute-based high-pass filter that can be interpreted theoretically as a minimizer for semi-supervised kernel ridge regression. Then, we cast the topology-based low-pass filter as a Mercer's kernel within the context of GCNs. This serves as a foundation for combining it with the attribute-based filter to capture the adaptive-frequency information. Finally, we derive the cross-space filter via an effective multiple-kernel learning strategy, which unifies the attribute-based high-pass filter and the topology-based low-pass filter. This helps to address the over-smoothing problem while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSF not only successfully alleviates the over-smoothing problem but also promotes the effectiveness of the node classification task.
