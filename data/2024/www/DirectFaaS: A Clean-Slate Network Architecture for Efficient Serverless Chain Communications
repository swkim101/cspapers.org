Serverless computing, also known as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), triggers web applications in the form of function chains. It uses a central orchestrator to route all requests from end-users and internal functions. Such architecture simplifies application deployment for developers. However, the convenient centralized network architecture compromises the efficiency of function chain communications. Specifically, (i) a centralized API gateway assists in routing requests between functions. This indirect routing scheme raises invocation latency. (ii) The control flow for invoking functions and the data flow for passing function data packets are both forwarded by the API gateway. This results in the API gateway consuming a significant amount of resources. (iii) All data packets of internal function communications go through the same API gateway. This expands the additional attack surface in multi-tenant scenarios. In this paper, we propose DirectFaaS, a clean-slate network architecture to improve the function chain communication performance. By separating coupled control flow and data flow, DirectFaaS releases the API gateway from heavy traffic forwarding, reducing its resource consumption. For this goal, DirectFaaS exploits the network control capabilities of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to establish direct data forwarding channels to accelerate function chain invocations. In addition, the data flow constrained by fine-grained network policies consolidates multi-tenant traffic security. We implement the DirectFaaS prototype on the popular OpenFaaS platform. Evaluations under real-world serverless applications show that DirectFaaS achieves a reduction in application execution time by up to 30.9% and CPU consumption by up to 30.1% compared to the current architecture.
