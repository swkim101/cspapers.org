Recommender systems (RSs) have gained widespread applications across various domains owing to the superior ability to capture users' interests. However, the complexity and nuanced nature of users' interests, which span a wide range of diversity, pose a significant challenge in delivering fair recommendations. In practice, user preferences vary significantly; some users show a clear preference toward certain item categories, while others have a broad interest in diverse ones. Even though it is expected that all users should receive high-quality recommendations, the effectiveness of RSs in catering to this disparate interest diversity remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate whether users with varied levels of interest diversity are treated fairly. Our empirical experiments reveal an inherent disparity: users with broader interests often receive lower-quality recommendations. To mitigate this, we propose a multi-interest framework that uses multiple (virtual) interest embeddings rather than single ones to represent users. Specifically, the framework consists of stacked multi-interest representation layers, which include an interest embedding generator that derives virtual interests from shared parameters, and a center embedding aggregator that facilitates multi-hop aggregation. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in achieving better trade-off between fairness and utility across various datasets and backbones.
