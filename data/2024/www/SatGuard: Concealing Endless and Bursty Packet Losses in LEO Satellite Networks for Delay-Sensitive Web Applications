Delay-sensitive Web services are crucial applications in emerging low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks (LSNs). However, our real-world measurement study based on SpaceX's Starlink, the most widely used commercial LSN today, reveals that the endless and bursty packet losses over unstable LEO satellite links impose significant challenges on guaranteeing the quality of experience (QoE) of Web applications. We propose SatGuard, a distributed in-orbit loss recovery mechanism that can reduce user-perceived delay by completely concealing packet losses in the unstable and lossy LSN environment from endpoints. Specifically, SatGuard adopts a series of techniques to: (i) correctly migrate on-board packet buffer to support link-local retransmission under LEO dynamics; (ii) efficiently detect packet losses on satellite links; and (iii) ensure packet ordering for endpoints. We implement a SatGuard prototype, and conduct extensive trace-driven evaluations guided by public constellation information and real-world measurements. Our experiments demonstrate that, in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches, SatGuard can significantly improve Web-based QoE, by reducing: (i) up to 48.3% of page load time for Web browsing; and (ii) up to 57.4% end-to-end communication delay for WebRTC.
