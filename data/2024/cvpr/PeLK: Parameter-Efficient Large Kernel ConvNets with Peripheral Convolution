Recently, some large kernel convnets strike back with appealing performance and efficiency. However, given the square complexity of convolution, scaling up kernels can bring about an enormous amount of parameters and the proliferated parameters can induce severe optimization problem. Due to these issues, current CNNs compromise to scale up to 51 × 51 in the form of stripe convolution (i.e., 51 ×5 + 5 ×51) and start to saturate as the kernel size continues growing. In this paper, we delve into addressing these vital issues and explore whether we can continue scaling up kernels for more performance gains. Inspired by human vision, we propose a human-like peripheral convolution that efficiently reduces over 90% parameter count of dense grid convolution through parameter sharing, and manage to scale up kernel size to extremely large. Our peripheral convolution behaves highly similar to human, reducing the complexity of convolution from O(K2) to O(logK) without backfiring performance. Built on this, we propose Parameter-efficient Large Kernel Network (PeLK). Our PeLK outperforms modern vision Transformers and ConvNet architectures like Swin, ConvNeXt, RepLKNet and SLaK on various vision tasks including ImageNet classification, semantic segmentation on ADE20K and object detection on MS COCO. For the first time, we successfully scale up the kernel size of CNNs to an unprecedented 101 × 101 and demonstrate consistent improvements.
