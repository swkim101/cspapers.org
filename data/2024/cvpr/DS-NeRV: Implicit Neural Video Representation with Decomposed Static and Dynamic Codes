Implicit neural representations for video (NeRV) have recently become a novel way for high-quality video representation. However, existing works employ a single network to represent the entire video, which implicitly con-fuse static and dynamic information. This leads to an inability to effectively compress the redundant static information and lack the explicitly modeling of global temporal-coherent dynamic details. To solve above problems, we propose DS-NeRV, which decomposes videos into sparse learnable static codes and dynamic codes without the need for explicit optical flow or residual supervision. By setting different sampling rates for two codes and applying weighted sum and interpolation sampling methods, DS-NeRV efficiently utilizes redundant static information while maintaining high-frequency details. Additionally, we design a cross-channel attention-based (CCA) fusion module to efficiently fuse these two codes for frame decoding. Our approach achieves a high quality reconstruction of 31.2 PSNR with only 0.35M parameters thanks to separate static and dynamic codes representation and outperforms existing NeRV methods in many downstream tasks.
