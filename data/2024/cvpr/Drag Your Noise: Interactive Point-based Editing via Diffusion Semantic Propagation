Point-based interactive editing serves as an essential tool to complement the controllability of existing generative mod-els. A concurrent work, DragD iffus ion, updates the diffusion latent map in response to user inputs, causing global latent map alterations. This results in imprecise preservation of the original content and unsuccessful editing due to gradient vanishing. In contrast, we present DragNoise, offering ro-bust and accelerated editing without retracing the latent map. The core rationale of DragNoise lies in utilizing the predicted noise output of each U-Net as a semantic editor. This approach is grounded in two critical observations: firstly, the bottleneck features of U-Net inherently possess semantically rich features ideal for interactive editing; secondly, high-level semantics, established early in the denoising process, show minimal variation in subsequent stages. Leveraging these insights, DragNoise edits diffusion semantics in a sin-gle denoising step and efficiently propagates these changes, ensuring stability and efficiency in diffusion editing. Compar-ative experiments reveal that DragNoise achieves superior control and semantic retention, reducing the optimization time by over 50% compared to DragDiffusion.
