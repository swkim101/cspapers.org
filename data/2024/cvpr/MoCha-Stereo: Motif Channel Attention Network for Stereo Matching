Learning-based stereo matching techniques have made significant progress. However, existing methods inevitably lose geometrical structure information during the feature channel generation process, resulting in edge detail mis-matches. In this paper, the Motif Channel Attention Stereo Matching Network (MoCha-Stereo) is designed to address this problem. We provide the Motif Channel Correlation Volume (MCCV) to determine more accurate edge matching costs. MCCV is achieved by projecting motif channels, which capture common geometric structures in feature channels, onto feature maps and cost volumes. In addition, edge variations in the reconstruction error map also affect details matching, we propose the Reconstruction Error Motif Penalty (REMP) module to further refine the full-resolution disparity estimation. REMP integrates the frequency information of typical channel features from the re-construction error. MoCha-Stereo ranks 1st on the KITTI-2015 and KITTI-2012 Reflective leaderboards. Our structure also shows excellent performance in Multi- View Stereo.
