We describe a method for recovering the irradiance underlying a collection of images corrupted by atmospheric turbulence. Since supervised data is often technically im-possible to obtain, assumptions and biases have to be im-posed to solve this inverse problem, and we choose to model them explicitly. Rather than initializing a latent irradiance (“template”) by heuristics to estimate deformation, we se-lect one of the images as a reference, and model the de-formation in this image by the aggregation of the optical flow from it to other images, exploiting a prior imposed by Central Limit Theorem. Then with a novel flow inversion module, the model registers each image TO the template but WITHOUT the template, avoiding artifacts related to poor template initialization. To illustrate the robustness of the method, we simply (i) select the first frame as the ref-erence and (ii) use the simplest optical flow to estimate the warpings, yet the improvement in registration is decisive in the final reconstruction, as we achieve state-of-the-art per-formance despite its simplicity. The method establishes a strong baseline that can be further improved by integrating it seamlessly into more sophisticated pipelines, or with domain-specific methods if so desired.
