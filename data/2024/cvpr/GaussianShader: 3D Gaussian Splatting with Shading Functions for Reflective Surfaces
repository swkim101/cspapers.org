The advent of neural 3D Gaussians [21] has recently brought about a revolution in the field of neural rendering, facilitating the generation of high-quality renderings at real-time speeds. However, the explicit and discrete repre-sentation encounters challenges when applied to scenes fea-turing reflective surfaces. In this paper, we present Gaus-sian Shader, a novel method that applies a simplified shading function on 3D Gaussians to enhance the neural ren-dering in scenes with reflective surfaces while preserving the training and rendering efficiency. The main challenge in applying the shading function lies in the accurate nor-mal estimation on discrete 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we proposed a novel normal estimation framework based on the shortest axis directions of 3D Gaussians with a deli-cately designed loss to make the consistency between the normals and the geometries of Gaussian spheres. Experiments show that GaussianShader strikes a commendable balance between efficiency and visual quality. Our method surpasses Gaussian Splatting [21] in PSNR on specular object datasets, exhibiting an improvement of 1.57dB. When compared to prior works handling reflective surfaces, such as Ref-NeRF [45], our optimization time is significantly accelerated (23h vs. 0.58h).
