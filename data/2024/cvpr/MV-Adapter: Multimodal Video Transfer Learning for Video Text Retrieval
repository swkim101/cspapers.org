State-of-the-art video-text retrieval (VTR) methods typically involve fully fine-tuning a pre-trained model (e.g. CLIP) on specific datasets. However, this can result in significant storage costs in practical applications as a separate model per task must be stored. To address this issue, we present our pioneering work that enables parameter-efficient VTR using a pre-trained model, with only a small number of tunable parameters during training. Towards this goal, we propose a new method dubbed Multimodal Video Adapter (MV-Adapter) for efficiently transferring the knowledge in the pre-trained CLIP from image-text to video-text. Specifically, MV-Adapter utilizes bottleneck structures in both video and text branches, along with two novel components. The first is a Temporal Adaptation Module that is incorporated in the video branch to introduce global and local temporal contexts. We also train weights calibrations to adjust to dynamic variations across frames. The second is Cross Modality Tying that generates weights for video/text branches through sharing cross modality factors, for better aligning between modalities. Thanks to above innovations, MV-Adapter can achieve comparable or better performance than standard full fine-tuning with negligible parameters overhead. Notably, MV-Adapter consistently outperforms various competing methods in V2T/T2V tasks with large margins on five widely used VTR benchmarks (MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, DiDemo, and ActivityNet). Codes will be released.
