State-of-the-art man-made shape generative models usually adopt established generative models under a suitable implicit shape representation. A common theme is to perform distribution alignment, which does not explicitly model important shape priors. As a result, many synthetic shapes are not connected. Other synthetic shapes present problems of physical stability and geometric feasibility. This paper introduces a novel latent diffusion shape-generative model regularized by a quality checker that outputs a score of a latent code. The scoring function employs a learned function that provides a geometric feasibility score and a deterministic procedure to quantify a physical stability score. The key to our approach is a new diffusion procedure that combines the discrete empirical data distribution and a continuous distribution induced by the quality checker. We introduce a principled approach to determine the trade-off parameters for learning the denoising network at different noise levels. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art shape generations quantitatively and qualitatively on ShapeNet-v2.
