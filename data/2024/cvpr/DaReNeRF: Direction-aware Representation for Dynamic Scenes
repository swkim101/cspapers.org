Addressing the intricate challenge of modeling and re-rendering dynamic scenes, most recent approaches have sought to simplify these complexities using plane-based explicit representations, overcoming the slow training time issues associated with methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and implicit representations. However, the straight-forward decomposition of 4D dynamic scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations proves insufficient for re-rendering high-fidelity scenes with complex motions. In response, we present a novel direction-aware representation (DaRe) approach that captures scene dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation under-goes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. DaReNeRF computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes. Combining DaReNeRF with a tiny MLP for color regression and leveraging volume rendering in training yield state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for complex dynamic scenes. Notably, to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six imag-inary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we introduce a trainable masking approach, mitigating storage issues without significant performance decline. Moreover, DaReNeRF maintains a 2 Ã— reduction in training time compared to prior art while delivering superior performance.
