In this paper, we present an end-to-end 3D-building-wireframe reconstruction method to regress edges directly from aerial light-detection-and-ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. Our method, named parametric-building-wireframe reconstruction (PBWR), takes aerial LiDAR point clouds and initial edge entities as input and fully uses the self-attention mechanism of transformers to regress edge parameters without any intermediate steps such as corner prediction. We propose an edge non-maximum suppression (E-NMS) module based on edge similarity to remove redundant edges. Additionally, a dedicated edge loss function is utilized to guide the PBWR in regressing edges parameters when the simple use of the edge distance loss is not suitable. In our experiments, our proposed method demonstrated state-of-the-art results on the Building3D dataset, achieving an improvement of approximately 36% in Entry-level dataset edge accuracy and around a 42% improvement in the Tallinn dataset.
