Finding correspondences between 3D shapes is an important and long-standing problem in computer vision, graphics and beyond. A prominent challenge are partial-to-partial shape matching settings, which occur when the shapes to match are only observed incompletely (e.g. from 3D scanning). Although partial-to-partial matching is a highly relevant setting in practice, it is rarely explored. Our work bridges the gap between existing (rather artificial) 3D full shape matching and partial-to-partial real-world set-tings by exploiting geometric consistency as a strong constraint. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to solve this challenging problem in a variety of settings. For the first time, we achieve geometric consistency for partial-to-partial matching, which is realized by a novel integer non-linear program formalism building on triangle prod-uct spaces, along with a new pruning algorithm based on linear integer programming. Further, we generate a new inter-class dataset for partial-to-partial shape-matching. We show that our method outperforms current SOTA meth-ods on both an established intra-class dataset and our novel inter-class dataset. The code of this work is publicly avail-able. 11https://github.com/vikiehm/gc-ppsm
