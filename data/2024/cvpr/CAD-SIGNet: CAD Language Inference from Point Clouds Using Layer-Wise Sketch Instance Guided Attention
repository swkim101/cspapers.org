Reverse engineering in the realm of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) has been a longstanding aspiration, though not yet entirely realized. Its primary aim is to uncover the CAD process behind a physical object given its 3D scan. We propose CAD-SIGNet, an end-to-end trainable and aetoregressive architecture to recover the design history of a CAD model represented as a sequence of sketch-and-extrusion from an input point cloud. Our model learns CAD visual-language representations by layer-wise crossattention between point cloud and CAD language embedding. In particular, a new Sketch instance Guided Attention (SGA) module is proposed in order to reconstruct the finegrained details of the sketches. Thanks to its auto-regressive nature, CAD-SIGNet not only reconstructs a unique full design history of the corresponding CAD model given an input point cloud but also provides multiple plausible design choices. This allows for an interactive reverse engineering scenario by providing designers with multiple next step choices along with the design process. Extensive experiments on publicly available CAD datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach against existing baseline models in two settings, namely, full design history recovery and conditional auto-completion from point clouds.
