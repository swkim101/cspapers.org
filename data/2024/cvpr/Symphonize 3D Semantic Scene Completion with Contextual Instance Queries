3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a nascent and pivotal undertaking in autonomous driving, aiming to predict the voxel occupancy within volumetric scenes. However, prevailing methodologies primarily focus on voxel-wise feature aggregation, while neglecting instance semantics and scene context. In this paper, we present a novel paradigm termed Symphonies (Scene-from-Insts), that delves into the integration of instance queries to orchestrate 2D-to-3D reconstruction and 3D scene modeling. Leveraging our proposed Serial Instance-Propagated Attentions, Symphonies dynamically encodes instance-centric semantics, facilitating intricate interactions between the image and volumetric domains. Simultaneously, Symphonies fosters holistic scene comprehension by capturing context through the efficient fusion of instance queries, alleviating geometric ambiguities such as occlusion and perspective errors through contextual scene reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Symphonies achieves state-of-the-art performance on the chal-lenging SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, yielding remarkable mIoU scores of 15.04 and 18.58, respectively. These results showcase the promising advancements of our paradigm. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/hustvl/Symphonies.
