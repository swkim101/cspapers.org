Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been widely used in text-to-image diffusion models, where the CFG scale is introduced to control the strength of text guidance on the whole image space. However, we argue that a global CFG scale results in spatial inconsistency on varying semantic strengths and suboptimal image quality. To address this problem, we present a novel approach, Semantic-aware Classifier-Free Guidance (S-CFG), to customize the guidance degrees for different semantic units in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we first design a training-free semantic segmentation method to partition the latent image into relatively independent semantic regions at each denoising step. In particular, the cross-attention map in the denoising U-net backbone is renormalized for assigning each patch to the corresponding token, while the self-attention map is used to complete the semantic regions. Then, to balance the amplification of diverse semantic units, we adaptively adjust the CFG scales across different semantic regions to rescale the text guidance degrees into a uniform level. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S-CFG over the original CFG strategy on various text-to-image diffusion models, without requiring any extra training cost. our codes are available at https://github.com/SmilesDZgk/S-CFG.
