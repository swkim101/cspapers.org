Generating a 3D human model from a single reference image is challenging because it requires inferring textures and geometries in invisible views while maintaining consistency with the reference image. Previous methods utilizing 3D generative models are limited by the availability of 3D training data. Optimization-based methods that lift text-to-image diffusion models to 3D generation often fail to preserve the texture details of the reference image, resulting in inconsistent appearances in different views. In this paper, we propose HumanRef, a 3D human generation framework from a single-view input. To ensure the generated 3D model is photorealistic and consistent with the input image, HumanRef introduces a novel method called reference-guided score distillation sampling (Ref-SDS), which effectively incorporates image guidance into the generation process. Furthermore, we introduce region-aware attention to Ref-SDS, ensuring accurate correspondence between different body regions. Experimental results demonstrate that HumanRef outper-forms state-of-the-art methods in generating 3D clothed humans with fine geometry, photorealistic textures, and view-consistent appearances.
