Prior research on deep video compression (DVC) for machine tasks typically necessitates training a unique codec for each specific task, mandating a dedicated decoder per task. In contrast, traditional video codecs employ a flexible encoder controller, enabling the adaptation of a single codec to different tasks through mechanisms like mode prediction. Drawing inspiration from this, we introduce an innovative encoder controller for deep video compression for machines. This controller features a mode prediction and a Group of Pictures (GoP) selection module. Our approach centralizes control at the encoding stage, allowing for adaptable encoder adjustments across different tasks, such as detection and tracking, while maintaining compatibility with a standard pre-trained DvC decoder. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our method is applica-ble across multiple tasks with various existing pre-trained Dv'Cs. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous DVC by about 25% bi-trate for different tasks, with only one pre-trained decoder.
