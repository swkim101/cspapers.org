We present a method to generate full-body selfies from photographs originally taken at arms length. Because self-captured photos are typically taken close up, they have lim-ited field of view and exaggerated perspective that distorts facial shapes. We instead seek to generate the photo some one else would take of you from a few feet away. Our approach takes as input four selfies of your face and body, a background image, and generates a full-body selfie in a de-sired target pose. We introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to combine all of this information into high-quality, well-composed photos of you with the desired pose and background.
