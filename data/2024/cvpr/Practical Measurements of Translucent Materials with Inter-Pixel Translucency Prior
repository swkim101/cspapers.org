Material appearance is a key component of photorealism, with a pronounced impact on human perception. Although there are many prior works targeting at measuring opaque materials using light-weight setups (e.g., consumer-level cameras), little attention is paid on acquiring the optical properties of translucent materials which are also quite common in nature. In this paper, we present a practical method for acquiring scattering properties of translucent materials, based solely on ordinary images captured with unknown lighting and camera parameters. The key to our method is an inter-pixel translucency prior which states that image pixels of a given homogeneous translucent material typically form curves (dubbed translucent curves) in the RGB space, of which the shapes are determined by the parameters of the material. We leverage this prior in a specially-designed convolutional neural network comprising multiple encoders, a translucency-aware feature fusion module and a cascaded decoder. We demonstrate, through both visual comparisons and quantitative evaluations, that high accuracy can be achieved on a wide range of real-world translucent materials.
