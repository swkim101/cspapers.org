The diffusion-based text-to-image model harbors im-mense potential in transferring reference style. However, current encoder-based approaches significantly impair the text controllability of text-to-image models while transfer-ring styles. In this paper, we introduce DEADiff to address this issue using the following two strategies: 1) a mecha-nism to decouple the style and semantics of reference images. The decoupled feature representations are first extracted by Q-Formers which are instructed by different text descriptions. Then they are injected into mutually exclusive subsets of cross-attention layers for better disentanglement. 2) A non-reconstructive learning method. The Q-Formers are trained using paired images rather than the identical target, in which the reference image and the ground-truth image are with the same style or semantics. We show that DEADiff attains the best visual stylization results and optimal balance between the text controllability inherent in the text-to-image model and style similarity to the reference image, as demonstrated both quantitatively and qualitatively.
