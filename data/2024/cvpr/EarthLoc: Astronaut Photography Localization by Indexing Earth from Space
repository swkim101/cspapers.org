Astronaut photography, spanning six decades of human spaceflight, presents a unique Earth observations dataset with immense value for both scientific research and disaster response. Despite their significance, accurately localizing the geographical extent of these images, which is crucial for effective utilization, poses substantial challenges. Cur-rent, manual localization efforts are time-consuming, mo-tivating the need for automated solutions. We propose a novel approach - leveraging image retrieval - to address this challenge efficiently. We introduce innovative training techniques which contribute to the development of a high-performance model, EarthLoc. We develop six evaluation datasets and perform a comprehensive benchmark comparing EarthLoc to existing methods, showcasing its superior efficiency and accuracy. Our approach marks a signifi-cant advancement in automating the localization of astro-naut photography, which will help bridge a critical gap in Earth observations data.
