Due to its promising results, density map regression has been widely employed for image-based crowd counting. The approach, however, often suffers from severe performance degradation when tested on data from unseen scenarios, the so-called “domain shift” problem. To address the problem, we investigate in this work single domain generalization (SDG) for crowd counting. The existing SDG approaches are mainly for image classification and segmentation, and can hardly be extended to our case due to its regression nature and label ambiguity (i.e., ambiguous pixel-level ground truths). We propose MPCount, a novel effective SDG approach even for narrow source distribution. MPCount stores diverse density values for density map regression and reconstructs domain-invariant features by means of only one memory bank, a content error mask and attention consistency loss. By partitioning the image into grids, it employs patch-wise classification as an auxiliary task to mitigate label ambiguity. Through extensive experiments on different datasets, MPCount is shown to significantly improve counting accuracy compared to the state of the art under diverse scenarios unobserved in the training data characterized by narrow source distribution.
