The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) in generating high-quality code has drawn increasing attention in the software testing community. However, existing code LLMs often demonstrate unsatisfactory capabilities in generating accurate and complete tests since they were trained on code snippets collected without differentiating between code for testing purposes and other code. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset UniTSyn, which is capable of enhancing the prowess of LLMs for Unit Test Synthesis. Associating tests with the tested functions is crucial for LLMs to infer the expected behavior and the logic paths to be verified. By leveraging Language Server Protocol, UniTSyn achieves the challenging goal of collecting focal-test pairs without per-project execution setups or per-language heuristics that tend to be fragile and difficult to scale. It contains 2.7 million focal-test pairs across five mainstream programming languages, making it possible to be utilized for enhancing the test generation ability of LLMs. The details of UniTSyn can be found in Table 1. Our experiments demonstrate that, by building an autoregressive model based on UniTSyn, we can achieve significant benefits in learning and understanding unit test representations, resulting in improved generation accuracy and code coverage across all evaluated programming languages. Code and data will be publicly available.
