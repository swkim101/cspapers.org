Modern robot systems, like autonomous vehicles, are complex, distributed systems that consist of many interacting components. End-to-end timing latency guarantees are key properties of such systems. They upper bound the data processing time and provide a predictable timing behavior. The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is a widely used and highly configurable set of software libraries for creating and deploying robot systems. It features a custom scheduler to execute time-triggered and event-triggered tasks and uses Data Distribution Services (DDS) for the communication between different system components. The data propagations between ROS 2 system components form cause-effect chains, which can be analyzed to determine the maximum reaction time (longest time between occurrence of an external cause and the earliest time when this external cause is fully processed) and maximum data age (longest time between the moment of a sensor measurement and the latest moment where an effect is based on this sensor measurement). In this paper, we provide an analysis of the end-to-end latencies in multi-executor ROS 2 systems to upper bound the end-to-end latencies of cause-effect chains in ROS 2 systems. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization using constrained programming that determines the optimal system configuration to minimize the end-to-end latencies for ROS 2 systems. We evaluate our upper-bound analysis to determine the end-to-end latencies of cause-effect chains in an autonomous driving-software stack for oval racing used in the Indy Autonomous Challenge and apply our optimization method to reduce the end-to-end latency upper bound, measured maximum, and measured mean by up to 50.2 %, 19.8 %, and 7.2 %, respectively.
