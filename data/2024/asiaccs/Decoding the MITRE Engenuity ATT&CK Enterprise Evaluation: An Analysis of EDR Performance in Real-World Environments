Endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems have emerged as a critical component of enterprise security solutions, effectively combating endpoint threats like APT attacks with extended lifecycles. In light of the growing significance of endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, many cybersecurity providers have developed their own proprietary EDR solutions. It's crucial for users to assess the capabilities of these detection engines to make informed decisions about which products to choose. This is especially urgent given the market's size, which is expected to reach around 3.7 billion dollars by 2023 and is still expanding. MITRE is a leading organization in cyber threat analysis. In 2018, MITRE started to conduct annual APT emulations that cover major EDR vendors worldwide. Indicators include telemetry, detection and blocking capability, etc. Nevertheless, the evaluation results published by MITRE don't contain any further interpretations or suggestions. In this paper, we thoroughly analyzed MITRE evaluation results to gain further insights into real-world EDR systems under test. Specifically, we designed a whole-graph analysis method, which utilizes additional control flow and data flow information to measure the performance of EDR systems. Besides, we analyze MITRE evaluation's results over multiple years from various aspects, including detection coverage, detection confidence, detection modifier, data source, compatibility, etc. Through the above studies, we have compiled a thorough summary of our findings and gained valuable insights from the evaluation results. We believe these summaries and insights can assist researchers, practitioners, and vendors in better understanding the strengths and limitations of mainstream EDR products.
