The Bitcoin blockchain scalability problem has inspired several off-chain solutions for enabling cryptocurrency transactions, of which Layer-2 systems such as payment channel networks (PCNs) have emerged as a frontrunner. PCNs allow for path-based transactions between users without the need to access the blockchain. These path-based transactions are possible only if a suitable path exists from the sender of a payment to the receiver. In this paper, we propose Auroch, a distributed auction-based pathfinding and routing protocol that takes into account the routing fees charged by nodes along a path. Unlike other routing protocols proposed for PCNs, Auroch takes routing fees into consideration. Auroch maximizes the profit that can be achieved by an intermediate node at the same time minimizing the overall payment cost for the sender.
