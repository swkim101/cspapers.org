Cryptocurrency networks crucially rely on digital signature schemes, which are used as an authentication mechanism for transactions. Unfortunately, most major cryptocurrencies today, including Bit-coin and Ethereum, employ signature schemes that are susceptible to quantum adversaries, i.e., an adversary with access to a quantum computer can forge signatures and thereby spend coins of honest users. In cryptocurrency networks, signature schemes are typically not executed in isolation, but within a so-called cryptographic wallet. In order to achieve security against quantum adversaries, the signature scheme and the cryptographic wallet must withstand quantum attacks. In this work, we advance the study on post-quantum secure signature and wallet schemes. That is, we provide the first formal model for deterministic threshold wallets and we show a generic post-quantum secure construction from any post-quantum secure threshold signature scheme with rerandomizable keys. We then instantiate our construction from the isogeny-based signature scheme CSI-FiSh and we show that our instantiation significantly improves over prior work.
