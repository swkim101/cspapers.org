The selection of parameters that offer best possible performance while simultaneously guaranteeing a well-defined level of security is one of the most challenging tasks in cryptographic system design. In order to ensure that the chosen parameters offer a certain level of security an estimation of the computational complexity of the underlying hard problem is required. To date, those estimations are often performed in an ad-hoc manner. This led to a scattered landscape of available estimation scripts, with multiple scripts for the same problem with varying outputs. In this work we present the first open-source software library entirely dedicated to cryptographic hardness estimation, the CryptographicEstimators library. In contrast to most previous estimators, this library follows a modern object-oriented software architecture, which provides a wide variety of features. Overall the design is optimized to ease extending existing estimators by new algorithms and makes it simple to integrate completely new estimators. We then showcase the functionality of the library by presenting estimates for selected candidates of the NIST PQC first round digital signature standardization effort. In this work we further specify the algorithmic cost model underlying the estimators. We then survey the state-of-the-art of concrete complexity estimation on six different hardness assumptions, including the syndrome decoding problem, the multivariate quadratic problem, the code equivalence problem, the permuted kernel problem and different flavors thereof. In this process we gathered and integrated estimators for all these assumptions, to provide a solid starting point for the project. Additionally, we normalized all estimates to fit into the cost model and to measure the same unit operations.
