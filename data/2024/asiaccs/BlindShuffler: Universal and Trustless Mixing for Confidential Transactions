Mixing services provide unlinkability for blockchains by breaking the link between sender/receiver identities and are highly appreciated for their compatibility with the underlying blockchains. Many efforts have been made to provide mixing services for either non-confidential or confidential payments. For confidential payments, all the known mixing protocols are designed for confidential blockchains using homomorphic commitment. There is, however, no satisfactory solution for confidential blockchains using public key encryption (PKE), such as PGC and Zether. This work proposes the first universal mixing protocol for confidential blockchains built upon homomorphic PKE. We provide formal security definitions, and prove that the mixing protocol satisfies all the security requirements. Moreover, we present BlindShuffler, an instantiation of the universal mixing protocol. The evaluation shows that when applying BlindShuffler to PGC, notably lower cost is needed to achieve the same level of anonymity compared with other solutions, and it becomes more advantageous with the increase of the anonymous level. As an independent contribution in the building of BlindShuffer, we improve the state-of-the-art standard one-out-of-many proof to support heterogeneous public keys and construct an enhancement with logarithmic membership proof length.
