In the domain of Cyber-Physical Systems, the FPGA Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) feature has been proved to be efficient to adapt the system hardware configuration to environment changes, also in the case of hard real-time constraints. Often, in this context, a single task can request multiple DPR to modify the platform configuration.However, also if in the hard real-time literature several works exploit the DPR process, to the best of our knowledge, no one deals with its scalability (i.e., the efficient management of multiple DPR requests).Hence, in this work, focusing on hard real-time systems, we conduct both a theoretical and practical investigation about the DPR scalability, discussing the obtained outcomes and the objectives to be achieved in the near future.
