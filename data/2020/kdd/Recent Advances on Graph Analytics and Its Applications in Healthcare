Graph is a natural representation encoding both the features of the data samples and relationships among them. Analysis with graphs is a classic topic in data mining and many techniques have been proposed in the past. In recent years, because of the rapid development of data mining and knowledge discovery, many novel graph analytics algorithms have been proposed and successfully applied in a variety of areas. The goal of this tutorial is to summarize the graph analytics algorithms developed recently and how they have been applied in healthcare. In particular, our tutorial will cover both the technical advances and the application in healthcare. On the technical aspect, we will introduce deep network embedding techniques, graph neural networks, knowledge graph construction and inference, graph generative models and graph neural ordinary differential equation models. On the healthcare side, we will introduce how these methods can be applied in predictive modeling of clinical risks (e.g., chronic disease onset, in-hospital mortality, condition exacerbation, etc.) and disease subtyping with multi-modal patient data (e.g., electronic health records, medical image and multi-omics), knowledge discovery from biomedical literature and integration with data-driven models, as well as pharmaceutical research and development (e.g., de-novo chemical compound design and optimization, patient similarity for clinical trial recruitment and pharmacovigilance). We will conclude the whole tutorial with a set of potential issues and challenges such as interpretability, fairness and security. In particular, considering the global pandemic of COVID-19, we will also summarize the existing research that have already leveraged graph analytics to help with the understanding the mechanism, transmission, treatment and prevention of COVID-19, as well as point out the available resources and potential opportunities for future research.
