Those who work in politics and policy are often unprepared to address the issues that current technology developments have created. A glaring example is the congressional hearings with Facebook where Congress Members asked embarrassingly fundamental questions and were not able to get to the heart of the issue. Many congress people do not have technology advisor on staff to assist in addressing technical issues. Not only does Congress not have technology experts on staff, but the few who are involved are not from underrepresented minority communities. This makes it even more difficult to adequately address issues that more directly impact communities of color including predictive policing, voter suppression, and facial recognition. The PhDx fellowship program was created by the Media Democracy Fund to bridge this gap. Underrepresented PhD students in STEM fields spend multiple summers working in various technology policy outlets including Upturn, Free Press, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. In this talk, I will discuss my experience in the program, how it helped me to understand the various career paths I could take in the policy realm with a technical degree, and how I have been able to make a meaningful impact in the field for my community.
