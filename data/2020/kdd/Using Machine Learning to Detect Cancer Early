GRAIL's mission is to detect cancer early, when it can be cured. Building a classifier that can detect cancer early in a clinical setting is a complicated endeavor with unique challenges: data acquisition and stabilization can take years; cancer status (labels) can be ambiguous, noisy, and changing; sequencing data can be enormous and presents scaling issues. Because the cancer early detection machine learning classifier is being built in the context of a clinical trial environment, an extra level of rigor and planning is required. Through the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas study, GRAIL has collected blood samples from >15,000 patients with and without cancer on which to train and validate the classifier. Results on a validation set show that the GRAIL classifier can detect >50 cancers with >99% specificity. The correct tissue of origin can be identified approximately 90% of the time.
