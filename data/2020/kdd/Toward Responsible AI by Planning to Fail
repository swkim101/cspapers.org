The potential for AI technologies to enhance human capabilities and improve our lives is of little debate; yet, neither is their potential to cause harm and social disruption. While preventing or minimizing AI biases and harms is justifiably the subject of intense study in academic, industrial and even legal communities, an approach centered on acknowledging and planning for AI-based failures has the potential to shed new light on how to develop and deploy responsible AI-based systems. In this talk, I will discuss the sociotechnical nature of several inherent and unavoidable AI failures and why it is important for the industry to systematically and proactively identify, assess, and mitigate harms caused by such failures in our AI-based products and services. I will then present Microsoft's recently released Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction and how we've been using them at Microsoft to help teams think through and prepare for different types of AI failures.
