Anomaly detection has been widely studied and used in diverse applications. Building an effective anomaly detection system requires researchers and developers to learn complex structure from noisy data, identify dynamic anomaly patterns, and detect anomalies with limited labels. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have greatly improved anomaly detection performance, in comparison with classical approaches, and have extended anomaly detection to a wide variety of applications. This tutorial will help the audience gain a comprehensive understanding of deep learning based anomaly detection techniques in various application domains. First, we give an overview of the anomaly detection problem, introducing the approaches taken before the deep model era and listing out the challenges they faced. Then we survey the state-of-the-art deep learning models that range from building block neural network structures such as MLP, CNN, and LSTM, to more complex structures such as autoencoder, generative models (VAE, GAN, Flow-based models), to deep one-class detection models, etc. In addition, we illustrate how techniques such as transfer learning and reinforcement learning can help amend the label sparsity issue in anomaly detection problems and how to collect and make the best use of user labels in practice. Second to last, we discuss real world use cases coming from and outside LinkedIn. The tutorial concludes with a discussion of future trends.
