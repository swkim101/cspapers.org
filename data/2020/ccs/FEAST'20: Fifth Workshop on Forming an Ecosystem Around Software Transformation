The Fifth Workshop on Forming an Ecosystem Around Software Transformation (FEAST) provides a forum for presentation and discussion of new tools, methodologies, and techniques facilitating the automated or semi-automated transformation and analysis of software executables for improving their security and efficiency without the benefit of any original source code whence they were developed. Late-stage software customization of this form is of particular benefit to security-conscious software consumers who must use closed-source or source-free binary software components in mission-critical settings, or who must harden software against newly emerging attacks not anticipated during the software's original design and development. However, code analysis and transformation becomes much more difficult without the aid of source-level information to provide a context for its intended operation. This outstanding challenge motivates the FEAST Workshop's goal of forming a robust ecosystem of strategies and tools for accomplishing source-free binary code transformation reliably and on-demand.
