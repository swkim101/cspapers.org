The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices makes it vitally important to understand real-world cybersecurity threats to them. Traditionally, honeypots have been used as decoys to mimic real devices on a network and help researchers/organizations understand the dynamic of threats. A crucial condition for a honeypot to yield useful insights is to let attackers believe they are real systems used by humans and organizations. However, IoT devices pose unique challenges in this respect, due to the large variety of device types and the physical-connectedness nature. In this work, we (1) presented an approach to create a multi-phased multi-faceted honeypot ecosystem, where researchers gradually increase the sophistication of a low-interaction IoT honeypot by observing real-world attackers' behaviors, (2) built a low-interaction honeypot for IoT cameras that allowed researchers to gain a concrete understanding of what attackers were going after on IoT camera devices, and (3) designed a proxy instance, called ProxyPot, that sits between IoT devices and the external network and helps researchers study the IoT devices' inbound/outbound communication. We used PorxyPot as a means to understanding attacks against IoT cameras and increasing the honeypot's sophistication. We deployed honeypots for more than two years. Our preliminary results showed that we were able to attract increasingly sophisticated attack data in each new phase. Moreover, we captured activities that appeared to involve direct human interactions rather than purely automated scripts.
