Simplified models are useful to increase the computational efficiency of a motion planning algorithm, but their lack of accuracy have to be managed. We propose two feasibility constraints to be included in a Single Rigid Body Dynamics-based trajectory optimizer in order to obtain robust motions in challenging terrain. The first one finds an approximate relationship between joint-torque limits and admissible contact forces, without requiring the joint positions. The second one proposes a leg model to prevent leg collision with the environment. Such constraints have been included in a simplified nonlinear non-convex trajectory optimization problem. We demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting motion plans both in simulation and on the Hydraulically actuated Quadruped (HyQ) robot, considering experiments on an irregular terrain.
