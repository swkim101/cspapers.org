We consider the problem of optimal reactive synthesis — compute a strategy that satisfies a mission specification in a dynamic environment, and optimizes a given performance metric. We incorporate task-critical information, that is only available at runtime, into the strategy synthesis in order to improve performance. Existing approaches to utilising such time-varying information require online re-synthesis, which is not computationally feasible in real-time applications. In this paper, we presynthesize a set of strategies corresponding to candidate instantiations (pre-specified representative information scenarios). We then propose a novel switching mechanism to dynamically switch between the strategies at runtime while guaranteeing all safety and liveness goals are met. We also characterize bounds on the performance suboptimality. We demonstrate our approach on two examples — robotic motion planning where the likelihood of the position of the robot’s goal is updated in real-time, and an air traffic management problem for urban air mobility.
