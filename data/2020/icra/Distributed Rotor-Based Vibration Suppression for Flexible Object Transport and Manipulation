The RVM (Robot-based Vibration Suppression Modules) is proposed for the manipulation and transport of a large flexible object. Since the RVM is easily attachable/detachable to the object, this RVM allows distributing over the manipulated object so that it is scalable to the object size. The composition of the system is partly motivated by the MAGMaS (Multiple Aerial-Ground Manipulator System) [1]- [3], however, since the quadrotor usage is mechanically too complicated and its design is not optimized for manipulation, thus we overcome these limitations using distributed RVMs and newly developed theory. For this, we first provide a constrained optimization problem of RVM design with the minimum number of rotors, so that the feasible thrust force is maximized while it minimizes undesirable wrench and its own weight. Then, we derive the full dynamics and elucidate a controllability condition with multiple distributed RVMs and show that even if multiple, their structures turn out similar to [2] composed with a single quadrotor. We also elucidate the optimal placement of the RVM via the usage of controllability gramian which is not even alluded in [2] and established for the first time here. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory.
