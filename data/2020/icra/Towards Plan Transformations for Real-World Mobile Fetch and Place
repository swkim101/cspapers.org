In this paper, we present an approach and an implemented framework for applying plan transformations to real-world mobile manipulation plans, in order to specialize them to the specific situation at hand. The framework can improve execution cost and achieve better performance by autonomously transforming robotâ€™s behavior at runtime. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we apply three example transformations to the plan of a PR2 robot performing simple table setting and cleaning tasks in the real world. Based on a large amount of experiments in a fast plan projection simulator, we make conclusions on improved execution performance.
