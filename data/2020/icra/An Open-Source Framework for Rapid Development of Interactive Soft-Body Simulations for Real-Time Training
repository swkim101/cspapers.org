We present an open-source framework that provides a low barrier to entry for real-time simulation, visualization, and interactive manipulation of user-specifiable soft-bodies, environments, and robots (using a human-readable front-end interface). The simulated soft-bodies can be interacted by a variety of input interface devices including commercially available haptic devices, game controllers, and the Master Tele-Manipulators (MTMs) of the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) with real-time haptic feedback. We propose this framework for carrying out multi-user training, user-studies, and improving the control strategies for manipulation problems. In this paper, we present the associated challenges to the development of such a framework and our proposed solutions. We also demonstrate the performance of this framework with examples of soft-body manipulation and interaction with various input devices.
