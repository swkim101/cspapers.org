We present a parallel robot mechanism and the constitutive laws that govern the deformation of its constituent soft actuators. Our ultimate goal is the real-time motion-correction of a patient’s head deviation from a target pose where the soft actuators control the position of the patient’s cranial region on a treatment machine. We describe the mechanism, derive the stress-strain constitutive laws for the individual actuators and the inverse kinematics that prescribes a given deformation, and then present simulation results that validate our mathematical formulation. Our results demonstrate deformations consistent with our radially symmetric displacement formulation under a finite elastic deformation framework.
