Autonomous tool construction is a significant but challenging task in robotics. This task can be interpreted as when given a reference tool, selecting some available candidate parts to reconstruct it. Most of the existing works perform tool construction in the form of action part and grasp part, which is only a specific construction pattern and limits its application to some extent. In general scenarios, a tool can be constructed in various patterns with different part pairs. Therefore, whether a part pair is most suitable for constructing the tool depends not only on itself, but on other parts in the same scene. To solve this problem, we construct a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) to model the relations between all part pairs, so that we can select the candidate parts in consideration of the global information. Afterwards, we embed the constructed GGNN into a RCNN-like structure to finally accomplish tool construction. The whole model will be named Tool Construction Graph RCNN (TC-GRCNN). In addition, we develop a mechanism that can generate large-scale training and testing data in simulation environments, by which we can save the time of data collection and annotation. Finally, the proposed model is deployed on the physical robot. The experiment results show that TC-GRCNN can perform well in the general scenarios of tool construction.
