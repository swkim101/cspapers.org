A novel scheme for an "upgrade" of a linear control algorithm to a non-linear one is developed based on the concepts of a generalized homogeneity and an implicit homogeneous feedback design. Some tuning rules for a guaranteed improvement of a regulation quality are proposed. Theoretical results are confirmed by real experiments with the quadrotor QDrone of Quanserâ„¢.
