Snake-like robots for endoscopic surgery make it possible to reach deep-seated lesions. With the use of small flexible tendon-driven instruments, it is possible to perform bimanual micro-surgical tasks that are challenging for standard endoscopic surgeries. Existing devices, however, lack articulated wrists and rolling motion of the end-effector. This paper presents a new instrument design with a distal-roll gripper for snake-like robots. The developed 5 DoFs miniaturized instruments with a diameter of 3 mm enable the deployment into narrow endoluminal channels. Issues related to actuation coupling, tendon slack, and backlash are addressed. Experimental results show that the distal-roll gripper can rotate 106Â°, and the actuated joints can achieve good repeatability and accuracy with the proposed compensation control scheme.
