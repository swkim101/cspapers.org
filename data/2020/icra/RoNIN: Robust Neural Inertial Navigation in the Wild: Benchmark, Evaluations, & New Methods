This paper sets a new foundation for data-driven inertial navigation research, where the task is the estimation of horizontal positions and heading direction of a moving subject from a sequence of IMU sensor measurements from a phone. In contrast to existing methods, our method can handle varying phone orientations and placements.More concretely, the paper presents 1) a new benchmark containing more than 40 hours of IMU sensor data from 100 human subjects with ground-truth 3D trajectories under natural human motions; 2) novel neural inertial navigation architectures, making significant improvements for challenging motion cases; and 3) qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the competing methods over three inertial navigation benchmarks. We share the code and data to promote further research. (http://ronin.cs.sfu.ca).
