Noisy  Intermediate-Scale  Quantum  (NISQ)  computers are  enabling  development  and  evaluation  of  real quantum algorithms, but due to their highly erroneous nature,careful selection of qubits to map the algorithm on to real hardware is required to minimize the error rate of the algorithm output. In this paper, we propose UREQA, a new approach that introduces quantum-operation-aware error rate prediction to minimize of output errors of quantum algorithms running on NISQ devices.
