In this paper we present PERCIVAL, a browser-embedded, lightweight, deep learning-powered ad blocker. PERCIVAL embeds itself within the browser’s image rendering pipeline, which makes it possible to intercept every image obtained during page execution and to perform image classification based blocking to flag potential ads. Our  implementation  inside  both  Chromium  and  Brave browsers shows only a minor rendering performance overhead of 4.55%, for Chromium, and 19.07%, for Brave browser, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying traditionally heavy models (i.e. deep neural networks) inside the critical path of  the  rendering  engine  of  a  browser.  We  show  that  our image-based ad blocker can  replicate  EasyList rules  with an   accuracy  of  96.76%.   Additionally, PERCIVAL does surprisingly  well  on  ads  in  languages  other than  English and  also  performs  well  on  blocking  first-party  Facebook ads, which have presented issues for rule-based ad blockers. PERCIVAL proves that image-based perceptual ad blocking is an attractive complement to today’s dominant approach of block lists.
