The development of technology has enabled the construction of various expert systems that can now assist experts in disease recognition. Nowadays, most of the expert systems are based on decision trees. The parameters inside a decision tree are based on experts' knowledge and scientific data which vary slightly depending on the expert and source. To deal with this problem, we developed a complete medical system in which electrical impedance tomography and body surface potential mapping are used to measure the patient biosignals. The system focuses on the cardiorespiratory biosignals. With the use of machine learning, we analyze each measured channel and show which channel should be taken into account in the detection of pathologies. We show that the channels that are important for machine learning are different from those used by experts in 12-channel ECG.
