Team "DL_Lock": The Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) recognition challenge 2020 poses a unique opportunity to work on a broad, real-life dataset to classify transport-related activities in a user and location-independent manner. Since deep learning architectures have now received great attention on achieving promising results on time series classification tasks, we focused our experiments on some recent state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as CNN, Resnet, and InceptionTime. A considerable amount of time was spent on the preprocessing pipeline, which turned out to be a critical phase that impacted most of the results. At the end and after many experiments and hyperparameter tuning, we were able to achieve a 79% F1 score on the validation dataset using InceptionTime architecture. The objective of this paper is to present the technical description of the Machine Learning processing pipeline, the algorithms used, and the results achieved during the development/training phase.
