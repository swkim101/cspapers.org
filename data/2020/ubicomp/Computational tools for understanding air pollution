Ambient fine particulate (PM2.5) is the most significant risk factor for premature death, shortening life expectancy at birth by 1.5 to 1.9 years [2]. 91% of the world's population lives in areas where air pollution exceeds safety limits1. 99% of the people in countries like India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh experience ambient exposures of PM2.5 exceeding 75 μg/m3 to 100 μg/m3 [3]. My Ph.D. thesis will be on understanding the perception of air pollution among people using social media data. I also intend to develop a wearable air pollution exposure monitor and design an air pollution visualisation tool to reduce the entry barrier for air pollution research.
