Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of anticancer drugs that causes muscle weakness in the cancer patients, causing them to fall. Therefore, we constructed "FD-AWARE", a system to understand the users' fall context and users' CIPN symptoms as the first step in preventing these falls. This system can collect the various sensor data from the iPhone and the Apple Watch, self-reported fall information data, self-reported user status data of CIPN symptoms, and their physical condition. We conducted a 2-week in-the-wild experiment with 8 patients who were actually suffering from CIPN. We constructed the machine learning models for estimating the users' status of CIPN symptoms and successfully achieved high accuracy of performance for several estimating models.
