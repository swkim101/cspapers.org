Users are increasingly confronted with a tremendous amount of information proactively and without explicit consent through notifications from a variety of applications and services. This information load is increased due to the ubiquity of end-user (mobile) devices. Novel computing paradigms such as IoT and smart cities may further overload end-users, despite the clear indication from literature that human attention is limited. To counter this challenge, "attention management", including attention representation, sensing, prediction, analysis, personalization, and adaptive behavior is needed in our computing systems. Following the successful UbiTtention workshop series as organised from 2016 on-wards, the UbiTtention 2020 workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to explore the management of human attention and notifications across versatile devices and contexts. UbiTtention presents and elicits research to overcome information overload and overchoice - tailoring device or application behavior to user needs.
