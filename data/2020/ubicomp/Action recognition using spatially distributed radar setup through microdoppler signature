Small form factor off-the shelf radar sensor nodes are being investigated for various privacy preserving non-contact sensing applications. This paper, presents a novel method, based on a system of spatially distributed radar setup(panel radar), for real time action recognition. Proposed method uses spatially distributed two single channel Continuous Wave (CW) radars to classify actions. For classification, a unique two layered classifier, is employed on novel features. Layer I performs coarse limb level classification followed by finer action detection in Layer II. For validation of the proposed system, 7 actions were targeted and data was collected for 20 people. Accuracy of 88.6 % was obtained, with a precision and recall of 0.9 and 0.89 respectively, hence proving the efficacy of this novel approach.
