In this paper we summarize the contributions of participants to the third Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) Recognition Challenge organized at the HASCA Workshop of UbiComp/ISWC 2020. The goal of this machine learning/data science challenge is to recognize eight locomotion and transportation activities (Still, Walk, Run, Bike, Bus, Car, Train, Subway) from the inertial sensor data of a smartphone in a user-independent manner with an unknown target phone position. The training data of a "train" user is available from smartphones placed at four body positions (Hand, Torso, Bag and Hips). The testing data originates from "test" users with a smartphone placed at one, but unknown, body position. We introduce the dataset used in the challenge and the protocol of the competition. We present a meta-analysis of the contributions from 15 submissions, their approaches, the software tools used, computational cost and the achieved results. Overall, one submission achieved F1 scores above 80%, three with F1 scores between 70% and 80%, seven between 50% and 70%, and four below 50%, with a latency of maximum of 5 seconds.
