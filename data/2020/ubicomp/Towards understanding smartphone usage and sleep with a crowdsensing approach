Smartphone usage and sleep quality have established connections in psychological research, but in the HCI context, the topic is still understudied. In this paper, we present preliminary insights into behavioral patterns between smartphone usage and sleep quality by using crowdsensed data. We utilize a large-scale mobile usage dataset and a PHQ-8 depression questionnaire answered by 743 participants from varying age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds. Based on our preliminary results, we provide a methodological pipeline for future work towards understanding the relationship between daily smartphone usage patterns and sleep quality in the wild.
