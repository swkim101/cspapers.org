In this work, we examine the suitability of automatic facial expression recognition to be used for satisfaction analysis in an Empathic Building environment. We use machine learning based facial expression recognition on the working stations to integrate an online satisfaction index into Empathic Building platform. To analyze the suitability of facial expression recognition to reflect longer-term satisfaction, we examine the changes and trends in the happiness curves of our test users. We also correlate the happiness curve with temperature, humidity, and light intensity of the test users' local city (Tampere Finland). The results indicate that the proposed analysis indeed shows some trends that may be used for long-term satisfaction analysis in different kinds of intelligent buildings.
