In the real-world ubiquitous computing systems, it is difficult to require a significant amount of data to obtain accurate information through pure data-driven methods. The performance of data-driven methods relies on the quantity and 'quality' of data. They perform well when a sufficient amount of data is available, which is regarded as ideal conditions. However, in real-world systems, collecting data can be costly or impossible due to practical limitations. On the other hand, it is promising to utilize physical knowledge to alleviate these issues of data limitation. The physical knowledge includes domain knowledge from experts, heuristics from experiences, analytic models of the physical phenomena and etc. The goal of the workshop is to explore the intersection between (and the combination of) data and physical knowledge. The workshop aims to bring together domain experts that explore the physical understanding of the data, practitioners that develop systems and the researchers in traditional data-driven domains. The workshop welcomes papers, which focuses on addressing these issues in different applications/domains as well as algorithmic and systematic approaches to applying physical knowledge. Therefore, we further seek to develop a community that systematically analyzes the data quality regarding inference and evaluates the improvements from physical knowledge. Preliminary and on-going work is welcomed.
