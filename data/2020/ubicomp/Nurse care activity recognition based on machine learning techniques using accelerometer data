Sensor-based human activity recognition has become one of the challenging and emerging research areas. Several machine learning algorithm with appropriate feature extraction has been used to solve human activity recognition task. However, recent research mainly focused on various deep learning algorithms, our focus of this study is measuring the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms with the incorporation of frequency-domain features. Because deep learning methods require a high computational cost. In this paper, we used Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour, SVM, Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron with necessary feature extraction for our experimentation. We achieved best performance for K-Nearest Neighbour. Our experiment was a part of "The 2nd Nurse Care Activity Recognition Challenge Using Lab and Field Data" followed by the team MoonShot_BD. We concluded that with proper feature extraction, machine learning techniques may be useful to solve activity recognition with a low computational cost.
