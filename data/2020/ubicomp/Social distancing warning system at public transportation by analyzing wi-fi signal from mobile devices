A novel coronavirus (nCov) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The disease caused by this new virus was subsequently named the 'COVID-19'. The outbreak of COVID-19 around the world urges or forces people to isolate themselves, and now social distancing is a part of a new normal to measures taken to increase the distance between individuals to prevent people from being infected the virus. Public transportation is a necessary facility in a city used by many people every day, at the same time is a higher risk place to be infected by COVID-19. Sometime people will forget to keep the distance between nearby persons, that can be a cause of mass infection. In this paper, we propose a social distancing warning system which is implemented by a method to separate passing- by people from waiting people by passively monitoring the activity of Wi-Fi signals from mobile devices. When the number of people in that area exceeds the allowable density, the system will warn the people to keep the distance from other people.
