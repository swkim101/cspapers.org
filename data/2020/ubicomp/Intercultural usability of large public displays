One component of smart or major cities are large public displays that are used for many purposes - advertising, warning, informing. These devices appeal to a large heterogeneous user group as especially in major cities people from many countries and cultures live together. Even though, researchers have identified intercultural usability recommendations for general and private devices - mobile phones, websites, etc. -, there is still a gap of information about how to design large non-personal, public displays for intercultural user groups. This dissertation explores the challenges and opportunities within the intercultural design space of large public displays. The expected results are design recommendations and guidelines regarding relevant aspects for intercultural usability of large public displays. Further, these results can be used by user interface designers and researchers that want to design, improve, evaluate or further explore large public displays for intercultural settings.
