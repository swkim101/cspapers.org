In recent years, we have seen efforts made to simultaneously monitor the respiration of multiple persons based on the channel state information (CSI) retrieved from commodity WiFi devices. However, existing approaches only work when multiple persons exhibit dramatically different respiration rates and the performance degrades significantly when the targeted subjects have similar rates. What's more, they can only obtain the average respiration rate over a period of time and fail to capture the detailed rate change over time. These two constraints greatly limit the application of the proposed approaches in real life. Different from the existing approaches that apply spectral analysis to the CSI amplitude (or phase difference) to obtain respiration rate information, we leverage the multiple antennas provided by the commodity WiFi hardware and model the multi-person respiration sensing as a blind source separation (BSS) problem. Then, we solve it using independent component analysis (ICA) to obtain the reparation information of each person. In this demo, we will demonstrate MultiSense - a multi-person respiration monitoring system using COTS WiFi devices.
