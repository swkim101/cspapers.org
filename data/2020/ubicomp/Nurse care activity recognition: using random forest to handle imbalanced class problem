Nurse care activity recognition is a new challenging research field in human activity recognition (HAR) because unlike other activity recognition, it has severe class imbalance problem and intra-class variability depending on both the subject and the receiver. In this paper, we applied the Random Forest-based resampling method to solve the class imbalance problem in the Heiseikai data, nurse care activity dataset. This method consists of resampling, feature selection based on Gini impurity, and model training and validation with Stratified KFold cross-validation. By implementing the Random Forest classifier, we achieved 65.9% average cross-validation accuracy in classifying 12 activities conducted by nurses in both lab and real-life settings. Our team, "Britter Baire" developed this algorithmic pipeline for "The 2nd Nurse Care Activity Recognition Challenge Using Lab and Field Data".
