In this work we present an indoor emergency context monitoring system based on ground vibration caused by persons in the target area. The system is designed for production plants and large buildings to perceive the safety status of this area. Our approach is privacy-protecting, because it requires neither video nor sound. Instead, piezo sensors on the floor measure vibrations, which are analyzed with machine learning to compute the safety status of the covered area. This way our system can determine whether an emergency occurred, but it is not straight forward possible to attach names to the detected persons. We compare the impact of different feature extraction methods and different types of classifiers on the classification results. Our experiments show that we can determine an emergency event with an average F1 score of 0.97.
