Nature and outdoor open spaces are good for our mental and physical health; providing space for exercise, relaxation, socializing and exploring nature. Technology plays an important role in how people explore the outdoors, however, despite the prevalence of mobile technologies that promote outdoor mobility, they are often not accessible to people with disabilities. This PhD project explores technologies to promote nature connectedness in blind and partially sighted people. We have conducted formative studies exploring the needs of blind and partially sighted people and barriers that limit their experiences. The next phase of my research will focus on designing auditory augmented reality systems to augment the natural elements in open spaces which are presented to the user in real-time as they navigate the space. We aim to design, implement, and evaluate pervasive auditory augmented reality systems that enhance people's immersive experience and engagement with nature.
