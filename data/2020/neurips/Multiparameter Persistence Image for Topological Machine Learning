The Multiparameter Persistence Image is built from the Vineyard Decomposition associated to the fibered barcode, which is a collection of successive matchings of barcodes. Fix a 2D persistence moduleM(f). Considering a collection of lines {`i}, Landiâ€™s external stability result [Lan14] implies that as a pair of lines `i and `j get closer together, bcd(f`i) and bcd(f`j ) converge. This implies that the persistence image is a sensible construction in the sense that there are not discontinuous jumps in the barcodes along the matchings, provided the cover by the lines is fine enough. Moreover, these considerations also imply that for sufficiently close lines, the vineyard matching closely approximates the bottleneck distance matching.
