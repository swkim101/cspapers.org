Recent work on automated augmentation strategies has led to state-of-the-art results in image classification and object detection. An obstacle to a large-scale adoption of these methods is that they require a separate and expensive search phase. A common way to overcome the expense of the search phase was to use a smaller proxy task. However, it was not clear if the optimized hyperparameters found on the proxy task are also optimal for the actual task. In this work, we rethink the process of designing automated augmentation strategies. We find that while previous work required a search for both magnitude and probability of each operation independently, it is sufficient to only search for a single distortion magnitude that jointly controls all operations. We hence propose a simplified search space that vastly reduces the computational expense of automated augmentation, and permits the removal of a separate proxy task.Despite the simplifications, our method achieves equal or better performance over previous automated augmentation strategies on on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, ImageNet and COCO datasets. EfficientNet-B7, we achieve 85.0% accuracy, a 1.0% increase over baseline augmentation, a 0.6% improvement over AutoAugment on the ImageNet dataset. With EfficientNet-B8, we achieve 85.4% accuracy on ImageNet, which matches a previous result that used 3.5B extra images. On object detection, the same method as classification leads to 1.0-1.3% improvement over baseline augmentation. Code will be made available online.
