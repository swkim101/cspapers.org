One of the earliest commonly-used packages is Spearmint [94], which implements a variety of modeling techniques such as MCMC hyperparameter sampling and input warping [95]. Spearmint also supports parallel optimization via fantasies, and constrained optimization with the expected improvement and predictive entropy search acquisition functions [31, 38]. Spearmint was among the first libraries to make BO easily accessible to the end user.
