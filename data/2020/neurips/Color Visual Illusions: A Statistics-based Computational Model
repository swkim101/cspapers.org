Visual illusions may be explained by the likelihood of patches in real-world images, as argued by input-driven paradigms in Neuro-Science. However, neither the data nor the tools existed in the past to extensively support these explanations. The era of big data opens a new opportunity to study input-driven approaches. We introduce a tool that computes the likelihood of patches, given a large dataset to learn from. Given this tool, we present a model that supports the approach and explains lightness and color visual illusions in a unified manner. Furthermore, our model generates visual illusions in natural images, by applying the same tool, reversely.
