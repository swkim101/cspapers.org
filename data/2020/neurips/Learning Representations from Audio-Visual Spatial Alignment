We introduce a novel self-supervised pretext task for learning representations from audio-visual content. Prior work on audio-visual representation learning leverages correspondences at the video level. Approaches based on audio-visual correspondence (AVC) predict whether audio and video clips originate from the same or different video instances. Audio-visual temporal synchronization (AVTS) further discriminates negative pairs originated from the same video instance but at different moments in time. While these approaches learn high-quality representations for downstream tasks such as action recognition, their training objectives disregard spatial cues naturally occurring in audio and visual signals. To learn from these spatial cues, we tasked a network to perform contrastive audio-visual spatial alignment of 360{\deg} video and spatial audio. The ability to perform spatial alignment is enhanced by reasoning over the full spatial content of the 360{\deg} video using a transformer architecture to combine representations from multiple viewpoints. The advantages of the proposed pretext task are demonstrated on a variety of audio and visual downstream tasks, including audio-visual correspondence, spatial alignment, action recognition, and video semantic segmentation.
