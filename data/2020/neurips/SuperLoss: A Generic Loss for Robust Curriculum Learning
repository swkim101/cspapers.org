where s ∈ [0, 1] is the similarity score between two keypoints computed as a dot-product between their representation, y ∈ {−1, 1} is the ground-truth label for the pair and σ > 0 is an input-dependent prediction of the reliability of the two keypoints. In Figure 2 of the main paper, we plot σ on the x-axis and the similarity score s on the y-axis, assuming a positive label y = 1. Note that this loss hardly generalizes to other tasks as it is specially designed to handle similarity scores in the range [0, 1] with binary labels.
