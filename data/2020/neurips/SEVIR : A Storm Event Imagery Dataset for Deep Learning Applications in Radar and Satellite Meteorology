The SEVIR catalog contains relevant information about each event in SEVIR. Table 1 includes a list of the catalogs columns, with a short description of each. When extracting data from SEVIR, it is helpful to first group the catalog by the id column. After doing so, the size of each group will represent the number of image types that are available for each event. This is useful for building training datasets that utilize multiple image types (such as the synthetic radar problem). The catalog also allows for efficient filtering of SEVIR by time, geographic location, or by statistic for more focused training and testing sets.
