We propose a novel unsupervised generative model that learns to disentangle object identity from other low-level aspects in class-imbalanced data. We ﬁrst investigate the issues surrounding the assumptions about uniformity made by InfoGAN [10], and demonstrate its ineffectiveness to properly disentangle object identity in imbalanced data. Our key idea is to make the discovery of the discrete latent factor of variation invariant to identity-preserving transformations in real images, and use that as a signal to learn the appropriate latent distribution representing object identity. Experiments on both artiﬁcial (MNIST, 3D cars, 3D chairs, ShapeNet) and real-world (YouTube-Faces) imbalanced datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in disentangling object identity as a latent factor of variation
