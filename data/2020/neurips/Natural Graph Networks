A key requirement for graph neural networks is that they must process a graph in a way that does not depend on how the graph is described. Traditionally this has been taken to mean that a graph network must be equivariant to node permutations. Here we show that instead of equivariance, the more general concept of naturality is sufﬁcient for a graph network to be well-deﬁned, opening up a larger class of graph networks. We deﬁne global and local natural graph networks, the latter of which are as scalable as conventional message passing graph neural networks while being more ﬂexible. We give one practical instantiation of a natural network on graphs which uses an equivariant message network parameterization, yielding good performance on several benchmarks.
