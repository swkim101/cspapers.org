In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing AI techniques for finance research and applications. For instance, AI techniques (e.g., machine learning) can help traders in quantitative trading (QT) by automating two tasks: market condition recognition and trading strategies execution. However, existing methods in QT face challenges such as representing noisy high-frequent financial data and finding the balance between exploration and exploitation of the trading agent with AI techniques. To address the challenges, we propose an adaptive trading model, namely iRDPG, to automatically develop QT strategies by an intelligent trading agent. Our model is enhanced by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning techniques. Specifically, considering the noisy financial data, we formulate the QT process as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Also, we introduce imitation learning to leverage classical trading strategies useful to balance between exploration and exploitation. For better simulation, we train our trading agent in the real financial market using minute-frequent data. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can extract robust market features and be adaptive in different markets.
