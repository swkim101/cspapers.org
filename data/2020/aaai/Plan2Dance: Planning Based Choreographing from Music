The field of dancing robots has drawn much attention from numerous sources. Despite the success of previous systems on choreography for robots to dance with external stimuli, they are often either limited to a pre-defined set of movements or lack of considering “hard” relations among dancing motions. In the demonstration, we design a planning based choreographing system, which views choreography with music as planning problems and solve the problems with off-the-shelf planners. Our demonstration exhibits the effectiveness of our system via evaluating our system with various music.
