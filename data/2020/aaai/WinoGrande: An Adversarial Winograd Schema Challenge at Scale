The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), proposed by Levesque et al. (2011) as an alternative to the Turing Test, was originally designed as a pronoun resolution problem that cannot be solved based on statistical patterns in large text corpora. However, recent studies suggest that current WSC datasets, even when composed carefully by experts, are still prone to such biases that statistical methods can exploit. We introduce WINOGRANDE, a new collection of WSC problems that are adversarially constructed to be robust against spurious statistical biases. While the original WSC dataset provided only 273 instances, WINOGRANDE includes 43,985 instances, half of which are determined as adversarial. Key to our approach is a novel adversarial filtering algorithm AFLITE for systematic bias reduction, combined with a careful crowdsourcing design. Despite the significant increase in training data, the performance of existing stateof-the-art methods remains modest (61.6%) and contrasts with high human performance (90.8%) for the binary questions. In addition, WINOGRANDE allows us to use transfer learning for achieving new state-of-the-art results on the original WSC and related datasets. Finally, we discuss how biases lead to overestimating the true capabilities of machine commonsense.
