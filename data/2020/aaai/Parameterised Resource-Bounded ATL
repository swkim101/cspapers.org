It is often advantageous to be able to extract resource requirements in resource logics of strategic ability, rather than to verify whether a fixed resource requirement is sufficient for achieving a goal. We study Parameterised Resource-Bounded Alternating Time Temporal Logic where parameter extraction is possible. We give a parameter extraction algorithm and prove that the model-checking problem is 2EXPTIME-complete.
