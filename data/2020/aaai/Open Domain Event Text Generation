Text generation tasks aim at generating human-readable text from different kinds of data. Normally, the generated text only contains the information included in the data and its application is thus restricted to some limited scenarios. In this paper, we extend the task to an open domain event text generation scenario with an entity chain as its skeleton. Specifically, given an entity chain containing several related event entities, the model should retrieve from a trustworthy repository (e.g. Wikipedia) the detailed information of these entities and generate a description text based on the retrieved sentences. We build a new dataset called WikiEvent1 that provides 34K pairs of entity chain and its corresponding description sentences. To solve the problem, we propose a wiki augmented generator framework that contains an encoder, a retriever, and a decoder. The encoder encodes the entity chain into a hidden space while the decoder decodes from the hidden space and generates description text. The retriever retrieves relevant text from a trustworthy repository which provides more information for generation. To alleviate the overfitting problem, we propose a novel random drop component that randomly deletes words from the retrieved sentences making our model more robust for handling long input sentences. We apply the proposed model on the WikiEvent dataset and compare it with a few baselines. The experimental results show that our carefully-designed architecture does help generate better event text, and extensive analysis further uncovers the characteristics of the proposed task.
