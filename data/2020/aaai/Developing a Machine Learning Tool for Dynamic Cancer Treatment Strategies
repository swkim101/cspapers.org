With the rising number and complexity of cancer therapies, it is increasingly difficult for clinicians to identity an optimal combination of treatments for a patient. Our research aims to provide a decision support tool to optimize and supplant cancer treatment decisions. Leveraging machine learning, causal inference, and decision analysis, we will utilize electronic medical records to develop dynamic cancer treatment strategies that advice clinicians and patients based on patient characteristics, medical history, and etc. The research hopes to bridge the understanding between causal inference and decision analysis and ultimately develops an artificial intelligence tool that improves clinical outcomes over current practices.
