The lack of annotated data in many languages is a well-known challenge within the field of multilingual natural language processing (NLP). Therefore, many recent studies focus on zero-shot transfer learning and joint training across languages to overcome data scarcity for low-resource languages. In this work we (i) perform a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art multilingual word and sentence encoders on the tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and part of speech (POS) tagging; and (ii) propose a new method for creating multilingual contextualized word embeddings, compare it to multiple baselines and show that it performs at or above state-of-the-art level in zero-shot transfer settings. Finally, we show that our method allows for better knowledge sharing across languages in a joint training setting.
