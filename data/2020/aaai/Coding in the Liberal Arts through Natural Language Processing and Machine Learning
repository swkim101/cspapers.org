An initiative recently established at our institution is creating new opportunities for students to deepen their understanding of code and computational thinking, and to embrace questions of access, equity and social justice. In this short paper we report on two contextualized computing courses in this initiative that introduce coding and computational thinking through contextualizing two subfields of AI: Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The goal was two-fold: to help students gain foundational computational skills to further their own creative and critical practices; and more broadly, to help them develop better-informed critiques of the use of algorithmic systems, especially AI technology.
