Deep neural models for relation extraction tend to be less reliable when perfectly labeled data is limited, despite their success in label-sufficient scenarios. Instead of seeking more instance-level labels from human annotators, here we propose to annotate frequent surface patterns to form labeling rules. These rules can be automatically mined from large text corpora and generalized via a soft rule matching mechanism. Prior works use labeling rules in an exact matching fashion, which inherently limits the coverage of sentence matching and results in the low-recall issue. In this paper, we present a neural approach to ground rules for RE, named Nero, which jointly learns a relation extraction module and a soft matching module. One can employ any neural relation extraction models as the instantiation for the RE module. The soft matching module learns to match rules with semantically similar sentences such that raw corpora can be automatically labeled and leveraged by the RE module (in a much better coverage) as augmented supervision, in addition to the exactly matched sentences. Extensive experiments and analysis on two public and widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Nero framework, comparing with both rule-based and semi-supervised methods. Through user studies, we find that the time efficiency for a human to annotate rules and sentences are similar (0.30 vs. 0.35 min per label). In particular, Neroâ€™s performance using 270 rules is comparable to the models trained using 3,000 labeled sentences, yielding a 9.5x speedup. Moreover, Nero can predict for unseen relations at test time and provide interpretable predictions. We release our code1 to the community for future research.
