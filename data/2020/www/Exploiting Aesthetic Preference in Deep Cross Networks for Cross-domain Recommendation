Visual aesthetics of products plays an important role in the decision process when purchasing appearance-first products, e.g., clothes. Indeed, user’s aesthetic preference, which serves as a personality trait and a basic requirement, is domain independent and could be used as a bridge between domains for knowledge transfer. However, existing work has rarely considered the aesthetic information in product images for cross-domain recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new deep Aesthetic Cross-Domain Networks (ACDN), in which parameters characterizing personal aesthetic preferences are shared across networks to transfer knowledge between domains. Specifically, we first leverage an aesthetic network to extract aesthetic features. Then, we integrate these features into a cross-domain network to transfer users’ domain independent aesthetic preferences. Moreover, network cross-connections are introduced to enable dual knowledge transfer across domains. Finally, the experimental results on real-world datasets show that our proposed model ACDN outperforms benchmark methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.
