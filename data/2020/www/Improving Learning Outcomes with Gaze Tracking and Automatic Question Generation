As AI technology advances, it offers promising opportunities to improve educational outcomes when integrated with an overall learning experience. We investigate forward-looking interactive reading experiences that leverage both automatic question generation and analysis of attention signals, such as gaze tracking, to improve short- and long-term learning outcomes. We aim to expand the known pedagogical benefits of adjunct questions to more general reading scenarios, by investigating the benefits of adjunct questions generated after participants attend to passages in an article, based on their gaze behavior. We also compare the effectiveness of manually-written questions with those produced by Automatic Question Generation (AQG). We further investigate gaze and reading patterns indicative of low vs. high learning in both short- and long-term scenarios (one-week followup). We show AQG-generated adjunct questions have promise as a way to scale to a wide variety of reading material where the cost of manually curating questions may be prohibitive.
