Consumer IoT networks are characterized by heterogeneous devices with diverse functionality and programming interfaces. This lack of homogeneity makes the integration and secure management of IoT infrastructures a daunting task for users and administrators. In this paper, we introduce VISCR, a Vendor-Independent policy Specification and Conflict Resolution engine that enables intent-based conflict-free policy specification and enforcement in IoT environments. VISCR converts the topology of the IoT infrastructure into a tree-based abstraction and translates existing policies from heterogeneous vendor-specific programming languages, such as Groovy-based SmartThings, OpenHAB, IFTTT-based templates, and MUD-based profiles, into a vendor-independent graph-based specification. These are then used to automatically detect rogue policies, policy conflicts, and automation bugs. We evaluated VISCR using a dataset of 907 IoT apps, programmed using heterogeneous automation specifications, in a simulated smart-building IoT infrastructure. In our experiments, among 907 IoT apps, VISCR exposed 342 of IoT apps as exhibiting one or more violations, while also running 14.2x faster than the state-of-the-art tool (Soteria). VISCR detected 100% of violations reported by Soteria while also detecting new types of violations in 266 additional apps.
