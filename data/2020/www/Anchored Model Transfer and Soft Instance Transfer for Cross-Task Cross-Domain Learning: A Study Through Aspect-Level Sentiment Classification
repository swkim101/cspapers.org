Supervised learning relies heavily on readily available labelled data to infer an effective classification function. However, proposed methods under the supervised learning paradigm are faced with the scarcity of labelled data within domains, and are not generalized enough to adapt to other tasks. Transfer learning has proved to be a worthy choice to address these issues, by allowing knowledge to be shared across domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose two transfer learning methods Anchored Model Transfer (AMT) and Soft Instance Transfer (SIT), which are both based on multi-task learning, and account for model transfer and instance transfer, and can be combined into a common framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMT and SIT for aspect-level sentiment classification showing the competitive performance against baseline models on benchmark datasets. Interestingly, we show that the integration of both methods AMT+SIT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the same task.
