Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging architecture that supports ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth services by deploying servers at the edge of the network to provide computing and storage resources. Recent studies tend to combine (Network Function Virtualization) NFV with MEC and deploy (Virtualized Network Functions) VNFs on MEC servers to achieve fast access to the edge user equipment (UE). However, to guarantee the QoS requirements of mobile users, it is necessary to migrate VNFs to an advisable edge server when users move across Base Stations (BS). How to choose the target BS for VNFs migration? How to select the path for VNF data migration? How to ensure the QoS of user services during the migration process? To solve these issues, we study the seamless VNFs migration problem in mobile edge networks and formulate it as an ILP model, which aims to minimize the migration delay and cost. Then we propose a migration algorithm based on Dijkstra (MBD) to obtain the migration destination BS and migration paths. We implement the mathematical model in Gurobi and design a Greedy algorithm to compare the performance with the MBD algorithm. The experiment results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.
