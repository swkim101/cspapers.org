Private deployments of 4G and 5G networks in industrial environments are beneficial from various aspects. Private 4G/5G networks typically face the challenge of supporting heterogeneous industrial applications. This technology demonstration highlights the importance of network slicing in private 4G/5G networks. It shows that network slicing is crucial for performance guarantees in multiservice co-existence scenarios. With network slicing, our private 4G/5G network successfully supports closed-loop control, event-driven control and video streaming applications.
