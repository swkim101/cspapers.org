Network function virtualization (NFV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) enable internet service providers (ISPs) to deploy service function chains (SFCs) to achieve the convenience and performance benefit without incurring high service delay, capital expenditures, and operating expenses. In MEC-NFV networks, network services are deployed in the form of service function chains (SFCs), each consisting of an ordered set of virtual network functions (VNFs). In this paper, we focus on the VNF placement problem in MEC-NFV enabled networks, aiming to optimize the throughput of SFC requests (SFCRs). First, we involve the sharing mechanism of VNF instances in the problem formulations, which can improve network resource utilization and save more node resources. Then we formulate the problem mathematically and propose a correlation-based mapping algorithm to map SFCRs in the network. Moreover, we design an adjustment algorithm to optimize the mapped SFCRs. Evaluation results show that our proposed solution efficiently improves the throughput of SFCRs compared with the benchmarks.
