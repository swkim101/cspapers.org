We propose a hybrid system of combining mobile sensor nodes and fixed sensor nodes for robust and effective public management, analysis, and prediction. In the proposed system, user privacy protection (on device, edge, and cloud) is implemented via the design of multiple levels of data sensitivity protection: User activities and location data are anonymized, consented, and aggregated (via edge computing at public infrastructures) before uploading for analysis; Specially designed event tokens are distributed for information/notification flowing and matching, and sharing user sensitive data is avoided; Event tokens also link hierarchical user groups combined with blockchain based technologies. Our system facilitates matching between user private data and public data without compromising privacy.
