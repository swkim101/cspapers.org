In this paper, we propose iCellSpeed, an on-device solution to increase data access speed by substantiating unrealized performance potentials. We find that performance potentials are missed in today's mobile networks, as the data speed a user device gets is much lower than what the device could get. The issue is rooted in the current cell selection practice, which misses good candidate cells that offer faster access speed, thus under-utilizing the available capabilities in mobile networks. We design iCellSpeed to facilitate network-controlled cell selection with proactive device-side assistance towards more desirable cells. Our evaluation over AT&T and Verizon confirms its effectiveness. iCellSpeed increases data access speed by more than 10 Mbps at 79% of test locations (> 25Mbps at 29% of locations, up to 80.6 Mbps). It doubles access speed at 62.5% of locations with the gain up to 28.4x. Datasets are available at [9].
