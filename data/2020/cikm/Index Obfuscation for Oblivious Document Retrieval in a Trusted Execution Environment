This paper studies privacy-aware inverted index design and document retrieval for multi-keyword document search in a trusted hardware execution environment such as Intel SGX. The previous work uses time-consuming oblivious computing techniques to avoid the leakage of memory access patterns for privacy preservations in such an environment. This paper proposes an efficiency-enhanced design that obfuscates the inverted index structure with posting bucketing and document ID masking, which aims to hide document-term association and avoid the access pattern leakage. This paper describes privacy-aware oblivious document retrieval during online query processing based on such an index. Both privacy and efficiency analyses are provided, followed by evaluation results comparing proposed designs with multiple baselines.
