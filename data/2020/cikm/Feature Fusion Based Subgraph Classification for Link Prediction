Link prediction, which centers on whether or not a pair of nodes is likely to be connected, is a fundamental problem in complex network analysis. Network-embedding-based link prediction has shown strong performance and robustness in previous studies on complex networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs. This approach has certain drawbacks, however; namely, the hierarchical structure of a subgraph is ignored and the importance of different nodes is not distinguished. In this study, we established the Subgraph Hierarchy Feature Fusion (SHFF) model for link prediction. To probe the existence of links between node pairs, the SHFF first extracts a subgraph around the two nodes and learns a function to map the subgraph to a vector for subsequent classification. This reveals any link between the two target nodes. The SHFF learns a function to obtain a representation of the extracted subgraph by hierarchically aggregating the features of nodes in that subgraph, which is accomplished by grouping nodes with similar structures and assigning different importance to the nodes during the feature fusion process. We compared the proposed model against other state-of-the-art link-prediction methods on a wide range of data sets to find that it consistently outperforms them.
