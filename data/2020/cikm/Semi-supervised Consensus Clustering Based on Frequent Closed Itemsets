Semi-supervised consensus clustering integrates supervised information into consensus clustering in order to improve the quality of clustering. In this paper, we study the novel Semi-MultiCons semi-supervised consensus clustering method extending the previous MultiCons approach. Semi-MultiCons aims to improve the clustering result by integrating pairwise constraints in the consensus creation process and infer the number of clusters K using frequent closed itemsets extracted from the ensemble members. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-art semi-supervised consensus algorithms.
