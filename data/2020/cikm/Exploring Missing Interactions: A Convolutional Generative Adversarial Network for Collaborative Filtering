Adversarial examples can be detrimental to a recommender,leading to a surging enthusiasm for applying adversarial learning to improve recommendation performance, e.g. raising model robustness, alleviating data sparsity, generating initial profiles for cold-start users or items, etc. Most existing adversarial example generation methods fall within three categories: attacking the user-item interactions or auxiliary contents, adding perturbations in latent space, sampling the latent space according to certain distribution. In this work, we focus on the semantic-rich user-item interactions in a recommender system and propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) named Convolutional Generative Collaborative Filtering (Conv-GCF). We develop an effective perturbation mechanism (adversarial noise layer) for convolutional neural networks (CNN), based on which we design a generator with residual blocks to synthesize user-item interactions. We empirically demonstrate that on Conv-GCF, the adversarial noise layer is superior to the conventional noise-adding approach. Moreover, we propose two types of discriminators: one using Bayes Personalized Ranking (BPR) and the other with binary classification. On four public datasets, we show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art top-n recommendation performance among competitive baselines.
