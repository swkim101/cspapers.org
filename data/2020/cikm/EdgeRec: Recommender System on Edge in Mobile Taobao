Recommender system (RS) has become a crucial module in most web-scale applications. Recently, most RSs are in the waterfall form based on the cloud-to-edge framework, where recommended results are transmitted to edge (e.g., user mobile) by computing in advance in the cloud server. Despite effectiveness, network bandwidth and latency between cloud server and edge may cause the delay for system feedback and user perception. Hence, real-time computing on edge could help capture user preferences more preciously and thus make more satisfactory recommendations. Our work, to our best knowledge, is the first attempt to design and implement the novel Recommender System on Edge (EdgeRec), which achieves Real-time User Perception and Real-time System Feedback. Moreover, we propose Heterogeneous User Behavior Sequence Modeling and Context-aware Reranking with Behavior Attention Networks to capture user's diverse interests and adjust recommendation results accordingly. Experimental results on both the offline evaluation and online performance in Taobao home-page feeds demonstrate the effectiveness of EdgeRec.
