Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) have been ubiquitous in the real-world. HIN embeddings, which encode various information of the networks into low-dimensional vectors, can facilitate a wide range of applications on graph-structured data. Existing HIN embedding methods include random walk based methods that may not fully utilize the edge semantics and knowledge graph embedding methods that restrict the expression ability of topological information. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive embedding framework, which integrates these two kinds of methods to preserve both topological information and relational information. By incorporating an assistant knowledge graph embedding model, the proposed framework performs efficient biased random walk under the guidance of edge semantics.
