The technique of recursive neighborhood aggregation has dominated the implementation of existing successful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the recursive information propagation across layers inevitably brings in extra calculations, potentially large variance, and difficulty of parallel computation. In this paper, we propose Graph Unfolding Networks (GUNets) as an alternative mechanism of recursive neighborhood aggregation for graph representation learning. Comparing to generic GNNs, our proposed GUNets are efficient, robust and practically effective. At their core, GUNets unfold the local structure of every node, i.e. the rooted tree, to a set of trajectories, and then adopt set function to capture the topology of the rooted subtree, which is more convenient for parallel computation than the recursive neighborhood aggregation process. More importantly, through a specific design of the set function, our architecture enables efficient and robust learning on large-scale graphs without resorting to any pruning of the rooted subtree that is usually necessary in generic GNNs. Extensive experiments on five large datasets (the number of nodes ranges from 104 to 106) show that our GUNets achieve comparable or even better results than current successful GNNs while gaining significantly more efficiency and lower accuracy variance.
