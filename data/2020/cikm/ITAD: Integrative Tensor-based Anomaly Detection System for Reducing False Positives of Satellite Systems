Reducing false positives while detecting anomalies is of growing importance for various industrial applications and mission-critical infrastructures, including satellite systems. Undesired false positives can be costly for such systems, bringing the operation to a halt for human experts to determine if the anomalies are true anomalies that need to be mitigated. Although rule-based or machine learning-based anomaly detection approaches have been studied, a tensor-based decomposition method has not been extensively explored. In this work, we introduce an Integrative Tensor-based Anomaly Detection (ITAD) framework to detect anomalies in a satellite system with the goal of minimizing false positives. We construct 3rd-order tensors with telemetry data collected from the Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2 (KOMPSAT-2) and calculate the anomaly score using one of the component matrices obtained by applying CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition to detect anomalies. Our result shows that our tensor-based approach outperforms existing methods, achieving higher accuracy and lower false positive rates. And we successfully deployed our anomaly detection system in real KOMPSAT-2 mission operation.
