This joint panel between UIST and CSCW brings together leading researchers at the intersection of the conferences-systems researchers in collaborative and social computing-to engage in a discussion and retrospective. Pairs of panelists will represent each decade since the founding of the conferences, sharing a brief retrospective that surveys the most influential papers of that decade, the zeitgeist of the problems that were popular that decade and why, and what each decade's work has to say to the decades that came before and after. The panel is intended as a space to celebrate advances in the field, and reflect on the burdens and opportunities that it faces ahead.
