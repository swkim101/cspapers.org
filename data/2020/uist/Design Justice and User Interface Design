In this keynote talk, Dr. Costanza-Chock will explore the theory and practice of design justice, discuss how design affordances, disaffordances, and dysaffordances distribute benefits and burdens unequally according to users? location within the matrix of domination (white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, ableism, capitalism, and settler colonialism), and invite us to consider how user interface designers can intentionally contribute to building ?a better world?, a world where many worlds fit; linked worlds of collective liberation and ecological sustainability.
