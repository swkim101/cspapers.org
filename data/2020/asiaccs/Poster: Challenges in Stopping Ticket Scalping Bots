The existence of ticket scalpers is a negative impact to all performers, audience, and primary ticket sellers. Automated ticket scalping bots, especially, generate serious damages to the online ticketing systems, and cause an extremely unfair competition between malicious ticket scalpers and normal users. However, little work had been done to address this security issue and propose solutions. In this paper, we will formulate this problem, propose an evaluation framework to systematize some known defenses, and provide several directions that can be further researched to mitigate automated ticket scalping bots.
