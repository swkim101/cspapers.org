As many U.S. states continue to work to increase and broaden participation in K-20 computing education, it is imperative to collect data and construct landscape reports to create organized efforts and strategic plans. Effective CS education interventions, and strategic plans, must be data-driven in order to ensure that all students have access to and are retained in high quality K- 20 computer science pathways (Stanton et al., 2017). The Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance, and the 23 member states, have been leaders in the development and promotion of state-level landscape reports. Several ECEP states have successfully designed, delivered, and analyzed data collection tools to landscape the current status of computer science education within their own state (e.g., Maryland, Indiana, Texas). However, there have been instances where data collected by different stakeholders have provided conflicting perspectives and viewpoints. Conflicting data, data that fails to account for intersectionality, or leaves out critical populations or context, potentially distracts time and effort from broadening participation in computing. This session will provide a platform for researchers and evaluators to discuss data relevant to BPC efforts, how to develop surveys, and how to structure and disseminate reports.
