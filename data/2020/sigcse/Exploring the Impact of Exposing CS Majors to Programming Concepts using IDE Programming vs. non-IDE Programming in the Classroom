Due to the increased demand for computer scientists in the, the importance to improve the retention rate of CS majors who could potentially fill such positions has been ongoing. Literature has produced many efforts for increasing the engagement of CS majors in the field while also exploring ways to improve their ability to develop the ideal skill sets for success. In such efforts, our research explores the impact of visual and/or command-line based programming editors and their ability to shape the students' mental model as they learn to program. This abstract discusses a "think-aloud" protocol assessment that was conducted on two entry level programming courses at a university in the United States during the 2018-2019 school year. The objective of this assessment was to determine whether Repl.IT, a web-based IDE, and Cygwin/Nano Editor, a command line-based tool, impacted student performance while being used for programming. Our preliminary results showed that 41% of the students using Repl.IT completed the assigned task for the assessment, while 53% of the students using the Cygwin/Nano editor did the same. The results concerning assignment incompletion revealed that students who did not complete their assignment and used Repl.IT did so because of assignment complexity and programming language difficulty, whereas assignment complexity and tool usage difficulty lead to assignment incompletion for students using Cygwin/Nano. This assessment also revealed that Repl.IT students exhibited a higher comfort, confidence, and fondness for using their editor than the Cygwin/Nano students.
