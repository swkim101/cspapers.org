We need to greatly expand the number of students studying cybersecurity in order to meet the increasing demand for security professionals. As a community, we can use our expertise and alliances with other fields to create interdisciplinary courses and modules to attract diverse students into cybersecurity. For example, Liberal Arts Colleges have a strong core general education curriculum that can be enhanced with cybersecurity concepts. On one hand, students from non-CS majors are important for the cybersecurity workforce as they will be shaping the policies and business processes that affect cybersecurity decisions. On the other hand, well rounded CS students that take interdisciplinary security courses and CS1 will be able to apply the concepts and solve today's complex security problems. This BoF will explore ideas for integrating the technical content of cybersecurity with political science, business, law, psychology, philosophy, international affairs, and others. Participants from colleges, universities and K-12 will be able to co-create plans for these interdisciplinary experiences. We will discuss possible ways to integrate security-related topics hands-on exercises into existing courses from other fields or the general education core curriculum. The questions we will ask are, "Have you created interdisciplinary courses or modules? If so, what was your experience? Were there problems? If you had no resource or policy constraints, what would an interdisciplinary security curriculum look like at your school?" We will generate a list of ideas and disseminate that publicly.
