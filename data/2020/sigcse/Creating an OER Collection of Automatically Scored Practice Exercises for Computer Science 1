Open Educational Resources (OER) is one way to help reduce the cost of higher education. We created a repository of 90 (and growing) practice problems for learning introductory programming using Python 3. In order to provide immediate feedback to learners as well as alleviate the scoring burden on instructors, these exercises include tests for a popular automatic web based scoring platform. We have been using and refining these materials for the past four semesters and collecting student user survey data. Overall, students have had a positive reaction to the practice format.
