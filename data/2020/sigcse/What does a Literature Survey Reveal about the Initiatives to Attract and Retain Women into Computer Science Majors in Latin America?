Among the many papers describing initiatives to recruit and re- tain women into Computer Science (CS) majors, the vast majority focus on the United States and Europe. This poster addresses the research question: "What does the literature tell us about inter- ventions for women in CS majors in Latin America?". We have analyzed papers indexed by Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and the Latin America Women in Computing Conference (LAWCC) using a systematic literature review process. We found papers from ten countries covering initiatives at different educational levels to increase the participation of women in Computing majors in Latin America.
