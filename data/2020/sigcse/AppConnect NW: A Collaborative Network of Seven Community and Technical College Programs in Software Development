AppConnect NW is a network of seven community and technical colleges in the Puget Sound region offering applied baccalaureate degrees in software and application development. As the need for qualified developers continues to increase, the AppConnect NW colleges are preparing the next generation of the workforce with the most in-demand skills, technologies, and hands-on project experience. The network is engaging with the Washington Technology Industry Association, regional employers, local high schools, and graduate schools to increase the awareness of applied bachelor's degree pathways and support the local talent pipeline. Faculty collaborate across colleges on industry-driven curriculum that prepares students for careers in technology. The purpose of this lightning talk is to share some of the initial results of the project (year two, out of a four-year project) and to share opportunities for further work in developing similar regional collaboration networks.
