Online learning is useful for expanding educational offerings. This is crucial for institutions with limited space and courses with high demand. Universities still need to be mindful about the quality of their online offerings, and ensure that it meets higher education standards. In this work we present a retrospective comparison between concurrent offerings (one online and one in classroom) of a discrete math course. The online course was carefully designed to be as challenging as the classroom one. We note the key takeaways from the experience.
