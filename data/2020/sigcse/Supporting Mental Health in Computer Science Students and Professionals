Long hours, pressure to meet deadlines, lacking a sense of belonging, and fear of failure are just some of the stressors that affect Computer Science students and professionals alike, leading to burnout, anxiety, and depression. Although this issue is by no means unique to the field of computing, there is significant need for awareness and support around student mental health in the CS education community. In this timely and important session, panelists will discuss the mental health issues that affect CS students, present resources that are available to students and educators, and describe their efforts to create and foster a culture of understanding and support within their communities.
