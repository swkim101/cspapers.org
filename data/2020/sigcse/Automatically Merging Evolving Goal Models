Goal models helped stakeholders make trade-off decisions in the early stages of project development. While these models were well studied within the academy they had yet to see broad industrial adoption, with the construction of large realistic goal models acting as a significant barrier. Recent work suggested creating models piecemeal, and then merging them together. This merge algorithm had only been demonstrated manually and was time consuming due to unnecessary repetition, as well as deferring all decisions to the user. We aimed to automate the majority of the merge algorithm. We divided this project into two parts: (1) merging the content of goal models, and (2) creating a visual representation of the merged model. Since this work extended prior work on evolving goal models we also considered merging timing information. Using a motivating example, we discussed how we handled conflicts between node names and types, as will as conflicts across multiple time scales. We improved the original algorithm by simplifying evolving functions described over multiple intervals, where possible, and proved the correctness of these changes. We extended a force-directed algorithm to include goal model heuristics to alter the relative position of node types, which made for an aesthetically pleasing layout. To demonstrate effectiveness and scalability of the algorithm, we implemented our automated algorithm in BloomingLeaf, an analysis and modeling tool that allows stakeholders to model goals and intentions.
