Software Engineering courses often incorporate large-scale projects with collaboration between students working in teams. However, it is difficult to objectively assess individual students when their projects are a product of collaborative efforts. This study explores measurements of individuals' contributions to their respective teams. I analyzed ten Software Engineering team projects (n=42) and evaluations of individual contributions using automated evaluation of the version control system history (Git logs) and user stories completed on their project management (Kanban) boards. Unique insights from meta-data within the Git history and Kanban board user stories reveal complicated relationships between these measurements and traditional assessments, such as peer review and subjective instructor evaluation. From the results, I suggest supplementing and validating traditional assessments with insights from individuals' commit history and user story contributions.
