The field of formal methods relies on a large body of background knowledge that can dissuade researchers from engaging with younger students, such as undergraduates or high school students. However, we have found that formal methods can be an excellent entry point to computer science research - especially in the framing of Computing Identity-based Mentorship. We report on our experience in using a cascading mentorship model to involve early stage researchers in formal methods, covering our process with these students from recruitment to publication. We present case studies (N=12) of our cascading mentorship and how we were able to integrate formal methods research with the students' own interests. We outline some key strategies that have led to success and reflect on strategies that have been, in our experience, inefficient.
