Front-end development skills are a practical necessity for creating impactful "real-world" systems. Yet universities don't often prioritize skills-focused courses such as web or mobile development that teach students to design and implement user-facing systems. We believe our curricula should include these skills and stacks, and that they are a key practice through which foundational CS concepts are applied. While other technology areas have research- or education-focused conferences, front-end programming and design skill-sets are mostly relegated to professional conferences where little time is focused on education. Currently there is no way for people teaching web and mobile development in higher education to easily connect. This BoF will gather as-of-yet unconnected instructors in these areas. We will discuss questions of practice, and share expertise and support around how to best teach these user-focused skills. How can you and your students keep up with rapid changes to programming languages such as JavaScript or Swift? Should teaching focus on a particular framework such as React or Vue (or something else)-and if so which one? What is the role of "no code" tools (e.g., Webflow, Bubble.io) in teaching front-end development? Should you teach front-end courses like a traditional CS course or like a code bootcamp? How can you integrate foundational skills in your web and mobile development courses? Does your department want to teach these practical skills, but lacks the resources, faculty or knowledge to do so? Let's share and discuss.
