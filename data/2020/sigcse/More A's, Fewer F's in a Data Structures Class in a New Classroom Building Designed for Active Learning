Recognizing the value of evidence-based active learning teaching methods, as well as the need for higher-order skills in its increasingly diverse student body, the University of California, Irvine recently invested $62 million in a new classroom building designed for active learning. We report first experiences in transforming a Data Structures class to take advantage of this space. The specially designed environment made it easier for students to collaborate on problem solving, discuss their solutions with each other, and share them with the entire class for further discussion. Survey data showed that students appreciated the benefits of the space and the active learning exercises. Compared to a previous offering of the course taught by the same instructor in a traditional lecture hall, students in this highly-structured active learning classroom were more likely to earn an A grade (41% vs 75%), and three times less likely to fail (6.7% vs 2.1%).
