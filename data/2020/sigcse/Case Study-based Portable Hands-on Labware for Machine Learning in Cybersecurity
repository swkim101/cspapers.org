Machine Learning (ML) analyzes, and processes data and develop patterns. In the case of cybersecurity, it helps to better analyze previous cyber attacks and develop proactive strategy to detect and prevent the security threats. Both ML and cybersecurity are important subjects in computing curriculum, but ML for cybersecurity is not well presented there. We design and develop case-study based portable labware on Google CoLab for ML to cybersecurity so that students can access and practice these hands-on labs anywhere and anytime without time tedious installation and configuration which will help students more focus on learning of concepts and getting more experience for hands-on problem solving skills.
