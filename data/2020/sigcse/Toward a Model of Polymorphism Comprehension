Polymorphism is challenging for novice programmers because it is an emergent consequence of multiple language features. OO polymorphism is critical to flexible software design, but no model currently explains student comprehension. In this research, students implemented the Strategy pattern to improve their comprehension of polymorphism, then were assessed by professional developers in whiteboard interviews. From these data, the authors work toward deriving a model of novice comprehension of polymorphism.
