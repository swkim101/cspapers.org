This lightning talk will discuss the current efforts to identify and analyze the possibility of language bias in documents, exams, technical interviews, and actual interviews used in computer science as contributing factors in the continued lack of participation/success of underrepresented populations in computers science despite extensive efforts to develop a more inclusive environment. Although many factors have been examined while attempting to explain the continued lack of participation/success of under-represented populations in computer science, language bias in the very instruments that are used to measure success and entry does not seem to be among the forefront of these endeavors. This work is inspired by previous work done to examine biased language based upon neutral point of view (NPOV) revisions done on Wikipedia pages and seeks to apply similar methodologies to computer science instruments of evaluation in order to determine if there may indeed be a subtle and unconscious language bias within them.
