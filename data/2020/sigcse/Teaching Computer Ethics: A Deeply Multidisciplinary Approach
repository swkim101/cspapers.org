We report on a curricular experiment at Stanford University focused on teaching computer ethics. After nearly a year of preparation, we launched a new course at the intersection of ethics, public policy, and technology that deeply marries the humanities, social sciences, and computer science. While the teaching of computer ethics courses dates back decades, such courses are often taught by a (single) CS faculty member without significant training in ethics, do not include a policy component, and are meant for CS students. By contrast, we take a deeply multidisciplinary approach, where three faculty instructors, from philosophy, political science, and CS, each bring their respective lens to four related course modules: algorithmic decision-making, data privacy and civil liberties, AI and autonomous systems, and the power of platform companies. Panels of guest speakers drawn from academia, industry, civil society, and government provide a practitioner's view of the topics addressed. Additionally, custom case studies were developed under the direction of the course staff. These materials (videos of the speaker panels and the case studies) are freely available for use by the broader community. We report on the details of the course structure, including how multiple disciplines are integrated throughout the course, including lectures, discussions, and assignments. We discuss aspects of the course that worked well as well as challenges in making the course broadly accessible (beyond just CS majors). Importantly, we also include a discussion of students' response to the course, showing that a deeply multidisciplinary approach resonates strongly with them.
