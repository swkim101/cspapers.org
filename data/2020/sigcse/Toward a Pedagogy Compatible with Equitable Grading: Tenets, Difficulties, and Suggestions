Improving one's understanding of teaching and learning and applying it to instructional practice is a continuous process. While a few of us may be natural teachers, most of us need guidance to follow when planning and implementing instruction for the courses we teach. As we have examined our practice, we've discovered that we typically begin planning with instructional activity, but our plans are not done until we have explicated a grading plan (and then revised instructional plans to fit it). Recently, we have begun working with a grading plan motivated by equitable grading, an idea we first encountered in the book Grading for Equity by Joe Feldman. We have found that adopting an equitable grading plan has provided us with a framework for course design that has significantly improved our pedagogy. In this poster, we present the first work on implementing equitable grading in computer science education.
