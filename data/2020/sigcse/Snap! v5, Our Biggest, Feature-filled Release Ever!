In early June, we released Snap! version 5, with more new features than in any previous release. We now have a community website where users can share and publish projects so others can find and remix them, and where they can ask questions and discuss the beauty and joy of computing. We can now embed Snap! projects in other web pages. We've also enhanced the programming language, making it easier to discover and to use powerful blocks for analyzing data and transforming media. Did you know you can now use the video motion from the camera as an input device? How about painting by whistling? There's nothing that beats a live demonstration of all these wonderful features, and we have two veteran power users to take it through its paces.
