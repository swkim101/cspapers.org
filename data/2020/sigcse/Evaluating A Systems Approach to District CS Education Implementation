Computer science education exists within a broader education environment than individual classrooms. Formal, or during the school day, K-12 education requires implementation within schools and local education agencies with leadership structures, budgets, and often competing priorities. In this experience report we share outcomes from a series of district workshops for supporting critical systems planning needed to ensure the integration and sustainability of computer science education within K-12 systems. The paper will briefly discuss the program's theory of change, the actions CSforALL took to deliver the program at scale, and data with short and long term outcomes from program implementation. Discussion will include the intersection of program and curricular and professional development and the critical frame of continuous improvement as a theoretical model for sustainability and rigor in computer science education implementation.
