Peer-instruction has been shown to be an effective method to support learning. We exploit a form of peer-instruction in an undergraduate course on databases, where students take an exam in teams. Instantly after attempting the exam individually without any immediate feedback, students re-take the exam as a group utilizing immediate feedback instruments. These instruments permit the students to tackle each multiple-choice question several times until a correct answer is uncovered. Our thesis is that this approach provides the students with an opportunity to learn from their mistakes, whether committed individually or as a group, while promoting individual student deep learning. We support this thesis by analyzing data collected from 125 students, 5 group exams, and other assessment instruments, including a final exam.
