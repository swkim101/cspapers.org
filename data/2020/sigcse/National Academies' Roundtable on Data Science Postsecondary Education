The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Roundtable on Data Science Postsecondary Education convened more than twenty experts from a variety of sectors and academic areas to facilitate discussions on current practices, needs, and next steps in data science education. Participants described the interdisciplinary nature of data science, emphasizing contributions from computer science, statistics, and mathematics. Over three years the Roundtable discussed a broad range of topics, including partnerships between industry and academia and strategies to better engage women and minorities. This panel will synthesize themes and disseminate materials from the twelve Roundtable meetings, highlighting the role of computer science concepts in data science education while also encouraging partnerships across disciplines.
