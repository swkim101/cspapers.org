Policymakers believe that preparing all students from the earliest grades to high school for a new future of STEM+Computing (STEM+C) integration involves teaching them not only the science and math central to these areas, but also how computational thinking is integral to STEM disciplines. This panel brings together four researchers who focus on research and development of interdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within STEM teaching and learning for preK-12 students. They will share the most impactful, practical, and promising approaches to STEM+C integration, their pros and cons, challenges, and key insights to successful STEM+C integration at all grade levels.
