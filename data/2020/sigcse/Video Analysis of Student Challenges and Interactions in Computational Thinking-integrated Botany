This study aimed to understand elementary students' challenges and interactions in computational thinking-integrated botany through robotics activities. Data was collected from screen-casting videos and analyzed using Collaborative Computing Observation Instrument (CCOI), a web-based analysis instrument with nodes and paths that classify and specify students' computing experience. The results revealed that all participants engaged in independent work for most of the time, with short interactions on 1) general computer technology issues; 2) software navigating issues; 3) questions about academic content; 4) computing discussion with the instructor; 5) informing the instructor about task accomplishment. The findings of this study will provide important insights to CS researchers, educators, and elementary teachers regarding CT-integration research and practice.
