Since the new privacy feature in iOS enabling users to acknowledge which app is reading or writing to his or her clipboard through prompting notifications was updated, a plethora of top apps have been reported to frequently access the clipboard without user consent. However, the lack of monitoring and control of Android application's access to the clipboard data leave Android users blind to their potential to leak private information from Android clipboards, raising severe security and privacy concerns. In this preliminary work, we envisage and investigate an approach to (i) dynamically detect clipboard access behaviour, and (ii) determine privacy leaks via static data flow analysis, in which we enhance the results of taint analysis with call graph concatenation to enable leakage source backtracking. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed method can expose clipboard data leakage as substantiated by our discovery of a popular app, i.e., Sogou Input, directly monitoring and transferring user data in a clipboard to backend servers.
