With the influx of Web 3.0 the focus in Big Data Analytics has shifted towards modelling highly interconnected data and analysing relationships between them. Graph databases befit the requirements of Big Data Analytics yet organizations still depend on relational databases. A major roadblock in the industry wide adoption of graph databases is that a standard query language is still in its inception stage hence withholding interoperability between the two technologies. In this research we propose a tool FLUX for translating relational database queries to graph database queries.
