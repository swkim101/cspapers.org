The field of Interactive Coding studies how an interactive protocol can be made resilient to channel errors. Even though this field has received abundant attention since Schulman's seminal paper (FOCS 92), constructing interactive coding schemes that are both deterministic and efficient, and at the same time resilient to adversarial errors (with constant information and error rates), remains an elusive open problem. An appealing approach towards resolving this problem is to construct an efficiently encodable and decodable combinatorial object called a tree code (Schulman, STOC 93). After a lot of effort in this direction, the current state of the art has deterministic constructions of tree codes that are efficiently encodable but require an alphabet of size logarithmic (instead of constant) in the depth of the tree code (Cohen, Haeupler, and Schulman, STOC 18). We emphasize that we still lack (even heuristic) candidate constructions that are efficiently decodable. In this work, we show that tree codes that are efficiently encodable, but not efficiently decodable, also imply deterministic and efficient interactive coding schemes that are resilient to adversarial errors. Our result immediately implies a deterministic and efficient interactive coding scheme with a logarithmic alphabet (i.e., 1/ log log rate). We show this result using a novel implementation of hashing through deterministic tree codes that is powerful enough to yield interactive coding schemes.
