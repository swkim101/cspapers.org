In submodular covering problems, we are given a monotone, nonnegative submodular function $f:2^{\mathcal{N}}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+}$ and wish to find the min-cost set $S\subseteq \mathcal{N}$ such that $f(S)=f(\mathcal{N})$. When $f$ is a coverage function, this captures Setcover as a special case. We introduce a general framework for solving such problems in a fully-dynamic setting where the function $f$ changes over time, and only a bounded number of updates to the solution (a.k.a. recourse) is allowed. For concreteness, suppose a nonnegative monotone submodular integer-valued function $g_{t}$ is added or removed from an active set $G^{(t)}$ at each time $t$. If $f^{(t)}=\sum\nolimits_{g\in G^{(t)}}g$ is the sum of all active functions, we wish to maintain a competitive solution to Submodularcover for $f^{(t)}$ as this active set changes, and with low recourse. For example, if each $g_{t}$ is the (weighted) rank function of a matroid, we would be dynamically maintaining a low-cost common spanning set for a changing collection of matroids. We give an algorithm that maintains an $O(\log(f_{\max}/f_{\min}))$ - competitive solution, where $f_{\max}, f_{\min}$ are the largest/smallest marginals of $f^{(t)}$. The algorithm guarantees a total recourse of $O(\log(c_{\max}/c_{\min})\cdot\sum\nolimits_{t < T}g_{t}(\mathcal{N}))$, where $c_{\min}, c_{\min}$ are the largest/smallest costs of elements in $\mathcal{N}$. This competitive ratio is best possible even in the offline setting, and the recourse bound is optimal up to the logarithmic factor. For monotone sub-modular functions that also have positive mixed third derivatives, we show an optimal recourse bound of $O(\sum\nolimits_{t < T}g_{t}(\mathcal{N}))$. This structured class includes set-coverage functions, so our algorithm matches the known $O(\log n)$-competitiveness and $O(1)$ recourse guarantees for fully-dynamic Setcover. Our work simultaneously simplifies and unifies previous results, as well as generalizes to a significantly larger class of covering problems. Our key technique is a new potential function inspired by Tsallis entropy. We also extensively use the idea of Mutual Coverage, which generalizes the classic notion of mutual information.
