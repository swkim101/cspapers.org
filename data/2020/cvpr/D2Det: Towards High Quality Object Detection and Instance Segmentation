We propose a novel two-stage detection method, D2Det, that collectively addresses both precise localization and accurate classification. For precise localization, we introduce a dense local regression that predicts multiple dense box offsets for an object proposal. Different from traditional regression and keypoint-based localization employed in two-stage detectors, our dense local regression is not limited to a quantized set of keypoints within a fixed region and has the ability to regress position-sensitive real number dense offsets, leading to more precise localization. The dense local regression is further improved by a binary overlap prediction strategy that reduces the influence of background region on the final box regression. For accurate classification, we introduce a discriminative RoI pooling scheme that samples from various sub-regions of a proposal and performs adaptive weighting to obtain discriminative features. On MS COCO test-dev, our D2Det outperforms existing two-stage methods, with a single-model performance of 45.4 AP, using ResNet101 backbone. When using multi-scale training and inference, D2Det obtains AP of 50.1. In addition to detection, we adapt D2Det for instance segmentation, achieving a mask AP of 40.2 with a two-fold speedup, compared to the state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our D2Det on airborne sensors by performing experiments for object detection in UAV images (UAVDT dataset) and instance segmentation in satellite images (iSAID dataset).
