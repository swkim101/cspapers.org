Social interaction is an important topic in human trajectory prediction to generate plausible paths. In this paper, we present a novel insight of group-based social interaction model to explore relationships among pedestrians. We recursively extract social representations supervised by group-based annotations and formulate them into a social behavior graph, called Recursive Social Behavior Graph. Our recursive mechanism explores the representation power largely. Graph Convolutional Neural Network then is used to propagate social interaction information in such a graph. With the guidance of Recursive Social Behavior Graph, we surpass state-of-the-art methods on ETH and UCY dataset for 11.1% in ADE and 10.8% in FDE in average, and successfully predict complex social behaviors.
