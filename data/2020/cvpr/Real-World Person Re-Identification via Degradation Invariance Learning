Person re-identification (Re-ID) in real-world scenarios usually suffers from various degradation factors, e.g., low-resolution, weak illumination, blurring and adverse weather. On the one hand, these degradations lead to severe discriminative information loss, which significantly obstructs identity representation learning; on the other hand, the feature mismatch problem caused by low-level visual variations greatly reduces retrieval performance. An intuitive solution to this problem is to utilize low-level image restoration methods to improve the image quality. However, existing restoration methods cannot directly serve to real-world Re-ID due to various limitations, e.g., the requirements of reference samples, domain gap between synthesis and reality, and incompatibility between low-level and high-level methods. In this paper, to solve the above problem, we propose a degradation invariance learning framework for real-world person Re-ID. By introducing a self-supervised disentangled representation learning strategy, our method is able to simultaneously extract identity-related robust features and remove real-world degradations without extra supervision. We use low-resolution images as the main demonstration, and experiments show that our approach is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several Re-ID benchmarks. In addition, our framework can be easily extended to other real-world degradation factors, such as weak illumination, with only a few modifications.
