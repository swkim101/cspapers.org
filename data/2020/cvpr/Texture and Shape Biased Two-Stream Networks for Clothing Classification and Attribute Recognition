Clothes category classification and attribute recognition have achieved distinguished success with the development of deep learning. People have found that landmark detection plays a positive role in these tasks. However, little research is committed to analyzing these tasks from the perspective of clothing attributes. In our work, we explore the usefulness of landmarks and find that landmarks can assist in extracting shape features; and using landmarks for joint learning can increase classification and recognition accuracy effectively. We also find that texture features have an impelling effect on these tasks and that the pre-trained ImageNet model has good performance in extracting texture features. To this end, we propose to use two streams to enhance the extraction of shape and texture, respectively. In particular, this paper proposes a simple implementation, Texture and Shape biased Fashion Networks (TS-FashionNet). Comprehensive and rich experiments demonstrate our discoveries and the effectiveness of our model. We improve the top-3 classification accuracy by 0.83% and improve the top-3 attribute recognition recall rate by 1.39% compared to the state-of-the-art models.
