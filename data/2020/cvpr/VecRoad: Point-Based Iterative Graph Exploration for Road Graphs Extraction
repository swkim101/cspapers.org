In all the three road metrics, the pixel metric measures the alignment with ground-truth road pixels, the APLS metric measures the connectivity of the road graph, and the junction metric measures the accuracy of junctions and the connectivity with neighbouring vertices of junctions. We argue that the road alignment (both road centerline and junctions) should be firstly guaranteed, then the connectivity will make sense. In another word, the connectivity without precise alignment is of non-sense.
