We introduce a deep learning approach to realistically edit an sRGB image's white balance. Cameras capture sensor images that are rendered by their integrated signal processor (ISP) to a standard RGB (sRGB) color space encoding. The ISP rendering begins with a white-balance procedure that is used to remove the color cast of the scene's illumination. The ISP then applies a series of nonlinear color manipulations to enhance the visual quality of the final sRGB image. Recent work by [3] showed that sRGB images that were rendered with the incorrect white balance cannot be easily corrected due to the ISP's nonlinear rendering. The work in [3] proposed a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) solution based on tens of thousands of image pairs. We propose to solve this problem with a deep neural network (DNN) architecture trained in an end-to-end manner to learn the correct white balance. Our DNN maps an input image to two additional white-balance settings corresponding to indoor and outdoor illuminations. Our solution not only is more accurate than the KNN approach in terms of correcting a wrong white-balance setting but also provides the user the freedom to edit the white balance in the sRGB image to other illumination settings.
