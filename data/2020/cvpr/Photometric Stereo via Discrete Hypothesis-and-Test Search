In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating surface normals of a scene with spatially varying, general BRDFs observed by a static camera under varying, known, distant illumination. Unlike previous approaches that are mostly based on continuous local optimization, we cast the problem as a discrete hypothesis-and-test search problem over the discretized space of surface normals. While a naive search requires a significant amount of time, we show that the expensive computation block can be precomputed in a scene-independent manner, resulting in accelerated inference for new scenes. It allows us to perform a full search over the finely discretized space of surface normals to determine the globally optimal surface normal for each scene point. We show that our method can accurately estimate surface normals of scenes with spatially varying different reflectances in a reasonable amount of time.
