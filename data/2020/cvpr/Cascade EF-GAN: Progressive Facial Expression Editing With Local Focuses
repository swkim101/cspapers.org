Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) have shown remarkable improvements for facial expression editing. However, current methods are still prone to generate artifacts and blurs around expression-intensive regions, and often introduce undesired overlapping artifacts while handling large-gap expression transformations such as transformation from furious to laughing. To address these limitations, we propose Cascade Expression Focal GAN (Cascade EF-GAN), a novel network that performs progressive facial expression editing with local expression focuses. The introduction of the local focus enables the Cascade EF-GAN to better preserve identity-related features and details around eyes, noses and mouths, which further helps reduce artifacts and blurs within the generated facial images. In addition, an innovative cascade transformation strategy is designed by dividing a large facial expression transformation into multiple small ones in cascade, which helps suppress overlapping artifacts and produce more realistic editing while dealing with large-gap expression transformations. Extensive experiments over two publicly available facial expression datasets show that our proposed Cascade EF-GAN achieves superior performance for facial expression editing.
