Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) acquisition is an inherently slow process which has spurred the development of two different acceleration methods: acquiring multiple correlated samples simultaneously (parallel imaging) and acquiring fewer samples than necessary for traditional signal processing methods (compressed sensing). Both methods provide complementary approaches to accelerating MRI acquisition. In this paper, we present a novel method to integrate traditional parallel imaging methods into deep neural networks that is able to generate high quality reconstructions even for high acceleration factors. The proposed method, called GrappaNet, performs progressive reconstruction by first mapping the reconstruction problem to a simpler one that can be solved by a traditional parallel imaging methods using a neural network, followed by an application of a parallel imaging method, and finally fine-tuning the output with another neural network. The entire network can be trained end-to-end. We present experimental results on the recently released fastMRI dataset and show that GrappaNet can generate higher quality reconstructions than competing methods for both 4x and 8x acceleration.
