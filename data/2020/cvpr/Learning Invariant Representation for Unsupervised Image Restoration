Recently, cross domain transfer has been applied for unsupervised image restoration tasks. However, directly applying existing frameworks would lead to domain-shift problems in translated images due to lack of effective supervision. Instead, we propose an unsupervised learning method that explicitly learns invariant presentation from noisy data and reconstructs clear observations. To do so, we introduce discrete disentangling representation and adversarial domain adaption into general domain transfer framework, aided by extra self-supervised modules including background and semantic consistency constraints, learning robust representation under dual domain constraints, such as feature and image domains. Experiments on synthetic and real noise removal tasks show the proposed method achieves comparable performance with other stateof-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods, while having faster and stable convergence than other domain adaption methods.
