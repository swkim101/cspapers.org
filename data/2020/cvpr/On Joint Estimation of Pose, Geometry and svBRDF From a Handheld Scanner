In this supplementary document , we Ô¨Årst provide additional information on our custom-built sensor. Subsequently, we discuss details of the implementation omitted from the main document due to space constraints. Finally we present quantitative and qualitative results, both photometric and geometric, for all nine objects studied in the main paper. The supplementary video gives a high-level overview of our method and provides additional relighting results.
