We propose to construct a view graph to excavate the information of the whole given sequence for absolute camera pose estimation. Specifically, we harness GNNs to model the graph, allowing even non-consecutive frames to exchange information with each other. Rather than adopting the regular GNNs directly, we redefine the nodes, edges, and embedded functions to fit the relocalization task. Redesigned GNNs cooperate with CNNs in guiding knowledge propagation and feature extraction respectively to process multi-view high-dimension image features iteratively at different levels. Besides, a general graph-based loss function beyond constraints between consecutive views is employed for training the network in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments conducted on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches especially in large-scale and challenging scenarios.
