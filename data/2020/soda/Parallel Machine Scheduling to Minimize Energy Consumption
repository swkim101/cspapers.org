Given n jobs with release dates, deadlines and processing times we consider the problem of scheduling them on m parallel machines so as to minimize the total energy consumed. Machines can enter a sleep state and they consume no energy in this state. Each machine requires Q units of energy to awaken from the sleep state and in its active state the machine can process jobs and consumes a unit of energy per unit time. We allow for preemption and migration of jobs and provide the first constant approximation algorithm for this problem.
