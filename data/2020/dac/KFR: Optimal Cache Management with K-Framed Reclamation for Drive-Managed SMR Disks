Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) disks have been proposed as a promising solution to satisfy the increasing capacity need in the big data era. Drive-Managed SMR (DM-SMR) disk which acts as a traditional block device is favored for providing high compatibility. However, DM-SMR disks suffer from high performance recovery time (PRT) due to the "SMR space reclamation" issue. This paper proposes an optimal cache management named K-Framed Reclamation (KFR) to minimize PRT within the DM-SMR disk. The effectiveness of our proposed design was evaluated with realistic and intensive I/O workloads and the results are encouraging.
