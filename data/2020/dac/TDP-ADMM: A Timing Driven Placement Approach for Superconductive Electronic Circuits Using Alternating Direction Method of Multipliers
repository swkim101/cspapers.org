This paper presents a novel timing driven global placement approach utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) targeting superconductive electronic circuits. The proposed algorithm models the placement problem as an optimization problem with constraints on the maximum wirelength delay of timing-critical paths and employs the ADMM algorithm to decompose the problem into two sub-problems, one minimizing the total wirelength of the circuit and the other minimizing the delay of timing-critical paths of the circuit. Through an iterative process, a placement solution is generated that simultaneously minimizes the total wirelength and satisfies the setup time constraints. Compared to an state-of-the-art academic global placement tool, the proposed method (called TDP-ADMM) improves the worst and total negative slack for seven single flux quantum benchmark circuits by an average of 26% and 44%, respectively, with an average overhead of 1.98% in terms of total wirelength.
