Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) have enabled a paradigm shift to include machine intelligence in a wide range of autonomous tasks. As a result, a largely unexplored surface has opened up for attacks jeopardizing the integrity of DL models and hindering the success of autonomous systems. To enable ubiquitous deployment of DL approaches across various intelligent applications, we propose to develop architectural support for hardware implementation of secure and robust DL. Towards this goal, we leverage hardware/software co-design to develop a DL execution engine that supports algorithms specifically designed to defend against various attacks. The proposed framework is enhanced with two real-time defense mechanisms, securing both DL training and execution stages. In particular, we enable model-level Trojan detection to mitigate backdoor attacks and malicious behaviors induced on the DL model during training. We further realize real-time adversarial attack detection to avert malicious behavior during execution. The proposed execution engine is equipped with hardware-level IP protection and usage control mechanism to attest the legitimacy of the DL model mapped to the device. Our design is modular and can be tuned to task-specific demands, e.g., power, throughput, and memory bandwidth, by means of a customized hardware compiler. We further provide an accompanying API to reduce the nonrecurring engineering cost and ensure automated adaptation to various domains and applications.
