This paper presents a new paradigm for analog placement, which further incorporates poles in addition to the considerations of symmetry-island and monotonic current flow while minimizing wire crossings. The nodes along the signal path in an analog circuit contribute to the poles, and the parasitics on these dominant poles can significantly limit the circuit performance. Although the monotonic placements introduced in the previous works can generate simpler routing topologies, the unawareness of poles, especially both dominant pole and the first non-dominant pole, and wire crossing among critical nets may result in the increase wire-load and performance degradation. Experimental results show that the proposed pole-aware analog placement method considering symmetry-island, monotonic current flow, and crossing-wire minimization results in much better solution quality in terms of circuit performance.
