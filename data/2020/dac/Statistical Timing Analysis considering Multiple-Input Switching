Traditional statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) using available single-input switching (SIS) based gate delay libraries either ignore timing impact from multiple-input switching (MIS) or use single-corner (deterministic) models for MIS consideration. This paper presents a method for modeling the impact of MIS on statistical timing accurately using concepts of convolution and chain ruling. Experimental results in a commercial SSTA framework demonstrate negligible run-time overheads of modeling MIS while accurately exposing timing slack optimism in an SIS based flow of up to 17 pico-seconds on designs mapped to a 14 nanometer technology library. Prediction of timing critical paths due to MIS show excellent correlation to silicon hardware. Comparisons with prior work illustrate the accuracy improvements of the presented work.
