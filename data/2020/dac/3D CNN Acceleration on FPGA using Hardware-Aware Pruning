There have been many recent attempts to extend the successes of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from 2-dimensional (2D) image classification to 3-dimensional (3D) video recognition by exploring 3D CNNs. Considering the emerging growth of mobile or Internet of Things (IoT) market, it is essential to investigate the deployment of 3D CNNs on edge devices. Previous works have implemented standard 3D CNNs (C3D) on hardware platforms, however, they have not exploited model compression for acceleration of inference. This work proposes a hardware-aware pruning approach that can fully adapt to the loop tiling technique of FPGA design and is applied onto a novel 3D network called R(2+1)D. Leveraging the powerful ADMM, the proposed pruning method achieves simultaneous high accuracy and significant acceleration of computation on FPGA. With layer-wise pruning rates up to 10× and negligible accuracy loss, the pruned model is implemented on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA board, where the pruned model achieves 2.6× speedup compared with the unpruned version, and 2.3× speedup and 2.3× power efficiency improvement compared with state-of-the-art FPGA implementation of C3D.
