Recent advances in die-stacking and 2.5D chip integration technologies introduce in-package network heterogeneities that can complicate the interconnect design. Integrating chiplets over a silicon interposer offers new opportunities of optimizing interposer topologies. However, limited by the capability of existing network-on-chip (NoC) simulators, the full potential of the interposer-based NoCs has not been exploited. In this paper, we address the shortfalls of prior NoC designs and present a new family of chiplet topologies called Kite. Kite topologies better utilize the diverse networking and frequency domains existing in new interposer systems and outperform the prior chiplet topology proposals. Kite decreased synthetic traffic latency by 7% and improved the maximum throughput by 17% on average versus Double Butterfly and Butter Donut, two previous proposals developed using less accurate modeling.
