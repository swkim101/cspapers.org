Modern accelerator platforms, are characterised by high micro-architectural complexity that affects both performance and energy consumption. Programmers usually are facing the problem of reasoning on differing trade-offs among the set of various code variants and their parameters configuration. While maximal configurations are usually adequate for performance optimization, this is not the case when optimizing for energy efficiency. Thus, efficient tuning methodologies accompanied with automated tools are of great importance for a quick and concrete evaluation of the explored design space. However, existing tuning frameworks are usually application-specific, i.e. performing well only on a priori known applications/workloads, and requiring heavy offline exploration and sampling procedures. In this paper, we present DDOT an online and scalable autotuning framework that enables the extraction of energy efficient tuning, with minimal online application characterisation. Instead of analyzing every application against every tuning configuration, it adopts a data driven approach, utilizing collaborative filtering, that quickly and with high accuracy configures the compilerand runtime-tuning parameters by identifying similarities to previously optimized applications. We evaluate DDOT efficiency utilizing as driving vehicle the Intel Phi accelerator platform, and compare it with state-of-art iterative and machine-learning tuning strategies as well with the exact optimal configurations of the derived solution space, through which we show that with minimal online characterisation, e.g. only either two or four online evaluations, DDOT finds tuning configurations that achieve more than 94% in respect to the optimal.
