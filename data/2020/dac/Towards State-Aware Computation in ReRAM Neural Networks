Resistive RAM (ReRAM) is a promising device to realize the Computing in Memory (CiM) architecture, suitable for power-constrained IoT systems. Because of low leakage, the dot-production operations in ReRAM crossbars dominate the chip power, especially when implementing low-precision neural networks. This work investigates the correlation between the cell resistance state and the crossbar operation power, and proposes a State-Aware ReRAM Accelerator (SARA) architecture for energy-efficient neural networks. With the proposed state-aware network training and mapping strategy, crossbars in the ReRAM accelerator can perform in a lower-power state. The evaluation shows that our design reduces 47% energy over the baseline without compromising the network accuracy.
