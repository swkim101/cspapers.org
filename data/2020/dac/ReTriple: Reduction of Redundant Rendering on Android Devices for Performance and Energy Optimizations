Graphics rendering is a compute-intensive work and a major source of energy consumption on battery-driven mobile devices. Unlike the existing works that degrade user experience or reuse rendering results coarsely, we propose ReTriple, a fine-grained scheme to reduce rendering workload by reusing the past rendering results at the UI element level. This fine-grained reuse mechanism can explore more opportunities to reduce the workload of the rendering process and save energy. The experiments tested with popular apps show that ReTriple achieves an average speedup of 2.6x and per-frame energy saving of 32.3% for the rendering process while improving user experience.
