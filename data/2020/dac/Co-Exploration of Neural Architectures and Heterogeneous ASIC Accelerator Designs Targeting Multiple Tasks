Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has demonstrated its power on various AI accelerating platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). However, it remains an open problem how to integrate NAS with Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), despite them being the most powerful AI accelerating platforms. The major bottleneck comes from the large design freedom associated with ASIC designs. Moreover, with the consideration that multiple DNNs will run in parallel for different workloads with diverse layer operations and sizes, integrating heterogeneous ASIC sub-accelerators for distinct DNNs in one design can significantly boost performance, and at the same time further complicate the design space. To address these challenges, in this paper we build ASIC template set based on existing successful designs, described by their unique dataflows, so that the design space is significantly reduced. Based on the templates, we further propose a framework, namely ASICNAS, which can simultaneously identify multiple DNN architectures and the associated heterogeneous ASIC accelerator design, such that the design specifications (specs) can be satisfied, while the accuracy can be maximized. Experimental results show that compared with successive NAS and ASIC design optimizations which lead to design spec violations, ASICNAS can guarantee the results to meet the design specs with 17.77%, 2.49×, and 2.32× reductions on latency, energy, and area and less than 1.6% accuracy loss. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work on neural architecture and ASIC accelerator design co-exploration.
