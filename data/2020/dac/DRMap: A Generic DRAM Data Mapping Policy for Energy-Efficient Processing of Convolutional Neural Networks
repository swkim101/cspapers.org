Many convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators face performance- and energy-efficiency challenges which are crucial for embedded implementations, due to high DRAM access latency and energy. Recently, some DRAM architectures have been proposed to exploit subarray-level parallelism for decreasing the access latency. Towards this, we present a design space exploration methodology to study the latency and energy of different mapping policies on different DRAM architectures, and identify the pareto-optimal design choices. The results show that the energy-efficient DRAM accesses can be achieved by a mapping policy that orderly prioritizes to maximize the row buffer hits, bank- and subarray-level parallelism.
