Planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) inherently gathers the information necessary to act optimally under uncertainties. The framework can be extended to model pure information gathering tasks by considering belief-based rewards. This allows us to use reward shaping to guide POMDP planning to informative beliefs by using a weighted combination of the original reward and the expected information gain as the objective. In this work we propose a novel online algorithm, Information Particle Filter Tree (IPFT), to solve problems with belief-dependent rewards on continuous domains. It simulates particle-based belief trajectories in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach to construct a search tree in the belief space. The evaluation shows that the consideration of information gain greatly improves the performance in problems where information gathering is an essential part of the optimal policy.
