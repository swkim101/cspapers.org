. (19) Since ftpφ,ωq “ Ftpφ,ω,ψq “ maxψ Ftpφ,ω,ψq, we have that fpφ,ωq “ maxψ Fpφ,ω,ψq. A.2. Lower-bound G Next, we derive the lower-bound G of gpφ,ωq “ logZφ,ω . We first derive a trivial lower-bound using a “general” variational distribution over trajectories and discuss its issue. Then, we derive a lower-bound presented in the paper by using a structured variational distribution. Recall that the normalization term Zφ,ω of the model pφ,ω is given by Zφ,ω “ K
