The prior distribution we construct has the following form. For C ∈ [0, 1], q C(α) = C · u(α) + (1− C) · w(α). (1) Here u is the uniform distribution over ω. The weight distribution w is obtained using Algorithm 1 to satisfy certain statistical rate constraints. To establish the correctness of Algorithm 1, we can estimate the representation rate and statistical rate of this distribution and formally prove Theorem 4.1. Theorem A.1 (Theorem 4.1). There is an algorithm (Algorithm 1) that, given the dataset S and a τ ∈ [0, 1], outputs a probability distribution w : S → [0, 1] such that
