Archetypal analysis (AA) aims to extract patterns using self-expressive decomposition of data as convex combinations of extremal points (on the convex hull) of the data. This work presents a computationally efﬁcient greedy AA (GAA) algo-rithm. GAA leverages the underlying geometry of AA, is scalable to larger datasets, and has sig-niﬁcantly faster convergence rate. To achieve this, archetypes are learned via sparse projection of data. In the transformed space, GAA employs an iterative subset selection approach to identify archetypes based on the sparsity of convex representations. The work further presents the use of GAA algorithm for extended AA models such as robust and kernel AA. Experimental results show that GAA is considerably faster while performing comparable to existing methods for tasks such as classiﬁcation, data visualization/categorization.
