This paper presents a framework of successive functional gradient optimization for training nonconvex models such as neural networks, where training is driven by mirror descent in a function space. We provide a theoretical analysis and empirical study of the training method derived from this framework. It is shown that the method leads to better performance than that of standard training techniques.
