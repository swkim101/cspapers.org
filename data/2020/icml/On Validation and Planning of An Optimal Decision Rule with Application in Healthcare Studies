A. Technical Proofs A.1. Proof of Lemma 1 (A.) First, we show that β̂ converges in probability to β0 as n → ∞, by checking three conditions of the Argmax Theorem: (a1.) By the regularity condition (C4) that the true value function V (β) has twice continuously differentiable at an inner point of maximum β0. (a2.) By the consistency conclusion of Zhang et al. (2012) that V̂ (β) = V (β) + op(1), i.e., for ∀β
