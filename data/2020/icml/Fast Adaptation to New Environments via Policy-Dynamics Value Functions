Encoders: The encoders consist of one layer composed of two sublayers, followed by another fully connected layer. The first sublayer, is a single-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization and dropout. We use a dropout of 0.1 for all experiments. To facilitate these residual connections, all sublayers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 64. The second layer of the encoder projects the output of the first layer into the embedding space (from dmodel to demb). The policy encoder takes as input a set of state-action pairs (st, at) from an full trajectory and outputs an embedding for the policy.
