Figure 3. Comparison of the sample and communication complexities for a number of decentralized methods. Existing deterministic methods enjoy lower sample complexity at smaller sample sizes, but such complexity scales linearly when the number of samples increases. Stochastic methods generally suffer from high communication complexity. The proposed D-GET bridges the gap between existing deterministic and stochastic methods, and achieves the optimal sample and communication complexities. Note that online methods can also be applied for finite sum problems, thus the actual sample complexity of D-GET is the minimum rate of both cases. A. Choices of Mixing Matrices Note that many choices of mixing matrices satisfy the above condition. Here we give three commonly used mixing matrices (Xiao & Boyd, 2004; Boyd et al., 2004), where di denotes the degree of node i, and dmax = maxi{di}:
