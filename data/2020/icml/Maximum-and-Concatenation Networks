While successful in many fields, deep neural networks (DNNs) still suffer from some open problems such as bad local minima and unsatisfactory generalization performance. In this work, we propose a novel architecture called Maximum-and-Concatenation Networks (MCN) to try eliminating bad local minima and improving generalization ability as well. Remarkably, we prove that MCN has a very nice property; that is, \emph{every local minimum of an $(l+1)$-layer MCN can be better than, at least as good as, the global minima of the network consisting of its first $l$ layers}. In other words, by increasing the network depth, MCN can autonomously improve its local minima's goodness, what is more, \emph{it is easy to plug MCN into an existing deep model to make it also have this property}. Finally, under mild conditions, we show that MCN can approximate certain continuous functions arbitrarily well with \emph{high efficiency}; that is, the covering number of MCN is much smaller than most existing DNNs such as deep ReLU. Based on this, we further provide a tight generalization bound to guarantee the inference ability of MCN when dealing with testing samples.
