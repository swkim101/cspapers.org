Beyond machine learning’s success in the speciﬁc tasks, research for learning multiple tasks simultaneously is referred to as multi-task learning. However, existing multi-task learning needs manual deﬁnition of tasks and manual task annotation. A crucial problem for advanced intelligence is how to understand the human task concept using basic input-output pairs. Without task deﬁnition, samples from multiple tasks are mixed together and result in a confusing mapping challenge. We pro-pose Confusing Supervised Learning (CSL) that takes these confusing samples and extracts task concepts by differentiating between these samples. We theoretically proved the feasibility of the CSL framework and designed an iterative algorithm to distinguish between tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our CSL methods could achieve a human-like task understanding without task labeling in multi-function regression problems and multi-task recognition problems.
