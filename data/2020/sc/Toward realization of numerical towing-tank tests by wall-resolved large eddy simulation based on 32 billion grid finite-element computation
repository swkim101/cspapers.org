To realize numerical towing-tank tests by substantially shortening the time to the solution, a general-purpose Finite-Element flow solver, named FrontFlow/blue (FFB), has been fully optimized so as to achieve maximum possible sustained memory throughputs with three of its four hot kernels. A single-node sustained performance of 179.0 GFLOPS, which corresponds to 5.3% of the peak performance, has been achieved on Fugaku, the next flagship computer of Japan. A weak-scale benchmark test has confirmed that FFB runs with a parallel efficiency of over 85% up to 5,505,024 compute cores, and an overall sustained performance of16.7 PFLOPS has been achieved. As a result, the time needed for large-eddy simulation using 32 billion grids has been significantly reduced from almost two days to only 37 min., or by a factor of 71. This has clearly indicated that a numerical towing-tank could actually be built for ship hydrodynamics within a few years.
