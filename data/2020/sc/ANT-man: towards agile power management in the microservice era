The emerging trend of decomposing cloud applications into microservices has raised new questions about managing the performance/power trade-off of a datacenter at microsecondscale. We introduce ANT-Man, an Auto, Native and Transparent power Management framework that can exploit fine-grained microservice variability for system efficiency. To achieve this, ANT-Man abstracts away two major sources of latency overhead in traditional hierarchical power management frameworks. First, ANT-Man proposes an auto power budgeting scheme for reducing the power coordination latency at the datacenter level. It can proactively determine the power budget tailored to each individual microservice. Second, ANT-Man proposes a native and transparent power control scheme to overcome the power configuration latency for each microservice. It enables super-fast power budget enforcement with nanosecond-scale performance scaling. Extensive experiments on our prototyped system show that ANT-Man could slash power consumption by $ 7.8\sim 43.5\%$ and in the meantime reduce the $95^{\text{th}}$ tail latency by $ 9.7\sim 12.5\%$ compared to existing techniques.
