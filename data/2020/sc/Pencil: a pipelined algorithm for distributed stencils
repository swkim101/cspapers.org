Stencil computations are at the core of various Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications and have been well-studied for several decades. Typically theyâ€™re highly memory-bound and as a result, numerous tiling algorithms have been proposed to improve its performance. Although efficient, most of these algorithms are designed for single iteration spaces on shared-memory machines. However, in CFD, we are confronted with multi-block structured girds composed of multiple connected iteration spaces distributed across many nodes.In this paper, we propose a pipelined stencil algorithm called Pencil for distributed memory machines that applies to practical CFD problems that span multiple iteration spaces. Based on an in-depth analysis of cache tiling on a single node, we first identify both the optimal combination of MPI and OpenMP for temporal tiling and the best tiling approach, which outperforms the state-of-the-art automatic parallelization tool Pluto by up to $1.92 \times$. Then, we adopt DeepHalo to decouple the multiple connected iteration spaces so that temporal tiling can be applied to each space. Finally, we achieve overlap by pipelining the computation and communication without sacrificing the advantage from temporal cache tiling. Pencil is evaluated using 4 stencils across 6 numerical schemes on two distributed memory machines with Omni-Path and InfiniBand networks. On the Omni-Path system, Pencil exhibits outstanding weak and strong scalability for up to 128 nodes and outperforms MPI+OpenMP Funneled with space tiling by $1.33- 3.41 \times$ on a multi-block grid with 32 nodes.
