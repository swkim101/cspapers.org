Canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is one of the most common tensor computations adopted in many scientific applications. The major bottleneck of CPD is matricized tensor times Khatri-Rao product (MTTKRP). To optimize the performance of MTTKRP, various sparse tensor formats have been proposed such as CSF and HiCOO. However, due to the spatial complexity of the tensors, no single format fits all tensors. To address this problem, we propose SpTFS, a framework that automatically predicts the optimal storage format for an input sparse tensor. Specifically, SpTFS leverages a set of sampling methods to lower the sparse tensor to fix-sized matrices and specific features. Then, TnsNet combines CNN and the feature layer to accurately predict the optimal format. The experimental results show that SpTFS achieves prediction accuracy of 92.7% and 96% on CPU and GPU respectively.
