Modern software engineering often involves using many existing APIs, both open source and – in industrial coding environments– proprietary. Programmers reference documentation and code search tools to remind themselves of proper common usage patterns of APIs. However, high-quality API usage examples are computationally expensive to curate and maintain, and API usage examples retrieved from company-wide code search can be tedious to review. We present a tool, EG, that mines codebases and shows the common, idiomatic us-age examples for API methods. EG was integrated into Facebook’s internal code search tool for the Hack language and evaluated on open-source GitHub projects written in Python. EG was also compared against code search results and hand-written examples from a popular programming website called ProgramCreek. Compared with these two baselines, examples generated by EG are more succinct and representative with less extraneous statements. In addition, a survey with Facebook developers shows that EG examples are preferred in 97% of cases.
