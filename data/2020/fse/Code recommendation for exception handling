Exception handling is an effective mechanism to avoid unexpected runtime errors. However, novice programmers might fail to handle exceptions properly, causing serious errors like system crashing or resource leaking. In this paper, we introduce FuzzyCatch, a code recommendation tool for handling exceptions. Based on fuzzy logic, FuzzyCatch can predict if a runtime exception would occur in a given code snippet and recommend code to handle that exception. FuzzyCatch is implemented as a plugin for Android Studio. The empirical evaluation suggests that FuzzyCatch is highly effective. For example, it has top-1 accuracy of 77% on recommending what exception to catch in a try catch block and of 70% on recommending what method should be called when such an exception occurs. FuzzyCatch also achieves a high level of accuracy and outperforms baselines significantly on detecting and fixing real exception bugs.
