We present a web-based Program Analysis Collaboratory (PAClab) tool that helps researchers to obtain realistic program benchmarks using user-defined selection criteria. Based on selection criteria, PAClab identifies relevant projects and its programs from open-source repositories, obtains those programs, and if necessary performs sound program transformations to adapt them to the targeted verification tool. PAClab makes the resulting program benchmarks available for download. PAClab is designed as a scalable, modular, and parametrizable tool that takes advantage of a computer cluster to handle multiple user requests.
