Mobile devices are part of our life and their energy consumption poses significant limits to their further adoption and usage. In this work, we conduct a meta-analytical review of the impact of programming languages on the energy consumption of such devices. We consider as a null hypothesis that from the perspective of the consumption of energy, there is no difference in writing apps in C, C++, and Java. With the studies at hand, we conclude that we cannot reject such null hypotheses.
