Unlike those on public permissionless blockchains, smart contracts on enterprise permissioned blockchains are not limited by resource constraints, and therefore often larger and more complex. Current testing and analysis tools lack support for such contracts, which demonstrate stateful behaviors and require special treatment in quality assurance. In this paper, we present a model-based testing platform, called ModCon, relying on user-specified models to define test oracles, guide test generation, and measure test adequacy. ModCon is Web-based and supports both permissionless and permissioned blockchain platforms. We demonstrate the usage and key features of ModCon on real enterprise smart contract applications.
