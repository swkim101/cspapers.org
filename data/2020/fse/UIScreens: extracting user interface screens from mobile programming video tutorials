Mobile apps are one of the most widely used types of software systems in existence today and more programmers and students learn how to develop them everyday. One of the most popular resources for learning mobile programming are videos hosted on social platforms such as YouTube. While useful, this type of resource has also its limitations, especially when developers are looking for user interface (UI) designs for mobile applications, since these are hard to search for and locate in videos. We propose UIScreens, a web-based analysis and search engine that analyzes the visual contents of mobile programming video tutorials, then identifies and extracts the UI screens displayed in the videos. Our tool offers features such as searching for UI screens in videos, displaying an overview of the UI screens identified in a video under each search result, and navigating to the part of a video where a particular UI screen is being displayed and discussed. In a user study, participants agreed that UIScreens is usable and useful to quickly skim through videos, while the UI screens it extracts can help developers further determine the relevance of videos to a search topic.
