In this paper, we investigate the role of technology to address the concerns of a civil society group carrying out community-level consultation on the allocation of Â£1 million of community funds. We explore issues of devolved decision-making through the evaluation of a sociodigital system designed to foster deliberative virtues. We describe the ways in which this group used our system in their consultation practices. Our findings highlight how they adopted our technology to privilege specific forms of expression, ascertain issues in their community, make use of and make sense of community data, and create resources for action within their existing practices. Based on related fieldwork we discuss the impacts of structuring and configuring tools for 'talk-based' consultation in order to turn attention to the potential pitfalls and prospects for designing civic technologies that create resources for action for civil society.
