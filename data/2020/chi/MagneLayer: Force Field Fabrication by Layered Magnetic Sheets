Magnets are very useful for the rapid prototyping of haptic interactions. However, it is difficult to arrange fine and complex magnetic fields rapidly. Therefore, we invented a method for fabricating complex geometric magnetic patterns by overlaying multiple magnetic rubber sheets. This method resolves the tradeoff between magnetized pattern complexity and the time required for magnetization. By layering multiple magnetic sheets that have simple magnetic patterns, various types of geometric magnetic patterns, such as checkered and diamond ones, can be generated on the top surface. By applying superposed magnetic fields, various types of tactile stimuli and haptic interaction can be created rapidly. Furthermore, the superposed magnetic fields can be changed dynamically by rotating the layered magnetic sheets. In this paper, we clarify the material requirements and describe the design method for creating these geometric magnetic patterns. We also demonstrate several of their applications.
