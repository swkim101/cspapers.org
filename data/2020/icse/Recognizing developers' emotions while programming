Developers experience a wide range of emotions during programming tasks, which may have an impact on job performance. In this paper, we present an empirical study aimed at (i) investigating the link between emotion and progress, (ii) understanding the triggers for developers' emotions and the strategies to deal with negative ones, (iii) identifying the minimal set of non-invasive biometric sensors for emotion recognition during programming tasks. Results confirm previous findings about the relation between emotions and perceived productivity. Furthermore, we show that developers' emotions can be reliably recognized using only a wristband capturing the electrodermal activity and heart-related metrics.
