Developer turnover is inevitable on software projects and leads to knowledge loss, a reduction in productivity, and an increase in defects. Mitigation strategies to deal with turnover tend to disrupt and increase workloads for developers. In this work, we suggest that through code review recommendation we can distribute knowledge and mitigate turnover with minimal impact on the development process. We evaluate review recommenders in the context of ensuring expertise during review, Expertise, reducing the review workload of the core team, CoreWorkload, and reducing the Files at Risk to turnover, FaR. We find that prior work that assigns reviewers based on file ownership concentrates knowledge on a small group of core developers increasing risk of knowledge loss from turnover by up to 65%. We propose learning and retention aware review recommenders that when combined are effective at reducing the risk of turnover by −29% but they unacceptably reduce the overall expertise during reviews by −26%. We develop the Sofia recommender that suggests experts when none of the files under review are hoarded by developers, but distributes knowledge when files are at risk. In this way, we are able to simultaneously increase expertise during review with a $\Delta$ Expertise of 6%, with a negligible impact on workload of $\Delta$ CoreWorkload of 0.09%, and reduce the files at risk by $\Delta$ FaR −28%. Sofia is integrated into GitHub pull requests allowing developers to select an appropriate expert or “learner” based on the context of the review. We release the Sofia bot as well as the code and data for replication purposes.
