In the last few years, the field of data science has been growing rapidly as various businesses have adopted statistical and machine learning techniques to empower their decision-making and applications. Scaling data analyses to large volumes of data requires the utilization of distributed frameworks. This can lead to serious technical challenges for data analysts and reduce their productivity. AFrame, a data analytics library, is implemented as a layer on top of Apache AsterixDB, addressing these issues by providing the data scientists' familiar interface, Pandas Dataframe, and transparently scaling out the evaluation of analytical operations through a Big Data management system. While AFrame is able to leverage data management facilities (e.g., indexes and query optimization) and allows users to interact with a large volume of data, the initial version only generated SQL++ queries and only operated against AsterixDB. In this work, we describe a new design that retargets AFrame's incremental query formation to other query-based database systems, making it more flexible for deployment against other data management systems with composable query languages.
