Modern data-intensive applications often generate large amounts of low precision float data with a limited range of values. Despite the prevalence of such data, there is a lack of an effective solution to ingest, store, and analyze bounded, low-precision, numeric data. To address this gap, we propose Buff, a new compression technique that uses a decomposed columnar storage and encoding methods to provide effective compression, fast ingestion, and high-speed in-situ adaptive query operators with SIMD support.
