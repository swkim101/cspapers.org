Many navigation applications take natural language speech as input, which avoids users typing in words and thus improves traffic safety. However, navigation applications often fail to understand a userâ€™s free-form description of a route. In addition, they only support input of a specific source or destination, which does not enable users to specify additional route requirements. We propose a SpeakNav framework that enables users to describe intended routes via speech and then recommends appropriate routes. Specifically, we propose a novel Route Template based Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (RT-BERT) model that supports the understanding of natural language route descriptions. The model enables extraction of information of intended POI keywords and related distances. Then we formalize a template-driven path query that uses the extracted information. To enable efficient query processing, we develop a hybrid label index for computing network distances between POIs, and we propose a branch-and-bound algorithm along with a pivot reverse B-tree (PB-tree) index. Experiments with real and synthetic data indicate that RT-BERT offers high accuracy and that the proposed algorithm is capable of outperforming baseline algorithms.
