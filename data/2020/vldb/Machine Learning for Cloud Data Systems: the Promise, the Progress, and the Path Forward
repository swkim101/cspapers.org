The goal of this tutorial is to educate the audience about the state of the art in ML for cloud data systems, both in research and in practice. The tutorial is divided in two parts: the progress, and the path forward. Part I covers the recent successes in deploying machine learning solutions for cloud data systems. We will discuss the practical considerations taken into account and the progress made at various levels. The goal is to compare and contrast the promise of ML for systems with the ground actually covered in industry. Finally, Part II discusses practical issues of machine learning in the enterprise covering the generation of explanations, model debugging, model deployment, model management, constraints on eyes-on data usage and anonymization, and a discussion of the technical debt that can accrue through machine learning and models in the enterprise.
