 Recent work has made significant progress in helping users to automate
 single
 data preparation steps, such as string-transformations and table-manipulation operators (e.g., Join, GroupBy, Pivot, etc.). We in this work propose to automate
 multiple
 such steps end-to-end, by synthesizing complex data-pipelines with both string-transformations and table-manipulation operators.
 
 
 We propose a novel
 by-target
 paradigm that allows users to easily specify the desired pipeline, which is a significant departure from the traditional
 by-example
 paradigm. Using by-target, users would provide input tables (e.g., csv or json files), and point us to a "target table" (e.g., an existing database table or BI dashboard) to demonstrate how the output from the desired pipeline would schematically "look like". While the problem is seemingly under-specified, our unique insight is that implicit table constraints such as FDs and keys can be exploited to significantly constrain the space and make the problem tractable. We develop an AUTO-PIPELINE system that learns to synthesize pipelines using deep reinforcement-learning (DRL) and search. Experiments using a benchmark of 700 real pipelines crawled from GitHub and commercial vendors suggest that AUTO-PIPELINE can successfully synthesize around 70% of complex pipelines with up to 10 steps.
