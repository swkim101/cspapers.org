In this paper, we present a novel mechanism called Full Encryption (FE) in GaussDB. FE-in-GaussDB provides column-level encryption for sensitive data, and secures the asset from any malicious cloud administrator or information leakage attack. It ensures not only the security of operations on ciphertext data, but also the efficiency of query execution, by combining the advantages of cryptography algorithms (i.e
