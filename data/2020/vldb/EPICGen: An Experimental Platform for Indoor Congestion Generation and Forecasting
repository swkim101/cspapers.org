Effectively and accurately forecasting the congestion in indoor spaces has become particularly important during the pandemic in order to reduce the risk of exposure to airborne viruses. However, there is a lack of readily available indoor congestion data to train such models. Therefore, in this demo paper we propose EPICGen , an experimental platform for indoor congestion generation to support congestion forecasting in indoor spaces. EPICGen consists of two components: (i) Grid Overlayer , which models the floor plans of buildings; and (ii) Congestion Generator , a realistic indoor congestion generator. We demonstrate EPICGen through an intuitive map-based user interface that enables end-users to customize the parameters of the system and visualize generated datasets
