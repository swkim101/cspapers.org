 We discovered that there was an inconsistency in the communication cost formulation for the decentralized fine-grained training method in
 Table 2
 of our paper [1]. We used Horovod as the archetype for decentralized fine-grained approaches, and its correct communication cost is higher than what we had reported. So, we amend the communication cost of decentralized fine-grained to
