Databases about general-world knowledge, so-called knowledge bases (KBs), are important in applications such as search and question answering. Traditionally, although KBs use open world assumption, popular KBs only store positive information, but with-hold from taking any stance towards statements not contained in them. In this demo, we show that storing and presenting noteworthy negative statements would be important to overcome current limitations in various use cases. In particular, we introduce the Wiki neg ata portal, a platform to explore negative statements for Wikidata entities, by implementing a peer-based ranking method for inferring interesting negations in KBs. The demo is available at http://d5demos.mpi-inf.mpg.de/negation.
