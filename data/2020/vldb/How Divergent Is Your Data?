We present DivExplorer , a tool that enables users to explore datasets and find subgroups of data for which a classifier behaves in an anomalous manner. These subgroups, denoted as divergent subgroups, may exhibit, for example, higher-than-normal false positive or negative rates. DivExplorer can be used to analyze and debug classifiers. If the data has ethical or social implications, Div-Explorer can be also used to identify bias in classifiers.
