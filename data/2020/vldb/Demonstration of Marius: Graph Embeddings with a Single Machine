Graph embeddings have emerged as the de facto representation for modern machine learning over graph data structures. The goal of graph embedding models is to convert high-dimensional sparse graphs into low-dimensional, dense and continuous vector spaces that preserve the graph structure properties. However, learning a graph embedding model is a resource intensive process, and existing solutions rely on expensive distributed computation to scale training to instances that do not fit in GPU memory. This demonstration showcases Marius: a new open-source engine for learning graph embedding models over billion-edge graphs on a single machine. Marius is built around a recently-introduced architecture for machine learning over graphs that utilizes pipelining and a novel data replacement policy to maximize GPU utilization and exploit the entire memory hierarchy (including disk, CPU, and GPU memory) to scale to large instances. The audience will experience how to develop, train, and deploy graph embedding models using Marius’ configuration-driven programming model. Moreover, the audience will have the opportunity to explore Marius’ deployments on applications including link-prediction on WikiKG90M and reasoning queries on a paleobiology knowledge graph. Marius is available as open source software at https://marius-project.org.
