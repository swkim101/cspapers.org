The deployment of vehicle location services generates increasingly massive vehicle trajectory data, which incurs high storage and transmission costs. A range of studies target offline compression to reduce the storage cost. However, to enable online services such as real-time traffic monitoring, it is attractive to also reduce transmission costs by being able to compress streaming trajectories in real-time. Hence, we propose a framework called TRACE that enables compression, transmission, and querying of networkconstrained streaming trajectories in a fully online fashion. We propose a compact two-stage representation of streaming trajectories: a speed-based representation removes redundant information, and a multiple-references based referential representation exploits subtrajectory similarities. In addition, the online referential representation is extended with reference selection, deletion and rewriting functions that further improve the compression performance. An efficient data transmission scheme is provided for achieving low transmission overhead. Finally, indexing and filtering techniques support efficient real-time range queries over compressed trajectories. Extensive experiments with real-life and synthetic datasets evaluate the different parts of TRACE, offering evidence that it is able to outperform the existing representative methods in terms of both compression ratio and transmission cost.
