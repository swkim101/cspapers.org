Parameter servers (PSs) ease the implementation of distributed machine learning systems, but their performance can fall behind that of single machine baselines due to communication overhead. We demonstrate Lapse , an open source PS with dynamic parameter allocation . Previous work has shown that dynamic parameter allocation can improve PS performance by up to two orders of magnitude and lead to near-linear speed-ups over single machine baselines. This demonstration illustrates how Lapse is used and why it can provide order-of-magnitude speed-ups over other PSs. To do so, this demonstration interactively analyzes and visualizes how dynamic parameter allocation looks like in action
