Recently proposed voice query interfaces translate voice input into SQL queries. Unreliable speech recognition on top of the intrinsic challenges of text-to-SQL translation makes it hard to reliably interpret user input. We present MUVE (Multiplots for Voice quEries), a system for robust voice querying. MUVE reduces the impact of ambiguous voice queries by filling the screen with multiplots, capturing results of phonetically similar queries. It maps voice input to a probability distribution over query candidates, executes a selected subset of queries, and visualizes their results in a multiplot.
 Our goal is to maximize probability to show the correct query result. Also, we want to optimize the visualization (e.g., by coloring a subset of likely results) in order to minimize expected time until users find the correct result. Via a user study, we validate a simple cost model estimating the latter overhead. The resulting optimization problem is NP-hard. We propose an exhaustive algorithm, based on integer programming, as well as a greedy heuristic. As shown in a corresponding user study, MUVE enables users to identify accurate results faster, compared to prior work.
