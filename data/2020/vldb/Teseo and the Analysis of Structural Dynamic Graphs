We present Teseo, a new system for the storage and analysis of dynamic structural graphs in main-memory and the addition of transactional support. Teseo introduces a novel design based on sparse arrays, large arrays interleaved with gaps, and a fat tree, where the graph is ultimately stored. Our design contrasts with early systems for the analysis of dynamic graphs, which often lack transactional support and are anchored to a vertex table as a primary index. We claim that the vertex table implies several constraints, often neglected, that can actually impair the generality, the robustness and extension opportunities of these systems. We compare Teseo with other dynamic graph systems, showing a high resilience to workload and input changes, while achieving comparable, if not superior, throughputs in updates and latencies in raw scans.
