In this talk, I will use multiple internet measurement studies as examples to outline the challenges that we face when performing internet-scale traffic analysis, including implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on internet traffic as well as detecting IoT devices through the lens of an ISP. Using this as motivation, I will discuss the challenges of working with network-wide flow data and correlating such data with other datasets.
