Providing machines with comprehensive knowledge of the worldâ€™s entities and their relationships has been a long-standing vision and challenge for AI. Over the last 15 years, huge knowledge bases, also known as knowledge graphs, have been automatically constructed from web data, and have become a key asset for search engines and other use cases. Machine knowledge can be harnessed to semantically interpret texts in news, social media and web tables, contributing to question answering, natural language processing and data analytics. This position paper reviews these advances and discusses lessons learned. It highlights the role of "DB thinking" in building and maintaining high-quality knowledge bases from web contents. Moreover, the paper identifies open challenges and new research opportunities. In particular, extracting quantitative measures of entities (e
