This paper presents design, implementation and evaluation of i10, a new remote storage stack implemented entirely in the kernel. i10 runs on commodity hardware, allows unmodiﬁed applications to operate directly on kernel’s TCP/IP network stack, and yet, saturates a 100Gbps link for remote accesses using CPU utilization similar to state-of-the-art user-space and RDMA-based solutions.
