Quantum computers are growing in size, and design decisions are being made now that attempt to squeeze more computation out of these machines. In this spirit, we design a method to boost the computational power of nearterm quantum computers by adapting protocols used in quantum error correction to implement “Approximate Quantum Error Correction (AQEC):” By approximating fully-fledged error correction mechanisms, we can increase the compute volume (qubits $\times$ gates, or “Simple Quantum Volume (SQV)”) of near-term machines. The crux of our design is a fast hardware decoder that can approximately decode detected error syndromes rapidly. Specifically, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept that approximate error decoding can be accomplished online in near-term quantum systems by designing and implementing a novel algorithm in superconducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) logic technology. This avoids a critical decoding backlog, hidden in all offline decoding schemes, that leads to idle time exponential in the number of T gates in a program [58].Our design utilizes one SFQ processing module per physical quantum bit. Employing state-of-the-art SFQ synthesis tools, we show that the circuit area, power, and latency are within the constraints of typical, contemporary quantum system designs. Under a pure dephasing error model, the proposed accelerator and AQEC solution is able to expand SQV by factors between 3,402 and 11,163 on expected near-term machines. The decoder achieves a 5% accuracy threshold as well as pseudo-thresholds of approximately 5%, 4.75%, 4.5%, and 3.5% physical error rates for code distances 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively. Decoding solutions are achieved in a maximum of $\sim$20 nanoseconds on the largest code distances studied. By avoiding the exponential idle time in offline decoders, we achieve a 10x reduction in required code distances to achieve the same logical performance as alternative designs.
