Cryogenic computing can achieve high performance and power efficiency by dramatically reducing the device’s leakage power and wire resistance at low temperatures. Recent advances towards cryogenic computing focus on developing cryogenic-optimal cache and memory devices to overcome memory capacity, latency, and power walls. However, little research has been conducted to develop a cryogenic-optimal core architecture despite its high potentials in performance, power, and area efficiency. Once a cryogenic-optimal core becomes available, it will also take full advantage of the cryogenic-optimal cache and memory devices, which leads to a cryogenic-optimal computer.In this paper, we first develop CryoCore-Model (CC-Modet), a cryogenic processor modeling framework which can accurately estimate the maximum clock frequency of processor models running at 77K. Next, driven by the modeling tool, we design CryoCore, a 77K-optimal core microarchitecture to maximize the core’s performance and area efficiency while minimizing the cooling cost. The key idea of CryoCore is to architect a core in a way to reduce the size and number of cooling-unfriendly microarchitecture units and maximize the potential of a voltage and frequency scaling at 77K. Finally, we propose two halfsized, but differently voltage-scaled CryoCore designs aiming for either the maximum performance or power efficiency. With both conventional and our design integrated with cryogenic memories, our high-performance CryoCore design achieves 41% higher single-thread performance for the same power budget and 2x higher multi-thread performance for the same die area. Our lowpower CryoCore design reduces the power cost by 38% without sacrificing the single-thread performance.
