The problem of learning to generalize on unseen classes during the training step, also known as few-shot classification, has attracted considerable attention. Initialization based methods, such as the gradient-based model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) [1], tackle the few-shot learning problem by “learning to fine-tune”. The goal of these approaches is to learn proper model initialization, so that the classifiers for new classes can be learned from a few labeled examples with a small number of gradient update steps. Few shot meta-learning is well-known with its fast-adapted capability and accuracy generalization onto unseen tasks [2]. Learning fairly with unbiased outcomes is another significant hallmark of human intelligence, which is rarely touched in few-shot meta-learning. In this work, we propose a Primal-Dual Fair Meta-learning framework, namely PDFM, which learns to train fair machine learning models using only a few examples based on data from related tasks. The key idea is to learn a good initialization of a fair model's primal and dual parameters so that it can adapt to a new fair learning task via a few gradient update steps. Instead of manually tuning the dual parameters as hyperparameters via a grid search, PDFM optimizes the initialization of the primal and dual parameters jointly for fair meta-learning via a subgradient primal-dual approach. We further instantiate an example of bias controlling using decision boundary covariance (DBC) [3] as the fairness constraint for each task, and demonstrate the versatility of our proposed approach by applying it to classification on a variety of three realworld datasets. Our experiments show substantial improvements over the best prior work for this setting. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/charliezhaoyinpeng/PDFM.git.
