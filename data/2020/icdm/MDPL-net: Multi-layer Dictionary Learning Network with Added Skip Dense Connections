Dictionary learning (DL) is powerful for representation learning, while it fails to capture the deep hierarchical information hidden in data. In this paper, we propose a new generalized end-to-end mulita-layer representation learning architecture referred to as Multi-layer Dictionary Pair Learning Network (MDPL-net) for the deep sparse and hierarchical representation of images. To enable MDPL-net to conduct accurate classification, MDPL-net clearly integrates the skip connection end-to-end network and multi-layer deep sparse dictionary learning into a unified architecture. The representation learning module has several hidden DL blocks, where each hidden DL block has a dictionary pair learning (DPL) layer, a batch-norm layer and an activation function layer, and the DL blocks are connected in a feed-forward manner. To further improve the information flow and maintain the privileged features between different DL blocks, a novel skip dense connectivity pattern is deployed between hidden DL blocks, which can obtain more stable and discriminative features. The DPL layer jointly formulates the discriminative synthesis dictionary and analysis dictionary by minimizing reconstruction error within each batch over the feature maps from front layers. Extensive results on benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness of MDPL-net for discriminative representation and robust image classification.
