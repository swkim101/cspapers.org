In education systems, Finding Similar Exercises (FSE) is the key step for both exercise retrieval and duplicate detection. Recently, more and more attention has been drawn into this area and several works have been proposed, to utilize the exercise content (e.g., texts or images) or the labeled knowledge concepts. Such approaches, however, have failed to take knowledge hierarchy into account. To this end, we advance a novel knowledge-aware multimodal network, namely KnowNet, for finding similar exercises in large-scale online education systems by integrating the knowledge hierarchy into the heterogeneous exercise data and learning a relation-aware semantic representation. Specifically, we first propose a Content Representation Layer (CRL) to learn a unified semantic representation of the heterogeneous exercise content. Then, we design a Hierarchy Fusion Layer (HFL) to exploit the knowledge hierarchy. By combining the knowledge hierarchy, HFL can not only retrieve the relation-aware semantic representation but also provide an interpretable view to investigate the similarity of exercises. Finally, we adopt a Similarity Score Layer (SSL) for returning similar exercises. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of KnowNet.
