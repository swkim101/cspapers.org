User Defined Functions (UDF) are an important and powerful extension point for database queries. Systems using incremental materialized views largely do not support UDFs because they cannot easily be incrementalized. In this work we design single-tuple UDF and User Defined Aggregates (UDA) interfaces for Noria, a state-of-the art dataflow system with incremental materialized views. We also add limited support for User Defined Table Functions (UDTF), by compiling them to query fragments. We show our UDTFs scale by implementing a motivational example used Friedman et al.
