Relational query processing is an ideal candidate for serverless computation with its stateless, idempotent, and short-lived properties. However, current serverless offerings for query processing neither provide millisecond-based pricing nor allow users to optimize the cost of their queries. To have tradeoffs between the cost and performance of their queries, users are limited to using traditional serverful approaches, which we demonstrate to be 50% slower at approximately the same cost as serverless approaches. We propose a model that will allow service providers to dynamically provision clusters to achieve their users' desired time-cost tradeoffs.
