Many modern data science applications build on data lakes, schema-agnostic repositories of data files and data products that offer limited organization and management capabilities. There is a need to build data lake search capabilities into data science environments, so scientists and analysts can find tables, schemas, workflows, and datasets useful to their task at hand. We develop search and management solutions for the Jupyter Notebook data science platform, to enable scientists to augment training data, find potential features to extract, clean data, and find joinable or linkable tables. Our core methods also generalize to other settings where computational tasks involve execution of programs or scripts.
