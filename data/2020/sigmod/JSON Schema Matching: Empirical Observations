Database schema specifies the desired logical organization of the data it stores. A major challenge in database integration is that of schema matching [10, 12], which seeks to determine schema elements in different databases that correspond to the same real world entity. For example, a simple matcher may determine that the attribute ID in one schema is semantically equivalent to Identification in another.
