Business Rule Management Systems (BRMSs) are widely used in industry for a variety of tasks. Their main advantage is to codify in a succinct and queryable manner vast amounts of constantly evolving logic. In BRMSs, rules are typically captured as facts (tuples) over a collection of criteria, and checking them involves querying the collection of rules to find the best match. In this paper, we focus on a real-world use case from the airline industry: determining the minimum connection time (MCT) between flights. The MCT module is part of the flight search engine, and captures the ever changing constraints at each airport that determine the time to allocate between an arriving and a departing flight for a connection to be feasible. We explore how to use hardware acceleration to (i) improve the performance of the MCT module (lower latency, higher throughput); and (ii) reduce the amount of computing resources needed. A key aspect of the solution is the transformation of a collection of rules into a Non-deterministic Finite state Automaton efficiently implemented on FPGA. Experiments performed on-premises and in the cloud show several orders of magnitude improvement over the existing solution, and the potential to reduce by 40% the number of machines needed for the flight search engine.
