The paradigm of interleaving (i.e. blending) visual subgraph query formulation and processing by exploiting the latency offered by the GUI brings in several potential benefits such as superior system response time (SRT) and opportunities to enhance usability of graph databases. Recent efforts at implementing this paradigm are focused on subgraph isomorphism-based queries, which are often restrictive in many real-world graph applications. In this demonstration, we present a novel system called BOOMER to realize this paradigm on more generic but complex bounded 1-1 p-homomorphic(BPH) queries on large networks. Intuitively, a BPH query maps an edge of the query to bounded paths in the data graph. We demonstrate various innovative features of BOOMER, its flexibility, and its promising performance.
