There is a growing interest in supporting advanced Big Data applications on distributed data processing platforms. Most of these systems support SQL or its dialect as the query interface due to its portability and declarative nature. However, current SQL standard cannot effectively express advanced analytical queries due to its limitation in supporting recursive queries. In this demonstration, we show that this problem can be resolved via a simple SQL extension that delivers greater expressive power by allowing aggregates in recursion. To this end, we propose the Recursive-aggregate-SQL (RASQL) language and its system on top of Apache Spark to express and execute complex queries and declarative algorithms in many applications, such as graph search and machine learning. With a variety of examples, we will (i) show how complicated analytic queries can be expressed with RASQL; (ii) illustrate formal semantics of the powerful new constructs; and (iii) present a user-friendly interface to interact with the RASQL system and monitor the query results.
