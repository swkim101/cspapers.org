Confidentiality is an indispensable requirement in financial applications of blockchain technology, and supporting it along with high performance and friendly programmability is technically challenging. In this paper, we present a system design called CONFIDE to support on-chain confidentiality by leveraging Trust Execution Environment (TEE). CONFIDE's secure data transmission protocol and data encryption protocol, together with a highly efficient virtual machine run in TEE, guarantee the confidentiality in the life cycle of a transaction from end to end. CONFIDE proposes a secure data model along with an application-driven secure protocol to guarantee data confidentiality and integrity. Its smart contract language extension offers users the flexibility to define complex confidentiality models. CONFIDE is implemented as a plugin module to Antfin Blockchain's proprietary platform, and can be plugged into other blockchain platforms as well with its universal interface design. Nowadays, CONFIDE is supporting millions of commercial transactions daily on consortium blockchain running financial applications including supply chain finance, ABS, commodity provenance, and cold-chain logistics.
