Searching for a community based on query nodes in a graph is a fundamental problem and has been extensively investigated. Most of the existing approaches focus on finding a community in a social network, and very few studies consider location-based social networks where users can check in locations. In this paper we propose the GeoSocial Community Search problem (GCS) which aims to find a social community and a cluster of spatial locations that are densely connected in a location-based social network simultaneously. The GCS can be useful for marketing and user/location recommendation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to find a social community and a cluster of spatial locations that are densely connected from location-based social networks. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, and is not in APX, unless P = NP. To solve this problem, we propose three algorithms: core-based basic algorithm, top-down greedy removing algorithm, and an expansion algorithm. Finally, we report extensive experimental studies that offer insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solutions.
