We consider the problem of creating an effective navigation structure over a data lake. We define an organization as a navigation graph that contains nodes representing sets of attributes within a data lake and edges indicating subset relationships among nodes. We propose the data lake organization problem as the problem of finding an organization that allows a user to most effectively navigate a data lake. We present a new probabilistic model of how users interact with an organization and propose an approximate algorithm for the data lake organization problem. We show the effectiveness of the algorithm on both a real data lake containing data from open data portals and on a benchmark that contains rich metadata emulating the observed characteristics of real data lakes. Through a formal user study, we show that navigation can help users find relevant tables that cannot be found by keyword search.
