In this demonstration, we present a new definition of integrity constraint that is more powerful for anomalous data discovery. In our definition, a constraint is functioned on both categorical and numerical attributes in relational tables, as well as their derivative attributes, leading to a huge search space. Furthermore, we are the first to take into account attribute value distribution as part of a constraint. Based on the proposed integrity constraint, we build AUDITOR on top of relational tables from the industry of healthcare auditing and demonstrate its effectiveness and ease-of-use for domain experts to discover anomalous data.
