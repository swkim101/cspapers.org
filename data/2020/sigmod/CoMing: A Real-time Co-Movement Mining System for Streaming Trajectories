The aim of real-time co-movement pattern mining for streaming trajectories is to discover co-moving objects that satisfy specific spatio-temporal constraints in real time. This functionality serves a range of real-world applications, such as traffic monitoring and management. However, little work targets the visualization and interaction with such co-movement detection on streaming trajectories. To this end, we develop CoMing, a real-time co-movement pattern mining system, to handle streaming trajectories. CoMing leverages ICPE, a real-time distributed co-movement pattern detection framework, and thus, it has its capacity of good performance. This demonstration offers hands-on experience with CoMing's visual and user-friendly interface. Moreover, several applications in the traffic domain, including object monitoring and traffic statistics visualization, are also provided to users.
