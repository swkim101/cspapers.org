The performance of data-driven, web-scale client applications is sensitive to access latency. To address this concern, enterprises strive to cache data on edge nodes that are closer to users, thereby avoiding expensive round-trips to remote data centers. However, these geo-distributed approaches are limited to caching static data. In this paper we present ChronoCache, a mid-tier caching system that exploits the presence of geo-distributed edge nodes to cache database query results closer to users. ChronoCache transparently learns and leverages client application access patterns to predictively combine query requests and cache their results ahead of time, thereby reducing costly round-trips to the remote database. We show that ChronoCache reduces query response times by up to 2/3 over prior approaches on multiple representative benchmark workloads. representative benchmark workloads.
