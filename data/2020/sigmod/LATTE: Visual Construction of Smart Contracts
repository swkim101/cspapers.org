Smart contracts enable developers to run instructions on blockchains (eg. Ethereum) and have broad range of real-world applications. Solidity is the most popular high-level smart contract programming language on Ethereum. Coding in such language, however, demands a user to be proficient in contract programming and debugging to construct smart contracts correctly. In practice, such expectation makes it harder for non-programmers to take advantage of smart contracts. In this demonstration, we present a novel visual smart contract construction system on Ethereum called latte to make smart contract development accessible to non-programmers. Specifically, it allows a user to construct a contract without writing Solidity code by manipulating visual objects in a direct manipulation-based interface. Furthermore, latte interactively guides users and makes them aware of the cost (in units of Gas) of visual actions undertaken by them during contract construction.
