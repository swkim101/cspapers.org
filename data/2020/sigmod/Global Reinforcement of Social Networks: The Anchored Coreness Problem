The stability of a social network has been widely studied as an important indicator for both the network holders and the participants. Existing works on reinforcing networks focus on a local view, e.g., the anchored k-core problem aims to enlarge the size of the k-core with a fixed input k. Nevertheless, it is more promising to reinforce a social network in a global manner: considering the engagement of every user (vertex) in the network. Since the coreness of a user has been validated as the "best practice" for capturing user engagement, we propose and study the anchored coreness problem in this paper: anchoring a small number of vertices to maximize the coreness gain (the total increment of coreness) of all the vertices in the network. We prove the problem is NP-hard and show it is more challenging than the existing local-view problems. An efficient heuristic algorithm is proposed with novel techniques on pruning search space and reusing the intermediate results. Extensive experiments on real-life data demonstrate that our model is effective for reinforcing social networks and our algorithm is efficient.
