The log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) [16, 18] is widely used in modern NoSQL systems. Different from traditional update-in-place structures, an LSM-tree first buffers all writes in memory, which are subsequently flushed to disk when memory is full. The on-disk components are usually organized into levels of exponentially increasing sizes, where a smaller level is merged into the adjacent larger level when it fills up. To bound the temporary disk space occupied by merges, modern LSM-tree implementations often range partition a disk component into many fixed-size SSTables
