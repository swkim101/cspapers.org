Intersection types have come a long way since their introduction in the Seventies. They have been exploited for characterising behaviours of λ-terms and π-calculus processes, building λ-models, verifying properties of higher-order programs, synthesising code, and enriching the expressivity of programming languages. This paper is a light overview of intersection types and some of their applications.
