In response to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has published preventive measures such as performing hand hygiene frequently, wearing a medical mask, trying to avoid touching face and so on. This paper presents a nudge-based system to promote hand hygiene in a private organization. The proposed system consists of a hand sanitizer station equipped with a magnetic sensor to sense user presses. We conducted 4 case studies to compare the effects of nudging on the frequency of hand sanitizer use: no nudging, traditional nudging, non-personalized nudging, and personalized nudging. The results reveal that using nudge-based methods offer a significant increase in the frequency hand sanitizer use.
