In this paper, we present "ThermoTrak", a smartphone accessory based, real-time and accurate temperature measurement mechanism, which can be used to screen for fever, which is a manifestation of infectious diseases including the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our system accurately identifies face and forehead region from a safe distance of one meter, calculates accurate temperature of forehead with accuracy of ±0.5° C on a linear scale. An AI based algorithm is employed for the purpose of accurately detecting the Region of interest (ROI) (Face & point near center of Forehead) and calculate the absolute temperature within 300 milliseconds.
