The performance dichotomy between wired and wireless networks for the Internet of Things primarily arises from the inherent complexity and inefficiency of networking abstractions such as routing, medium access control and store-and-forward packet switching. This paper aims to enable a new class of latency-sensitive applications by breaking all three of these abstractions to deliver a performance envelope that resembles that of a wired bus in terms of deterministic latency and throughput. The essence of this approach is a novel networking paradigm for optical wireless communication, referred to as a symbol-synchronous bus, wherein a mesh of nodes concurrently transmit LED-based signals. This paper realises the paradigm within a platform called Zero-Wire and evaluates it on a 25-node testbed under laboratory conditions. Key end-to-end performance measurements on this physical prototype include 19 kbps of contention-agnostic goodput, interface-level latency under 1 ms for two-byte frames across four hops, jitter on the order of 10s of Î¼s, and a base reliability of 99%. These first results indicate a bright future for the under-explored area of optical wireless mesh networks in delivering ubiquitous connectivity through a simple and low-cost physical layer.
