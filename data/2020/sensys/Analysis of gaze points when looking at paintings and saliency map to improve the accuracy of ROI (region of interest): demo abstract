As a preliminary step to improve the accuracy of ROI (Region of Interest) based on human visual characteristics, we measured and analyzed the eye movements when looking at paintings. We assumed that there was regularity in viewers' eye movement when looking at a world-renowned painting. This time, we introduce our experimental method, and compare for gaze points distributions and saliency map.
