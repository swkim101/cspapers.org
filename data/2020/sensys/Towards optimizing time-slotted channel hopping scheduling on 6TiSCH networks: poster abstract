Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) is defined in the IEEE 802.15.4e standard as a share medium access control technology to address reliability and timeliness requirements of low-power Internet of Things (IoT) applications. While standards define mechanisms for the basic configuration and communication of TSCH nodes, the adaptation of the TSCH schedule to traffic dynamics has been left as an open research problem. In this poster, we propose an Optimized Adaptive TSCH Scheduling Function (OA-TSCH) to dynamically adjust the TSCH schedule to the changes in the data traffic loads. We implement OA-TSCH on Zolerita Firefly IoT motes and the Contiki-NG operating system to evaluate its performance. Evaluation results show that our proposed scheduling function can improve the packet delivery ratio and throughput significantly.
