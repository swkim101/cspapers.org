Street parking in prohibited areas has become a social problem, especially in urban and tourist areas. In addition, because street parking can cause traffic congestion and accidents, real-time detection is required. The detection of street parking has been previously implemented on the basis of comparisons of videos recorded by fixed-point cameras. However, this approach has a limited detection area and low accuracy. In this demonstration, we present a system that recognizes street parking in real-time using a model trained by dashboard camera videos, which are widely used. The trained model was constructed by collecting data on 1,765 vehicles from dashboard camera videos. We use the Jetson TX2 as an edge device for vehicle recognition and processing. We create and demonstrate a dashboard camera device by attaching a camera and sensor module to the Jetson TX2.
