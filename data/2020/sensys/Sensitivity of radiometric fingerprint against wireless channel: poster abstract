Radiometric signatures have been shown effective in identifying wireless devices, also known as fingerprinting, which refers to imperfections in their electronics. Previous work mainly considered static channel conditions. In this work, we systematically and experimentally study the impact of dynamic and complex channel conditions on the radiometric signatures. The results show a threat to identification accuracy for modulation error-based fingerprinting that was considered channel-resilient.
