In recent years, eye tracking technology has received a lot of attention. This time, as a basic study of interaction that can extract user's interest information, we tried to develop a user interaction system using a low-cost, non-contact eye-gaze input device. Our system uses the user's gaze point and gaze time when browsing a web page to extract words that the user may be interested in and display the information on the screen.
