Technology assistance refers to all tools or systems that allow a people with dementia to carry out their daily activities in order to increase convenience and security in these activities. Dementia is a condition of a collection of symptoms of irreversible brain damage that occurs over a relatively long time period, resulting in problems concentrating, planning or organizing daily activities. This paper is focused on estimating daily activity recognition time by considering the feasibility of activity types, feature extraction techniques for speech recognition, and the design effectiveness of a system that is easy to use by people with dementia. The results from activity recognition need to be further analyzed to find the best pattern for people with dementia. After that, monitoring applications can develop into prevention of abnormal activity in dementia.
