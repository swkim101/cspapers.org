In recent years, there has been a growing interest in travel applications that provide on-site personalized tourist spot recommendations. While they are generally useful, most of the available apps are focused on helping tourists make decisions only on the next spot to visit. This may cause that the tourists miss attractive spots to visit in the future. Due to the lack of awareness on the spots to go afterwards, they are unable to visit the spots they wanted to visit later, hence their overall tourism satisfaction decreases. In this study, we introduce an on-site tourism recommendation system, ISO-Tour, which can be used on the spot during the tour and allows users to consider multiple spots to visit next taking into account the trade-off between satisfaction of the next spot and that of the subsequent spots visited in the future.
