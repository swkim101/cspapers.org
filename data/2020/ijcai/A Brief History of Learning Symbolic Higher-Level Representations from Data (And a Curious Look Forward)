Learning higher-level representations from data has been on the agenda of AI research for several decades. In the paper, I will give a survey of various approaches to learning symbolic higher-level representations: feature construction and constructive induction, predicate invention, propositionalization, pattern mining, and mining time series patterns. Finally, I will give an outlook on how approaches to learning higher-level representations, symbolic and neural, can benefit from each other to solve current issues in machine learning.
