Medical code assignment from clinical texts is 001 a crucial task in the healthcare industry. Clini-002 cal texts are typically very long sequences and 003 the number of possible labels are large, mak-004 ing this task quite challenging. Recent work 005 applies deep neural network models to encode 006 the medical notes and assign medical codes 007 to clinical documents. Some works use effec-008 tive attention mechanisms to construct label-009 speciÔ¨Åc document representations and show 010 promising results. In this paper, we propose 011 a new attention mechanism, GE-LAAT (graph 012 enhanced label attention), which utilizes code 013 graphs to learn robust representation vectors 014 for medical codes and improve upon the state 015 of the art models. Experiments on the MIMIC-016 III dataset are conducted to show the effective-017 ness of our proposed model. 018
