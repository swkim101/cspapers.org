Nowadays, both online shopping and video sharing have grown exponentially. Although internet celebrities in videos are ideal exhibition for fashion corporations to sell their products, audiences do not always know where to buy fashion products in videos, which is a cross-domain problem called video-to-shop. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network, called Detect, Pick, and Retrieval Network (DPRNet), to break the gap between fashion products from videos and audiences. For the video side, we have modified the traditional object detector, which automatically picks out the best object proposals for every commodity in videos without duplication, to promote the performance of the video-to-shop task. For the fashion retrieval side, a simple but effective multi-task loss network obtains new state-of-the-art results on DeepFashion. Extensive experiments conducted on a new large-scale cross-domain video-to-shop dataset shows that DPRNet is efficient and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on video-to-shop task.
