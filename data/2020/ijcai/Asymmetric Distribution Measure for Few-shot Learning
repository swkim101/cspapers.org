In practical industrial scenarios, it is difficult to collect sufficient labeled fault data for diverse machine types. How to train a robust intelligent fault diagnosis model with limited labeled samples and work well on different machine types remains a challenging issue. This paper proposes a novel cross-machine few-shot fault diagnosis method based on asymmetric distribution measure. The proposed method first constructs a large number of meta-diagnostic tasks from source machines with sufficient labeled fault data and then trains the meta-diagnostic model based on meta-learning to learn task-independent diagnostic knowledge, which will be transferred for the diagnostic task of the target machine to achieve accurate few-shot fault diagnosis. A series of cross-machine few-shot fault diagnosis experiments based on three rotating machinery datasets have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
