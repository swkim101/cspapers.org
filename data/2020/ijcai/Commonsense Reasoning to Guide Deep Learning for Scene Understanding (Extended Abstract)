Our architecture uses non-monotonic logical reasoning with incomplete commonsense domain knowledge, and incremental inductive learning, to guide the construction of deep network models from a small number of training examples. Experimental results in the context of a robot reasoning about the partial occlusion of objects and the stability of object configurations in simulated images indicate an improvement in reliability and a reduction in computational effort in comparison with an architecture based just on deep networks.
