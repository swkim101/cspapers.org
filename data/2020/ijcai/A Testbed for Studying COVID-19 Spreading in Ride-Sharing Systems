Order dispatch is an important area where artificial intelligence (AI) can benefit ride-sharing systems (e.g., Grab, Uber), which has become an integral part of our public transport network. In this paper, we present a multi-agent testbed to study the spread of infectious diseases through such a system. It allows users to vary the parameters of the disease and behaviours to study the interaction effect between technology, disease and people's behaviours in such a complex environment.
