Decentralized online planning can be an attractive paradigm for cooperative 

multi-agent systems, due to improved scalability and robustness.

A key difficulty of such approach lies in making accurate

predictions about the decisions of other agents. 

In this paper, we present a trainable online decentralized planning algorithm

based on decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search, combined with

models of teammates learned from previous episodic runs. 

By only allowing one agent to adapt its models at a time, 

under the assumption of ideal policy approximation,

successive iterations of our method are guaranteed to improve joint

policies, and eventually lead to convergence to a Nash equilibrium. 

We test the efficiency of the algorithm by performing experiments 

in several scenarios of the spatial task

allocation environment introduced in [Claes et al., 2015]. We show that

deep learning and convolutional neural networks can be employed

to produce accurate policy approximators which exploit the spatial features of the

problem, and that the proposed algorithm improves over the baseline

planning performance for particularly challenging domain configurations.
