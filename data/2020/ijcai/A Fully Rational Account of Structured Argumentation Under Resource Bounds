ASPIC+ is an established general framework for argumentation and non-monotonic reasoning. However, ASPIC+ does not satisfy the non-contamination rationality postulates, and moreover, tacitly assumes unbounded resources when demonstrating satisfaction of the consistency postulates. In this paper we present a new version of ASPIC+ – Dialectial ASPIC+ – that is fully rational under resource bounds.
