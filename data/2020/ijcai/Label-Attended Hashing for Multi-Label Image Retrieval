For the multi-label image retrieval, the existing hashing algorithms neglect the dependency between objects and thus fail to capture the attention information in the feature extraction, which affects the precision of hash codes. To address this problem, we explore the inter-dependency between objects through their co-occurrence correlation from the label set and adopt Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear (MFB) pooling component so that the image representation learning can capture this attention information. We propose a Label-Attended Hashing (LAH) algorithm which enables an end-to-end hash model with inter-dependency feature extraction. LAH first combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to separately generate the image representation and label co-occurrence embeddings, then adopts MFB to fuse these two modal vectors, finally learns the hash function with a Cauchy distribution based loss function via back propagation. Extensive experiments on public multi-label datasets demonstrate that (1) LAH can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval results and (2) the usage of co-occurrence relationship and MFB not only promotes the precision of hash codes but also accelerates the hash learning.
