Modern machine learning techniques can discover complicated statistical dependencies between ran- dom variables, usually in the form a statistical model, and make use of these dependencies to per- form predictions on future observations. How- ever, many real problems involve causal inference, which aims to infer how the data generating sys- tem should behave under changing conditions. To perform causal inference, we need not only statisti- cal dependencies but also causal structures to deter- mine the systemâ€™s behavior under external interven- tions. In this paper, I will be focusing on two essen- tial problems that bridge causality and learning and investigate how they can benefit from each other. On the one hand, since conducting randomized controlled experiments for causal structure discov- ery is often expensive or infeasible, it would be valuable to investigate how we can explore modern machine learning algorithms to search for causal structures from observational data. On the other hand, since causal structure provides information about the distribution changing properties, it can be used as a fundamental tool to tackle a major chal- lenge for machine learning: the capability of gener- alization to new distributions and prediction in non- stationary environment.
