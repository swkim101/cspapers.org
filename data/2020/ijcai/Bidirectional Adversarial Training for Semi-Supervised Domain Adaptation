Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is a novel branch of machine learning that scarce labeled target examples are available, compared with unsupervised domain adaptation. To make effective use of these additional data so as to bridge the domain gap, one possible way is to generate adversarial examples, which are images with additional perturbations, between the two domains and fill the domain gap. Adversarial training has been proven to be a powerful method for this purpose. However, the traditional adversarial training adds noises in arbitrary directions, which is inefficient to migrate between domains, or generate directional noises from the source to target domain and reverse. In this work, we devise a general bidirectional adversarial training method and employ gradient to guide adversarial examples across the domain gap, i.e., the Adaptive Adversarial Training (AAT) for source to target domain and Entropy-penalized Virtual Adversarial Training (E-VAT) for target to source domain. Particularly, we devise a Bidirectional Adversarial Training (BiAT) network to perform diverse adversarial trainings jointly. We evaluate the effectiveness of BiAT on three benchmark datasets and experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art.
