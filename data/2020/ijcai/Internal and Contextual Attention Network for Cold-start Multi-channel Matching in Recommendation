Real-world integrated personalized recommendation systems usually deal with millions of heterogeneous items. It is extremely challenging to conduct full corpus retrieval with complicated models due to the tremendous computation costs. Hence, most large-scale recommendation systems consist of two modules: a multi-channel matching module to efficiently retrieve a small subset of candidates, and a ranking module for precise personalized recommendation. However, multi-channel matching usually suffers from cold-start problems when adding new channels or new data sources. To solve this issue, we propose a novel Internal and contextual attention network (ICAN), which highlights channel-specific contextual information and feature field interactions between multiple channels. In experiments, we conduct both offline and online evaluations with case studies on a real-world integrated recommendation system. The significant improvements confirm the effectiveness and robustness of ICAN, especially for cold-start channels. Currently, ICAN has been deployed on WeChat Top Stories used by millions of users.
