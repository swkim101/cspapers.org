This paper presents a method for synthesizing a reactive program to coordinate the actions of a group of other reactive programs so that the combined system satisfies a temporal specification of its desired long-term behavior. Traditionally, reactive synthesis has been applied to the construction of a stateful hardware circuit. This work is motivated by applications to other domains, such as the IoT (the Internet of Things) and robotics, where it is necessary to coordinate the actions of multiple sensors, devices, and robots to carry out a task. The mathematical model represents each agent as a process in Hoareâ€™s CSP model. Given a network of interacting agents, called an environment, and a temporal specification of long-term behavior, the synthesis method constructs a coordinator process (if one exists) that guides the actions of the environment agents so that the combined system is deadlock-free and satisfies the given specification. The main technical challenge is that a coordinator may have only partial information of the environment state, due to non-determinism within the environment and internal environment actions that are hidden from the coordinator. This is the first method to handle both sources of partial information and to do so for arbitrary linear temporal logic specifications. It is established that the coordination synthesis problem is PSPACE-hard in the size of the environment. A prototype implementation is able to synthesize compact solutions for a number of coordination problems.
