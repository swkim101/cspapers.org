We construct a constant-round zero-knowledge classical argument for NP secure against quantum attacks. We assume the existence of Quantum Fully-Homomorphic Encryption and other standard primitives, known based on the Learning with Errors Assumption for quantum algorithms. As a corollary, we also obtain a constant-round zero-knowledge quantum argument for QMA. At the heart of our protocol is a new no-cloning non-black-box simulation technique.
