Challenging scheduling problems arise in the implementation of cyber-physical systems upon heterogeneous platforms with (serial) data offloading and (parallel) computation. In this paper, we adapt techniques from scheduling theory to model, analyze, and derive scheduling algorithms for real-time workloads on such platforms. We characterize the performance of the proposed algorithms, both analytically via the approximation ratio metric and experimentally through simulation experiments upon synthetic workloads that are justified via a case study on a CPU-GPU platform. The evaluation exposes some divergence between the analytical characterization and experimental one; recommendations that seek to balance such divergent characterizations are made regarding the choice of algorithmic approaches.
