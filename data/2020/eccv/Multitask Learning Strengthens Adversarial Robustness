Theorem 1. (Adversarial Vulnerability of Model for Multiple Correlated Tasks) If the selected output tasks are correlated with each other such that the covariance between the gradient of task i and task j is Cov(ri, rj), and the gradient for each task is i.i.d. with zero mean (because the model is converged), then adversarial vulnerability of the given model is proportional to √ (1 + 2 M ∑M i=1 ∑i−1 j=1 Cov(ri,rj) Cov(ri,ri) ) √ M
