– An extensive study on the LVIS [18] dataset where UFO2 learns to detect more than 1k di↵erent objects without bounding box annotation (Sec. A), which demonstrates the generalizability and applicability of UFO2 – Details regarding the annotation policies mentioned in Sec. 5.4 ‘Budgetaware Omni-supervised Detection’ of the main paper – Additional visualizations of the simulated partial labels – Additional qualitative results on COCO (complementary to main paper Sec. 5.2)
