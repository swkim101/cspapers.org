Debugging Cyber-Physical System models is often challenging, as it requires identifying a potentially long, complex and heterogenous combination of events that resulted in a violation of the expected behavior of the system. In this paper we present CPSDebug, a tool for supporting designers in the debugging of failures in MATLAB Simulink/Stateflow models. CPSDebug implements a gray-box approach that combines testing, specification mining, and failure analysis to identify the causes of failures and explain their propagation in time and space. The evaluation of the tool, based on multiple usage scenarios and faults and direct feedback from engineers, shows that CPSDebug can effectively aid engineers during debugging tasks.
