In the distributed graident coding problem, it has been established that, to exactly recover the gradient under s slow machines, the mmimum computation load (number of stored data partitions) of each worker is at least linear ($s+1$), which incurs a large overhead when s is large[13]. In this paper, we focus on approximate gradient coding that aims to recover the gradient with bounded error ε. Theoretically, our main contributions are three-fold: (i) we analyze the structure of optimal gradient codes, and derive the information-theoretical lower bound of minimum computation load: O(log(n)/log(n/s)) for ε = 0 and d≥ O(log(1/ε)/log(n/s)) for ε>0, where d is the computation load, and ε is the error in the gradient computation; (ii) we design two approximate gradient coding schemes that exactly match such lower bounds based on random edge removal process; (iii) we implement our schemes and demonstrate the advantage of the approaches over the current fastest gradient coding strategies. The proposed schemes provide order-wise improvement over the state of the art in terms of computation load, and are also optimal in terms of both computation load and latency.
