As the design complexity grows dramatically in modern circuit designs, 2.5D/3D chip/package/board integration has become a key to beat process limitation for optimizing system performance and power consumption. Among the explored technologies, the wafer-level integrated fan-out (InFO) package-on-package (PoP) has been adopted by major companies such as TSMC to achieve high-density, high-performance, low-cost packaging solutions. To achieve a high-quality 2.5D/3D heterogeneous integration system, we shall study the chip, package, and board codesign methodology with advanced packages and explore key techniques to handle the emerging challenges in physical design, timing, electrical effects, and testing.
