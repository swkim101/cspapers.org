SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) has become an indispensable tool for the simulation of transistor-level circuits since its introduction in the early 1970s [1]. Over the years, many SPICE simulators have been introduced and their capabilities have been greatly improved. However, as we move into deeper sub-micron designs and circuit sizes keep increasing, the capabilities of current SPICE simulators prove insufficient; continuous performance breakthroughs are needed to keep up with the demands of larger circuits, high accuracy and fast turn-around. SPICE developers have put lots of effort to improve speed. In this paper, we will present how GPU is used to accelerate SPICE simulation with 10 Ã— + performance gain.
