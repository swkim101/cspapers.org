Large, open, public events, such as marathons and festivals, have always presented a unique safety challenge. These sprawling events, which can take up entire city blocks or stretch for many miles, can draw tens to hundreds of thousands of spectators and in some cases have open admission. As it is impracticable to guarantee the subjection of every event-goer to a security screening, we propose a crowd-based explosive detection system that uses a multitude of low-cost ChemFET sensors which are distributed to attendees. As the sensors offer limited accuracy, we further propose a server-based decision-making framework that utilizes a two-level feedback loop between the sensors and the server and explores spatial and temporal locality of the collected data to overcome the inherent low-accuracy of individual sensors. We thoroughly explore two distinct detection schemes, stressing their performance under a myriad of conditions, thus showing that such a crowd-based detection system comprised of low-cost and low-accuracy sensors can deliver high detection accuracy with minimal false positives.
