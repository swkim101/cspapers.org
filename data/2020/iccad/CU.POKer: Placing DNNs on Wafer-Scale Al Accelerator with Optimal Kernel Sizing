The tremendous growth in deep learning (DL) applications has created an exponential demand for computing power, which leads to the rise of AI-specific hardware. Targeted towards accelerating computation-intensive deep learning applications, AI hardware, including but not limited to GPGPU, TPU, ASICs, etc., have been adopted ubiquitously. As a result, domain-specific CAD tools play more and more important roles and have been deeply involved in both the design and compilation stages of modern AI hardware. Recently, ISPD 2020 contest introduced a special challenge targeting at the physical mapping of neural network workloads onto the largest commercial deep learning accelerator, CS-1 Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE). In this paper, we proposed CU.POKer, a high-performance engine fully-customized for WSE's DNN workload placement challenge. A provably optimal placeable kernel candidate searching scheme and a data-flow-aware placement tool are developed accordingly to ensure the state-of-the-art quality on the real industrial benchmarks. Experimental results on ISPD 2020 contest evaluation suites [1] demonstrated the superiority of our proposed framework over other contestants.
