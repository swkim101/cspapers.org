In this paper, we propose a novel transient full-chip thermal map estimation method for multi-core commercial CPU based on the data-driven generative adversarial learning method. We treat the thermal modeling problem as an image-generation problem using the generative neural networks. In stead of using traditional functional unit powers as input, the new models are directly based on the measurable real-time high level chip utilizations and thermal sensor information of commercial chips without any assumption of additional physical sensors requirement. The resulting thermal map estimation method, called ThermGAN can provide tool-accurate full-chip transient thermal maps from the given performance monitor traces of commercial off-the-shelf multi-core processors. In our work, both generator and discriminator are composed of simple convolutional layers with Wasserstein distance as loss function. ThermGAN can provide the transient and real-time thermal map without using any historical data for training and inferences, which is contrast with a recent RNN-based thermal map estimation method in which historical data is needed. Experimental results show the trained model is very accurate in thermal estimation with an average RMSE of 0.47Â°C, namely, 0.63% of the full-scale error. Our data further show that the speed of the model is faster than 7.5ms per inference, which is two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional finite element based thermal analysis. Furthermore, the new method is ~4x more accurate than recently proposed LSTM-based thermal map estimation method and has faster inference speed. It also achieves ~2x accuracy with much less computational cost than a state-of-the-art pre-silicon based estimation method.
