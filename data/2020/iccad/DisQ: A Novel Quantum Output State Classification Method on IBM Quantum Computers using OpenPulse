Superconducting quantum computing technology has ushered in a new era of computational possibilities. While a considerable research effort has been geared toward improving the quantum technology and building the software stack to efficiently execute quantum algorithms with reduced error rate, effort toward optimizing how quantum output states are defined and classified for the purpose of reducing the error rate is still limited. To this end, this paper proposes DisQ, a quantum output state classification approach which reduces error rates of quantum programs on NISQ devices.
