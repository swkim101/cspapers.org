In recent years, 2.5D chiplet package designs have gained popularity in system integration of heterogeneous technologies. Currently, there exists no standard CAD flow that can design, analyze, and optimize a complete heterogeneous 2.5D system. The traditional die-by-die design approach does not consider any package layers during extraction and optimization, and an accurate chiplet-package extraction can not be applied to heterogeneous designs without fundamental changes in standard CAD tools. In this paper, we present our Holistic and In-Context chiplet-package co-design flows for high-performance high-density 2.5D systems using standard ASIC CAD tools with zero overhead on IO pipeline depth. Our flow encompasses 2.5D-aware partitioning, chiplet-package co-planning, in-context extraction, iterative optimization, and post-design analysis and verification of the entire 2.5D system. We design our package planner with a routing and pin-planning strategy to minimize package routing congestion and timing overhead. An ARM Cortex-M0-based microcontroller system is designed as the benchmark. The performance gap to the reference 2D design reduces by 62.5% when chip-package interactions are taken into account in the holistic flow. Our in-context extraction achieves only 0.71% and 0.79% error on ground and coupling capacitance on a homogeneous system. Further, we implement a heterogeneous 2.5D system to demonstrate our novel in-context design and optimization methodology.
