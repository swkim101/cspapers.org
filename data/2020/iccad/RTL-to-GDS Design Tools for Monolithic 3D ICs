In this paper, we propose RTL-to-GDS design flow for monolithic 3D ICs (M3D) built with carbon nanotube field-effect transistors and resistive memory. Our tool flow is based on commercial 2D tools and smart ways to extend them to conduct M3D design and simulation. We provide a post-route optimization flow, which exploits the full potential of the underlying M3D process design kit (PDK) for power, performance and area (PPA) optimization. We also conduct IR-drop and thermal analysis on M3D designs to improve the reliability. To enhance the testability of our M3D designs, we develop design-for-test (DFT) methodologies and integrate a low-overhead built-in self-test module into our design for testing inter-layer vias (ILVs) as well as logic circuitries in the individual tiers. Our benchmark design is RISC-V Rocketcore, which is an open source processor. Our experiments show 8.1% of power, 19.6% of wirelength and 55.7% of area savings with M3D designs at iso-performance compared to its 2D counterpart. In addition, our IR-drop and thermal analyses indicate acceptable power and thermal integrity in our M3D design.
