This paper present a new method to automatically synthesize operational amplifiers. The topology synthesis is based on a functional block modeling. Every op-amp consists of hierarchical functional blocks whose behaviors are describable with analytical equations. Synthesizing the topologies based on functional blocks allows to use the sizing of the topologies during the synthesis process to lessen the number of topologies created not fulfilling the specifications. This makes this method different to previous methods and reduces the time needed to find a large variety of topologies fulfilling a given set of specifications. The paper presents the first prototype of the method.
