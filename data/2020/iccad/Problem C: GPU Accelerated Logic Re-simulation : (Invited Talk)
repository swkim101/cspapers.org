Logic “re” -simulation can be defined as gate level simulation where the input waveforms at every primary input and pseudo-primary input (such as register/RAM outputs) are known. Such waveforms could come from the unit's RTL simulation trace or Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) vectors. This type of simulation is useful in doing functional verification on gate level netlists and power analysis, since we can take the known trace on all primary and pseudo-primary inputs, re-simulate the trace using propagation of signals through timing-aware gate-level combinational logic, and verify that results at the primary and pseudo-primary outputs match the reference RTL simulation results. However, gate level simulation is usually much slower than RTL simulation. Thus, there is motivation for faster solutions. In this contest, we ask contestants to use Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) to speedup the re-simulation task.
