The use of randomized algorithms in safety-critical systems is investigated. Under the vast majority of circumstances, randomized algorithms out-perform deterministic ones on average; however, it is not obvious how one goes about establishing the correctness of safety-critical systems that use such algorithms. The approach advocated in this work is to exploit the fact that many safety standards allow for small probabilities of failure of even the most critical functionalities. We explore the use of concentration bounds - probabilistic bounds on the likelihood of the performance of a randomized algorithm deviating from its expected performance - to bound the probability of failure of systems that incorporate randomized algorithms, thereby showing compliance with safety standards that allow for small probabilities of failure. We illustrate the use of the proposed approach on several examples that both explain how the approach is to be applied, and demonstrate the benefits of doing so.
