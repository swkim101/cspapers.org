As the technology node is evolving, standard cell (SDC) design scaling is obstructed by design constraints such as limited routing resources, lateral P-N separation, and performance requirements. Complimentary-FET (CFET) technology, which stacks the P-FET on N-FET or vice versa, is able to release the restriction of P-N connection for SDC layout scaling. However, (both in-cell and block-level) routable CFET SDC design, while maintaining the scaling advantages, is a non-trivial problem because of the extremely limited routability (including pin-accessibility) comes from the intrinsic stacked FET structure. In this paper, we propose an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo theories)-based framework to automate CFET SDC synthesis through the simultaneous place-and-route optimization methodology with a novel Dynamic Complimentary Pin Allocation scheme. Moreover, our framework generates optimized CFET SDC layouts in terms of routability through our novel pin access and routing resource related objectives/constraints, while the scaling advantage of CFET structure is maintained compared to conventional FET structure. We demonstrate that CFET cell structure provides 10.1/22.2% on average reduced cell width and metal length compared to conventional FET structure. Moreover, we validate that our routability-driven features successfully improve routability in practical circuit designs through block-level analysis. Compared to the previous work, our routability-driven framework improves 4.2% utilization and reduces 83% routing errors on average in block-level designs.
