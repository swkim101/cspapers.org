Electromigration (EM) is still the most important reliability concern for VLSI systems, especially at the nanometer regime. EM immortality check is an important step for full-chip EM signoff analysis. In this paper, we propose a new electromigration (EM) immortality check method for multi-segment interconnect considering the impacts of Joule heating induced temperature gradient. Temperature gradients from metal Joule heating, called thermal migration, can be a significant force for the metal atomic migrations, and these impacts get more significant as technology scales down. Compared to existing methods, the new method can consider the spatial temperature gradient due to Joule heating for multi-segment wires for the first time. We derive the analytic solution for the resulting steady-state EM-thermal migration stress distribution problem. Then we develop the new temperature-aware voltage-based EM immortality check method considering the multi-segment temperature migration effects, which carries all the benefits of the recently proposed voltage-based EM immortality method for multi-segment interconnects. Numerical results on an IBM power grid and self synthesized power delivery networks show that the proposed temperature-aware EM immortality check method is much more accurate than recently proposed state of the art EM immortality method.
