Next-generation systems, such as edge devices, will have to provide efficient processing of machine learning (ML) algorithms, along with several metrics, including energy, performance, area, and latency. However, the quickly evolving field of ML makes it extremely difficult to generate accelerators able to support a wide variety of algorithms. Simultaneously, designing accelerators in hardware description languages (HDLs) by hand is laborious and time-consuming, and does not allow quick exploration of the design space. This paper discusses the SODA synthesizer, an automated open-source high-level ML framework-to-Verilog compiler targeting ML Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) chiplets based on the LLVM infrastructure. The SODA synthesizers will allow implementing optimal designs by combining templated and fully tunable IPs and macros, and fully custom components generated through high-level synthesis. All these components will be provided through an extendable resource library, characterized by commercial and open-source logic design flows. Through a closed-loop design space exploration engine, developers will quickly explore their hardware designs along different dimensions.
