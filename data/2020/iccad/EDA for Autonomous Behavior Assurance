Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that must additionally comply with high assurance correctness and safety criteria. Such autonomous systems cannot be tested and verified in the traditional design process. While all systems hardware and software components can be implemented as usual, test and verification only cover the autonomous system functionality, but do not include the goal-driven autonomous behavior in all possible circumstances. This autonomous behavior is a primary design target. Thus, autonomous systems pose a number of emerging challenges and opportunities to the field of electronic design automation (EDA). Examples include specification of (evolving) requirements involving components and their interaction, defining different assurance levels for bounded operational environments, synthesis of mechanisms to guideline diagnosis and rigorously monitor systems integration after deployment.
