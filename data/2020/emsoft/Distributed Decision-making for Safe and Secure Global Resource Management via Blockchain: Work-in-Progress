Existing global resource management approaches for real-time and safety-critical applications deployed on distributed systems consisting of multicore and many -core nodes don't consider safety and security together for the global resource management itself. In this work, we propose an approach considering safety and security using distributed global resource re-orchestration decision-making to complement the existing approaches. The implemetation of our framework is based on Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain and smart contracts.
