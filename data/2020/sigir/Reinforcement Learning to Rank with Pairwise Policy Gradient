This paper concerns reinforcement learning~(RL) of the document ranking models for information retrieval~(IR). One branch of the RL approaches to ranking formalize the process of ranking with Markov decision process~(MDP) and determine the model parameters with policy gradient. Though preliminary success has been shown, these approaches are still far from achieving their full potentials. Existing policy gradient methods directly utilize the absolute performance scores (returns) of the sampled document lists in its gradient estimations, which may cause two limitations: 1) fail to reflect the relative goodness of documents within the same query, which usually is close to the nature of IR ranking; 2) generate high variance gradient estimations, resulting in slow learning speed and low ranking accuracy. To deal with the issues, we propose a novel policy gradient algorithm in which the gradients are determined using pairwise comparisons of two document lists sampled within the same query. The algorithm, referred to as Pairwise Policy Gradient (PPG), repeatedly samples pairs of document lists, estimates the gradients with pairwise comparisons, and finally updates the model parameters. Theoretical analysis shows that PPG makes an unbiased and low variance gradient estimations. Experimental results have demonstrated performance gains over the state-of-the-art baselines in search result diversification and text retrieval.
