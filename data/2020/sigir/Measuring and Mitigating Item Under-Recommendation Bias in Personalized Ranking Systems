Recommendation algorithms typically build models based on user-item interactions (e.g., clicks, likes, or ratings) to provide a personalized ranked list of items. These interactions are often distributed unevenly over different groups of items due to varying user preferences. However, we show that recommendation algorithms can inherit or even amplify this imbalanced distribution, leading to item under-recommendation bias. Concretely, we formalize the concepts of ranking-based statistical parity and equal opportunity as two measures of item under-recommendation bias. Then, we empirically show that one of the most widely adopted algorithms -- Bayesian Personalized Ranking -- produces biased recommendations, which motivates our effort to propose the novel debiased personalized ranking model. The debiased model is able to improve the two proposed bias metrics while preserving recommendation performance. Experiments on three public datasets show strong bias reduction of the proposed model versus state-of-the-art alternatives.
