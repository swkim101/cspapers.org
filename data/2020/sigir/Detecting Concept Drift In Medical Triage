in their accompanying referral documents, which contain a mix of free text and structured data. By training a model to predict triage decisions from these referral documents, we can partially automate the triage process, resulting in more efficient and systematic triage decisions. One of the difficulties of this task is maintaining robustness against changes in triage priorities due to changes in policy, funding, staff, or other factors. This is reflected as changes in relationship between document features and triage labels, also known as concept drift. These changes must be detected so that the model can be retrained to reflect the new environment. We introduce a new concept drift detection algorithm for this domain called calibrated drift detection method (CDDM). We evaluated CDDM on benchmark and synthetic medical triage datasets, and find it competitive with state-of-the-art detectors, while also being less prone to false positives from feature drift.
