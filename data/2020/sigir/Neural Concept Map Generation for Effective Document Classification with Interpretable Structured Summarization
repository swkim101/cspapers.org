Concept maps provide concise structured representations for documents regarding their important concepts and interaction links, which have been widely used for document summarization and downstream tasks. However, the construction of concept maps often relies heavily on heuristic design and auxiliary tools. Recent popular neural network models, on the other hand, are shown effective in tasks across various domains, but are short in interpretability and prone to overfitting. In this work, we bridge the gap between concept map construction and neural network models, by designing doc2graph, a novel weakly-supervised text-to-graph neural network, which generates concept maps in the middle and is trained towards document-level tasks like document classification. In our experiments, doc2graph outperforms both its traditional baselines and neural counterparts by significant margins in document classification, while producing high-quality interpretable concept maps as document structured summarization.
