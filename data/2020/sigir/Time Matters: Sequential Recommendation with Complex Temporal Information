Incorporating temporal information into recommender systems has recently attracted increasing attention from both the industrial and academic research communities. Existing methods mostly reduce the temporal information of behaviors to behavior sequences for subsequently RNN-based modeling. In such a simple manner, crucial time-related signals have been largely neglected. This paper aims to systematically investigate the effects of the temporal information in sequential recommendations. In particular, we firstly discover two elementary temporal patterns of user behaviors: "absolute time patterns'' and "relative time patterns'', where the former highlights user time-sensitive behaviors, e.g., people may frequently interact with specific products at certain time point, and the latter indicates how time interval influences the relationship between two actions. For seamlessly incorporating these information into a unified model, we devise a neural architecture that jointly learns those temporal patterns to model user dynamic preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model, comparing with the state-of-the-arts.
