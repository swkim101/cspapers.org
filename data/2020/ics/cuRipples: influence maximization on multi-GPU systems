Influence maximization is an advanced graph-theoretic operation that aims to identify a set of k most influential nodes in a network. The problem is of immense interest in many network applications (e.g., information spread in a social network, or contagion spread in an infectious disease network). The problem is however computationally expensive, needing several hours of compute time on even modest sized networks. There are numerous challenges to parallelizing influence maximization including its mixed workloads of latency- and throughput-bound steps, frequent and irregular access to graph data, large memory footprint, and potential load imbalanced workloads. In this work, we present the design and development of a new hybrid CPU+GPU parallel influence maximization algorithm (CuRipples) that is also capable of running on multi-GPU systems. Our approach uses techniques for efficiently sharing and scheduling of work between CPU and GPU, and data access and synchronization schemes to efficiently map the different steps of sampling and seed selection on a heterogeneous system. Our experiments on state-of-the-art multi-GPU systems show that our implementation is able to achieve drastic reductions in the time to solution, from hours to under a minute, while also significantly enhancing the approximation quality.
