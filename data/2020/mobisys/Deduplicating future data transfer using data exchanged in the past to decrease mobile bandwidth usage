In client-server architectures, there are cases where there is a need to transfer large amounts of data from the server to the client (or less frequently, in the opposite direction). Mobile application markets are a notable example where the clients need to download large chunks of data in the order of megabytes at a time, compared to a typical RPC request which is in the order of kilobytes.
