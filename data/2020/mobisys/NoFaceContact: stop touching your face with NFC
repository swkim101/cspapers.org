Coronavirus disease 2019, known as COVID-19, has spread rapidly and infected millions of people around the world. In addition to respiratory droplet spreading, a common mode of contraction of this virus is when individuals touch their face after coming into contact with a contaminated surface. In this poster, we leverage near-field communication (NFC) and propose a system design, NoFaceContact, which can promptly warn users when they attempt to touch their face with the aim of helping to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and improve overall hygiene. A proof-of-concept experiment shows that NoFaceContact can achieve an average communication distance of 8.07 cm and can potentially detect a wide range of face touching poses.
