—This work introduces the so-called Modular Passive Tracking Controller (MPTC), a generic passivity-based controller, which aims at independently fulﬁlling several subtask objectives. These are combined in a stack of tasks (SoT) that serves as a basis for the synthesis of an overall system controller. The corresponding analysis and controller design are based on Lyapunov theory. An important contribution of this work is the design of a speciﬁc optimization weighting matrix that ensures passivity of an overdetermined and thus conﬂicting task setup. The proposed framework is validated through simulations and experiments for both ﬁxed-base and free-ﬂoating robots.
