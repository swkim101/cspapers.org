—We present a numerical method to compute singularity sets in the conﬁguration space of free-ﬂoating robots, comparing two different criteria based on formal methods. By exploiting speciﬁc properties of free-ﬂoating systems and an alternative formulation of the generalized Jacobian, the search space and computational complexity of the algorithm is reduced. It is shown that the resulting singularity maps can be applied in the context of trajectory planning to guarantee feasibility with respect to singularity avoidance. The proposed approach is validated on a space robot composed of a six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) arm mounted on a body with six DOF.
