The recent progress of an ongoing project utilizing a ducted-fan propulsion system to improve a humanoid robot’s ability to step over large ditches is reported. A novel method (GAS) based on the genetic algorithm with smoothness constraint can effectively minimize the thrust by optimizing the robot’s posture during 3D stepping. The significant advantage of the method is that it can realize the continuity and smoothness of the thrust and pelvis trajectories. The method enables the landing point of the robot’s swing foot to be not only in the forward but also in a side direction. The methods were evaluated by simulation and by being applied on a prototype robot, JetHR1. By keeping a quasistatic balance, the robot could step over a ditch with a span of 450 mm (as much as 97% of the length of the robot’s leg) in 3D stepping.
