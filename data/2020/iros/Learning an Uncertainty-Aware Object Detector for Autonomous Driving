The capability to detect objects is a core part of autonomous driving. Due to sensor noise and incomplete data, perfectly detecting and localizing every object is infeasible. Therefore, it is important for a detector to provide the amount of uncertainty in each prediction. Providing the autonomous system with reliable uncertainties enables the vehicle to react differently based on the level of uncertainty. Previous work has estimated the uncertainty in a detection by predicting a probability distribution over object bounding boxes. In this work, we propose a method to improve the ability to learn the probability distribution by considering the potential noise in the ground-truth labeled data. Our proposed approach improves not only the accuracy of the learned distribution but also the object detection performance.
