Earthworm-like soft robots have been widely studied for various applications, such as medical endoscopy and pipeline inspection. Many actuation modes have been chosen to drive the soft robots, including pneumatic actuators, dielectric elastomeric actuators, and shape memory actuators. Pneumatic actuators stand out since the soft robots with pneumatic actuation can produce relatively large forces and displacements with relatively ease of fabrication. Currently, several pneumatic actuators are used to realize elongating movement and anchoring movement of the earthworm for peristaltic motion. More pneumatic actuators not only require more pumps and valves to actuate and control the earthworm, but also lead to less efficient movement control of the earthworm. To address this issue, a new design with integrated single pneumatic actuator and cellular structures is developed to realize elongating movement and anchoring movement of the earthworm-like soft robot in peristaltic motion. With the new design, the simulation model of the new earthworm is developed to simulate both elongating and anchoring movements of the earthworm. A 3D printed prototype of the earthworm-like soft robot is fabricated to validate the proposed design and simulation model. Experimental results show good agreement with the simulation in elongations of peristaltic motion as the differences between the simulated and experimental is 5.8 % in one cycle of the peristaltic motion.
