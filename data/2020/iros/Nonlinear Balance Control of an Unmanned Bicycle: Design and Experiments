In this paper, nonlinear control techniques are exploited to balance an unmanned bicycle with enlarged stability domain. We consider two cases. For the first case when the autonomous bicycle is balanced by the flywheel, the steering angle is set to zero, and the torque of the flywheel is used as the control input. The controller is designed based on the Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) method. For the second case when the bicycle is balanced by the handlebar, the bicycleâ€™s velocity is high, and the flywheel is turned off. The angular velocity of the handlebar is used as the control input and the balance controller is designed based on feedback linearization. In these cases, the global stability of the closed-loop unmanned bicycle is theoretically proved based on Lyapunov theory. The experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed nonlinear balance controllers.
