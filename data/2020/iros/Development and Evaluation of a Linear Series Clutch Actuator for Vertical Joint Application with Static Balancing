Future robots are expected to share their workspace with humans. Controlling and limiting the forces that such robots exert on their environment is crucial. While force control can be achieved actively with the help of force sensing, passive mechanisms have no time delay in their response to external forces, and would therefore be preferable. Series clutch actuators can be used to achieve high levels of safety and backdrivability. This work presents the first implementation of a linear series clutch actuator. It can exert forces of more than 110N while weighing less than 2kg. Force controllability and safety are demonstrated. Static balancing, which is important for the application in a vertical joint, is also implemented. The power consumption is evaluated, and for a payload of 3kg and with the maximum speed of 94mm/s, the power consumed by the actuator is 11W. Overall, a practical implementation of a linear series clutch actuator is reported, which can be used for future collaborative robots.
