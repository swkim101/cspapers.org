We present the first demonstration of a battery-free untethered wirelessly powered sub-gram jumping robot on an insect-scale. In order to operate the insect-sized robot autonomously, the limitation in battery use emphasizes the need for a wireless power transmission system as an onboard power solution. We designed a wireless power transmission system based on inductive coupling to power the Shape Memory Alloy (SMA), which serves as an elastic energy storage element and actuator for the jumping robot. The assembled mechanical structures, onboard power and electronics yield a 2 mm (high) × 24 mm (long) × 12 mm (wide) robot with ∼a weight of 216 mg. The experiments show that our jumping robot wirelessly lift-off up to 5.75 times its body length and repeats the jump around 7 times per minute. To date, out of the several untethered sub-gram insect-scale jumping robots with onboard power, this is the first wirelessly powered robot with the highest jumping performance. The novelty in this work, which addresses the engineering challenges in insect-scale jumping robots, is an untethered wirelessly powered design that achieves dynamic jumping maneuvers, and has self-righting ability.
