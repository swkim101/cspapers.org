In this paper, we propose SolarSLAM, a batteryfree loop closure method for indoor localisation. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) based indoor localisation method has been widely used due to its ubiquity in mobile devices, such as mobile phones, smartwatches and wearable bands. However, it suffers from the unavoidable long term drift. To mitigate the localisation error, many loop closure solutions have been proposed using sophisticated sensors, such as cameras, laser, etc. Despite achieving high-precision localisation performance, these sensors consume a huge amount of energy. Different from those solutions, the proposed SolarSLAM takes advantage of an energy harvesting solar cell as a sensor and achieves effective battery-free loop closure method. The proposed method suggests the key-point dynamic time warping for detecting loops and uses robust simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) as the optimiser to remove falsely recognised loop closures. Extensive evaluations in the real environments have been conducted to demonstrate the advantageous photocurrent characteristics for indoor localisation and good localisation accuracy of the proposed method.
