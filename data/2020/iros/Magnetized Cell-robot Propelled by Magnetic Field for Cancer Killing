In this paper, we present a magnetized cell-robot using macrophages as templates, which can be controlled under a strong gradient magnetic field, to approach and kill cancer cells in both vitro and vivo environment. Firstly, we establish a magnetic control system using only four coils which can generate gradient field up to 4.14 T/m utilizing the coupled field contributed by multiple electromagnets acting in concert. Most importantly, the cell-robot which is based on the macrophage is proposed, and can be transported to the vicinity of cancer cells precisely using strong gradient magnetic field. Then the cell-robot will actively phagocytose the cancer cells and eventually kill them, achieving the cancer treatment at the cellular level. It has important significance for guiding accurate targeted therapy in vivo for the future, under the premise of zero harm to the human body.
