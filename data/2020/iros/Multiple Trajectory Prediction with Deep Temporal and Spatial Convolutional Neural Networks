Automated vehicles need to not only perceive their environment, but also predict the possible future behavior of all detected traffic participants in order to safely navigate in complex scenarios and avoid critical situations, ranging from merging on highways to crossing urban intersections. Due to the availability of datasets with large numbers of recorded trajectories of traffic participants, deep learning based approaches can be used to model the behavior of road users. This paper proposes a convolutional network that operates on rasterized actor-centric images which encode the static and dynamic actor-environment. We predict multiple possible future trajectories for each traffic actor, which include position, velocity, acceleration, orientation, yaw rate and position uncertainty estimates. To make better use of the past movement of the actor, we propose to employ temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) and rely on uncertainties estimated from the previous object tracking stage. We evaluate our approach on the public "Argoverse Motion Forecasting" dataset, on which it won the first prize at the Argoverse Motion Forecasting Challenge, as presented on the NeurIPS 2019 workshop on "Machine Learning for Autonomous Driving".
