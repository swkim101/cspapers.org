The main contribution of this paper is a probabilistic estimator that assists a mobile robot to locate a gas source in an indoor environment. The scenario is that a robot equipped with a gas sensor enters a building after the gas is released due to a leak or explosion. The problem is discretized by dividing the environment into a set of regions and time into a set of time intervals. Likelihood functions describing the probability of obtaining a certain gas concentration measurement at a given location at a given time interval are assembled using data generated with GADEN, a three-dimensional gas dispersion simulator([1]). Given a measurement of the gas concentration is available, Bayesâ€™s rule is used to compute the joint probability density describing the location of the gas source and the time at which it started spreading. To illustrate the estimation process, a relatively simple motion planner that directs the robot towards the most likely gas source location using a cost function based on the marginal probability of the gas source location is used. The motion plan is periodically revised to reflect the latest posterior probability density. Simulation experiments in a large air-conditioned building with turbulence and wind are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.
