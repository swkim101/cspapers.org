This paper presents a concept for haptic-based human-in-the-loop aerial manipulation for drilling. The concept serves as a case study for designing the human-drone interface to remotely drill with a mobile-manipulating drone. The notion of the work stems from using drones to perform dangerous tasks like material assembly, sensor insertion while being vertically elevated from bridge, wind turbine, and power line. Presented is the aerial manipulator, the customized haptic drill press, the gantry-based test-and-evaluation platform design, material drilling results in the gantry, and validation-and-verification results for indoor flight trials.
