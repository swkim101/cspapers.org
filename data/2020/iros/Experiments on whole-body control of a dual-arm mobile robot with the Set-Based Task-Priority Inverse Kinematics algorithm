In this paper an experimental study of set-based task-priority kinematic control for a dual-arm mobile robot is developed. The control strategy for the coordination of the two manipulators and the mobile base relies on the definition of a set of elementary tasks to be properly handled depending on their functional role. In particular, the tasks have been grouped into three categories: safety, operational and optimization tasks. The effectiveness of the resulting task hierarchy has been validated through experiments on a Kinova Movo robot, in a domestic use case scenario.
