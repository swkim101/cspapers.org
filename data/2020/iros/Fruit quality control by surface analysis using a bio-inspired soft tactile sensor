The growing consumer demand for large volumes of high quality fruit has generated an increasing need for auto-mated fruit quality control during production. Optical methods have been proved successful in a few cases, but with limitations related to the variability of fruit colors and lighting conditions during tests. Tactile sensing provides a valuable alternative, although it comes with the need of a physical interaction that could damage the fruit. To overcome these limitations, we propose the usage of a recently developed soft tactile sensor for non-invasive fruit quality control. The ability of the sensor to detect very small forces and to finely analyze surfaces allows the collection of relevant information about the fruit by performing a very delicate physical interaction, that does not cause any damage. We report experiments in which such information is used to determine whether apples and strawberries are ripe or senescent. We test different configurations of the sensor and different classification algorithms, achieving very good accuracy for both apples (96%) and strawberries (83%).
