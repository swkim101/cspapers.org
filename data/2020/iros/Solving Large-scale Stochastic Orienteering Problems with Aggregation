In this paper we consider the stochastic cost orienteering problem, i.e., a version of the classic orienteering problem where the cost associated with each edge is a random variable with known distribution. Such a model is relevant when travel costs are variable, e.g., when a robot moves in uncertain terrain conditions. We model this problem using a composite state space tracking both how much progress the robot has made towards the goal and how much time it has left. On top of this state space, we compute a time-aware policy that allows the robot to dynamically adjust its path and avoid missing the temporal deadline. This policy is determined using a Constrained Markov Decision Process that allows tuning the accepted failure probability upfront. This approach suffers from a significant growth in the composite state space, and to mitigate this problem we introduce an aggregation technique where nearby vertices are compounded together, effectively reducing the original routing problem to an instance with a smaller state space. We then analyze this approach over large scale problem instances associated with robotic irrigation on a commercial grade vineyard.
