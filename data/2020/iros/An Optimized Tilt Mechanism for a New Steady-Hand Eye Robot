Robot-assisted vitreoretinal surgery can filter surgeonsâ€™ hand tremors and provide safe, accurate tool manipulation. In this paper, we report the design, optimization, and evaluation of a novel tilt mechanism for a new Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER). The new tilt mechanism features a four-bar linkage design and has a compact structure. Its kinematic configuration is optimized to minimize the required linear range of motion (LRM) for implementing a virtual remote center-of-motion (V-RCM) while tilting a surgical tool. Due to the different optimization constraints for the robots at the left and right sides of the human head, two configurations of this tilt mechanism are proposed. Experimental results show that the optimized tilt mechanism requires a significantly smaller LRM (e.g. 5.08 mm along Z direction and 8.77 mm along Y direction for left side robot) as compared to the slider-crank tilt mechanism used in the previous SHER (32.39 mm along Z direction and 21.10 mm along Y direction). The feasibility of the proposed tilt mechanism is verified in a mock bilateral robot-assisted vitreoretinal surgery. The ergonomically acceptable robot postures needed to access the surgical field is also determined.
