Control and localization of deformable linear objects (DLOs) require models to handle their deformation. This paper proposes an approach to automatically generate a model from available visual sensor information. Based on point cloud data obtained from a 3D stereo camera, the kinematics of a multibody model formulation are derived. The approach aims to balance the tradeoff between computational complexity and model accuracy. This is achieved with a geometric error criterion that reduces the introduced degrees of freedom (DOF) of the model to a necessary minimum, representing the continuous shape with as few bodies as possible. The approach is evaluated analytically and validated with an experimental scenario of DLO manipulation.
