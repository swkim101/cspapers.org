Driver gaze mapping is crucial to estimate driver attention and determine which objects the driver is focusing on while driving. We introduce DGAZE, the first large-scale driver gaze mapping dataset. Unlike previous works, our dataset does not require expensive wearable eye-gaze trackers and instead relies on mobile phone cameras for data collection. The data was collected in a lab setting designed to mimic real driving conditions and has point and object-level annotation. It consists of 227,178 road-driver image pairs collected from 20 drivers and contains 103 unique objects on the road belonging to 7 classes: cars, pedestrians, traffic signals, motorbikes, auto-rickshaws, buses and signboards.We also present I-DGAZE, a fused convolutional neural network for predicting driver gaze on the road, which was trained on the DGAZE dataset. Our architecture combines facial features such as face location and head pose along with the image of the left eye to get optimum results. Our model achieves an error of 186.89 pixels on the road view of resolution 1920Ã—1080 pixels. We compare our model with state-of-the-art eye gaze works and present extensive ablation results.
