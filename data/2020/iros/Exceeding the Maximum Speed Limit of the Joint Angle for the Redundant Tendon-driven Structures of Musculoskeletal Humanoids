The musculoskeletal humanoid has various biomimetic benefits, and the redundant muscle arrangement is one of its most important characteristics. This redundancy can achieve fail-safe redundant actuation and variable stiffness control. However, there is a problem that the maximum joint angle velocity is limited by the slowest muscle among the redundant muscles. In this study, we propose two methods that can exceed the limited maximum joint angle velocity, and verify the effectiveness with actual robot experiments.
