This paper presents combined velocity-heading control of a planar snake robot for the autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in a simulation environment. The kinematics and dynamics of the snake robot were derived using the articulated-body algorithm without considering the non-holonomic constraints. A double-layer controller was designed to control both heading direction and average velocity through joint motion control. We adopted a rule-based expert system for autonomous navigation while avoiding obstacles/restricted-areas. The guidance commands were realized by two proportional controllers that use feedback of the estimated speed and heading of the robot. To validate the combined velocity-heading controller, a series of simulations were carried out for a snake robot with 6 links (8 DOF). The autonomous navigation and obstacle-avoidance algorithms provided the commands to follow the desired trajectories. The simulation results showed the effectiveness of the controller in following the desired heading directions and achieving targeted velocities with small errors to reach the goal position by avoiding obstacles.
