This paper describes the design, control and initial experimental results of the quadruped robot LLAMA. Designed to operate in a human-scale world, this 67kg-class, all-electric robot is capable of rapid motion over a variety of terrains. Thanks to a unique leg configuration and custom high-torque, low gear-ratio motors, it can move omnidirectionally at speeds over 1 m/s. A hierarchical reactive control scheme allows for robust and efficient motion even under variable payloads. This paper describes the structure of the controller and outlines simulation results that probe the performance envelope of the robot suggesting payload capacities up to one third of its body weight. Initial testing shows robust motion over loose debris and a variety of ground slopes. Videos of the robot may be seen at https://tinyurl.com/llama-robot.
