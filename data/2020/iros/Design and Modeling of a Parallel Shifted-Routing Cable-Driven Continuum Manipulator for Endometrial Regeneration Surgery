Endometrial regeneration surgery is a new therapy for intrauterine adhesion (IUA). However, existing instruments lacking dexterity and compliance are with difficulty to successfully perform the tasks of generating transplant wounds and transplanting stem cells during endometrial regeneration surgery. This paper presents a novel shifted-routing continuum manipulator which is driven by only two cables but has high dexterity, simple structure and small size. The design of the continuum manipulator with novel actuation strategy is introduced and the manipulatorâ€™s kinematic model is also derived. The analysis and simulation imply that shifted-routing strategy improves the dexterity of manipulators under limited actuation numbers and enhances the ability of reaching targets on fundus and corpus of the uterus. Finally, the shifted-routing continuum manipulator is used to reach targets in a planner endometrium model. The experimental results show that the tip of the manipulator can reach all the area of endometrium from proper directions.
