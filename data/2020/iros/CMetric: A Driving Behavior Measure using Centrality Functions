We present a new measure, CMetric, to classify driver behaviors using centrality functions. Our formulation combines concepts from computational graph theory and social traffic psychology to quantify and classify the behavior of human drivers. CMetric is used to compute the probability of a vehicle executing a driving style, as well as the intensity used to execute the style. Our approach is designed for realtime autonomous driving applications, where the trajectory of each vehicle or road-agent is extracted from a video. We compute a dynamic geometric graph (DGG) based on the positions and proximity of the road-agents and centrality functions corresponding to closeness and degree. These functions are used to compute the CMetric based on style likelihood and style intensity estimates. Our approach is general and makes no assumption about traffic density, heterogeneity, or how driving behaviors change over time. We present an algorithm to compute CMetric and demonstrate its performance on real-world traffic datasets. To test the accuracy of CMetric, we introduce a new evaluation protocol (called "Time Deviation Error") that measures the difference between human prediction and the prediction made by CMetric.
