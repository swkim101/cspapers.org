This work investigates the problem of simultaneous tracking and jamming of a rogue drone in 3D space with a team of cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We propose a decentralized estimation, decision and control framework in which a team of UAVs cooperate in order to a) optimally choose their mobility control actions that result in accurate target tracking and b) select the desired transmit power levels which cause uninterrupted radio jamming and thus ultimately disrupt the operation of the rogue drone. The proposed decision and control framework allows the UAVs to reconfigure themselves in 3D space such that the cooperative simultaneous tracking and jamming (CSTJ) objective is achieved; while at the same time ensures that the unwanted inter-UAV jamming interference caused during CSTJ is kept below a specified critical threshold. Finally, we formulate this problem under challenging conditions i.e., uncertain dynamics, noisy measurements and false alarms. Extensive simulation experiments illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.
