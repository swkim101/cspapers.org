Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has long been a dream for stable and reliable motion estimation, especially in indoor environments where GPS strength limits. In this paper, we propose a novel method for position and orientation estimation of a moving object only from a sequence of IMU signals collected from the phone. Our main observation is that human motion is monotonous and periodic. We adopt the Extended Kalman Filter and use the learning-based method to dynamically update the measurement noise of the filter. Our pedestrian motion tracking system intends to accurately estimate planar position, velocity, heading direction without restricting the phoneâ€™s daily use. The method is not only tested on the self-collected signals, but also provides accurate position and velocity estimations on the public RIDI dataset, i.e., the absolute transmit error is 1.28m for a 59-second sequence.
