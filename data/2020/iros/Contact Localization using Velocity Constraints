Localizing contacts and collisions is an important aspect of failure detection and recovery for robots and can aid perception and exploration of the environment. Contrary to state-of-the-art methods that rely on forces and torques measured on the robot, this paper proposes a kinematic method for proprioceptive contact localization on compliant robots using velocity measurements. The method is validated on two planar robots, the quadrupedal Minitaur and the two-fingered Direct Drive (DD) Hand which are compliant due to inherent transparency from direct drive actuation. Comparisons to other state-of-the-art proprioceptive methods are shown in simulation. Preliminary results on further extensions to complex geometry (through numerical methods) and spatial robots (with a particle filter) are discussed.
