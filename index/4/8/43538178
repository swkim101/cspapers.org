Complex structures cannot be built; they must grow. Natural living systems grow and are both the products and creators of the environment; nothing exists in isolation. To create software that can approach the complexity of natural forms, we will have to figure out how to grow our software as well. This begins with changing the way we represent it so that changes are graceful and fundamentally stable. One way to do it, which I am developing, is to represent software as a connected web of relationships among the parts. If this representation can be integrated with its environment - that is, all the information that surrounds the creation of the software, all the more likely the system as a whole will reflect reality and pave the way for automated processes to work together with humans in the same environment in the software garden.
