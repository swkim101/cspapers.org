This paper presents a multidisciplinary task approach for assessing the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of work. We provide definitions of a task from two main perspectives: socio-economic and computational. We propose to explore ways in which we can integrate or map these perspectives, and link them with the skills or capabilities required by them, for humans and AI systems. Finally, we argue that in order to understand the dynamics of tasks, we have to explore the relevance of autonomy and generality of AI systems for the automation or alteration of the workplace.
