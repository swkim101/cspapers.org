In this paper, we investigate the physical layer secrecy performance of a single-input single-output system that consists of single antenna devices and operates in the presence of a single antenna passive eavesdropper over dissimilar fading channels. In particular, we consider two scenarios in terms of dissimilar fading channel arrangements: the legal/illegal channels are subject to Rayleigh/Rician fading, respectively; and the legal/illegal channels are subject to Rician/Rayleigh fading, respectively. Specifically, analytical expressions for the probability of the existence of a non-zero secrecy capacity and the secrecy outage probability are derived by using statistical characteristics of the signal-to-noise ratio. Numerical results are provided for selected scenarios to illustrate applications of the developed analytical expressions.
