Healthcare insurance data represent a rich source of information and has the potential to contribute significantly in guiding business decision making. In this work we present GraPhys, a Graph Analysis platform designed for exploration, visualization and analysis of healthcare insurance data and its corresponding metadata. By taking advantage of relationships contained in healthcare claims data, we are able to apply Graph Analytics methods and algorithms in order to devise useful business metrics to guide data analysis and exploration. Our tool focuses in better understanding physicians, patients and their practices. We illustrate our approach by demonstrating two use cases where we show how graph analytics metrics, combined with other data, may lead to useful insights not directly available to traditional Business Analytics.
