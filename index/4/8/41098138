In this research project we have taken the TeaLeaf ‘miniapp’ and developed several ports using a mixture of new and mature parallel programming models. We have discovered that RAJA is a promising model with an intuitive development approach, that exhibits good performance on central processing units (CPUs), but does not currently support other devices. Kokkos requires greater up-front development, but represents a highly competitive option for performance portability on CPUs and NVIDIA general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). The results showed that Kokkos can exhibit portable performance to within 5% of OpenMP and hand-optimised CUDA for some solvers, but our implementation suffered some issues on the Intel Xeon Phi Knights Corner (KNC).
