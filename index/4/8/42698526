A Class-AB 0.8 GHz-2.1 GHz broadband power amplifier integrated circuit is present in 0.13 Î¼m SiGe HBT technology. The power amplifier circuit adopts broadband matching, compensated matching, high-linearity, and temperature-insensitive bias technique. The simulation results show, when the circuit biased at 3.3 V, the power amplifier maximum power gain is 24 dB, its 3-dB bandwidth is 649 MHz-2151 MHz, output 1 dB compression point is 25.9 dBm, and its maximum output power is 28.4 dBm. The power added efficiency is better than 31%.
