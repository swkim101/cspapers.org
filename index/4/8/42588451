A course in discrete mathematical structures has been included as a necessary component of a program in all major curriculum studies in computer science. This paper discusses this type of course with respect to problems encountered in its implementation due to its central position in the curriculum. Recommendations are made regarding the level, content, and handling of the course, based on several years' experience in teaching the material.
