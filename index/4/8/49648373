We present a new quasi-polynomial algorithm for solving parity games. It is based on a new bisimulation invariant measure of complexity for parity games, called the register-index, which captures the complexity of the priority assignment. For fixed parameter k, the class of games with register-index bounded by k is solvable in polynomial time. We show that the register-index of parity games of size n is bounded by O(log n) and derive a quasi-polynomial algorithm. Finally, we give a descriptive complexity account of the quasi-polynomial complexity of parity games: The winning regions of parity games with p priorities and register-index k are described by a modal Î¼ formula of which the complexity, as measured by its alternation depth, depends on k rather than p.
