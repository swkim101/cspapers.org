This paper presents a formulation for unsupervised learning of clusters reflecting multiple causal structure in binary data. Unlike the standard mixture model, a multiple cause model accounts for observed data by combining assertions from many hidden causes, each of which can pertain to varying degree to any subset of the observable dimensions. A crucial issue is the mixing-function for combining beliefs from different cluster-centers in order to generate data reconstructions whose errors are minimized both during recognition and learning. We demonstrate a weakness inherent to the popular weighted sum followed by sigmoid squashing, and offer an alternative form of the nonlinearity. Results are presented demonstrating the algorithm's ability successfully to discover coherent multiple causal representations of noisy test data and in images of printed characters.
