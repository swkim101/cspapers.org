Metallic surfaces are imparted to non-conductive or dielectric substrates by an electroless (chemical) coating process comprised of coating the surface of the substrate with colloids of catalytic non-precious metals wherein the metals are either part of an alloy or in the elemental state or a compound and wherein the colloidal suspension further comprises antioxidant as to minimize the surface oxidation of the colloids and are further admixed in a manner resulting in good colloidal stability.
