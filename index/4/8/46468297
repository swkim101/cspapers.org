In this paper, different energy harvesting solutions for an autonomous miniature wireless sensing node are invista-gated. The communication part is realized with Low Power Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) LoRa technology that combine low-power and long range capabilities. Solar, Thermal and Piezo harvesting techniques are compared for autonomous sensing application.
