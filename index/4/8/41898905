This article gives insight into a research project aiming at the on-site manufacturing of masonry with the assistance of an automatic mobile robot. Regarding an application orientated realisation, a commercial construction machine is modified and converted into a bricklaying robot. The paper describes the kinematic structure of the robot, the sequence of the automated construction of masonry and an open and efficient multitasking control system for the bricklaying robot.<<ETX>>
