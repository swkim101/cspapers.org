In this paper we introduce a software and hardware structure for on-line mobile robotic systems. The system hardware configuration mainly consists of a commercially available Pioneer 2 PeopleBot mobile robot, a Sony PTZ video camera and a pair of BreezeNet indoor wireless Ethernet adaptors. The system employs a client-server software architecture in which the client server is insulated from the lower-level details of the mobile robot. This architecture is implemented on the real Internet and the preliminary result is promising. By adopting this modular structure, it will be very easy to construct an experimental platform for the research on diverse teleoperation topics such as remote control algorithms, interface designs, network protocols and applications etc.
