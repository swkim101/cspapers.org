In a previous work, we presented system Ltree, a multivariate tree that combines a decision tree with a linear discriminant by means of constructive induction. We have shown that it performs quite well, in terms of accuracy and learning times, in comparison with other multivariate systems like LMDT, OC1, and CART. In this work, we extend the previous work by using two new discriminant functions: a quadratic discriminant and a logistic discriminant. Using the same architecture as Ltree we obtain two new multivariate trees Qtree and LgTree. The three systems have been evaluate on 17 UCI datasets. From the empirical study, we argue that these systems can be shown as a composition of classi-ers with low correlation error. From a bias-variance analysis of the error rate, the error reduction of all the systems in comparison to a univariate tree, is due to a reduction on both components.
