The modeling and identification of a mechanical system is the most important issue for many control systems in order to realize the desired control specifications. In particular, the friction characteristics often deteriorate the control performance, such as in the fast and precise positioning performance in industrial robots, the force estimation accuracy based on a disturbance observer, and the posture control performance of an inverted pendulum robot. Rolling friction tends to cause overshoot, undershoot, or limit cycles of the target value in positioning systems. In previous research, some model structures for rolling friction have been proposed to express the hysteresis characteristics in order to overcome these control issues. However, it is difficult to identify the correct parameters for precise modeling. In this paper, the modeling of rolling friction based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to precisely express the rolling friction characteristics. The initial value design of the RNN during supervised learning is also presented to achieve a better model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by comparison with conventional friction models using an actual experimental setup.
