Because of rapidly increasing demand for high capacity communication services compact antennas have become center of research interest nowadays and this reduction of size becomes much more important especially when we want to use the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology; to increase channel capacity, in modern compact devices. Microstrip antennas are an attractive option due to low cost, and small size. However to fulfill need for more compact and miniaturized devices; a dual feed dual element planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) at 2.45GHz has been proposed on a very small PCB (60 mm × 20 mm × 0.8 mm), to be used for ISM 2.45 GHz band. While total volume occupied by two antennas is 10 mm × 20 mm × 2.5 mm. −10 dB return loss or VSWR=2 criterion for required bandwidth has been satisfied, only with help of designing a novel radiation structure. To miniaturize size of PIFA a novel T-shaped slot has been employed in radiation structure. Overall size is compact than small MIMO antennas, available in open literature. As the proposed design is suitable for different feeding environments, it can be used in different small size PCB devices, for different applications. Results show satisfactory bandwidth, and omnidirectional radiation pattern.
