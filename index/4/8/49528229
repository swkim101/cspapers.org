We use surrogate losses to obtain several new regret bounds and new algorithms for contextual bandit learning. Using the ramp loss, we derive a new margin-based regret bound in terms of standard sequential complexity measures of a benchmark class of real-valued regression functions. Using the hinge loss, we derive an efficient algorithm with a $\sqrt{dT}$-type mistake bound against benchmark policies induced by $d$-dimensional regressors. Under realizability assumptions, our results also yield classical regret bounds.
