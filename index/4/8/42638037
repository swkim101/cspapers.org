My thesis research focuses on developing tools and techniques in the robotic sciences to study and understand large-scale dynamic coastal processes that are driven by global climate change. As a first step, my work targets Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) which have significant societal and economic impact to coastal communities, yet are poorly understood ecologically because of undersampling.
