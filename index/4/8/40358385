Office Information Systems (OIS) are emerging as a major application area of computer technology [Ellis and Nutt]. In this paper, a system is outlined which can hopefully provide a successful environment for office mechanization and automation. As a first step the philosophy is sketched which led to certain decisions concerning the nature and the facilities of the system. The philosophical remarks can be helpful in explaining the directions in the development of the system.
