Carbon-metal catalysts having a substantial amount of catalytically active metal, e.g. silver, deposited thereon in zero-valent, small cluster form, are prepared by vapourizing the metal under low vapour pressure conditions in the vicinity of an organic liquid solvent e.g. tetrahydrofuran, such that the metal dissolves in the solvent as a labile solvated zero-valent metal complex. This complex is contacted with the carbon so that the complex diffuses onto the surface of the carbon and also into the pores thereof.
