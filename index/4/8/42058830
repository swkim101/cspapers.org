The ability to understand and communicate spatial relationships is central to many human-level reasoning tasks. People often describe spatial relationships using prepositions (i.e., in, on, under). Being able to use and interpret spatial prepositions could help create interactive systems for many tasks, including knowledge capture. Here I describe my thesis work modeling the learning and use of spatial prepositions and applying this model to the task of knowledge capture.
