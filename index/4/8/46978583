Software controllers are increasingly prevalent in embedded applications controlling safety-critical physical processes. The actual stability guarantee offered by such software implementations depend on errors induced in plant state information due to sensor level faults caused either by transient errors in sensing hardware or adversaries with the intention of destabilizing the system. The present work proposes a framework which estimates the stability loss of control software implementations as the probability of violating some control theoretic guarantee in the presence of sensory faults.
