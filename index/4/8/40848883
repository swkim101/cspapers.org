In this poster we propose a granular approach for presenting web search results. Sentences, taken from the top documents, are used as fine-grained representations of document content and, when combined in a ranked list, to provide an overview of the set of retrieved documents. Current search engine interfaces assume users examine such results document-by-document. In contrast our approach groups, ranks and presents the contents of the top ranked document set. We evaluate our approach by a comparison with traditional forms of web search result presentation.
