In the scope of this paper, we analyze and evaluate in a comprehensive manner the effect of diffraction in hidden target detection and localization using ultra wide-band (UWB) radars. In order to effectively do the analysis and evaluation, we firstly derive to develop a three-dimensional electromagnetic (EM) propagation model which can characterize at any point in free space the far-field scattered by a scenario. The far-field at a given point includes the amplitude and the phase. The proposed scenario in the paper comprises of a metallic wall and a canonical object placed behind the wall in a way that there is no issue of direct line-of-sight (LOS). We configure two UWB radars, as transmitter and receiver, in bistatic mode working at high frequencies (i.e. Ka-band). Then, we apply this model to compare with some experimental results in the anechoic chamber with regard to explain and evaluate the diffraction effect in target detection and localization.
