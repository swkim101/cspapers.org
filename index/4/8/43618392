In sensing systems, data compression is a promised way to save energy because it reduces the rate of data transmission, but less attention has been paid to the underlying task scheduling algorithms. We present a Double Rate Bundle Scheduling algorithm (DRBS) that maximizes the sleep state period of the CPU to reduce energy consumption. Our prototype implementation in a Mote device improves energy efficiency up to 8% compared to existing algorithms.
