At the end of digital integrated circuit (IC) design flow, some nets may still be left open due to engineering change order (ECO). Resolving these opens could be quite challenging for some huge nets such as power ground nets because of a large number of obstacles and greatly distributed net components. Existing studies on multilayer obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner trees may not be applicable to solve this problem because they assume the pins of an input net is a set of points, while the discrete net components in this problem can be regarded as a set of rectilinear pins. In this paper, we develop an efficient open-net connector that can deal with rectilinear pins. The proposed algorithm flow minimizes the total connection cost based on precise estimation of the shortest distance between each pair of rectilinear net components with the presence of complex obstacles. Experimental results show that the proposed flow can outperform the top three teams of 2017 CAD Contest at ICCAD in terms of total connection cost or runtime efficiency.
