In this paper, we study two important secure performance metrics of cluster-based multihop relaying networks under the presence of eavesdropper with imperfect main channel estimation. At each hop, partial relay selection is used to improve secure performance. In particular, we derive the system secure outage probability and the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity over Rayleigh fading channels, which are then used to investigate the effect of imperfect channel state information on the system secure performance. Simulations are performed to verify the correctness of the analysis approach.
