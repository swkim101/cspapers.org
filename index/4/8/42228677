Recorded Future has developed its Temporal Analytics Engine as a general purpose platform for harvesting and analyzing unstructured text from the open, deep, and dark web, and for transforming that content into a structured representation suitable for different analyses. In this paper we present some of the key components of our system, and show how it has been adapted to the increasingly important domain of cyber threat intelligence. We also describe how our data can be used for predictive analytics, e.g. to predict the likelihood of a product vulnerability being exploited or to assess the maliciousness of an IP address.
