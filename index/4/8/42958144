Rapid and widespread reform in the teaching of mathematical and computational sciences is essential if this nation is to retain (or regain) technological, economic, and social leadership in the community of nations. Some effective strategies, such as the calculus reform movement, have already demonstrated that widespread change is possible (and have validated the vision and investment of organizations such as the NSF, NRC, and DOE). The UCES (Undergraduate Computational Engineering and Science) project, an effort funded by the Department of Energy and administered through the Ames Laboratory, promotes the emerging field of computational science as a multidisciplinary approach to scientific analysis.

In order to make these materials useful to as wide range of people as possible, they have been designed to be problem driven, modular in format, and interactive. The UCES materials can augment (or replace) traditional classes in computer programming and numerical analysis. All UCES educational materials stress the path from scientific problem to computational solution, while illustrating the ~$guiding themes‚Äù of computational science, such as high performance computing architectures and scientific visualization. As part of its mission, the UCES project is sponsoring an informal and open discussion of the salient issues confronting efforts
