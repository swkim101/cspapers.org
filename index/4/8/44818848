HPC vendors have typically focused on scaling system performance without the same level of focus on scaling system reliability. In this presentation, Dr. Garth Gibson, founder and CTO of Panasas, Inc., will discuss a range of storage reliability issues including the impact of the ever-increasing density of disk drives on storage system availability. Gibson will discuss Panasas Object RAID - a new solution for overcoming the problem of incomplete reconstructions of failed disks and the advantages of this approach over traditional RAID 6. In addition, he will review the latest technology enhancements designed to deliver industry-leading availability by providing fully parallel reconstruction and seamless failover for clustered metadata and storage networks. As a result, HPC customers can run their critical applications and analysis without interruptions or downtime on their Linux clusters.
