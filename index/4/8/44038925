Electronic energy meter has got numerous advantages over the conventional electromechanical meter and due to this; many countries of the world have switched to electronic metering system. But unfortunately Pakistan is still deprived of such meters. The paper is based on the final year project of the design & implementation of prepaid electronic energy meter which we are designing in order to eliminate the problems being faced by the Pakistani people. By the introduction of prepaid system in Pakistan the problem of overcharging and over billing and the trouble being faced by the customers in paying the bills will be removed all together. Since our meter is electronic in nature, it has got no moving parts and hence the problem of stability & accuracy due to temperature changes are solved. Our meter is also tamper resistant which eradicates the chances of the theft of electricity.
