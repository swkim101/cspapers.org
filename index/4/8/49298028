This paper discusses energy-efficient acoustic feature-scoring using transistors with Gaussian-shaped IDS–VGS. Acoustic feature-scoring is a critical step in speech recognition tasks such as speaker recognition. Suited to the transistor, we discuss a novel acoustic model based on the harmonic mean of Gaussian functions, yielding a much-simplified physical implementation. Compared to digital CMOS, the discussed implementation reduces energy dissipation of a 13-dimensional mixture function by 45×. For a test-case recognizing among seven speakers, the design reduces power dissipation by 7.8× than digital CMOS. Exploiting the simplified mixture function, we present algorithmic overdesigning for resiliency against hardware imperfections.
