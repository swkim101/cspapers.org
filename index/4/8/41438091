In this paper, we focus on a network of rich sensors that are geographically distributed and argue that the design of such networks poses very different challenges from traditional "mote-class" sensor network design. We identify the need to handle the diverse requirements of multiple users to be a major design challenge, and propose a utility-driven approach to maximize data sharing across users while judiciously using limited network and computational resources. Our utility-driven architecture addresses three key challenges for such rich multi-user sensor networks: how to define utility functions for networks with data sharing among end-users, how to compress and prioritize data transmissions according to its importance to end-users, and how to gracefully degrade end-user utility in the presence of bandwidth fluctuations. We instantiate this architecture in the context of geographically distributed wireless radar sensor networks for weather, and present results from an implementation of our system on a multi-hop wireless mesh network that uses real radar data with real end-user applications. Our results demonstrate that our progressive compression and transmission approach achieves an order of magnitude improvement in application utility over existing utility-agnostic non-progressive approaches, while also scaling better with the number of nodes in the network.
