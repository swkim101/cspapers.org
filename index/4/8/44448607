The potential for presynaptic information processing within the arbor of a single axon will be discussed in this paper. Current knowledge about the activity dependence of the firing threshold, the conditions required for conduction failure, and the similarity of nodes along a single axon will be reviewed. An electronic circuit model for a site of low conduction safety in an axon will be presented. In response to single frequency stimulation the electronic circuit acts as a lowpass filter.
