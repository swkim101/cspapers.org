BVirusGS has been developed for Begomovirus genome analysis. This software development is an attempt to build a tool that provides single platform for conducting research at DNA, RNA and protein level. The software has a flexible structure and can be adapted to other organism's genome. A scientist can use it to conduct research at DNA level and extend it to protein studies. An average person can get an idea of structure and similarity by using this tool. The software can be used in gene identification, pattern recognition, similarity search and secondary structure prediction.
