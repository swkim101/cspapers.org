The ‘mail merge’ or ‘form letter’ feature prevalent in most word processors provides many features which make it desirable for a first introduction to the art of computer programming. We demonstrate how key concepts are introduced in an environment easily understood by the student, including variables and identifiers, the importance of order in specifying input, data files, output files, IF/THEN/ELSE statements, nested and compound IF statements, issues of syntax vs. semantics, garbage in/garbage out, debugging, and the creation of output through specifications written in a language understood by the computer.
