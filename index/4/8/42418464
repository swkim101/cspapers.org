There are proposed collective signature, blind signature, and collective blind signature protocols based on the digital signature generation and verification procedures specified by Russian and Belarusian signature standards. The protocols are characterized in computing the randomization parameter of the collective signature depending on the collective public key. Due to this novel feature the proposed protocols provide integrity of the collective signature.
