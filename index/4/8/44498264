In this paper, I propose a new algorithm for self-organizing a multilayered neural network which has an ability to recognize patterns based on the geometrical similarity of their shapes. This network, whose nickname is "neo-cognitron", has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of a photoreceptor layer followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells", which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The input synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We don't need any "teacher" during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After completion of self-organization, the stimulus patterns has become to elicit their own response from the last C-cell layer. That is, the response of the last C-cell layer changes without fail, if a stimulus patterns of a different category is presented to the input layer. The response of that layer, however, is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a certain amount of changes of the pattern's shape or size.
