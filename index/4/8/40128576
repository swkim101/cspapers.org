There is an increasing need to add real-time capability to distributed systems. This requires real-time guarantees to be provided to applications in an asynchronous distributed system. This can be acheived by adding streames, signals, synchronous programming, explicit binding, Quality of Service specifications, resource separation and pre-allocation to the flexible, lightweight distributed processing infrastructure framework described in APM.1580. 1 20th September 1995 Approved Briefing Note APM.1581.01 A Real-Time Distributed Processing Infrastructure
