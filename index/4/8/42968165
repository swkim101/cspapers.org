The advent of computing technology has made far more impact in the developed world than any other technology in the past. The effect of this technology on third world countries has, so far, not been different from the introduction of other types of technologies. This paper attempts to highlight the negative aspects of the present state of computing in these countries in the hope that lessons can be drawn which will improve and modify future developments and trends. Transferring the development pattern of the developed world would be unwise as this has proved inadequate in the industrialization process of third world countries.
 The paper also argues the role of international agencies and computer suppliers in the dissemination of information on computing technology and suggests a more pragmatic approach to the development of endogenous capacities through direct interaction between developed and less developed countries. Examples of development profiles are drawn from the Arab region and guidelines for future plans are proposed.
