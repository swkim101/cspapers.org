The prediction accuracy of a propagation model depends on two factors; the exactness of the input data (environmental database) and the ability of the prediction tool to correctly model the available information. As the current databases used in propagation prediction tools do not provide environmental details on the wavelength scale, hence an alternate solution comprising of semi-deterministic technique is used in which walls and windows/doors in the buildings are modeled as strips and slits respectively and their distribution is treated statistically. Secondly the current favourite propagation models use ray tracing technique which becomes cumbersome when dealing with multiple interaction between large number of edges. So in order to correctly model the available information method of moments (MoM) is used which takes into account all the edges present on the building faces. Channel impulse response (CIR) for scattering from building having large scale discontinuities on its face modelled semi-deterministically was calculated using MoM. Simulated CIR was validated with the actual on sight measurements and a good agreement was found
