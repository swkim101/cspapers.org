We study the problem of automatically generating an integrated schema for XML DTDs. Introducing a novel view inference approach, we shows that the set of views and source descriptions can be automatically derived. Introduction The problem of information integration has become significant as the growing number of information sources on the Internet. Information integration systems pro- vide users with an integrated schema of underlying sources. The integrated schema is designed by hand and a mapping between the integrated schema and the source schemas is needed for the system to answer queries. As XML (Bray, Paoli, & Sperberg-McQueen 1998) has become a new stan- dard for representation and exchange of data on the Internet, in this article, we consider the problem of automatically gen- erating an integrated schema for different XML DTDs with similar document types. Architecture XML with a DTD is self-descriptive and provides a semistructured data model. These properties ren- der that DTDs defining similar document type have struc- tural and naming similarities. Given a collection of source DTDs, we propose a view inference approach which auto- matically derives the set of integrated views and source de- scriptions.
