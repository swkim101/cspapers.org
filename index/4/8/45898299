An approach to 3D object representation and matching, which employs cubic B-spline curves and Coons surface patches is described. 3D objects are represented as structured collections of surface patches whose boundary curves are approximated by cubic II-splines. Both curved and polyhedral objects may be represented. A variety of 3D and 2D shape fetures are defined which are easily computed for this representation. Many of the 3D leatures have 2D analogues, thus providing access paths from 2D to 3D. It is anticipated that this approach will prove useful for matching 3D object models against 2D object descriptions. The representations our approaches to the problems of indexing and matching. the state of the implementation. and our experience with the implementation are briefly discussed.
