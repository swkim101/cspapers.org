It can discover sub-events from large amount of noisy event-related information in Twitter and semantically represent them. The task is challenging because tweets are short, informal and noisy. To solve this problem, we consider leveraging event-related hashtags that contain many locations, dates and concise sub-event related descriptions to enhance sub-event discovery. To this end, we propose a hashtag-based mutually generative Latent Dirichlet Allocation model(MGe-LDA). In MGe-LDA, hashtags and topics of a tweet are mutually generated by each other. The mutually generative process models the relationship between hashtags and topics of tweets, and highlights the role of hashtags as a semantic representation of the corresponding tweets. Experimental results show that MGe-LDA can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods for sub-event discovery.
