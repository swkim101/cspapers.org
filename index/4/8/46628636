Autonomous mobile robots can be used in many applications, such as working in dangerous environments instead of human beings. If two or more robots are used, they should work cooperatively to accomplish their job. When two mobile robots move cooperatively, one should be able to track the other. A sonar-based environment recognition AND obstacle avoidance method for the cooperative motion of two mobile robots is suggested and simulated. For this map generation, communication between the mobile robots is also used.
