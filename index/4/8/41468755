In this paper, the Power Level Difference (PLD)-based noise cancelling algorithm is implemented in a Xilinx FPGA SoC using hardware/software co-design methodology. Thanks to the hardware/software co-design, the complex control part of the algorithm can be fast deployed in software meanwhile the computational part is effectively implemented in hardware. Therefore, the system can not only process the real-time input data but also consumes few hardware resource.
