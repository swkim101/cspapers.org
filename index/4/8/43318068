In this paper, we used second order interpolation method via three successding data points in narrow area, combined with loop transformation method and used samples to build an algorithm for processing of measurement data to reduce non-linear errors and transformation errors of non-electric measuring devices. Simulation and experimental results shown the ability to reduce errors of measurement devices.
