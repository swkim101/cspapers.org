Through audio-taped student interviews, this study examined beginning Java students' conceptions of object-oriented programming. Students rated programs on stylistic criteria including ease of comprehension, ease of debugging, ease of modification, ease of reuse, and overall quality of design. They also explained the reasons for their ratings. The results will be discussed and interpreted in light of previous research. Implications for instruction will also be examined.
