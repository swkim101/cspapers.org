EXPERT Is a system for designing and building models for consultation. An EXPERT model consists of hypotheses (which can be structured Into causal and taxonomic networks); findings or observations; and decision rules for logically relating these components. A relatively simple language for describing models is employed. Logical and probabilistic rules are restricted to particular types which implicitly order the tasks performed by the control strategies: classification, question selection, and explanation. Explicit representations of decision rules are emphasized, as opposed to suboptimal scoring functions. This results in more easily predictable and correctable performance for a model. The system is currently being used to develop consultation models in domains such as rheumatology, ophthalmology, and endocrinology.
