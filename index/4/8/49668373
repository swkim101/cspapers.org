Mobile systems face privacy challenges including coarsegrained privacy control and the inability to distinguish private and public files. We propose System-E, a novel system which can enhance the user privacy on mobile systems (e.g., Android) by (1) enabling users to set finer grained permissions for apps accessing data, and (2) enabling automatic classification of data (e.g., photos) at the storage layer (e.g., by using deep learning) to prevent potentially sensitive data from being stored/accessed with open permissions.
