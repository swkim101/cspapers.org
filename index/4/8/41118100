Solving logic puzzles has become a very popular past-time, particularly since the Sudoku puzzle started appearing in newspapers all over the world. We have developed a puzzle generator for a modification of Sudoku, called Jidoku, in which clues are binary disequalities between cells on a 9 Ã— 9 grid. Our generator guarantees that puzzles have unique solutions, have graded difficulty, and can be solved using inference alone. This demonstration provides a fun application of many standard constraint satisfaction techniques, such as problem formulation, global constraints, search and inference. It is ideal as both an education and outreach tool. Our demonstration will allow people to generate and interactively solve puzzles of user-selected difficulty, with the aid of hints if required, through a specifically built Java applet.
