An approach is described for introducing practical work experience into an undergraduate computer science curriculum. This approach differs from others which have been reported in that it is not necessary for the student to make any arrangements for academic credit in advance. The requirements for obtaining practicum credit are described, and examples of projects which have received such credit are given. This approach has made a significant contribution to the educational program by offering academic credit for learning experiences which are difficult to duplicate in a typical computer science curriculum.
