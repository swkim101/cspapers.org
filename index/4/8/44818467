DARPA has been investing in data science and building open source tools for applications ranging from counter threat finance, through radar operations and cancer research, to anti-human trafficking. This presentation will cover previous work at DARPA, experience building real-world applications for defense and law enforcement to analyze data, and the future of computer science as an enabler for content discovery, information extraction, relevance determination, and information visualization. The talk will be a mix of background, detailed examples, and software demonstration. It will cover the importance of anchoring in applications, minimization of design-to-testing time, development with users-in-the-loop, error tolerance of machine learning, design for diverse user populations, and the necessity of open source software integration. It will conclude by covering a few next directions for special projects at Microsoft.
