Laboratory equipment and software have a large degree of non-homogeneity and laboratory workflows are often based on manual, error-prone activities. The current trend is to realize integrated laboratories, supporting tool interoperation and data integration. A solution for hiding the non-homogeneity of tools and data is to raise the integration problem at a higher level of abstraction. The paper studies the domains that generally pertain to a laboratory performing measurements and tests, such as to obtain integration by composing their domain models. A data integration domain is presented here, whose design is based on the interpretation of specific, user-defined, laboratory models.
