Improving the novice's experience with programming may be key to retaining more students interested in Computer Science. Programming environments is an area that lacks comprehensive study. Some entry-level sequences prefer visual environments while others tout the benefits of command line environments. In either case, there is little more than anecdotal evidence to support either choice. We present a novel categorization of programming tools based on assistive features that predict the usefulness of programming environments for novices. This categorization is supported by a controlled study that measured the differences in engagement, efficiency, comprehension, and usability. We found that the extremes of assistive features are problematic regardless of prior programming experience.
