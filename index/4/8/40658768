This WIP proposes a new architecture for applications that perform bulk data transfers. This architecture, called DOT (for data-oriented transfer), cleanly separates out two functions that are comingled in today's applications. Using DOT, applications perform content negotiation to determine what content to send. They then pass that data object to the transfer service to perform the actual data transmission. This separation increases application flexibility, enables the rapid development of innovative transfer mechanisms, reduces developer effort, and allows increased efficiency through cross-application sharing.
