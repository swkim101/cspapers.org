Large-scale software development, for the longest time, has relied heavily on centralized, process-centric approaches, such as CCMI. There are three trends that make applying a traditional approach increasingly infeasible, i.e. the increasing adoption of software product lines, global software development and software ecosystem. Although agile software development methods have removed much of the inefficiencies in small and medium-scale software development, addressing the inefficiencies in large scale software development requires a more compositional approach. The presentation introduces the differences between intra-team and inter-team coordination and presents an architecture-centric approach to large-scale software development that heavily relies on automated tool support.
