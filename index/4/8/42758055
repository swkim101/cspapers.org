This paper discusses introducing students to programming concepts before they study a high-level language. Algorithm specification using flowcharts, and implementation of certain algorithms on a demonstration computer programmed in decimal machine code provide a functional basis which extends by way of analogy to sound programming concepts for both high-level languages and assembler languages.
