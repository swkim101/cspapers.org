The authors have developed a new representation method of lexical entries and implemented it in the continuous speech recognition system. The basic structure of an entry is a transition network. Associated with each arc of the network are the expected phoneme symbol and a pair of procedures which specify the run-time treatment of phonological transformations and provide the facility of arbitrary contextual and prosodic tests.
