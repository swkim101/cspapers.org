We show by reduction from the Orthogonal Vectors problem that algorithms with strongly subquadratic running time cannot approximate the Frechet distance between curves better than a factor 3 unless SETH fails. We show that similar reductions cannot achieve a lower bound with a factor better than 3. Our lower bound holds for the continuous, the discrete, and the weak discrete Frechet distance even for curves in one dimension. Interestingly, the continuous weak Frechet distance behaves differently. Our lower bound still holds for curves in two dimensions and higher. However, for curves in one dimension, we provide an exact algorithm to compute the weak Frechet distance in linear time.
