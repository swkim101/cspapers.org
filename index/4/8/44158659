The goal of high-recall information retrieval (HRIR) is to find all or nearly all relevant documents for a search topic. In this paper, we present the design of our system that affords efficient high-recall retrieval. HRIR systems commonly rely on iterative relevance feedback. Our system uses a state-of-the-art implementation of continuous active learning (CAL), and is designed to allow other feedback systems to be attached with little work. Our system allows users to judge documents as fast as possible with no perceptible interface lag. We also support the integration of a search engine for users who would like to interactively search and judge documents. In addition to detailing the design of our system, we report on user feedback collected as part of a 50 participants user study. While we have found that users find the most relevant documents when we restrict user interaction, a majority of participants prefer having flexibility in user interaction. Our work has implications on how to build effective assessment systems and what features of the system are believed to be useful by users.
