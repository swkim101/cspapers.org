This paper presents as a case study our experience gathered along the development of a mobile application prototype to be used by restaurant clients. The application, named SmartRestaurant, uses Near Field Communication (NFC) connectivity and runs on Android. It can be used in restaurants to load its menu, and other information provided by the restaurant, through scanning a NFC tag with a mobile phone or other NFC enabled device. Additionally, the application should allow users to store and share data with others. The paper presents the lessons learned during the development process used in this case study, including the functionalities already implemented, the future work, and also the process successes and failures.
