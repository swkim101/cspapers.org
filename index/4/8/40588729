A decentralized bilateral teleoperation system is studied in this paper by using estimators with task abstraction. There is only a part of mobile robots in the multi-robot system can receive the human command via the master robot located in the local side. By exchanging information through a undirected and connected graph, mobile robots in the network have to estimate the human command and the global task function for the control of teleoperation. The control framework is more scalable and flexible that the size and formation of mobile robot network can be teleoperated. Stability analysis is presented and experimental results are illustrated to show the efficacy of the performance of the decentralized teleoperation system.
