Both practical pilgrimages into issues involving the integration of AI and DBMS technologies has attracted attention in recent years. The promised “pot of gold” has always been that the combined technologies were “more” than the sum of the individual technologies. Database technology could bring performance perspective to AI; AI could bring enriching concepts to database systems. The result would be a cross-fertilization that would lead directly to a new class of functionally rich, yet computationally efficient, information systems. Have practical, interesting, innovative, and/or useful results come from the attempts to marry or crossfertilize these fields? Are the pragmatic results from the field encouraging or discouraging? What are the lessons learned? We bring together in this panel a world-wide variety of expertise and experience to discuss this topic for the 90’s. Panelists will describe their own experiences with both the development and implementation of end-user oriented applications in a variety of environments and with a variety of tools. They will describe both the rapture of happy outcomes and the agony of less than successfull attempts. The panel and the audience in concert will provide prescriptions for the future.
