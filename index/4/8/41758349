We describe an application of artif icial intelligence techniques to computer system fault diagnosis, in particular, we have implemented an automated consultant that advises I B M field service personnel on the diagnosis of faults occurring in computer installations. The consultant identifies specific system components (both hardware and software) l ikely to be responsible for an observed fault and offers a br ief explanation of the major factors and evidence supporting these indictments. The consultant, called D A R T , was constructed using H M Y C I N [1], and is part of a larger research effort investigating automated diagnosis of machine faults [2).*
