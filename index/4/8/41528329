This paper discusses information and power flow in the Intelligent Assisting System (IAS). The IAS includes an intelligent manipulation assistant to a human operator, where information as well as forces between the operator, the IAS and the task environment are exchanged. A manipulation skill database enables the IAS to perform complex manipulations on the motion control level and intelligently assist the operator. As a first approach to the IAS the authors have been developing a skill acquisition and transfer system using a sensor glove for force feedback to the human operator. The dynamic behavior of the grip transformation matrix is regarded as the essence of the performed manipulation skill shown with a simple manipulation example. A detailed analysis of force transformations between hand and object space yields a method for acquisition of the grip transform dynamic behavior accumulated in the skill database. Further this paper defines a control algorithm realizing object task trajectories and its feasibility is shown by simulation.
