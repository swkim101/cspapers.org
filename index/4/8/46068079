We introduce data structures called responsibility set and kernel. We present an algorithm FCRK, which is a modification of FC that maintains these structures and uses them for pruning of the search space. According to our experimental evaluation, FC-RK outperforms FC-CBJ on constraint networks encoding graph k-coloring instances and on non-dense random binary constraint networks.
