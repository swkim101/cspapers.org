OpenSHMEM is a PGAS programming library implementing an RMA-based point-to-point and collective communication paradigm which decouples data motion from synchronization. This results in a more scalable programming model than more common two-sided paradigms such as MPI. The OpenSHMEM project arose in an effort to standardize among several implementations of the decade-old SHMEM API, which exhibited subtle differences in the API and underlying semantics, inhibiting portability between implementations. In collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the University of Houston is preparing an API specification and a portable, scalable, observable OpenSHMEM reference implementation.
