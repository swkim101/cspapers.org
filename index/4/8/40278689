Metamaterials composed of thin wires and spiral resonators have been studied in this paper. Technique to tune spiral resonators have been proposed. Transmission and reflection properties of metamaterials composed of thin wires and tuned spiral resonators have been simulated and compared with conventional metamaterials. The center frequency and transmission bandwidth of metamaterials have been varied through tuning of spiral resonators
