This workshop introduces an innovative social collaboration tool called Classroom Salon (CLS). Developed at Carnegie Mellon University, CLS is a combination of electronic books, social networks, and analytic tools. With CLS, instructors can upload documents, create social groups, and monitor student activities. Students can annotate documents, answer questions, and communicate in a social networks context. Students learn through participation in social networks while instructors use the tools built into CLS to easily and effectively analyze their participation. The workshop covers extant social networks, introduces CLS web-based software (nothing to install) and demonstrates the use of CLS to help students master critical skills such as code review, debugging, and reading documentation. Participants will create Salons, learn how to use them in their courses, and learn how to use the built-in tools to analyze student activities. A laptop with wifi is mandatory.
