This paper discusses a mnemonic coding language and translation program used to produce master sheet metal templates on a computer-controlled flatbed plotter. The major advantage of computer-assisted template layout is the ability to reproduce identical templates for use at different locations or to replace mutilated templates by simply reprocessing the original input data cards through a computer-plotter combination. A typical template required about two hours for preparation of the input data and seventeen minutes computer-plotter processing time.
