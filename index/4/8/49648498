In this talk, we present the overall system design and architecture, the challenges encountered in practice, and the lessons learned from the production deployment of the talent search and recommendation systems at LinkedIn. By presenting our experiences of applying techniques at the intersection of recommender systems, information retrieval, machine learning, and statistical modeling in a large-scale industrial setting and highlighting the open problems, we hope to stimulate further research and collaborations within the SIGIR community.
