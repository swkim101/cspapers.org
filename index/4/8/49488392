Effectively extracting the contour edge of the defect in the infrared image can realize the recognition of the geometrical features of the defect. In view of the traditional Canny edge detection algorithm in the Gauss filter variance and high and low threshold selection need artificial intervention, does not have the adaptive ability, and its defects in the gradient calculation, proposed a method based on the improved Canny operator and image morphological fusion edge detection method. Using the improved Canny operator and image morphology to edge detection, the simulation results show that the algorithm has good anti noise ability, effectively improve the accuracy and integrity of the edge detection in the infrared image, and achieve a better extraction of geometric features of the edge of the defect.
