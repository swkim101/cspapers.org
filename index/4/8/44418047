Future telecommunication services will extensively exploit database technology. The persistent and temporal information needed in operations and management of the telecommunication networks and services will be in databases. The current Intelligent Network (IN) Recommendations of ITU-T imply that real-lime transaction processing capabilities should be provided. Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) and Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture (TINA) are object oriented. Cunent and future mobile telephone systems have their own requirements for database services. An ideal database system supporting various telecommunications applications should be a fault-tolerant disuibuted real-time object-oriented database system. In the research project Rodaln the ultimate objective is to design and to specify a real-time object-oriented database architecture for telecommunications applications and to implement a prototype based on that architecture. The design and specification take place in 1996 while the prototype will be implemented in 1997.
