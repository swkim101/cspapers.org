With the large-scale research and development in space sciences, space technologies, and network communication technologies, there is a great demand of satellite imagery security system for providing secure storage and transmission of satellite imagery over internet and/or shared network environment. This brings new challenges to protect sensitive and critical satellite imagery from unauthorized access and illegal use in order to keep the storage and transmission process secure and reliable. Therefore there is strong need of satellite imagery encryption and decryption application for security. Satellite imagery security application (SISA) is an information security application developed for satellite imagery. The application supports new and modified version two most popular data encryption standards named as data encryption standard (DES) and advanced encryption standard (AES). This paper investigates the security and performance level of the new modified version DES and AES for satellite imagery. The method of application of DES and AES on the satellite imagery in each case is explained. The application provides conventional tools of measurement and analysis such as key sensitivity, statistical and performance analysis to determine the level of security, reliability and performance.
