In this paper, a dynamic backoff algorithm of IEEE 802.15.4 networks is proposed for time-critical sporadic data in industrial environment. To guarantee a channel access to real-time sporadic data, a transmission method using the dynamic backoff is applied to wireless control networks. Different initial BE, and CW parameters are used for the dynamic backoff adjustment for sporadic data. The simulation results show an enhancement of the real-time performance of sporadic emergency data.
