In this paper are given the results of the analysis of the existing force/torque control methods by using of the detailed dynamic model of the control object: manipulator and part, which is moved by this manipulator; it is known that feasible motions of this part are limited with constraints. This model take into consideration the elasticity of the transmission from the drives to the links of the manipulator, the wrist elasticity, and the elasticity of the manipulator links. In accordance with the requirements of the stability of the perturbed motion, the famous force/torque control laws are modified and made more precise. Besides the advantage and deficiencies of the different force/torque control methods are analyzed and the new methods are proposed, in which some deficiencies are absent.<<ETX>>
