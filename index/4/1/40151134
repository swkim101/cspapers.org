Fast DBMS-based applications are still too programmer dependent. A system is presented here that serves as an application generator coupled with its own sophisticated DBMS. The system, DB1, was developed since 1972 at the Weizmann Institute of Science in lsrael and has been fully operational since 1976. The most powerful module of DB1 is its Universal Transaction Processor (UTP) which manipulates transactions in an interpretive fashion. The other components of DB1 are the Basic System which is a physical segment access method, and DBPL1 which is an extension of PL/1 aimed as DB1's Data Retrieval Language.
