AMI Meeting Facilitator is a system that performs topic segmentation and extractive summarisation. It consists of three components: (1) a segmenter that divides a meeting into a number of locally coherent segments, (2) a summarizer that selects the most important utterances from the meeting transcripts, and (3) a compression component that removes the less important words from each utterance based on the degree of compression the user specified. The goal of the AMI Meeting Facilitator is two-fold: first, we want to provide sufficient visual aids for users to interpret what is going on in a recorded meeting; second, we want to support the development of downstream information retrieval and information extraction modules with the information about the topics and summaries in meeting segments.
