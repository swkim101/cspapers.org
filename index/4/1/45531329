This workshop is designed to offer a hands-on introduction to Alice 3.1 (now out of beta), as used in introductory courses in high school and early college levels. The focus of this workshop is on using program visualization for introducing fundamental concepts of programming. The introductory features of Alice 3.1 will be presented in an active-learning style. Although some comparisons between Alice 2.x and 3.1 will be included, the content of the workshop does not assume familiarity with Alice 2.x. Participants will receive latest 3.1 update and sneak peek at early textbook chapters. Attendees are expected to bring their own standard (no netbooks or tablets, please) laptop with a mouse (2-button).
