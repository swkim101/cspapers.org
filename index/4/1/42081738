In this pape r , a singularity-free control methodology for the s afe robot-human interaction is proposed using a h ybrid control technique in robotic rehabilitation applications. W ith the use of max-plus algebra, a h ybrid controller is designed to guarantee feasible robot motion in the vicinity of the kinematic singularities or going through and staying at the singular configuration. The approach ta k en in this paper is based on model-free impedance control and hence does not require a n y information about the model e xcept the upper bounds on the system matrix. The stability of the approach is i n v esti g ated using multiple L yapun o v function theor y . The proposed control algorithm is applied to PUMA 560 robot arm, a six-axis industrial robot. The results demonstrate the v alidity of the proposed control scheme.
