Given an undirected graph with edge costs and a subset of k nodes called terminals, a multiway cut is a subset of edges whose removal disconnects each terminal from the rest. Multiway Cut is the problem of finding a multiway cut of minimum cost. Previously, a very simple combinatorial algorithm due to Dahlhaus, Johnson, Papadimitriou, Seymour, and Yannakakis gave a performance guarantee of 2(1?1k). In this paper, we present a new linear programming relaxation for Multiway Cut and a new approximation algorithm based on it. The algorithm breaks the threshold of 2 for approximating Multiway Cut, achieving a performance ratio of at most 1.5?1k. This improves the previous result for every value of k. In particular, for k=3 we get a ratio of 76<43.
