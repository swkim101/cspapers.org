Information Systems is a rapidly growing, fully recognized profession which will continue to expand. Currently, the need for people with a solid foundation in information systems far exceeds the supply; this is well documented in a number of recent articles. For an information systems degree program to remain viable, however, it must be reevaluated periodically to ensure that the course offerings are both current with respect to the available technology, and of real value to the student who will be applying his acquired skills and knowledge in industry, government, or university. One topic area of information systems which has been, largely, ignored until recently is data communications. This field has been recognized as a valuable tool to our students; therefore, it has been included as one of the core requirements for our undergraduates. This course stresses the management information systems aspects of data communications. The pedagogical objectives of the course are that the student be able to analyze, design, implement, and evaluate data communications applications in a business system environment. The structure and content of such a data communications course is presented. Sufficient detail is given so that similar courses can be adapted to fit into a computer science curriculum, with slight changes in emphasis, or incorporated directly into an existing information systems program.
