This paper describes a new approach to developing reliable software for communication between parallel processes. The basis of this approach is the shared use of abstract data objects, and the separation of synchronization-related software from the software performing the actual data access. The paper presents a language in which synchronization behavior for abstract data objects can be specified independently of other kinds of behavior. Specifications written in this language can be used as a basis for constructing the required synchronization software automatically. Also discussed is the use of such specifications in verifying properties of programs which make use of the abstract objects for interprocess communication.
