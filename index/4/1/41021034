In this demo we present IBR-DTN for Android: IBR-DTN is a fully featured RFC5050 compliant Bundle Protocol implementation that can run on un-rooted Android devices starting from Android Version 2.3 (Gingerbread). IBR-DTN for Android supports all features of the IBR-DTN version for PCs and embedded systems. It is available in the Google Play Store for free.
 In addition to the protocol stack we provide two simple real world applications: a text messaging system and a push-to-talk application. They can serve as an example how to build DTN applications for mobile phones as both applications as well as the protocol implementation itself are open sourced.
