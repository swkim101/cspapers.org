Traditional vibration inspection systems, equipped with separated sensing and communication modules, are either very expensive (e.g. hundreds of dollars) and/or suffer from occlusion and narrow field of view (e.g. laser). This demo brings forward a concept of 'communication is sensing', which is to make sense of the world purely based on communication carrier rather than specialized sensors. In this demo, we present an RFID-based solution, called Tagbeat, to inspect mechanical vibration using COTS RFID tags and readers. We implement our system using a COTS RFID device and evaluate it with a commercial centrifugal machine. Empirical benchmarks with a prototype show that our system can inspect the vibration period with a mean accuracy of 0.36ms and a relative error rate of 0.03%.
