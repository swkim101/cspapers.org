This paper analyzes the performance of M-PSK systems operating under a class of non-Gaussian noise, modeled as a combination of a white Gaussian noise and an impulsive noise represented by a filtered Poisson process of which the baseband envelope follows the Rayleigh distribution. A tight upper bound of Symbol error rate (SER) is computed. Numerical results are presented in terms of different parameters of noise and systems, that allows for discussing the behavior of M-PSK in different situations.
