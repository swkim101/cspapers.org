A recently-introduced product of Comcast, a large cable company in the United States, is a "voice remote" that accepts spoken queries from viewers. We present an analysis of a large query log from this service to answer the question: "What do viewers say to their TVs?" In addition to a descriptive characterization of queries and sessions, we describe two complementary types of analyses to support query understanding. First, we propose a domain-specific intent taxonomy to characterize viewer behavior: as expected, most intents revolve around watching programs---both direct navigation as well as browsing---but there is a non-trivial fraction of non-viewing intents as well. Second, we propose a domain-specific tagging scheme for labeling query tokens, that when combined with intent and program prediction, provides a multi-faceted approach to understand voice queries directed at entertainment systems.
