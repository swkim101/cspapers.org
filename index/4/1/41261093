A sensitive, rapid, and efficient single-molecule detection method was developed by combining fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and on-chip molecular manipulation techniques. The highly restricted measurement volume in the FCS system significantly reduces the intrinsic background noise and facilitates single-molecule sensitivity. A microchannel integrated with multiple 3-D electrodes was fabricated and used for molecular sensing and manipulation by which individual DNA molecules were fast transported to and sequentially focused within the tiny probing volume for measuring single-molecular information, thereby enhancing both the efficiency and rates of detection.
