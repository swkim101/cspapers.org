Supervised summarization systems usually rely on supervision at the sentence or n-gram level provided by automatic metrics like ROUGE, which act as noisy proxies for human judgments. In this work, we learn a summary-level scoring function \theta including human judgments as supervision and automatically generated data as regularization. We extract summaries with a genetic algorithm using \theta as a fitness function. We observe strong and promising performances across datasets in both automatic and manual evaluation.
