Tags represent the semantic summarization of questions are useful for navigation and expert finding in CQA and can facilitate content consumption such as searching and mining in these web sites. The task is challenging, as both questions and tags are short and a large fraction of tags are tail tags which occur very infrequently. To solve these problems, we propose matching questions and tags not only by themselves, but also by similar questions and similar tags. The idea is then formalized as a model in which we calculate question-tag similarity using a linear combination of similarity with similar questions and tags weighted by tag importance.Question similarity, tag similarity, and tag importance are learned in a supervised random walk framework by fusing multiple features. Our model thus can not only accurately identify question-tag similarity for head tags, but also improve the accuracy of recommendation of tail tags. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on tag recommendation for questions. Particularly, it improves tail tag recommendation accuracy by a large margin.
