In both the online and offline world, networks that people form within certain communities are critical for their engagement and growth in those communities. In this work, we analyze the growth of ego-networks on LinkedIn for new employees of companies, and study how the pattern of network formation in the new company affects one's growth and engagement in that company. We observe that the initial state of ego-network growth in a newly joined company shows strong correlations with the future status in the company -- such as network size, network diversity, and retention. We also present some key patterns that demonstrate the importance of the first few connections in the new company as well as how they lead to the phenomena we observed.
