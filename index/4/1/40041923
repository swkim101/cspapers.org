With the increase in network bandwidth and delay, TCP shows poor performance due to the problems of slow recovery from loss and RTT bias inherit in its AIMD congestion control algorithm. Data intensive applications over high BDP networks such as the computational grids need new transport protocols to support them. To address this issue, a new application level protocol has been developed above UDP, which is named UDP based data transfer protocol (UDT). UDT has its own congestion control mechanism to achieve the efficiency, fairness and stability objectives, whereas its application level nature enables it to be deployed with the lowest cost, without any changes in the network infrastructure and operating systems. UDT congestion control algorithm only targets congestion caused by network and ignores end system performance. This work mainly focuses on development of new end system performance aware congestion control algorithm. UDT's composibility feature has made our life simpler. We have incorporated our algorithm in UDT for evaluation and experiments. Results of simulations has proved that our proposed algorithm shows relatively stable and better performance as compared to UDT native congestion control when end system is loaded.
