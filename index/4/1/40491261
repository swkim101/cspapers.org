This paper describes three emotions such as happiness, sadness and anger. The emotions are realized by the walking patterns of a biped personal robot that are defined by the parameterization of its whole body motion. The combined motion of the waist and trunk calculated by the compensatory control algorithm that has been proposed already is used to cancel the moments generated by the motions of the head, the lower-limbs and the upper-limbs. To experiment emotion expression, we have constructed a human-like personal robot WABIAB-RII (WAseda BIpedal humANoid robot-Revised II) that has forty-three mechanical degrees of freedom and four passive degrees of freedom. Simulation and experimental results of emotional walking are also presented.
