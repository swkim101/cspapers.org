In this paper, a pattern recognition approach is developed to identify the driver steering behavior characteristics. The detailed process is divided into three parts, feature parameters extracting, clustering process and identification model building. The driving simulator experiments are designed to obtain the primitive data, and the feature parameters are extractedto profile each driver steering manipulation sample. After that,all the driver steering manipulation samples are clustered with the aid of K-means and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Based on the samples and the corresponding cluster labels, two identification models of driver steering behavior characteristics are built with two typical pattern recognition methods respectively, which are BP Artificial neural network (BP_ANN) and Support vector machine (SVM). The result shows that the BP_ANN model has higheridentificationaccuracyand can realize the pattern recognition of driverâ€™s driving habits.
