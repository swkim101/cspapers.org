Presents a simplified forward gait for a quadruped walking robot. The proposed gait is a straight line, periodic, monotonically forward (SLPMF) gait and can easily be used for adaptive gait control, requiring only simple modifications. The authors show that given a support pattern, meaning a polygon generated by connecting the feet positions that are in contact with the ground, only certain sequences of leg movements will generate the SLPMF gait. The authors also introduce a useful method to determine how to preserve stability of a quadruped robot during the motions called for by an SLPMF gait. The authors also discuss the leg design from a hardware standpoint; the design permits independent joint control.<<ETX>>
