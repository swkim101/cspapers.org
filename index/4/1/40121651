A formal proposal for the establishment of an approval mechanism is being developed for presentation to the ACM Executive Committee in February, 1982. Some preliminary components of this proposal are:
 —A year long study during which materials will be developed, trial visits conducted, and approval parameters identified;
 —A volunteer based structure within ACM which will grow to the final body responsible for approving programs;
 —Initial funding to be sought from outside agencies to initiate the approval mechanism which will eventually be self-supporting.
 These and related items will be discussed by the panel.
