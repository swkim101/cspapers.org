Distributed mutual exclusion (DME) is an important concept in any multi-agent systems, including the distributed robotic system (DRS). Several basic DME algorithms employing sign-board as their inter-robot communication mechanism are presented. It is shown that a large number of DRS operating primitives, such as leader finding, dynamic ordering of robots and events, job assignment, and resource sharing, can be effectively implemented with algorithms based on DME.
