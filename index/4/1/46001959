The MIMOLA software system is a system for the design of digital processors. The system includes subsystems for retargetable microcode generation, automatic generation of self-test programs and a synthesis subsystem. This paper describes the synthesis part of the system, which accepts a PASCAL-like, high-level program as specification and produces a register transfer structure. Because of the complexity of this design process, a set of sub-problems is identified and algorithms for their solution are indicated. These algorithms include a flexible statement decomposition, statement scheduling, register assignment, module selection and optimizations of interconnections and instruction word length.
