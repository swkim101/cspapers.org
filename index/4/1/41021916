Schema Updates for Object-Oriented Database SystemsRoberto Zicari , Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Germany
OODBMS are often used for complex data whose structure is likelyto change over time, yet the problem of schema updates has not beencompletely solved by any commercial or research OODBMS. Thistutorial describes the schema modification problem and why it isimportant, what is really offered by products, what a good solutionwould be like, and whether we are likely to see it soon.
The tutorial reviews several commercial OODBMS products thatprovide facilities for updating the schema, namely: Gemstone(Servio Corporation), ITASCA(Itasca), 02(02Technology), ObjectStore(ObjectDesign), Ontos (Ontologic) and Statice (Symbolics). It alsodescribes the solutions proposed in some experimental researchprototypes and the open problems that remain.
