In this paper controller synthesis based on standard and dynamic sliding modes for an uncertain nonlinear MIMO Three tank System is presented. Two types of sliding mode controllers are synthesized; first controller is based on standard first order sliding modes while second controller uses dynamic sliding modes. Sliding manifolds for both controllers are designed in-order to ensure finite time convergence of sliding variable for tracking the desired system trajectories. Simulation results are presented showing the performance analysis of both sliding mode controllers. Simulations are also carried out to assess the performance of dynamic sliding mode controller against parametric uncertainties / disturbances. A comparison of designed sliding mode controllers with LMI based robust H∞ controller is also discussed. The performance of dynamic sliding mode control in terms of response time, control effort and robustness of dynamic sliding mode controller is shown to be better than standard sliding mode controller and H∞ controllers.
