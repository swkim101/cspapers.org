Micro-level Planning is gaining momentum in developing countries. The Planning steps, the data needs, the institutional requirements, the macro-micro linkages and the information flows are necessary to make the planning process effective. Indian planning and development process is aheading for a change from the centralised to more of decentralised approach in order to give due recognition to the micro-level needs and potentials in decision making. The committee on Study Group on Information Gap, constituted by the Planning Commission, Government of India, in 1989 has recommended for the creation of data bases on (i) Plan Information, (ii) Plan Monitoring, and (iii) Plan Evaluation, in districts. This committee has also recommended to develop databases with respect to (i) Socio-economic, (ii) Agro-economic, (iii) Infrastructure, (iv) Demographic, and (v) Natural resources.
