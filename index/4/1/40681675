Most academic departments have outreach efforts to inform potential students and the public about their computing majors. Most participate in events and produce materials to communicate with students, teachers, parents, and employers. Often, however, these recruiting efforts are attended in an opportunistic way rather than strategically. Often, little thought is given to the return on investment of this nontrivial use of scarce resources (money, time), the message conveyed to the particular audience, or to tracking outcomes. In this workshop, participants will develop an actionable plan for increasing the enrollment of qualified women into their undergraduate majors. The workshop philosophy is that departments should accomplish the greatest return on investment, in the shortest time to bring benefits, with the smallest resource commitment. After all, recruiting women is rarely one's "day job." Using research-based materials developed by the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) and ideas shared by NCWIT's Academic Alliance members, the presenters will provide information, a planning structure, resources, and activities to support participants in developing a strategic plan to improve the gender diversity of their undergraduate majors.
