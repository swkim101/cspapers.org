Korean named-entity recognition (NER) systems have been developed mainly on the morphological-level, and they are commonly based on a pipeline framework that identifies named-entities (NEs) following the morphological analysis. However, this framework can mean that the performance of NER systems is degraded, because errors from the morphological analysis propagate into NER systems. This paper proposes a novel syllable-level NER system, which does not require a morphological analysis and can achieve a similar or better performance compared with the morphological-level NER systems. In addition, because the proposed system does not require a morphological analysis step, its processing speed is about 1.9 times faster than those of the previous morphological-level NER systems.
