Since the mid-sixties, when the first public data services were introduced, the Deutsche Bundespost has endeavoured to meet the demands of the market for communications and to enable the data customers to perform their different data processing functions in an efficient and economic manner. To achieve this objective, as required under the mandate conferred on it by law, the Deutsche Bundespost operates public telecommunication networks. Whereas in the beginning there existed only one possibility of data transmission, namely the public switched telephone network, new applications of data transmission have been made available in recent years. This process is still going on. Within the next few years, the data services offered and the number of facilities available to our customers will continue to grow.
 The purpose of this paper is to give a survey of the current situation in the field of data communications in the Federal Republic of Germany and to provide an insight into the present stage of our projects.
