We propose an algorithm for robust visual classification of an object of interest observed from multiple views using a black-box Bayesian classifier which provides a measure of uncertainty, in the presence of significant ambiguity and classifier noise, and of localization error. The fusion of classifier outputs takes into account viewpoint dependency and spatial correlation among observations, as well as pose uncertainty when these observations are taken and a measure of confidence provided by the classifier itself. Our experiments confirm an improvement in robustness over state-of-the-art.
