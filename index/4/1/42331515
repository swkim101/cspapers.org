In this paper, a new microstrip antenna is proposed for wireless applications on S and C bands. A log-periodic fractal Koch structure is selected to research. A new antenna is designed and simulated before optimizing. The results achieve the purpose of increasing the bandwidth and reducing the size of the antenna. The antenna also has high gain and is fabricated on the Duroid RO4700JXR substrate instead of FR4-epoxy as a lot of other designs.
