The machine's air-gap cannot be perfectly smooth. Since a static or a dynamic eccentricity occurs, a mixed eccentricity behavior is observed and manifests by amplitude modulation of the stator current. Many other failures related to the motor condition or its driven load produce this same effect. Hence, by loading an induction machine, eccentricities incidence may be masked. Furthermore, because of power supply imperfections, the detection of characteristic frequencies around principal slot harmonics is not always practicable. In this paper, from theoretical development of eccentricities effects on analytical expressions of rotor and stator currents, a machine classification is proposed and related defect frequencies are predicted. The weakness of the motor current signature analysis is experimentally verified, and an alternative based on spectral analysis of the stray flux is proposed. Experimental results have shown an excellent capability of the suggested frequency signature for detecting and distinguishing the factual eccentricity.
