Binary offset carrier (BOC) modulated signals are widely used in the new global navigation satellite system (GNSS). These signals improve tracking accuracy and provide better resistance to multipath and narrowband interference. However, these advantages come at a price, namely the ambiguity problem in acquiring and tracking. In this paper, a novel ambiguity mitigating technique is proposed for arbitrary cosine-phased BOC signals. This technique is based on a pseudo correlation function (PCF) which has a sharp main peak and only two small positive side peaks, thus removes most of the false lock points on the discriminator output compared with conventional BOC tracking techniques. Theoretical and simulation results show that this technique also has a good performance of multipath mitigation.
