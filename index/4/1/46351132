Procedural content generation (PCG) studies the algorithmic creation of content (e.g., textures, maps), typically for games. PCG has become a popular research topic in recent years, but little has been done in terms of generalized content generators: approaches that can generate content for a variety of games without hand-tuning. We are interested in exploring statistical algorithms that could lead to generalized procedural map generators.
