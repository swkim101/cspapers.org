This paper will describe design work, involved in development of a PC based Supervisory Control, Data Acquisition system for Real Time Monitoring and Control of Industrial Parameters in order to provide an efficient automated environment in industries, where the process is geographically scattered and the centralized control is required. A certain model has been developed containing controller based Data Acquisition Card which act as Remote Station. The information gathered in Remote Station from sensors/detectors is fed to Master Terminal Unit. The Master Terminal Unit (MTU) is a general purpose PC equipped with monitoring capabilities and has the ability to remotely issue controlling commands by the virtue of Graphical User Interface. The information can be shared on wired or wireless network. This application specific and cost effective model of circulatory fluidized bed combustioner will provide efficient and cost effective model of control system.
