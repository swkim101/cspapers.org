= Students in programming courses must deal with multiple aspects of the programming process. They need to learn the syntax and semantics of a given programming language, to explore how to use the language to implement different algorithms, and how to construct programs properly and display them in an acceptable manner. Sometimes, for example in the case of sorting, students see many different algorithms and programs. In this paper, we argue that students can also benefit from seeing multiple program representations of the same algorithm. Students learn that programs can be different and that some programs are easier to understand than others.
