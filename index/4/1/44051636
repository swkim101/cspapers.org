This paper presents a performance analysis of randomized distributed space-time codes (RDSTCs) in Nakagami-m fading channels over a multiple Decode-and-Forward (DF) relay network. The performance is assessed in terms of symbol error probability (SEP) and outage probability (OP). The results of this research provide exact analytical expressions for these two performance metrics. In addition, the diversity gain of the considered system is derived from these expressions and compared with some results already presented in literature to verify its soundness. Finally, numerical results for some example scenarios are provided to illustrate applications of the derived expressions for performance analysis.
