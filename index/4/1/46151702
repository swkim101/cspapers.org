This paper considers implementing the Object Oriented Programming Model directly in the hardware to serve as a base to exploit object-level parallelism, speculation and heterogeneous computing. Towards this goal, we present a new execution model called Object 
Oriented execution Model - OOM - that implements the OO Programming Models. All OOM hardware structures are objects and the OOM Instruction Set directly utilizes objects while hiding other complex hardware structures. OOM maintains all high-level programming language information until execution time. This enables efficient 
extraction of available parallelism in OO serial code at 
execution time with minimal compiler support. Our results 
show that OOM utilizes the available parallelism better 
than the OoO (Out-of-Order) model
