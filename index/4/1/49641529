Ad click prediction is a task to estimate the click-through rate (CTR) in sponsored ads, the accuracy of which impacts user search experience and businesses' revenue. State-of-the-art sponsored search systems typically model it as a classification problem and employ machine learning approaches to predict the CTR per ad. In this paper, we propose a new approach to predict ad CTR in sequence which considers user browsing behavior and the impact of top ads quality to the current one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to predict ad CTR by using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. The proposed model is evaluated on a real dataset and we show that LSTM-RNN outperforms DNN model on both AUC and RIG. Since the RNN inference is time consuming, a simplified version is also proposed, which can achieve more than half of the gain with the overall serving cost almost unchanged.
