Two recent ACM reports have been published suggesting curricula for undergraduate education in Computer and Information Sciences. These reports have provided the basis of a new major program, the Computer Coordinate Major, recently established at Trinity College. The synthesis of these reports with the curriculum of the College in developing the new major is discussed. The resulting program is suggested as a case study in the implementation of the ACM reports. It is recommended that the ACM reports be regularly reviewed and up-dated so as to continue to provide the basis for development of curricula for undergraduate education in computing.
