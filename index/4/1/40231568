In this paper, we propose a trajectory generation framework for quadrotor autonomous navigation in unknown 3-D complex environments using gradient information. We decouple the trajectory generation problem as front-end path searching and back-end trajectory refinement. Based on the map that is incrementally built onboard, we adopt a sampling-based informed path searching method to find a safe path passing through obstacles. We convert the path consists of line segments to an initial safe trajectory. An optimization-based method which minimizes the penalty of collision cost, smoothness and dynamical feasibility is used to refine the trajectory. Our method shows the ability to online generate smooth and dynamical feasible trajectories with safety guarantee. We integrate the state estimation, dense mapping and motion planning module into a customized light-weight quadrotor platform. We validate our proposed method by presenting fully autonomous navigation in unknown cluttered indoor and outdoor environments.
