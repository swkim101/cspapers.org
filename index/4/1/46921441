This paper presents NLP Lean Programming framework (NLPf), a new framework for creating custom Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and pipelines by utilizing common software development build systems. This approach allows developers to train and integrate domain-specific NLP pipelines into their applications seamlessly. Additionally, NLPf provides an annotation tool which improves the annotation process significantly by providing a well-designed GUI and sophisticated way of using input devices. Due to NLPfâ€™s properties developers and domain experts are able to build domain-specific NLP application more effectively.
