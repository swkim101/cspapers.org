Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) is a recently proposed multicarrier waveform which is being considered as one of the possible candidates for 5G wireless access technology. Key advantages of GFDM are flexibility and low spectral side-lobes which render it the ability of carrier aggregation and reduced adjacent channel interference. However due to its non-orthogonal nature GFDM suffers from the problem of self-inter-carrier interference (self-ICI) which occurs between time-slots of adjacent subcarriers in the signal. Due to self-ICI, the bit-error rate (BER) performance of GFDM is severely affected under low SNR regime. Moreover application of MIMO technique to GFDM further adversely affects the BER due to inter-antenna interference (IAI) between the transmit antennas. To mitigate this problem, spatial modulation has been applied to GFDM and its BER performance with respect to V-BLAST based GFDM is studied under flat Rayleigh fading channel condition through computer simulations.
