Ways in which physical objects interact are explored, and in particular the concept of freedom is analysed. Intuitively, the fit between two shapes in a given spatial configuration is a statement about how much one shape needs to mutilated in order to be made identical to the other. The freedom of one object with respect to another specifies what motions the First object can go through without the second one moving. The formulations, termed naive kinematics, are compared to work that was done in the kinematics of machinery in the 10th century and that has since been somewhat neglected.
