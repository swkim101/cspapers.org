Formal definitions of data structure mappings are given and are used to transform relational algebraic formula into data base access procedures which search a formally defined data structure. Especially, a hierarcical data structure is introduced to represent a set of relations which are inherently hierarchical. A retrieval procedure using data accesses along a two level hierarchy is obtained from an original formula on flat relations by applying equivalence transformation rules and data representation mappings.
