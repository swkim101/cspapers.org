Magnetically actuated microswimmers have shown great potentials in multiple application scenarios, attracting researchers to investigate their swimming characteristics and controlling methods. However, among those studies, only a small number of closed-loop control schemes have been applied, which is crucial for the accuracy and repeatability in applications. In this paper, we proposed an Image-Based Visual Servoing(IBVS) method for arbitrary planar path following using features directly presented in image space as feedbacks. During experiments we found that IBVS guarantees convergence while not requiring camera calibrations. Furthermore, the proposed path following method is intuitive and flexible, and provides great potentials in various applications.
