Panel Abstract This panel addresses a very important area that is often neglected or overlooked by database systems, database applications developers and data warehouse designers, namely storage. We propose to inform, discuss and debate the use of “Active Storage Hierarchy” in database systems and applications. By active storage hierarchy we mean a database system that uses all storage media (i.e. optical, tape, and disk) to store and retrieve data and not just disk. We will examine, discuss and debate how active storage compares and/or complements what is known in the database research community as “Active Disks” [RGF 98] and other emerging diskcentric storage paradigms. The presentations and analysis will span current real products, emerging technology to active (and visionary) research in several related areas, like storage technology, storage systems, federated databases and database system uses of storage. Panel Format • Overview of Storage Technology, Current and Future Commercial Products. • Overview of Database Research and Commercial Database Product Plans • Overview and sample case studies of current and emerging applications that do and/or will in the future exploit costeffective storage hierarchy. • Discussion and debate on feasibility and future (visionary) use of storage systems in database applications.
