UIST is the premier forum on innovative engineering of the human-computer interface. The symposium brings together user-interface researchers and practitioners with an interest in techniques, tools, and technology for constructing quality, innovative user interfaces. UIST grew out of a series of SIGGRAPH-supported workshops on User Interface Management Systems (UIMS).
