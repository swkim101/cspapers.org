This paper describes a data base simulator, or rather, a family of simulators, that is being developed at the University of Stockholm. The purpose of this discrete event simulation model is to provide a tool for • investigating the performance of data base oriented information systems (existing and planned) • increasing the knowledge of i) design of data base oriented information systems, ii) design of DBMS (or setting parameters when generating a DBMS). 
 
A typical target system would be a heavily loaded multiprogrammed on-line system with a very large data base. One of the guidelines for design of the simulator has been user orientation. The preparation and execution of the model is done interactively and on a problem-oriented leve 1, e.g. the analyst describes the data base with DDL/DML instructions in a DBTG-like language. It is possible to model hierarchical as well as network-based data bases.
