This paper presents a switched linear hybrid system model for misfire detection in spark ignition (SI) engines. The proposed model is particularly helpful for early detection of some fault in automotive engines. Some properties of ignition systems are studied using the mathematical model and simulation. Simulation results are verified by comparing them with the experimental results given in the literature. The simulation results for a four stroke IC engine are also presented to test the misfire detection formulation.
