Imagine data that contains a dense core with points scaered around away from the core. An example would be data with outliers. A gure with a full view of a 2-dimensional projection of data then typically shows the points in the core all close to each other. Due to the fact that the visualization medium as well as our eyes have nite resolution, it may then not be possible to discern the location of the points in the core. In that case it may be more interesting to show a zoomed-in visualization that allows one to explore the structure of the core, while providing only limited information about points that are not part of the core. A trade-o emerges between showing small and large-scale structure, parametrized by the size of a bounding box. e quantication of this trade-o using Information eory, and the concurrent optimization of the size of a bounding box and nding informative linear projections are the topics of this paper.
