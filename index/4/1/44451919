A new tutorial digital circuit simulator, called CIR, is presented in this article. CIR contains all of the gates and flip-flops that are normally introduced in a computer organization course. It has subcircuit capabilities whereby a teacher or a student can design a subcircuit that can be used in the main circuit. Variables are assigned to each wire in the circuit which are then specified in the gates and the flip-flops. CIR also has a debug feature that allows a user to monitor the values of the circuit during the simulation. The user may also specify output variables to indicate which values are to be printed. The simulator has been used successfully in an undergradulate computer organization course.
