In order to meet the requirements of Large Data Base (LDB) Systems for short response time and high throughput a new approach has been investigated. In this paper only certain aspects of a powerful system, called SPARCOM, are described. The unique approach of this system is the conceptual conversion of data into large sparse binary matrices that enables one to apply sophisticated sparse matrix techniques to perform data base operations. Only for the sake of clarity the matrices are presented in their binary form. The high performance of the system is due to the direct conversion and manipulation of the matrices in their compact form as obtained from the application of the sparse matrix algorithms.
