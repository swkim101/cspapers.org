One aspect of the development of Web-enabled systems that has received increasing attention is information modeling, particularly with respect to aspects such as navigation models and their relationships to the underlying content. These models have, however, typically focused on modeling at a relatively low-level and have failed to address higher-level aspects, such as architectural and even business process modeling. In this paper we introduce a set of formal extensions to an existing modeling language - WebML - that facilitates information modeling at this higher level of abstraction. We argue that these extensions will provide a clearer connection between an understanding of business models and processes, and the lower-level designs typically represented in existing models. 12 12 12 ). This has been accompanied by a rapid increase in the complexity of these applications. Various approaches have been developed or adapted for representing this complexity. At lower levels we have models of the detailed system design. Functional design models are relatively well-established, with the dominant model (arguably) now UML ( 2, 9). In terms of modeling the information design, the situation is somewhat less mature. Typically we wish to model not only the information itself, but also the relationship between the underlying content and the user-perceived views of that content, and the interactions with those views (such as navigational aspects). Whilst existing modeling languages (such as UML) can be used to represent the functional aspects, they are not as effective at representing these informational aspects. The result has been the emergence of a number of informational modeling approaches specifically developed for Web (or hypermedia) applications. Example approaches, such as RMM ( 7) and OOHDM ( 11 11 11 11 ), and more recently WebML ( 3
