“LOGO” is sometimes used as the name of a programming language. It is also used as the name of ... what shall I call it ? ... an environment, a culture, way of thinking about computers and about learning and about putting the two together. I shall try to convey to you how I bring a child into this environment. The environment is made of ideas, of things and of people. The things include various types of turtles: computer controlled mechanical beasts which use touch sensors or eye-sight to crawl around the floor and display turtles, which live on TV-like screens where they draw in phosphor white or inmulti-color.
