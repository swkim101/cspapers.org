This paper presents an online motion planning strategy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in an obstacle-strewn environment that is complicated by uncertainties stemming from unmodeled effects and environmental disturbances, particularly cross-winds. During execution underlying wind currents are estimated and applied to the forward model used in online trajectory planning. To facilitate on-board computations, a reduced order forward model is used. We consider a 2D slice of the operating environment and assume that the UAV has independent bounded control over airspeed and altitude. Results are demonstrated from simulation using a medium fidelity non-linear model of a small UAV (Sig Rascal) under wind disturbances of varying magnitude and direction. The approach is tested in base winds in excess of 22 knots (50% forward speed). Results suggest that the method provides an efficient strategy for navigating to the desired destination by re-routing the trajectory as opposed to pure-pursuit methods under significant disturbance.
