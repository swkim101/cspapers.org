The difficulty of understanding SELF and SUPER in object-oriented languages indicates that inheritance interacts with self-reference in some subtle but fundamental way. The meaning of SELF in a class definition may change during inheritance, which clearly indicates that inheritance has a direct effect on recursion. The meaning of inheritance requires that a subclass be inserted between the superclass and its references to SELF, so that SELF in the superclass actually refers to the subclass. Conversely, the subclass refers to its superclass through SUPER. In this way inheritance involves a nearly symmetric system of references from parent to child through SELF and child to parent through SUPER. Inheritance has the effect of making partial specifications of self-referential behavior into first-class objects.
