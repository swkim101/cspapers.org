Smart antennas can unlock the potential of unlicensed spectrum by letting the coexisting networks transmit concurrently without harmful interference. This is possible by strategically allocating the antenna degrees-of-freedom for both beamforming toward the intended receiver and interference nulling toward the victim receiver(s). Our solution, named Xzero, achieves this goal for the particular case of LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U) and WiFi by overcoming the challenges of cross-technology interference nulling by a null search at the LTE-U BS with assistance from the WiFi network. Our demo shows a running prototype of Xzero implemented using USRP SDR platform running srsLTE and commodity WiFi hardware. We illustrate the change in the airtime of colocated WiFi and LTE-U networks upon activation of Xzero and fast reconfiguration of the null beam upon a change in WiFi node's location.
