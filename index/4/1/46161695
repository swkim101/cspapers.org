The paper presents an approach to the synthesis problem. The approach is based on the rough set philosophy, Boolean reasoning and Petri nets. Information systems as a tool for specification of concurrent systems are treated. However colored Petri nets as a model for concurrency are used. The proposed approach in the ROSECON computer system has been implemented. It can be used to deal with various problems arising from the process design domain.
