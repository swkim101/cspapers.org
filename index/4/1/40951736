During a disaster, appropriate information must be collected quickly. For example, residents along the coast require information about tsunamis and those who have lost their houses need information about shelters. Twitter can attract more attention than other forms of mass media under these circumstances because it can quickly provide such information. Since Twitter has an enormous amount of tweets, they must be classified to provide users with the information they need. Previous works on extracting information from Twitter focused on the text data of tweets. However, in some cases, text mining has difficulty extracting information. For example, it might be difficult for text mining to group tweets with URLs. On the other hand, by assuming that users who retweet the same tweet are interested in the same topic, we can classify tweets that are required by users with similar interests based on retweets. Thus, we employ the tweet classification method that focuses on retweets. In this paper, we demonstrated that our method works quickly in disaster situations and that it can quickly classify the required information based on the needs in disaster situations and is helpful for collecting information under them.
