This paper discusses the problem of finding an appropriate target system for undergraduate system design classes. This system should allow the students to experience its life cycle, including full implementation through the programming and installations phases. The system case is chosen to be purposely small and immediately useful. The implementation language used is an extended BASIC, which greatly facilitates file manipulation and interactive programming. The system is designed to be menu-driven; that is, its activities are selected by the user from a menu display. Two specific implementations of such a system are described. One is in a small business, and the other is in a college classroom setting.
