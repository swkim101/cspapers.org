Metadata repository acts like a backbone to a data warehouse as it stores and manages the metadata that is the basis for all the operations of a data warehouse. The generalized metadata repository presented in this paper is a comprehensive approach for creating a data warehouse from multiple and heterogeneous data sources in a semi-automatic way. The approach addresses all the issues involved in fetching operational schemas from different data sources, transforming them into a common model, comparing and merging them and transforming them into dimensional schema.
