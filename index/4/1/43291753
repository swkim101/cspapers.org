The tutorial presents the elements of design and engineering of the enabling technologies for building KBMSâ€™s. Expert systems and deductive systems in general have been developed very successfully over a number of years now. However, the scaling up of the required technologies to be able to construct large expert systems and knowledge bases with a deductive capability has proved a much more difficult problem to solve than was originally anticipated.
