In a case studies approach to computer architecture education, there is a need for small-scale simulation exercises to illustrate significant concepts and to provide hands-on student experience with architectural tradeoffs. Two such exercises are discussed, and one is described in some detail. The exercises cover virtual memory and multiprogramming systems' architecture, and are suitable as projects students can do within a ten-week academic quarter. Some hindsight based on student reaction to these exercises is provided, together with estimated costs to the educator and students for exercise development and execution.
