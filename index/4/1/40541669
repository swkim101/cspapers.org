In this paper we address the issue of controlling the stability of legged robots based on the virtual generalized stabilizer (VGS) introduced in [J. Foret, et al.,2002]. The proposed approach is a theoretical framework that gives a unified point of view to design and to control the walking gaits. Although the presented work is general, the application focuses on the particular problem of static stability maintenance of a biped robot subject to a destabilizing impulsive force applied on its trunk.
