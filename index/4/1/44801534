In natural language generation the grammatical component has to be systematically interfaced to the other components of the system, for example, the planning component Grammatical formalisms can be studied with respect to their suitability for generation. The tree adjoining grammar (TAG) formalism has been previously studied in terms of incremental generation. In this paper, the TAG formalism has been investigated from the point of view of its ability to handle word-order variation in the context of generation. Word-order cannot be treated as a last minute adjustment of a structure; this position is not satisfactory cognitively or computationally. The grammatical framework has to be able to deal with the word-order phenomena in a way such that it can be systematically interfaced to the other components of the generation system.
