Each year the Educational Testing Service in conjunction with the College Board administers many Advanced Placement tests. Among them are the AP Computer Science A and AB tests. In 1993, about 10,000 exams were taken. Each test has a multiple choice section (machine graded) and a freeresponse section. With four questions to answer in this section, ETS hires faculty consultants to grade the approximately 40,000 exam questions.
