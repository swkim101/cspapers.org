The problem of executing plans in an independent dynamic microworld is discussed. The microworld is a simulated city that not only contains permanent features (e.g. streets) but also transient features (e.g. other cars). A simulated taxi driver (ELMER) must plan and execute routes through this city. Among the interesting features of ELMER are the use of hierarchical rather than linear plans; the representation of knowledge by routes (similar to and possibly built from plans); and planning by splicing together these routes.
