The course described in this paper is intended for students who are not majoring in computer science or mathematics. In a typical semester students majoring in such diverse fields as dietetics, sociology, psychology, elementary education, accounting, broadcasting, physical education, music, industrial technology, english, business administration, chemistry and secretarial science are enrolled in the course. Virtually the only common element in the background of the students enrolled in the course is their lack of a previous university course in either mathematics or computer science. The highest level of mathematical education that may be expected is first year high school algebra; occasionally even that expectation is too high. 4 For students with this background many of the available textbooks are not satisfactory. This paper will attempt to further clarify the nature of the course by stating its objectives, by discussing the choice of a language for the course, by discussing what topics normally included in available textbooks are not desirable, and finally by suggesting topics which are desirable in an introductory course for non majors.
