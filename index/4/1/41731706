This paper concerns the Discrete time Sliding Mode Control (DSMC) of complex system with input delay, the synthesized control law will be tested on a four tank hydraulic system. A predictor in discrete time is introduced to convert the original system with input delay to an equivalent system without the explicit appearance of time delay and makes the control problem solvable. Simulation studies show the effectiveness of the control scheme for large-scale systems.
