The paper deals with the adaptive approach to decision making as applied to the problems of biological and medical cybernetics characterised by a priori uncertainty. A number of algorithms is suggested which, being based on the an allsis of aposteriory information, yield the most adequate decision rule to a specific problem. The learning is achieved by the stochastic approximation method and by means of the correction of the decision rule structure The methods discussed have been realized on a computer and used in a cybernetic medical centre.
