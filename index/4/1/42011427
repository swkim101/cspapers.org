In this paper, using a rogowski coil with a non-saturation characteristic to high current, a novel broadband inductive coupler for broadband power line communication (BPLC) has been first proposed and implemented. The frequency behavior of the rogowski coil has been analyzed in order to obtain a broadband frequency response for BPLC. Based on analyzed results, a non-saturated inductive coupler with broadband frequency response has been implemented. The variation of insertion loss of the implemented inductive coupler with the rogowski coil and the conventional inductive coupler with magnetic material according to magnitude of current has been measured, and then the performance of the implemented inductive coupler is verified to compare the measured results.
