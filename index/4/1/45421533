The paper investigates the performance of the energy detector in fading environments under the constraint, that each sensor has only a limited dynamic range. First, the effects which limit the dynamic of a sensor node are discussed before the influence on the energy detector is analyzed. Simulations are presented how cooperative spectrum sensing affects the detection probability and it is shown that a sensing network with limited dynamic can gain much more from cooperation compared to a sensor network with ideal sensor nodes.
