While the USA struggles with a demand for computer programming education which exceeds the capacity of formal educational opportunities, online resources dedicated to programming are growing rapidly. One valuable way to measure the usefulness of these online resources is to examine the links posted in the forums of CS learning communities. We scraped and analyzed over 80,000 posts from two popular forums (Reddit and Stack Overflow), and found that how these communities use and talk about CS learning resources (such as books and tutorials) demonstrated their differing priorities. These results have much to suggest to both novices and teachers.
