This paper describes a course entitled “Computers in the Humanities and Social Science” given at a small liberal arts college. The basic purpose of the course was to provide the student with knowledge about how a computer could be used in various fields (e.g. art, literature, economics). There was no intent to make the student expert in using the computer, although several programs were written and debugged as homework assignments. This paper includes appendices which show copies of the homework assignments given, a questionnaire on attitudes toward the computer, as well as further details on the course.
