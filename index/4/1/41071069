The FLOW tutor system is a simulation of a human tutor which gives advice to a student learning FLOW, a simple computer language. The tutor has a schema-based knowledge structure containing information about the programming language, the student's instruction booklet, and the student's developing knowledge. These schemas form the basis of a distributed intelligence system which uses conceptually guided and data-driven processing to interpret the student's behavior, update the model of the student, and give advice to the student.
