Digital wave observation apparatus includes first and second A/D converters to convert input signals of first and second channels into corresponding first and second digital signals. First and second delay circuits selectively delay the first and second digital signals, and a wave memory stores signals output from the first and second delay circuits for purposes of display. A first command device receives channel designating data corresponding to the first channel and desired delay value setting data, and provides first delay data to a first delay value setting device coupled to the first delay circuit. A second command device receives designating data corresponding to the second channel and desired delay value setting data, and provides second delay data to the first delay value setting device and a second delay value setting device coupled to the second delay circuit.
