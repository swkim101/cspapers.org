Most of the CAE/CAD tasks are characterized as having large search spaces, because of this they have been resistive to traditional algorithmic approaches. In recent years the knowledge-based expert systems approach of Artificial Intelligence has promised a new solution. This tutorial provides: a background as to what are knowledge-based expert systems; the type of tasks where knowledge-based expert systems can be applied; and the process of building knowledge-based expert systems.
