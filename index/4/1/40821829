Many application level qualities are functions of available computation resources. Recent studies have handled the computation resource allocation problem to maximize the overall application quality. However such QoS problem is fundamentally a multi-dimensional optimization problem that requires extensive computation. Therefore, online usage of optimization procedures may significantly reduce the computation resource available for applications. This raises the question of how to best use the optimization procedures for dynamic real-time task sets. This paper proposes a method called service classes configuration to address the QoS problem with dynamic arrival and departure of tasks. A simplified radar application is used as an illustrative example.
