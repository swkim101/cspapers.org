Treadmill training is an innovative rehabilitation method for patients with locomotor dysfunctions. In the lower extremity rehabilitation systems, the treadmill speed is restricted to a constant value or adjusted by the therapist. Speed of the treadmill is normally kept constant by controlling the speed of DC servomotors because of its wide usage in many applications from industrial to medicine and consumers. DC servomotors provide error feedback signal to its PID controller to minimize the error. Unfortunately, its conventional PID controller still causes poor accuracy and poor response. In this paper, a method for controlling DC servomotor based on fuzzy logic is proposed. The fuzzy-based speed controller is implemented in an 8-bit Atmel microcontroller without using any special software tool. With reduced fuzzy set and finer membership function tuning, the control result is improved.
