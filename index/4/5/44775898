This presentation will outline Cray's Adaptive Supercomputing vision. Cray's phased approach will take the concept of heterogeneous computing to a new level by integrating a range of processing technologies in a single platform. These Linux-based systems will combine scalar processing, vector processing, multithreading and hardware accelerators to solve scientific and engineering problems more quickly and make programmers and end users more productive. Powerful compilers and other software will automatically match an application to the processing technology that is best suited for it, allowing the supercomputer to flexibly adapt to the application rather than obligating users to adapt their applications to the system.
