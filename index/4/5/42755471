Work on the standardization of routing protocols for OSI is in progress. The envisioned set of routing protocols is expected to work in nearly all of the environments which constitute OSI networks. Behind these routing protocols is an architecture which outlines problems and goals, establishes a framework upon which to base the development of protocols, and provides a conceptual baseline for continued work on unsolved problems. This architecture defines routing in the OSI network layer, functionally partitions the problem into its components, defines a routing hierarchy and an address hierarchy and discusses their relationship, and discusses arms-length routing relationships between differently administered networks. This paper presents that architecture, and discusses problems which remain to be solved as work progresses towards a global OSI network.
