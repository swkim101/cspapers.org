A lot of motion planning research in robotics focuses on efficient means to find trajectories between individual start and goal regions, but it remains challenging to specify and plan robotic manipulation actions which consist of multiple interdependent subtasks. The Task Constructor framework we present in this work provides a flexible and transparent way to define and plan such actions, enhancing the capabilities of the popular robotic manipulation framework MoveIt!.11The Task Constructor framework is publicly available at https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_task_constructor Subproblems are solved in isolation in black-box planning stages and a common interface is used to pass solution hypotheses between stages. The framework enables the hierarchical organization of basic stages using containers, allowing for sequential as well as parallel compositions. The flexibility of the framework is illustrated in multiple scenarios performed on various robot platforms, including bimanual ones.
