The main advantages of semantic ATN-grammars are efficient execution and easy implementation in small discourse domains. The drawback lies in the growth of the semantic grammar if the domain of discourse is to be extended. The thesis of this paper is that a higher level of modularity for grammar rules can be attained by making semantic ATNs sharable through schemata (called "concepts") of the knowledge base. A workspace of activatable subATNs guides the parser in choosing among competing PUSH arcs. Expected subATNs are entered into this workspace either indirectly from the schemata through a filtering mechanism, or directly as a side effect of actions on arcs which instantiate a concept.
