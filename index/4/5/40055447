In this paper we describe the architecture of a vision-based workspace monitoring system for different kinds of nonautonomous service robots. Based on a hardware system with a movable color CCD-camera, mounted on a linear sledge above the workspace, we are developing a hierarchical, modular software system with a flexible control which is not restricted to a single application. During the initialization a 3D map of the workspace is generated by tracking prominent features like edges and corners while the camera is moved. In the following, regions of interest are determined by means of motion detection and/or color classification. These regions are used for the search of known objects, e.g. humans, the robot itself, etc. After an object is identified, its posture and location is estimated by matching a geometric 3D model of the object with the detected regions. The feasibility of this approach will be proved with two applications.
