An onboard multi-agent system for mobile robots requires improvements in reactivity and real time efficiency. The authors present a real time computing model blackboard with specific features to guarantee satisfactory behavior of a low level robotic control. They detail a mobile robot controller to evaluate the improvement offered by such a system in a real application. They present simulation software based on an essential event and state concept.
