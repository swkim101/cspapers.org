Spectrum allocation is one of the key techniques of spectrum management in cognitive radio. In this paper, we introduce a new spectrum allocation algorithm named multi-level allocation algorithm based on cost minimized matching algorithm. Characteristics of both spectrum holes and cognitive users are taken into account in the new algorithm. Based on the statistical information of the characteristics, cognitive radio network can find out the optimal matching of spectrum holes to serve cognitive users. Performance analysis and computer simulations validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The new algorithm outperforms the cost minimized matching algorithm with respect to system capacity and the expected number of spectrum handovers while provisioning user's quality of service (QoS) requirements.
