Hemiparetic gait after stroke is typically asymmetric and energetically inefficient. A major contributor to walking deficits is impaired paretic ankle function. Impaired paretic ankle plantarflexion (PF) reduces forward propulsion symmetry and impaired paretic ankle dorsiflexion (DF) diminishes ground clearance during swing. We have developed soft wearable robots (soft exosuits) to assist paretic PF and DF during walking after stroke. Through experimental studies with poststroke patients, we have demonstrated that exosuits can improve forward propulsion symmetry and ground clearance in walking, ultimately reducing the metabolic cost of walking. This paper presents an optimized soft exosuit aimed at use in clinical gait training for patients poststroke. The optimized exosuit is lightweight, easy to don and doff, and capable of efficiently delivering mechanical assistance to the paretic ankle. This paper focuses on the optimized controller that can deliver well-timed consistent ankle assistance to patients. A preliminary study was performed using this exosuit with three poststroke patients with heterogeneous gait patterns. Results showed that compared to a previously published controller, more consistent assistive force profiles could be delivered to individuals poststroke while consuming 50% less electrical power. Additionally, a preliminary biomechanical assessment was performed during overground walking.
