In this paper, we propose a new method to generate C/sup 2/ continuous gait motion for biped robots. The method is based on the enhanced inverted pendulum mode, which can easily handle angular momentum around the center of gravity. Using our method, it is possible to plan motion paths for biped robots without discontinuity in the acceleration even during switching from single support phase to double support phase, and vice versa.
