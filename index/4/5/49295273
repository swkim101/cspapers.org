In this paper, we study the main interconnect aging processes: electromigration, thermomigration and stress migration and propose comprehensive yet compact models for transient and steady states based on hydrostatic stress evolution. Our model can be expressed in terms of voltages only which abstracts away the hydrostatic stress. The model also explains some experimental observations, introduces temperature-dependent Blech’s length criterion and a new time-to-failure formula replacing Black’s empirical model. A tool is developed based on the proposed model which assesses reliability of multi-segment complex interconnect networks. Experimental results obtained on IBM benchmarks validate the model.
