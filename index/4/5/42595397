In this paper, we describe a newly developed system named Bach Khoa unified messaging system - BKUMN, a P2P communication system for sharing and exchanging messages in various formats such as email, instant messages, voice mail, phone call, video, files, conferencing. BKUMN is essentially an integration of unified messaging and unified communication system, which is not based on traditional client-server architecture but is built over new P2P architecture for scalability and resource efficiency. The designing process of BKUMN involved with the issues of P2P platform selection among numerous existing P2P platforms, from which the JXTA platform of Sun Microsystems was chosen. Moreover, BKUMN has successfully adopted a new P2PSIP mechanism over JXTA protocol as well as solved a number of issues related to architecture design.
