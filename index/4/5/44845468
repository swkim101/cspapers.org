This panel will mainly focus on the role that media processing can play in creating mobile communications, information, and entertainment services. A major premise of our discussion is that media processing techniques go beyond compression and can be employed to monitor, filter, convert, and repurpose information. Such automated techniques can serve to create personalized information and entertainment services in a cost-effective way, adapt existing content for consumption on mobile devices, and circumvent the inherent limitations of mobile devices. Some examples of the applications of media processing techniques for mobile service generation will be given.
