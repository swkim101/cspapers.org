In this paper, we describe an algorithm for predicting future positions and orientation of a moving object in a time-varying environment using an autoregressive model (ARM). No constraint is placed on the obstacles motion. The model addresses prediction of translational and rotational motions. Rotational motion is represented using quaternions rather than Euler representation to improve the algorithm performance and accuracy of the prediction results. Compared to other similar systems, the proposed algorithm has an adaptive capability, which enables it to predict over multiple time-steps rather than fixed ones as reported in other works. Such algorithm can be used in a variety of applications. An important one is its application in the framework of designing reliable navigational systems for autonomous mobile robots and more particularly in building effective trajectory planners. Simulation results show how significantly this model could reduce computational cost.
