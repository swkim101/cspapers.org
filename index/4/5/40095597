We have proposed a digital control method of space robot manipulators using the transpose of a generalized Jacobian matrix. The trajectory of the end-effector, however, is generally curved, because a desired trajectory is not defined in the control method. Furthermore, the method is based on the supposition that all physical parameters of the robot manipulator are known; therefore, if the end-effector captures an unknown mass object, the physical parameters are changed, and the control performance gets worse. In the paper, setting a desired trajectory and parameter identification are applied to the control method so as to overcome the drawbacks. Computer simulation, where a 3 DOF planar manipulator mounted on a free-floating robot base is selected, is performed. The simulation result demonstrates the effectiveness of the combination of setting the desired trajectory and parameter identification.
