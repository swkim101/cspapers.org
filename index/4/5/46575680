This paper presents the current work progress of HIT/DLR Dexterous Hand. Based on the technology of DLR Hand II, HIT and DLR are jointly developing a smaller and easier manufactured robot hand. The prototype of one finger has been successfully built. The finger has three DOF and four joints, the last two joints are mechanically coupled by a rigid linkage. All the actuators are commercial brushless DC motors with integrated analog Hall sensors. DSP based control system is implemented in PCI bus architecture and the serial communication between the hand and DSP needs only 6 lines(4 lines power supply and 2 lines communication interface). The fingertip force can reach 10N.
