Thanks to breakthrough by science for comprehensive understanding of systems, several principles of systemic mechanisms have been revealed. Expected applications of living mechanisms through the principles are proposed to create new ideas for engineering of robot systems. Among them, restricted emergent process can provide systems with flexibility, while elaboration in selection of context for interpretation can simplify information processing i.e., intelligence. In the former process, there emerges a qualitative difference of physical structures through discrete conversion from a slight difference of input. Combining these two processes, an assembly method of blocks for diversified structures in shape has been developed, in which intelligence is simplified by utilizing for the context information accumulated in the structure being assembled. It might contribute to miniaturization of robots by saving space for intelligence, as well as basic research on principles of systemic characteristics and visualization of numeric series. Referring to vulnerability, a multiple scene survey method is proposed to find serious risks for the systems in advance.
