In wireless sensor networks, one of the fundamental issues is the coverage problem. This is, whether a given region can be sufficiently covered by sensing disks of sensors? In this paper, we discuss the coverage-hole problem by using a sensing topology. From the sensing topology, we figure out the relation between the graph Gn,n+i and coverage holes, and obtain that if m <3n/2-(5-(-1)n)/4, there must exist a coverage hole for the closed graph Gn,m, which has a cut point but no cut edge. Finally, the simulation shows that the proposed approach is effective for some nodes randomly distributed in a region. Keywords-wireless sensor network; coverage; sensing topology
