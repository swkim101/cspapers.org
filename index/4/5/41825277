The AL1 System (Advice Language 1) was developed as a vehicle for conveying expert knowledge, or advice, to a problem solver. Using chess end-games as an experimental problem domain, this paper concentrates on the question: How to implement chess heuristics using the mechanisms of AL1? The spirit of advice programming as a sort of "tree-search engineering" is illustrated by developing an AL1 piece-of-advice for solving an example problem from the king-knight vs. king-rook chess ending. Experiments indicate that an advice program for this ending, based on comparatively simple concepts, and the human chess master perform comparably.
