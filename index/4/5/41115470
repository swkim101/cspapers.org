In this research, the author sought a meta-theory that establishes essential concepts and fundamental techniques in helping programmers design and implement practical fluent interfaces in the Java language. An anatomy of the conceptual establishment of fluent interfaces is established and presented. Six primitives, roles that a key method could play are also identified. The author also coined the term transition choreography and attributed it as the core of the design theory for practical fluent interfaces in Java. Results in this research may apply as well in languages other than Java.
