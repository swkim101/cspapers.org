I believe computers will continue to expand their areas of application, and so am forced to the conclusion that school curricula will have to deal with them. And if computer curricula are to be introduced into the schools, teacher training institutions must prepare teachers to teach about computers.
 The context I choose is education itself. "Education" is of course rather a broad term; computer uses in education are many and varied. Some of these applications are similar enough to those in other areas that some very general principles of computer use will automatically be raised. Others are quite unique, and raise specific questions which teachers will have to deal with in their own professional lives, so that the study of computers can be seen to be very relevant to being a teacher. By teaching about computers in this context instead of more abstractly or generally, and by drawing attention constantly to the educational implications of computer uses, I hope that the teachers who are my students will in turn pass on to their own students the habit of attending to the social implications of what is done by computers.
