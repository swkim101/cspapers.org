We assess the computational costs and benefits of control reasoning in the PROTEAN system, which is built in the BB* environment. We experimentally manipulate PROTEAN's control knowledge and analyze differences in total problem-solving time as a function of several component times. Our results demonstrate and explain the utility of control reasoning. They also illustrate the importance of experimental investigation and the utility of the BB* environment for conducting such investigations.
