Textbook subprogram packages for abstract data structures are often inadequate, inconsistent in design, or are listed as exercises. This paper presents three packages of coordinated Pascal procedures and functions that overcome these deficiencies for a selection of linear data structures. The packages are for array- and link-based stacks and link-based queues. Design guidelines for developing the packages are discussed, and examples of exercises using them are included.
