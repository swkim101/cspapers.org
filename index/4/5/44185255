In this paper, we design a B-tree based mechanical auto-construction system for asynchronous multi-channel wireless data broadcast. We name it as SAMBox (Smart Asynchronous Multi-channel black Box ), which is an integrated framework. Given the number of available channels and the data set to be broadcast, the framework can automatically construct an optimal broadcast program with best index tree structure, channel assignment, as well as index and data allocation, such that the overall performance of the data broadcast system will become optimal according to different client requirements. Theoretical analysis are also provided to prove the efficiency of SAMBox.
