Welcome to ISSTA 2009: The Eighteenth International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis. ISSTA 2009 brings together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange ideas, solve problems, and share experiences related to software testing and program analysis. 
 
We are delighted to be holding this ISSTA in the city of Chicago, Illinois, USA -- a city renowned for its architecture, its music, its art, and its wide range of ethnic neighborhoods, cultures, and cuisines. We are certain that you'll find many things to occupy your time outside the conference. 
 
The ISSTA week includes four workshops: 
Defects 2009: Defects in Large Software Systems 
PADTAD 2009: Parallel and Distributed Systems: Testing and Debugging 
SSEAT 2009: Workshop on State-space Exploration for Automated Testing 
WODA 2009: Workshop on Dynamic Analysis 
 
Defects, PADTAD, and WODA precede the technical program, and SSEAT follows it. 
 
The ISSTA technical program consists of two invited talks and twenty-five research paper presentations. Our invited speakers, Thomas W. Reps and Richard A. Kemmerer, speak on issues relevant to analysis and validation of software. The presentations were selected from ninety-three research papers submitted to ISSTA. At least three members of the Program Committee reviewed each paper, and additional reviewers also reviewed some.
