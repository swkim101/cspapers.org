In order to reform or rejuvenate a spent or worn tubular mold used for continuous casting, friction bodies are introduced into the hollow mold compartment following the grinding of the inner surface of such mold compartment, the ends of the tubular mold are closed, the tubular mold and the friction bodies are placed into a relative movement with respect to one another and thereafter the inner surfaces of the mold are galvanically coated.
