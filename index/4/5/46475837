In this paper we present the system MARS which has been designed for potential database users working with retrieval systems. It is an instrument that is to assist the retriever in specifying the search queries. MARS is an aid for increasing termprecision as well as for finding previously unknown terms which are morphologically related to user search terms. This is achieved by way of linguistic procedures as opposed to conventional mechanical operations such as truncation etc. The morpheme lexicon and the morphological decomposition procedures are described briefly. MARS was put to the test in a real-world situation the results of which will be presented.
