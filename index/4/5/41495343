Theoretical basis for a system named the SBDS (Structure Based Deduction System) including a formalism for representation of knowledge and an inferential algorithm is presented. This system is designed as a part of an intelligent interactive system to support man carrying out such the intelligent activities as engineering design, decision making, scientific research and so forth. The major emphases on the system are : (1) high processing efficiency, (2) high expressive power so that user can represent any knowledge he wishes and (3) easy access to databases.
