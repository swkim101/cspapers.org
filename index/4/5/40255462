Considerable research has been devoted to the development of methods for reducing the transmission bandwidth of video signals such that the reconstructed image is of a high quality. Typically, these methods perform a statistical encoding of the intensity levels of a quantized picture, or they perform some transformation and subsequent data reduction in order to achieve bandwidth reduction [3]. Such methods rarely achieve data compression ratios in excess of ten-to-one without noticeable loss of quality in the reconstructed picture.
