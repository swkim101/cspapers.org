Different methods have been proposed to mine attribute-based access control (ABAC) rules from logs. In practice, these logs are sparse in that they contain only a fraction of all possible requests. However, for sparse logs, existing methods mine and validate overly permissive rules, enabling privilege abuse. We define a novel measure, reliability, that quantifies how overly permissive a rule is and we show why other standard measures like confidence and entropy fail in quantifying overpermissiveness. We build upon state-of-the-art subgroup discovery algorithms and our new reliability measure to design Rhapsody, the first ABAC mining algorithm with correctness guarantees: Rhapsody mines a rule if and only if the rule covers a significant number of requests, its reliability is above a given threshold, and there is no equivalent shorter rule. We evaluate Rhapsody on different real-world scenarios using logs from Amazon and a computer lab at ETH Zurich. Our results show that Rhapsody generalizes better and produces substantially smaller rules than competing approaches.
