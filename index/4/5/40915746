Much attention has been given regarding the lack of writing ability of our graduating students. Many of these same students cannot make reasonable oral presentations of predominantely technical material to peers, graduate students, or faculty much less to an audience consisting of mostly non-technical (lay) persons. This paper examines one such attempt to do so for twenty undergraduate students in a computer science curriculum. The reactions of the presenters as well as those of the audiences are given.
