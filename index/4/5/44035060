Improving the energy efficiency is a major challenge of the next-generation wireless networks. In this regard, several network level green applications have been proposed during the last few years. In this paper, we review some of these applications, and describe how the awareness about the presence of clusters of nearby communicating nodes can enhance them. The considered applications fall into the categories of cell shaping, heterogeneous networks, beamforming and relaying. We exploit the received signal strength (RSS) measurements for finding the clusters of nodes, and study the clustering performance via simulations for local indoor and cellular network scenarios.
