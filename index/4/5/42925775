This work deals with the design of a locomotion algorithm that changes the speed of a crawling quadruped by varying the duty factor /spl beta/. The walking pattern used is the well-known wave gait. This kind of gait should be maintained as much as possible since it is the most efficient locomotion pattern on flat ground. However, the transition between initial and final gaits cannot be based on a wave gait any more because support legs have to be resynchronized according to a new duty factor. This paper proposes an algorithm that deals with the gait transition between initial and final duty factors.
