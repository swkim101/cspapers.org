Recently, there has been an increasing interest in hardware support for decimal arithmetic driven by the growing demands from financial and commercial applications. A crucial building block for decimal operations is the decimal adder. Thus, it is important to explore its design in future nanotechnologies. This work presents the first decimal adder design in quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) nanotechnology using majority voting gates. The proposed one-digit QCA decimal full adder structure in this paper requires 27 majority voting gates and 16 inverters.
