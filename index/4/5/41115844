In this paper we propose a method for motion planning and feedback control of hybrid, dynamic, and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. We outline five subproblems to address this: determining a set of manipulation primitives, choosing a sequence of tasks, picking transition states, motion planning for each individual primitive, and stabilizing each mode using feedback control. We apply the framework to plan a sequence of motions for manipulating a block with a planar 3R manipulator. We demonstrate preliminary experimental results for a block resting on the manipulator with a desired goal state on a ledge outside of the robot's workspace. The planned primitives reorient the block using a series of fixed, rolling, and sliding contact modes, and throw it to the goal state.
