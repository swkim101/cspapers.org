We propose and study a new typing algorithm for dependent type theory. This new algorithm typechecks more terms by using inheritance between classes. This inheritance mechanism turns out to be powerful: it supports multiple inheritance, classes with parameters and uses new abstract classes FUNCLASS and SORTCLASS (respectively class of functions and sorts). We also defines classes as records, particularily suitable for the formal development of mathematical theories. This mechanism, implemented in the proof checker Coq, can be adapted to all typed Â¿-calculus.
