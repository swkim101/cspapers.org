A new approach to obtaining shape information from textural information in static monocular Images la outlined. Also presented is a new aggregation transform which determines (under certain condition) vanishing points and lines. A theorem is proved which relates this Hough-l0ike transform to the gradient space, showing that the transform also directly indicates local surface orientation. Additionally, the transform is shown to have many properties that make it an appealling substitute for some other current image transforms. An example is given of its application to a synthetic textured Image.
