The purpose of this paper is to discuss and analyze the instructional programs needed to prepare prospective public school administrators for today's technological decisions. Most states require public school administrators to obtain an administrator's certificate earned by the satisfactory completion of a certain collection of course work considered necessary for their professional preparation. For example, an administrator's certificate in the state of Texas requires from forty-five to sixty hours of prescribed graduate level course work. The course work at East Texas State University was modified about two years ago to include a three-semester-hour course in computer science. It was believed that all prospective administrators could benefit by at least this amount of exposure to the procedures of automatic data processing. The course was designed to accommodate graduate students in education with very little or no background in computer science. This type of student tends to be initially petrified at the thought of having to take a course in computer science. However, after some exposure to computer science terminology, they are ready to pursue the primary educational objective of the course. This objective is to prepare a prospective superintendent or principal to assume his position in a public school system with some knowledge of how to intelligently use whatever automatic data processing capability is or might possibly become available for his district's use.
