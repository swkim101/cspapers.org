In this tutorial we will present, review, and compare the most popular evaluation metrics for some of the most salient information related tasks, covering: (i) Information Retrieval, (ii) Clustering, and (iii) Filtering. The tutorial will make a special emphasis on the specification of constraints for suitable metrics in each of the three tasks, and on the systematic comparison of metrics according to such constraints. The last part of the tutorial will investigate the challenge of combining and weighting metrics.
