We present Non-Interference Analysis as a model-based method to automatically reveal, track and analyze end-to-end timing dependencies as part of a cross-layer dependency analysis in complex systems. Based on revealed timing dependencies of functional cause-effect chains, this method enables an automated FMEA inspection of timing behavior of individual functions. In consequence, this method can support safety-critical design processes w.r.t. the technical safety concept as mandated by safety standards such as ISO 26262. Our case-study from a state-of-the-art automated research vehicle and synthetic experiments confirm the applicability and scaleability of the proposed method.
