This paper presents a study on the indoor localization system using the passive UHF RFID technology. Positions of multi-antennas are designed according to the Triangular model to narrow the location area of object tags. Major parts as Path Loss models, calibration method, localization algorithm and proposed methodology will be discussed in detail. The orientation between antennas and calibrated Path Loss models are used in improving the localization quality. Besides, the accuracy is increased by combining indoor Path Loss models with Triangular technique.
