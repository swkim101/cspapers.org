This report describes an experimental computer-based educational system called automatic question generation (AUTOQUEST) for assisting independent study of written text. Studies of reading comprehension have shown that retention of material is enhanced if the student is periodically required to answer questions about what he has read (Anderson & Biddle, 1975; Anderson et al., 1974; Alessi et al., 1974; Anderson et al., 1975a, 1975b). This principle has been employed in computer-managed instruction, but it requires considerable human effort to prepare the questions.
