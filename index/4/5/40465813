A process for producing steel in a convertor in which energy is supplied by introducing carbon containing materials into a pig iron melt in said convertor and oxygen is supplied to said melt, and the supply of carbon containing materials to said melt is discontinued when the carbon in said melt is not lower than 2%, and thereafter completing the refining of said melt with oxygen whereby the nitrogen content of the finished steel produced is lower than it would have been had the supply of carbon to said melt been continued to the end of refining.
