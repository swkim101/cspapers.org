The computer industry continues to be transformed by much of the technology that it creates for the markets it supplies. Much of this transformation has been fueled by relentless performance improvements in high-performance microprocessors, interconnection, and communications technologies and computing platforms based on them. Legacy systems of only a decade ago have largely been transformed into nodes on interconnected networks of networks. Where value is added in systems, how systems are differentiated from one another, and how systems are marketed and distributed have undergone substantial change. This talk will discuss several implications that these changes imply for some of the future generations of microprocessors and microprocessor-based systems.
