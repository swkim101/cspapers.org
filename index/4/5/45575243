It is well known that software development projects usually exceed both time and budget projections. Furthermore, many software systems do not meet expectedt performance, are difficult to modify and maintain, and often have unexpectedly short life cycles. These problems exist even when the developers are college graduates with bachelor, masters, and doctoral degrees in computer science. Clearly, the problem is not lack of training but rather focuses on the need for a new approach to the software development process.
 “Software Engineering” is a term coined in 1967 by a computer science study group of the NATO Science Committee as the theme of a workshop on improving the process of software development.
