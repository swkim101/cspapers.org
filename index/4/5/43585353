Program dependence graphs are an important program representation technique for use in vectorization, parallelization and programming environments. We present a graph rewriting semantics for program dependence graphs and prove the equivalence between the program dependence graphs semantics and the operational semantics for programs. We then propose a framework for studying program transformations using program dependence graphs and a programming language calculus based on this rewriting semantics. 1 Program Dependence Graph
