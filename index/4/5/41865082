Search engines are important resources for finding information on the Web. They are also important for publishers and advertisers to present their content to users. Thus, user satisfaction is key and must be quantified. In this tutorial, we give a practical review of web search metrics from a user satisfaction point of view. We cover metrics for relevance, comprehensiveness, coverage, diversity, discovery freshness, content freshness, and presentation. We will also describe how these metrics can be mapped to proxy metrics for the stages of a generic search engine pipeline. The practitioners can apply these metrics readily and the researchers can get motivation for new problems to work on, especially in formalizing and refining metrics.
