The syntax of a requirement specification description language should be similar to the language in which the users think. We have developed a system called JISDOS in which a user can describe his requirements using a formalized Japanese language. The description language, called JPSL, is basically a translation of PSL with the syntactic characteristics of the Japanese Language. Pre- and post-processors are added to PSA for transformations of JPSL descriptions into PSL and conversely to PSL reports into JPSL, so that no modification was performed on PSL/PSA. A user inputs JPSL statements either in KATAKANA (square phonetic characters) or ROMAJI (English alphabetic representation of Japanese characters), and he can receive various kinds of reports in HIRAGANA (curved phonetic characters) and KANJI (Chinese characters). It is concluded that JPSL has a high degree of readability and descriptive power in writing requirement specifications.
