In this paper, the robust control of robot manipulators with consideration of motor dynamics is studied. A robust control scheme is designed based on a third-order dynamic model of robot manipulators that incorporates motor dynamics. The motor torque ripple and parameter uncertainty of the armature circuit are taken into account. The well known robust saturation control technique is applied to the third-order dynamic model to design a control law that guarantees the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop tracking errors. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed control method, and the results have confirmed its effectiveness.
