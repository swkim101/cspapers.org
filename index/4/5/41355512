Embedded computers pervade our lives. There are increasing opportunities for them to adopt embedded operating systems as they are required to have high functionality and complexity. Unfortunately, the reliability of such embedded systems is insufficient to support our lives in 24/7. Therefore, we propose the fine-grain proactive recovery (FPR) of operating system components. FPR enables an operating system to periodically restart its modules and thus to keep their states clean.
