One of the more difficult tasks in this era of adopting curriculums, is to keep a program current with technology. There is a growing number of new hardware, software, and concepts that emerge each year. The speakers will share their experiences in bringing to the classroom the new technology that the students will face or should be facing as professionals in the marketplace. The discussions will focus on implementation of courses in Computer Graphics, Decision Support Systems, and Artificial Intelligence. These courses have been taught at all levels (undergraduate, graduate, Executive MBA) in Computer Science and Business environments.
 The speakers will also hold a discussion on questions from the audience.
