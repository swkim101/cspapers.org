In the past, most service courses were simply programming languages courses. The content and structure of services courses in computing are changing. Today, students taking service courses expect information on word processing, electronic spreadsheets, graphics packages, integrated software packages, social issues, etc., which give them direct and immediate access to computing power without the need to write programs. This panel discusses the changing content and structure of service courses. The time allocated for this presentation is divided into three parts: (i) A presentation by the panelists of information on possible course content (word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, social issues, copyright, privacy, systems concepts, problem solving, programming concepts, programming languages, etc.) with an emphasis on general concepts (i.e. teaching word processing rather than just the idiosyncrasies of a particular word processor like WordStar, PC Write, or any other specific package) rather than specifics. (2) Examples of specific implementations of service courses are presented by the panelists along with the rationale for the selection of particular course topics and details about the specific software and hardware supporting these courses. (3) The presentation is open for comments, questions, and observations from the floor.
