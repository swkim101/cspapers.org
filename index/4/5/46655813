This paper is in the nature of a preliminary report on a pilot project aimed at developing quality instructional materials in three basic areas of computer science (problem solving and programming, hardware and software) for presentation in a concentrated manner. A total of 162 90-minute (54 periods per area) class periods in a classroom environment and an equal amount of supervised workshop study are contemplated. It is expected that the project implementation would extend the capability of the computer science departments across the nation to offer a unique opportunity to students to earn a special minor in computer science and/or to prepare for entering a computer science graduate program - all in the shortest possible time. The courses were offered for the first time during the summer of 1981. The course outlines, the background of the participants and other details of the project are included in the paper.
