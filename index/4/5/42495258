This paper describes the development of a twenty-six minute video to encourage girls to consider studying computing, and a one week computer appreciation holiday program conducted for twenty schoolgirls, aged approximately fifteen years. While the two programs are quite different in the number of schoolgirls able to participate, duration and cost, both were highly successful in terms of the immediate responses received. Some student evaluations are included.
