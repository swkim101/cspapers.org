Auburn University's Robo Camp K12 outreach program integrates various robotics platforms to maximize students' critical thinking and creativity development. This work presents how robotics could be used to teach students computer science concepts and skills through implementing the Computer Science Unplugged (CSU) activities. CSU provide an insightful learning environment where students learn computer science concepts through some playful, coordinated and stress free activities. Implementing such activities using robots resulted in multiple benefits: 1) students acquired advanced computer science notions without undergoing the high stress levels associated with such activities and 2) students maintained high levels of motivation and concentration during the entire six weeks of the camp.
