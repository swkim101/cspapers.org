The FOPHO (F_oreign Phonetician) speech recognition project concerns the development of a system to produce a reasonably high quality phonetic transcription output from continuous speech input. The system is developed to perform in a way which approximates the actions of a phonetician trying to transcribe a foreign tongue, (in the case of FOPHO, Australian English). Because of this central philosophy, FOPHO is a very interactive system and has facilities for automatic learning and analysis of its own performance. Good quality recognition is achieved through algorithms which are very context-dependent and which are sensitive to a variety of possible productions of similar sounds even though the system itself is speaker independent.
