With the advent of communication and satellite industry, the need for efficient reflector antenna system has increased tremendously and vast research is undergoing to develop new schemes for analysis and design of reflector antennas more efficiently and accurately. Good sidelobe suppression is required especially in the radar and communication applications from the point of view of reducing mutual unintentional interference as well as deliberate jamming. The principal limitations on the side lobe performance of reflector antennas arise as a consequence of aperture blocking, scattering effects, the feed illumination on the reflector surface, reflector surface errors and feed misalignments. Detailed analysis of these limitations has been carried out in this paper.
