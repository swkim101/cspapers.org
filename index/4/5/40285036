The workshop will focus on the overall aspects of creating a successful peer grading experience for instructors and students using video rubrics. This includes: determining the right exam rubric, video creation, creating a blind "coupon" sheet, using students and class time to grade and storage. A solid rubric is the best candidate for a test to be peer graded. The rubric will be used in creating videos that along with a correct answer, describe each point breakdown in detail. As the instructor, the class meeting is the only time to have everyone together, answer questions, make grading decisions that affect the whole, show the answers, display exam point breakdown, and finally, grade. In order to get all of this done, a private set of videos are created to quicken the information needed for grading. The workshop will use a trial version Camtasia to create the videos. When taking the test, the students are given a test with the blind "coupon" cover sheet so later, the student graders are unable to determine which student really took this test - protecting the privacy of the original test taking student. After the tests have been taken, the next class meeting can be set aside for peer grading. The instructor plays the afore mentioned videos which are broken up into segments in order for the student to either the focus on the grading or on their own answer since the possibility of one of them getting it right.
