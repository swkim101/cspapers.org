This paper presents a new scenario recognition algorithm for Video Interpretation. We represent a scenario model by specifying the characters involved in the scenario, the sub-scenarios composing the scenario and the constraints combining the sub-scenarios. Various types of constraints can be used including spatio-temporal and logical constraints. In this paper, we focus on the performance of the recognition algorithm. Our goal is to propose an efficient algorithm for processing temporal constraints and combining several actors defined within the scenario. By efficient we mean that the recognition process is linear in function of the number of sub-scenarios and in most of the cases in function of the number of characters. To validate this algorithm in term of correctness, robustness and processing time in function of scenario and scene properties (e.g. number of persons in the scene), we have tested the algorithm on several videos of a bank branch and of an office, in on-line and off-line mode and on simulated data. We conclude by comparing our algorithm with the state of the art and showing how the definition of scenario models can influence the results of the real-time scenario recognition.
