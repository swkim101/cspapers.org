In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in computer science undergraduate research activities at colleges and universities nationwide. Developing and maintaining undergraduate research benefits students, faculty mentors, and the institution. Incorporating a research culture along with a sound academic foundation enables students to develop independent critical thinking skills along with effective oral and written communication skills. However, we are in a time when budgets are being tightened and some institutions do not have the resources to pursue such initiatives. Traditionally research focused universities (like R1) have access to various large funding sources to host Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) programs. R1 universities have established records of accomplishment for innovative research and the faculties at R1 institutions have lab infrastructure to blend such activities for undergraduate students. However, non-R1 institutions (like community colleges, undergraduate, masters, and to some extent R2 institutions) lack resources, lab infrastructure and above all a track record for innovative research that makes it hard for them to obtain funding to host an REU program. Thus, in this panel, our goal is to present ideas for establishing a track record and building an internally and externally funded Undergraduate Research experience (UR), particularly for non-R1 institutions. This involves obtaining funds to conduct the research and to secure travel funds to disseminate research results.
