To build smart human interfaces, it is necessary for a system to know a user's intention and point of attention. Since the motion of a person's head pose and gaze direction are closely related to his/her intention and attention, detection of such information can be utilized to build natural and intuitive interfaces. In this paper, we describe a behavior recognition system based on the real-time stereo face tracking and gaze detection system to measure head pose and gaze direction simultaneously. The key aspect of our system is the use of real-time stereo vision together with a simple algorithm which is suitable for real-time processing. Our system we can significantly simplify the algorithm for 3D model fitting to obtain the full 3D pose of the head compared with conventional systems that use monocular camera. The recognition of attentions and gestures of a person is demonstrated in the experiments.
