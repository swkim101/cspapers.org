The importance of the user interface within interactive robotic workstations is examined and design criteria are discussed. The command of an interactive robotic device is considered as a direct manipulation system and the potential benefits of graphical user interfaces for such systems are outlined. Aspects of current work in user interface design are introduced in the context of the Cambridge University Robot Language (CURL). Interface development tools and evaluation techniques are described. Finally, the future of robot user interfaces is examined with respect to recent advances in computing technology.<<ETX>>
