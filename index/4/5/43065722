A microprocessor system working in conjunction with an application dependent logic module tailored to serve the particular requirements of a given peripheral device. A microprocessor of a uniform architecture works in conjunction with all types of application dependent logic modules to provide instructions and control for data transfer operations. Means are provided in the microprocessor for operation in a normal mode whereby a first set of accumulator registers and flag registers are used exclusively and in a background or interrupt mode where a second set of accumulator registers and flag registers are used exclusively.
