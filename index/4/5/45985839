This paper reports on the experiences at Union University in using a mini-computer based time-sharing facility versus a loosely-coupled micro-computer based facility. These two facilities are the only computer resources used by two disjoint academic populations. Comparisons are drawn on acquisition costs, staffing, and operating costs. The micro-computer system is an inexpensive, viable alternative.
