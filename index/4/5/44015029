In this paper, we extend the answer for the question: Do the gains from massive MIMO and coded caching cumulate? in a simple setting of downlink MIMO channel with Rayleigh quasi-static fading. Under some practical assumptions, the scalability of massive MIMO and coded caching alone with the number of users does not hold. On the other hand, we show that in this setting, the combination of both provides a scalable solution in most practical scenarios. Therefore, MIMO and coded caching are indeed complementary, especially under an optimal power allocation.
