This paper discusses the compliance control of an ultrasonic motor powered prosthetic forearm which utilizes cutaneously measured electromyogram (EMG) signals sensed with the electrodes over the muscles as means of detecting motor commands sent by the central nervous system (CNS). Compliance control of the artificial limb was studied by implementing the bilinear model of the forearm and hand. This model emphasizes the role of the visco-elastic properties of the musculo-skeletal system of the actual limb in controlling its net configuration and movement. The flexor and extensor muscles extending over a joint influence the total joint impedance and determine the equilibrium position of the joint. Relaxing both flexor and extensor muscles makes the joint compliant to external forces, while activating both muscles increases the impedance of the joint.<<ETX>>
