This work presents the design of an inductorless 19–22GHz wideband Low Noise Amplifier in 0.13µm CMOS technology from IBM. A single ended three stage configuration is used. The circuit is designed in Cadence SpectreRF and employs resistive feedback technique to improve linearity and bandwidth. Impedance matching is obtained using transmission lines. At 20GHz, the low noise amplifier has a gain of 27dB, noise figure (NF) of 2.55dB, input referred ldB-CP of −21dBm and input referred third order intercept point (IEP3) of −9.5dBm consuming 75mW from IV supply. This design has the best gain and noise figure reported till date in 0.13µm CMOS technology for single ended 19–22GHzwidebandinductorless LNAs.
