This paper presents a brief summary of the first international workshop on Software Engineering for Parallel Systems (SEPS). The SEPS 2014 is held on October 21, 2014 in conjunction with the ACM SIGPLAN conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH 2014) in Portland, Oregon, USA. The purpose of the workshop is to provide a stable forum for researchers and practitioners dealing with compelling challenges of the software development life cycle on modern parallel platforms. The increased complexity of parallel applications on modern parallel platforms (e.g. multicore, manycore, distributed or hybrid) requires more insight into development processes, and necessitates the use of advanced methods and techniques supporting developers in creating parallel applications or parallelizing and reengineering sequential legacy applications. We aim to advance the state of the art in different phases of parallel software development, covering software engineering aspects such as requirements engineering and software specification; design and implementation; program analysis, profiling and tuning; testing and debugging.
