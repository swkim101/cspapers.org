We propose a behavior learning method of a mobile robot using visual information. The proposed system consists of two networks for the state expression and the behavior generation. The state expression network, which is based on self-organizing algorithm, categorizes the robot's states. Also, the behavior generation network acquires the robot's behaviors using the output of the state expression network. Here, for training the behavior generation network, we utilize the actor-critic method as a kind of unsupervised learning scheme. We report some experimental results using the mobile robot in real environment. The mobile robot generates adaptive behaviors utilizing visual information.
