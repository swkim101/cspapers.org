Learning Sciences argue that student engagement is composed of behavioral, motivational and cognitive dimensions. Many proposals in Learning Analytics have provided teachers with quantitative indicators focusing only on students' behaviors, such as the number and the duration of their actions with the learning environment. In this paper, we propose visual representations of cognitive indicators to add explanatory elements to behavioral indicators. We describe our general architecture for collecting and aggregating data used to build the proposed visualizations. We illustrate the use of these indicators in various pedagogical scenarios oriented towards supporting teachers in students' actions and performances understanding.
