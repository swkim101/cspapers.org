We report on the design and stability analysis of a simple quadruped running controller that can autonomously generate steady running with good energy efficiency and suppress such disturbances as irregularities of terrain. The self-stabilization property of the mechanical system is the inspirational source for our idea. We propose an original Delayed Feedback Control (DFC) approach based on measurements of the stance phase period obtained from contact sensors. Here, the DFC approach will not only stabilize running locomotion around the fixed point, but also result in transition from the stand state to the steady bounding running. Finally, we show several simulation results on different terrain (e.g., flat and step) to characterize the performance of the proposed controller.
