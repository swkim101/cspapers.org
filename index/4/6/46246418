The SPIN program was developed in order to perform Monte Carlo simulations of large communications networks which are under attack. Two mutually exclusive communications disciplines are applied to the network - cable and radio. Nodes are classified either as “originators” or “receivers”. The objective is to determine (for each discipline) how many surviving receivers are connected to surviving originators and their corresponding shortest path lengths. Statistical summaries of surviving receivers and originators and histograms relating surviving receivers with shortest path lengths to surviving originators are produced by the program.
