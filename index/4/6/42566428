Current general purpose operating systems are unable to support a new class of applications that have the same requirements as conventional applications but with additional real-time constraints. We introduce a new real-time process abstraction to model such applications. We show how an operating system can support these processes by having an admission policy to ensure that all of the processes' timing requirements can be met, by monitoring the behavior of the processes to ensure that one process cannot interfere with another by exceeding its allocated resources, and by scheduling the processes to meet their requirements. We also introduce a model for managing processes that overrun. Many of the issues involved in the design and implementation of these components are discussed in this paper.
