The current Information System (IS) design methods restrict the IS design to the one based upon data bases. They totally omit to consider processing aspects. Nevertheless complete representation of real phenomena needs the simultaneous design and realisation of the IS three components : data, processing and their operational dynamics. We take in account all of these aspects and try to develop a piloting system for the design and realisation of IS (REMORA project). In this paper we define a global model for the design of a complete IS including data programs and time dynamics and we present the IS conceptual schema consistent with this orientation. This model is one of relational type. Its definition begins by a representation of the perceived reality analysed in terms of three categories : objects, operations, events. The integrity constrainsts associated to the model concepts allow the definition of the normalized conceptual schema that in particular ensures the non-redudancy quality of the IS data and processings.
