Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a suitable method for the therapy of hemiparetic walking. However, FES requires suitable human and muscle models in order to achieve fast improvements of the patient's gait. Furthermore, an intelligent control scheme is to be employed considering the patient's autonomous motor activity. This paper presents the general therapeutic approach to therapy the hemiparetic gait. Further, human body and muscle models are presented and control algorithm are proposed. Concluding results from simulations and experiments are presented and debated.
