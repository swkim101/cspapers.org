The preemptive scheduling of systems of periodic tasks on a platform comprised of several identical processors is considered. A scheduling algorithm is proposed for static-priority scheduling of such systems; this algorithm is a simple extension of the uniprocessor rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm. It is proven that this algorithm successfully schedules any periodic task system with a worst-case utilization no more than a third the capacity of the multiprocessor platform. It is also shown that no static-priority multiprocessor scheduling algorithm (partitioned or global) can guarantee schedulability for a periodic task set with a utilization higher than one half the capacity of the multiprocessor platform.
