Students in software engineering need experiences that prepare them for a global work environment that is more and more likely to be structured around team work in which team members may come from a variety of disciplines and cultures and be geographically dispersed. New grads in software engineering are more and more likely to communicate with team members and managers solely via electronic means (e.g. teleconference, videoconference, e-mail, e-file sharing). This paper describes a highly successful international collaboration of students from two universities enrolled in undergraduate software engineering classes, one in the USA and the other in India. Within a semester, these students collaborated remotely to produce software for a leading international software development company. This collaboration, repeated for two semesters and planned for a third, met all learning objectives while successfully producing the desired software. This experience truly engaged our students and enabled the students to learn via a standard course in software engineering about many aspects of professional practice without resorting to special programs like co-op/internships, honors/research independent study, or capstones.
