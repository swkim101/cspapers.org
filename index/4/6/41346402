Denison University is a small, liberal arts college located in Granville, Ohio. It has a student body of approximately 2000 undergraduates and a faculty of approximately 165. Courses in Computer Science have been offered since 1969, and in 1972 it became possible to award a Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Sciences with a Concentration (minor) in Computer Science. In 1975, a full scale Bachelor's program in Computer Science was authorized, and the first degrees were awarded in 1976. The program was designed to satisfy two objectives. First, there are a number of students who are oriented towards management and are interested in the applications of computing in industrial environments. Many of these students either pursue a double major or major in one area and develop a strong background in another field. These students frequently do not need a strong mathematical background, but do need a broad exposure to a variety of applications. The Bachelor of Arts degree program was designed for these students. Our second objective was to construct a program for those students who were interested in computer science as a profession; these students would probably go to graduate school or take technical positions in industry upon graduation. For these students we provided the Bachelor of Science degree, which is a more rigorous program.
