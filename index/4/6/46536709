The Web Ontology Language (OWL-2) aims at offering a family of syntax such as RDF/XML, Manchester Turtle and others, for building ontologies. Ontology engineering is a complex task that requires skills that are rarely accessible to content experts. On the other hand, to model contents pertaining to a specific domain, graphical modeling is a technique that is often used to offer a knowledge representation tool to content experts that are not well acquainted with the process of formal ontology design. In this paper, we present the way in which the usage of polymorphism and symbol typing of graphical vocabulary have allowed us to design the G-OWL syntax, a graphical syntax that aims to graphically represent domain-specific knowledge using the OWL-2.
