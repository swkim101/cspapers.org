The goal of the ML-community is to design and develop algorithms which can learn from data and improve with experience over time. However, the application of such automatic machine learning (aML) approaches in the complex biomedical domain seems elusive in the near future, and a good example are Gaussian processes, where aML (e.g. standard kernel machines) struggle on function extrapolation problems which are trivial for human learners [2]. Psychological research indicates that human intuition is not an ’esotheric’ concept; much more, it is based on distinct behavioral and cognitive strategies that developed evolutionary over millions of years [3]. For improving ML, we need to identify the concrete mechanisms and we argue that this can be done best by observing crowd behaviors and decisions in gamified situations.
