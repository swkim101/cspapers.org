In this paper, we analyze the TCP Cubic throughput performance over a Nakagami-m slow-fading wireless channel with impacts of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) schemes. The loss event, which includes a transport-layer congestion loss and physical-layer random packet loss is first analyzed thanks to corresponding finite-state Markov models. The average normalized throughput can be, thus, calculated taking both the losses into consideration. Computer simulations are performed to validate our analysis. The results show that the TCP throughput can be maximized by optimally setting system parameters.
