A third generation parallel link manipulator (PLM) has been developed at the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. The device is similar in geometry to existing prototypes in the laboratory, however, the position sensing hardware configuration for online forward position analysis has been changed. The actuators and drivetrains are also more robust to provide for more realistic task demonstrations. This paper includes a brief description of the new prototype hardware. A closed-form forward position algorithm suitable for the new sensor configuration is derived, and a practical procedure for position sensor calibration is developed and demonstrated.
