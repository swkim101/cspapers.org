Today, on the threshold of an era of automatic placement and routing, a good many printed circuit boards are still manually designed. For these boards the process of checking the connectivity of the printed circuit artwork and the component layout against the engineering schematic is a time consuming and arduous task. In addition, the tedious repetition of this checking job makes it highly error prone. Thus, this task would seem to be an ideal prospect for automation.
 At Hughes Aircraft Company a computer program has been implemented to aid in checking printed circuit artwork. The first task encountered was to devise a method of reducing the artwork and the schematic to coded numerical data specifying their respective connective properties. Next it was necessary to implement an algorithm for comparing the two sets of data. It was also thought important to give consideration to user features and the nature of the man-machine interface.
