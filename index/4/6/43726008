Device-to-device (D2D) communication has recently been investigated as a means of increasing resource utilization, improving system throughput, and reducing power consumption of nearby user equipments (UE). In severe interference or high mobility situations, the expected signal quality might be temporarily unsatisfied, resulting UEs' retransmission or changing the modulation and coding scheme. Comparing to other D2D power control researches of maximizing system throughput or minimum of link quality, this study focuses on minimizing the number of UEs who cannot obtain expected link quality. The study proposes a heuristic power control method by which most of UEs can distributedly approach their target link quality without much interfering others who already have been satisfied in link quality. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs closely to the optimized solution even in heavy traffic situation.
