Designing tools for K-12 computer science education poses a unique and difficult challenge. The focus should be on teaching broad computer science concepts in an engaging way. Other approaches have involved visualizing data structures and algorithms. However, those approaches aren't very engaging. By applying the principles of universal design for learning we created an interactive visualization tool for a simple line game. This visualization tool has several ways to represent the same data structure, and is much more engaging than other approaches to teaching computer science concepts. We are still conducting research on the effectiveness of this tool, but our preliminary results look promising.
