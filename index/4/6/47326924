This report describes several evaluation procedures used to assess the effectiveness of a newly-developed introductory computer science curriculum. The authors describe the development of a tool to evaluate changes in student's attitudes toward the computer science discipline. The process used to develop this survey is presented, along with several interesting preliminary results. The authors also describe the use of an existing tool in the evaluation of the development of student's critical thinking skills.
