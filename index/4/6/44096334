Wearable devices that capture users' rich information regarding their daily activities have unmet authentication needs. Today's solutions, which primarily rely on indirect authentication mechanisms via users' smartphones, thus cumbersome and susceptible to adversary intrusions. Even though there have been some efforts trying to fill this gap, they either rely on some superior sensors, such as cameras and electrocardiogram (ECG) pads, or are awkward to use, e.g., users are asked to perform some pre-defined movement/gesture for authentication. Therefore, an authentication mechanism for wearable devices that is accurate, robust, light-weight and convenient is in dire need. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a user authentication mechanism, Beat-PIN, for wearable devices that are equipped with touch sensors. A user's password is a set of recorded beats when he/she taps the device. We call this rhythm-based password as a beat-PIN, which is represented by the timing of its beats. To achieve high authentication accuracy with short training overhead, we propose a novel classification method. Through extensive experimental evaluation with 124 participants, we show that our mechanism can achieve the average EER of 7.2% with only 7 training samples. Besides, its login time is as low as 1.7s. We also show that its average power consumption for training and login is 337.2mW and 181.4mW, separately, which is lower than that for most common operations on smartwatches. More importantly, we provide a theoretical analysis over the beat-PIN's raw space size and show that it is much larger than that of digit-PINs and traditional passwords.
