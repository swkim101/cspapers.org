Lisp is one of the major programming languages for AI research. This paper surveys the current status of Lisp activities in Japan. First, Lisp systems developed in Japan on commercial machines are reviewed. Next, projects for Lisp machines are reported with commentary. The current problems and future prospects for the Lisp developments are discussed. We propose that the general educational activities and developments of more powerful portable systems for this language are necessary.
