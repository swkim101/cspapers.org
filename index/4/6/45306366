The ability to generate narrative is of importance to computer systems that wish to use story effectively for entertainment, training, or education. One way to generate narrative is to use planning. However, story planners are limited by the fact that they can only operate on the story world provided, which impacts the ability of the planner to find a solution story plan and the quality and structure of the story plan if one is found. We present a planning algorithm for story generation that can nondeterministically make decisions about the description of the initial story world state in a least-commitment fashion.
