In this paper, we introduce a Virtual Reality (VR) search engine interface. Virtual reality has been explored in the game industry and in the multimedia community. When wearing a VR device, a realistic experience is simulated around the user. In the working environment, VR's potential is still understudied. As a first step to enable VR-supported working environment, we present a search engine with a virtual reality interface. In our system, users can read, search and interact with the search engine with novel experiences. They only need to use their hands to interact with digital content, just like what is shown in the "minority report" movie.
