This paper presents a protocol to manage multi-user interference (MUI) in a distributed base station system (DBS). Traditional cellular communication schemes are based on one-to-one wireless links. In a DBS scheme, more than one station can relay the same mobile. Hence, interference patterns cannot be handled by conventional means. The protocol proposed herein answers the problem of assigning channels to mobiles having dynamically changing sets of DBS (because of optimization and mobility) linking each of them to the network with a macro-diversity gain. It is also completely distributed and dynamic. It adapts to virtually any change in topology so that the communication network does not require explicit configuration. It is shown that a feasible operating point can be reached to make use of macro-diversity while maximizing channel reusability and limiting the effect of interference.
