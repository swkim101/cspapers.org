As humans become more and more immersed in a networked world of connected and mobile devices, cooperation and sociability to achieve valued outcomes within geographic locales appears to be waning in favour of extended personal networks and interaction using semi-automated agents to support communications, transportation and other services. From a messaging structure that is complex, multiplexed and much of the time asynchronous, conditions emerge that disrupt symmetry of information exchange. People thus encounter circumstances that seem unpredictable given the information available to them, resulting in limited or failed cooperation and consequent quality of outcomes. We explore the role of Social Machines to support, change, and enhance human cooperation within a blended reality context.
