The Educators' Symposium is a unique forum for educators from both academia and industry who have a vested interest in OO education and training. The Educators' Symposium facilitates the exchange of ideas in a number of ways, including featured talks by professionals on the cutting edge of OO education, paper presentations, and activity sessions. Furthermore the successful poster session has been expanded to an exhibition. This exhibition provides the ideal opportunity for exchanging teching and learning techniques, networking with professionals facing similar challenges, and exploring teaching and learning tools. All attendees are invited to actively participate in the exhibition by bringing any related material they would like to share.
