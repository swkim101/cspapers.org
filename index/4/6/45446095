Having been a part of all the previous symposia, I am happy to introduce this one. The Program Chairpersons Bob Blakely and Dorothy Denning have done a superb job in recruiting and cajoling the community to make possible a splendid program. Thanks to them and their program committee. Again Jim Runyan has done an outstanding job of organizing everything, and deserves our appreciation. All of these people have devoted considerable effort and time to jobs that are extremely valuable to the community at large.
