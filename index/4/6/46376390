This work solves the disassembly sequencing problem based on a disassembly sequence generator Information Model, which is a sub model belonging to a disassembly information base called Disassembly Information Model (DIM). DIM is developed based on an extensive investigation of various informational aspects in the domain of disassembly planning and represents an appropriate systematization and classification of the products, processes, uncertainties and degradations related information. In this paper, the goal is to partially validate the DIM model by using it for solving the disassembly sequencing problem.
