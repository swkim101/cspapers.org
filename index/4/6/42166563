In many industries, the adoption of technology developed at universities and independent research labs is the prevalent paradigm. However, in the software space, this is a relatively rare occurrence. In many cases, academic software engineering tends to lag rather than lead commercial developments. The goal of this Workshop is to open a dialouge between researchers and practitioners to address this problem.
