Two recent trends in computing, namely parallelism and programming generality, imply that increasing importance will be placed on developing location-independent schemes for computer memories. This paper examines several issues that arise when hierarchical associative memories are used to accomplish this objective. First, it presents methods for constructing economical associative memories to be utilized as lower levels in the hierarchy. Then, it considers the ramifications of storage reallocation in the memory and develops a new unit of storage transfer, the paragraph. Finally, it demonstrates that difficulties that might arise due to duplicate storage of data words in the memory can be negated by a simple scheme.
