It is our pleasure to welcome you to Seattle for UIST 2005, the Eighteenth Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology. UIST 2005 continues in the tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research innovations in the software and technology of human-computer interfaces. Sponsored by ACM's special interest groups on computer-human interaction (SIGCHI) and computer graphics (SIGGRAPH), UIST brings together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas that include traditional graphical & web user interfaces, tangible & ubiquitous computing, virtual & augmented reality, multimedia, new input & output devices, and CSCW. The intimate size, the single track, and comfortable surroundings make this symposium an ideal opportunity to exchange research results and implementation experiences.The call for papers attracted 158 full paper and TechNote submissions from 14 countries. The program committee accepted 30 of them (19%) that cover a variety of exciting topics, including mobile, physical, and voice interfaces, mouse & touch screen interaction, customization, and projector-based systems. In addition, the program includes a keynote from Gary Starkweather on personal computing in the 21st Century and two invited surveys by Susan Dray and Ken Goldberg on ethnography and the design of networked, interactive artworks, respectively. Posters, demos, and our third annual Doctoral Consortium will complete the program. You can find these contributions in the UIST conference companion, which is distributed at the conference. The UIST proceedings continue to be prepared in color and we hope that they serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners. We have supplemented the proceedings with a DVD containing videos as appropriate for the papers, TechNotes, posters and demonstrations.
