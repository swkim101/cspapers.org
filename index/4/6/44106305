We present an automated technique for synthesizing adaptive attacks to extract information from program functions that leak secret data through a side channel. We synthesize attack steps dynamically and consider noisy program environments. Our approach consists of an offline profiling phase using symbolic execution, witness generation, and profiling to construct a noise model. During our online attack synthesis phase, we use weighted model counting and numeric optimization to automatically synthesize attack inputs. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on DARPA benchmark programs created for testing side-channel analysis techniques.
