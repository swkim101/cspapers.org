In this paper, we discuss digital literacy and preservice teacher education and reflect on the current state of web-based education and development of digital literacy in teacher education in Slovenia. The literacy context is discussed in the context of the Educational Technology course which is delivered in teacher education. The aim of this course for preservice preprimary and primary classroom teachers is to develop student teachers' digital literacy and prepare them for the efficient integration of ICT into their teaching. This will in turn influence learners' digital literacy and competence for active engagement in the emerging culture of participation. The paper discusses web-based teaching methodology with a focus on instructional design, learning resources and high-order learning outcomes. The affordance of mobile technology fosters ubiquitous learning which has been integrated into the teacher education curriculum. The notion of tools in learning and literacies is discussed in the context of the transition from traditional written culture to digital culture. In integrating mobile learning, three important dimensions converge, underlining the development of digital literacy: the technology dimension of wireless mobile providing instant access, the social dimension and the learning behaviours dimension. A survey was conducted to examine undergraduate student-teachers' attitudes on the application of ubiquitous education and the development of digital literacy through the integration of mobile learning. The results indicate that student-teachers have developed competences in a variety of mobile learning and teaching activities They believe that mobile technology increases connection between learner and teacher but are neutral about the integration of children's social practices from their free time to school environment.
