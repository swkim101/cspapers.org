We proposed a seamless fiber-millimeter-wave converged system suitable to provide a high-speed and low-latency transmission for heterogeneous wireless signals. Satisfactory performance is experimentally confirmed for simultaneous transmission of high-speed LTE-A and very-high-throughput WLAN IEEE 802.11ac signals over the proposed system.
