This paper reports on a series of benchmarks conducted on a shared memory, tightly-coupled commercial multiprocessor system. A measurement of the degree of linear increase in throughput, as processors were added, was conducted for a number of transaction types and configurations. When compared to theoretical models and calculations, the benchmarks yielded results that were quite close to the predicted performance. This correlation held true over a wide range of transaction types and up to a large number of processors.
