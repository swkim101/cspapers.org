We study the complexity of computing the permanent on random inputs. We consider matrices drawn randomly from the space of n by n matrices with integer values between 0 and p â€“1, for any large enough prime p . We show that any polynomial time algorithm which computes the permanent correctly on even an exponentially small fraction of these matrices, implies the collapse of the polynomial-time hierarchy to its second level. We also show that it is hard to get partial information about the value of the permanent modulo p . We show that any balanced polynomial-time 0/1 predicate (e.g., the least significant bit, the parity of all the bits, the quadratic residuosity character) cannot be guessed with probability significantly greater than 1/2 (unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses). This result can be extended to showing simultaneous hardness for linear size groups of bits.
