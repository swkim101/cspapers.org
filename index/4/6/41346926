We have constructed a recurrent network that stabilizes images of a moving object on the retina of a simulated eye. The structure of the network was motivated by the organization of the primate visual target tracking system. The basic components of a complete target tracking system were simulated, including visual processing, sensory-motor interface, and motor control. Our model is simpler in structure, function and performance than the primate system, but many of the complexities inherent in a complete system are present.
