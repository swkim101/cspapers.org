The living lab concept promotes innovation by solving problems in an open, user-centric environment. A living lab approach was implemented in an undergraduate, advanced software engineering course to develop applications for the Leap Motion. The Leap Motion is a novel device that provides touch-less interaction with computer systems. Sixteen students worked toward the common goal of developing applications for the Leap Motion. All aspects of the project were supported in the student-led, open environment, from initial research to implementation. Because the Leap Motion device was not available until shortly before the semester, students had no prior experience in application development for the technology, adding to the difficulty and uniqueness of the task. This poster provides the details of the living lab implementation as the project progressed through the semester.
