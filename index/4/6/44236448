In this paper, the impact of hardware impairments on secrecy performance of cognitive MIMO schemes is investigated. In addition, the relay which helps the source forward the source signal to the destination can operate either half-duplex mode or full-duplex mode. For performance evaluation, we give the expressions of average secrecy rate over Rayleigh fading channel. Monte-Carlo simulations are presented to compare and optimize the performance of the proposed schemes.
