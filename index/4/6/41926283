The goal of our research is to achieve a dynamic and skillful motion by a real robot. We have previously developed a brachiation controller that can achieve two kinds of brachiation: overhand and side-hand motions. In this paper, we redesign behavior controllers in order to achieve a stable continuous brachiation without a break. We make the behavior controllers that can be controlled by the angle around a catching bar because the angle is the most dominant parameters of the brachiation motions. In addition, we introduce the action of bending elbow joints in order to realize a pendulum motion and to reduce the impact of the moment of catching a bar. Finally, we show the experimental results that the robot could successfully achieve continuous brachiation.
