This paper describes the knee stretch walking of the biped robot that has three degrees of freedom (DOF) in the ankle, one DOF in the knee and three DOF in the hip. To create the stable stretch walking pattern, a walking pattern generation method capable of specifying arbitrarily the knee joint angle is introduced. The motion of the waist avoids the singularity of the swing leg that can exist in single support phase. A compensatory motion algorithm to cancel the moments generated by the motion of the lower-limbs calculates the waist motion. Through stretch walking simulations, the effectiveness of the pattern generation method is confirmed.
