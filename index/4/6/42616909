Parlay X is a set of Web Services interfaces designed to provide an open access to network functions. Deployment of Web Services requires interoperability between Parlay X interfaces and Open Service Access (OSA) interfaces. The OSA gateway is responsible for the translation of OSA interfaces and the network control protocols. The paper presents a study on alternatives for deployment of Parlay X Payment Web Service in Internet Protocol based multimedia networks (IMS). It provides a transformation of Parlay X payment model to the IMS charging model based on the Diameter protocol. A formal approach to specification of OSA gateway is proposed.
