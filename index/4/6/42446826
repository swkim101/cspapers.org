Silicon carbide (SiC) has proved to be a promising material for the development of high temperature and high power applications because of excellent thermal and physical properties. In this study, 2D numerical simulation is performed using industry based Sentaurus TCAD tools. The aim of this research work is to design a device which provides high performance for power applications. Complete design provides the excellent forward and blocking characteristics. Simulation results show that increasing temperature, improve the forward characteristics and 5 A saturation current at 600 K is observed at VGS = 3 V. Also, a very low on-resistance is observed at 600 K which is 0.027 mΩ. The design also provides good blocking capability at room temperature which indicates high value of figure of merits (FOM). The calculated values of FOM decrease with increasing temperature and 19.75 MW (300 K) to 0.5 MW (600 K) are observed at VGS = −2 V. In addition, its high current value and superior FOM makes 4H-SiC VJFET an excellent device that can give better performance for high temperature and high power applications.
