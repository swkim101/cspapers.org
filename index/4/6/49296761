The reservoir computing, an emerging computing paradigm, has proven its benefit to multifarious applications. In this work, we successfully designed and fabricated an analog delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) chip. Measurement results demonstrate its rich dynamic behaviors and high energy efficiency. System performance, as well as the robustness, are evaluated. The application of video frame recognition is investigated using a hybrid neural network, which employs the multilayer perceptron (MLP) training model as the readout layer of our designed DFR system, and yields 98% classification accuracy. Compared to results of using the MLP training only, our hybrid training model exhibits much higher recognition rate and accuracy.
