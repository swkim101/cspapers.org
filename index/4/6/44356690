Conceptual clustering is an important way to sununarize data in an understandable manner. However, the recency of the conceptual clustering paradigm has allowed little exploration of conceptual clustering as a means of improving performance. This paper presents COBWEB, a conceptual clustering system that organizes data to maximize inference abilities. It does this by capturing attribute inter-correlations at classification tree nodes and generating inferences as a by-product of classification. Results from the domains of soybean and thyroid disease diagnosis support the success of this approach.
