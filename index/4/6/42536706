Makes a comparative study between two adaptive control strategies applied to a leg of a quadruped. This leg is composed of two rigid links with pneumatic actuators driving rotational joints. In order to enable nonlinear control approaches, a model of this system is built. The control design is based on one hand on MRAS and on the other hand on passive system theory which ensure the asymptotic stability of the whole. Adaptation laws are proposed, grounded either on the number of operations keeping in mind real time implementation facilities, or on the robustness toward disturbances. These control laws are compared using simulation results.<<ETX>>
