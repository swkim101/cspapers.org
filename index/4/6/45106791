The 6th ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communication Security (ASIACCS 2011) was held in Hong Kong, China, on 22-24 March 2011. The conference was sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC), and was supported by the Center for Information Security & Cryptography (CISC) at the University of Hong Kong, the School of Professional and Continuing Education (SPACE) at the University of Hong Kong, and the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong. 
 
The ASIACCS series is built on the success of ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) and ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC) and aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working in the areas of information, computer and communications security from universities, industry and government sectors. 
 
The Program Committee received 217 paper submissions, and accepted 35 regular papers and 24 short papers for presentation at the conference. The final versions of the accepted papers, which the authors finalized on the basis of comments from the reviewers, were included in the proceedings. Each paper was carefully reviewed by at least three program committee members on the basis of its significance, novelty, and technical quality. The individual reviewing process was double-blind. It was followed by a Web-based discussion. Based on the comments and scores given by reviewers, the final decisions on acceptance were made.
