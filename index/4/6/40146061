This is a review paper on Mobiligence research. In order to solve the mechanism of intelligence with which higher organisms can behave even in unknown environment, and to discover design principle of artificial systems that have such intelligence, a new concept called Mobiligence is introduced based on assumption that the intelligence must be emerged through the interaction of the system with the environment caused by its mobility. The research on the Mobiligence is characterized by embodied plasticity, co-embodiment with environment, and internal generation of abductive information. The framework of the research on Mobiligence is presented in this paper as well as the originality of the research.
