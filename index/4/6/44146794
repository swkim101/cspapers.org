In this work, we study the hidden cost of software vulnerabilities reported in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) through stock price analysis. We perform a high-fidelity data augmentation to ensure data reliability for estimating vulnerability disclosure dates as a baseline for assessing software vulnerabilities' implication. We further build a model for stock price prediction using the NARX Neural Network model to estimate the effect of vulnerability disclosure on the stock price. Compared to prior work, which relies on linear regression models, our approach is shown to provide better accuracy. Our analysis shows that the effect of vulnerabilities on vendors varies, and greatly depends on the specific industry.
