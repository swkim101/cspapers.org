This paper presents the development and demonstration of a robotic gripper for active control of shape and vibration of thin-walled flexible payloads. The gripper is a smart gripper, which is configured with multiple actuated fingers that are comprised of linear actuators with DC motors, and laser proximity sensors to enable control of both shape and vibration of thin-walled flexible payloads. A detailed description of the proof-of-concept smart gripper is presented, followed by an experimental demonstration using an automotive front quarter body panel.
