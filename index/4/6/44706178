The emergence of Internet as a global information repository, where information of all kind is stored, requires intelligent information processing tools (i.e., computer applications) to help the information seeker to retrieve the stored information. To build these intelligent information processing tools, we need to build computer applications that understand human language since most of those information is represented in human language. This is where computational linguistics becomes important, especially for countries like Indonesia that hosts more than 200 million people. We need to develop a systematic understanding of the Bahasa Indonesia (the Indonesian national language) to enable us develop the needed computer applications that will help us manage information intelligently.
