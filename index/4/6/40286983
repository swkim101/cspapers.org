Direct force control of robots is challenging, particularly since the interaction with the environment can render the robot unstable. This paper presents the results of novel approaches for passivity-based stability for a particular direct force control method, namely explicit force control. A step-by-step procedure to passivate and stabilise the control loop is presented and it explains how Time Domain Passivity Approach, a passivity-based tool widely used in teleoperation and haptics has been extended and applied in explicit force control. The electrical circuit and network-port representations derived in the process allows the analytical evaluation of the system and can be applied in other control architectures as well. The stability methods are presented both qualitatively and quantitatively with simulations and hardware experiments. A discussion about the results obtained and the energy behavior is also provided. Results are promising and suggest that these methods can be used for stable and high-bandwidth force control of robotic manipulators.
