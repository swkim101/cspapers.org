Pipeline techniques are used to assign the computation modules required in Inverse Plant plus Jacobian Control of robot manipulators to a multiple set of processors. With example execution times for each of the modules, the compute time, initiation rate, and CPU utilization are used to evaluate the performance. For three processors, with more than 90% CPU utilization, the compute time is reduced by more than 25% and the initiation rate is almost tripled over that of a single processor.
