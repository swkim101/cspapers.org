While much work has been done on the lab component of the CS1 course, programming assignments have not received as much attention. Many CS1 courses have a series of programming assignments that supplement the lab component. However, the assignments are often unrelated to each other. While the advantages of semester project for upper division courses are well known, little has been done on the use of a semester project in the first programming course. However, it is feasible for a first semester programmer to complete an entire semester project if it is designed properly. The development of a semester-long programming project done in phases has many benefits to offer a CS1 course.
