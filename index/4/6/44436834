Atlanta University Center is the largest private institution of Black higher education in the world and the second oldest consortium of schools in the nation. When the Center began offering an undergraduate degree in computer science in 1969, it was the first institution in Georgia to do so. Now there are 50 majors, and each semester the Center-Coordinated Computer Science Department teaches approximately 250 students for the six institutions comprising the Atlanta University Center. In this paper the computer science curriculum is described and programs and services provided by this department are detailed.
