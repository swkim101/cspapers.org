Due to the cost consideration for data storage, high-areal-density shingled-magnetic-recording (SMR) drives and data deduplication techniques are getting popular in many data storage services for the improvement of profit per storage unit. However, naively applying deduplication techniques upon SMR drives may dramatically downgrade the runtime performance of data storage services, because of the time-consuming SMR space reclamation processes. This work advocates a vertical integration solution by jointly managing the host-managed SMR drives with deduplication system, in order to essentially relieve the time-consuming SMR space reclamation issue. The proposed design was evaluated by a series of realistic deduplication workloads with encouraging results.
