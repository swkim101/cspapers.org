1. SUMMARY Roughly once per decade, the ACM and IEEE-Computer Society form a joint task force to survey the discipline and produce curricular guidelines for undergraduate computer science programs. The latest guidelines document, Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013), was released in the Fall of 2013 after multiple rounds of public review and feedback. A significant novel feature of CS2013 is the structuring of the Body of Knowledge core topics into two tiers. While Core-Tier1 topics are expected to be included in every undergraduate computer science program, individual programs may choose to cover only a subset of Core-Tier2 topics, depending upon institutional size, resources, and goals. CS2013 recommends at least 80% coverage of CoreTier2, which provides flexibility for designing curricula that meet institutional constraints while still maintaining disciplinary standards.
