This conference provides a unique opportunity for you to share your knowledge and to learn and grow. We have set up several social events intended, in part, to provide you with an opportunity to meet your technical peers from around the world. The PLANS symposium has a long history of attracting high quality technical papers and the PLANS 2004 program has carried on this tradition. The technical papers form the cornerstone of the symposium. Therefore, to provide much deserved recognition to the significant contributions of the authors, we have several awards for manuscripts. The awards arc the Walter Fried Award for best paper, best student paper, and best track paper. The four distinguished Track Chairs have assembled an excellent program with multiple tracks running simultaneously throughout the conference. The content of the program is diverse, including sensor technology, integrated navigation systems, satellite-based navigation, and advanced navigation. We have added several special features to this program including a workshop on MEMS, a plmcl discussion on GPS modernization, and a special session dedicated to research in academia. 1 want to thank the Track Chairs and Session Chairs for their hard work in developing this outstanding technical program.
