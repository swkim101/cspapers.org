Considerations involved in designing an undergraduate computer science curriculum for a small private liberal arts college are presented. Observations are made relative to the design and implementation of such a program at the School of the Ozarks, a small college located in the southwest corner of Missouri. The computing needs of the college are presented, and the challenges of introducing computer science to a predominantly liberal arts faculty are described.
