Robot navigation is a problem that encompasses most of the major areas of AI research. Machine architecture, search, knowledge acquisition and representation, planning, scheduling, reaction, perception, and of course robotics, all can play integral roles in a mobile robot navigation system. For this reason, a large part of the AI community is now interested (and has been since STRIPS was used to guide the Shakey robot) in mobile robot navigation.
