A display system for displaying feel information while manipulating dynamic virtual objects is introduced and new concept of impedance display is proposed. An unified description of the dynamics of virtual objects based on the Lagrangian formulation is derived. The detection of the grasp states, and the friction effects at the grasp points on virtual object surface, which is important to help recognize the object and handle it more dexterously, are treated explicitly. Display algorithms which create and present the dynamic operating feel of an object as well as the friction feel on the object surface to the operator is provided. Experimental verification on the proposed approaches is performed and its results are outlined.<<ETX>>
