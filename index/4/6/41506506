The use of wide area networks (WANs) such as the Internet is growing at a tremendous rate.Such networks hold great promise for new types of distributed applications, which will be widely distributed, highly replicated, intensely interactive, and adaptive to many types of network conditions. Developing such applications will require a solid understanding of the performance and availability characteristics of WANs as they evolve. The ability to measure the effect of these conditions will, for example, be important for large-volume applications such as digital libraries, and for near-real-time applications such as collaborative research and teleconferencing.
