INTRODUCTION Parallel and distributed computing is increasingly dominating real-world applications. It is critical to a wide range of applications, either because they require greater computational resources (cpu cycles or memory accesses) than are feasible on a sequential computer, or because they are naturally distributed. Thus, parallel and distributed computing is central to a range of areas from high performance scientific computing to industrial process control. More recently, the growth of intemet and intranet (wide area enterprise integration) has given new impetus to research and development in this field.
