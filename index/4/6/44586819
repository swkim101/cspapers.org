As the focus of software engineering has expanded from information technology supporting the department, to supporting the organization, and to supporting the enterprise, engineering communities have attempted to extend their focus using Enterprise Frameworks and Enterprise Architectures (EAs). Unfortunately in doing so, information assurance (IA) is seldom considered for inclusion in such frameworks and architectures. On the occasions when IA is included in the frameworks or architectures, it is not addressed in a complete and comprehensive manner. In addition, even when known IA solutions exist, they are often not effectively applied. Enterprise architects and systems/software engineers often do not know the basics of IA. Patterns have recently become common for conveying best practice approaches to development and integration for well-known technologies in the system and software engineering communities. However, the use of patterns to capture a full range of enterprise solutions and IA solutions is still very new.
