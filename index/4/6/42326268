The dearth of trained computer specialists continues in the market. The unprecedented advancement in computer technology has created need for computer specialists with higher degrees. Simultaneously it has also created tremendous job opportunities for people with bachelor degrees in computer science. As more and more students with an undergraduate degree are offered attractive positions, less and less of them are available for higher education. One way to meet the demand for computer specialists with higher degrees is through retraining. Students with degrees in related areas may be retrained appropriately to enter graduate programs in computer science. This paper describes such a retraining scheme which has been in existence for the last four years.
