This paper deals with the concept, design, construction and experimental results of a gripper dedicated to the grasping of nonrigid material pieces out of a bundle. Based on a number of functional requirements a gripper is proposed with two passively rotating fingers and its performance is assessed experimentally in the case of grasping furs.
