Future automotive software needs to deal with an increasing level of dynamicity, reasoned by the wish for connected driving, software updates, and dynamic feature activation. Such functionalities cannot be properly realized with today's classic AUTOSAR development approach, since it relies on the static configuration of all software units at build time.We present the automotive container (AUTOCONT) architecture as an alternative to AUTOSAR-based software development. Our approach relies on the combination of component containers, event-based interaction and configuration at update time. We discuss the requirements and principles for such an architecture and discuss first experiences with a prototypical implementation.
