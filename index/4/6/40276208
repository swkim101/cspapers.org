Of central interest in this connection is the Backward Induction algorithm, which has generated a good deal of controversy, and with it, a large literature. We will review some of this literature, culminating with an as yet unpublished result of Itai Arieli and the speaker.n is the Backward Induction algorithm, which has generated a good deal of controversy, and with it, a large literature.
