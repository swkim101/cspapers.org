We describe a technique to automatically classify a web page into an existing bookmark category to help a user to bookmark a page. HyperBK compares a bag-of-words representation of the page to descriptions of categories in the user's bookmark file. Unlike default web browser dialog boxes in which the user may be presented with the category into which he or she saved the last bookmarked file, HyperBK also offers the category most similar to the page being bookmarked. The user can also opt to create a new category; or save the page elsewhere. In an evaluation, the user's preferred category was offered on average 61% of the time.
