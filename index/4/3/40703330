In the Fall of 2013, the Institute for Certification of Computing Professionals (ICCP) appointed the authors of this paper to the CS2013 Assessment Council. This council created a standardized exam to assess computer programs and identify areas of the curriculum that a school needed to strengthen to meet CS2013: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science. The existing Major Field Test for Computer Science from Educational Testing Service does not provide schools with sufficient guidance to determine what aspects of their computer programs are strong and what aspects need to be strengthened to meet the CS 2013 guidelines. The ICCP exam covers the Core Tier 1 Knowledge Units (KU). CS 2013 indicates that all computer programs should teach these KUs. The ICCP exam selects questions in proportion to the number of hours the CS2013 guidelines indicate are necessary to teach the Core Tier 1 learning objectives for a KU. Choices for multiple choice questions were limited to three per question, since research indicated that student mastery of topics could be assessed more rapidly with fewer distractors without reducing reliability. The exam was alpha tested in 2014 and beta tested in January and February 2015. The exam will be available in Spring of 2015.
