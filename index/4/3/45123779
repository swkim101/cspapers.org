This paper describes a class that we developed at the University of Northern Iowa to address covering the topics suggested in ACM/IEEE Computing Curricula 1991 [1]. All junior level students take this course, and thus are ensured of a minimum introduction to the topics of software engineering, database management, human computer interfaces, and computer ethics. This paper describes the course and lessons learned in teaching the course. One of the benefits of the course is that it introduces abstract modeling (entity-relationship model) and the model is used in a life cycle that includes analysis, design, implementation, and test. Students see how a model fits into software development and the benefits of modeling. The greatest challenge in the course is finding a coordinated text book that adequately covers all the topics in the course.
