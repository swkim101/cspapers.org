"What's new?" and "What has changed?" are questions users of knowledge organizations systems, such as thesauri, classifications or taxonomies, ask, when new versions of such vocabularies are published. Until recently, it had been difficult for the publishers to provide this information (normally resorting to custom change logging within maintenance applications), and almost impossible for anybody else. With the widespread acceptance of SKOS as the standard publication and exchange format, the situation has changed fundamentally: Exact deltas between two sets of RDF triples can be computed, and the differences can be organized in a meaningful way through SPARQL queries, taking advantage of regular SKOS structures. skos-history combines a script for creating a "version store" with queries accessing this store to generate standard reports such as "added concepts" or "changed notations", or more subtle changes like concept splits, as well as aggregated statistics on certain change types, or a complete change history for a single concept across multiple versions. To allow for interactive sorting, filtering and downloading these reports, and for editing the queries in an IDE-like environment to adapt them to different vocabularies or user needs, other open source libraries are integrated.
