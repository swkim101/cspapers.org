Presents a method for robot modelling called "double dynamic modelling". This method is based on an improvement of the classic dynamic model which takes into account the gear trains included in the robot axes, especially the gear yields and the direction of power transmission in the gears. According to this direction the dynamic model becomes different. Experimental results on a biped robot are given, which show the improved accuracy of the new dynamic model and better performances of the computed-torque control implemented in the biped robot and based on this model.<<ETX>>
