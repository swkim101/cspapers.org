A notation is given for describing the inverse of multiple functions and of functions of multiple arguments. A technique based upon this notation is presented for taking a program written in pure LISP and automatically deriving a program which computes the inverse function of the given program. This technique differs from previous such methods in its use of heuristics to invert conditionals.
