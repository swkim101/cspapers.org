Todayâ€™s embedded systems operate under increasingly dynamic conditions. First, computational workloads can be either fluctuating or adjustable. Moreover, as many devices are battery-powered, it is common to have runtime power management technique, which results in dynamic power budget. This paper presents a design methodology for multi-core systems, based on dataflow specification, that can deal with various contexts. We optimize the original dataflow considering various working conditions, then, autonomously adapt it to a pre-defined optimal form in response to context changes. We show the effectiveness of the proposed technique with a real-life case study and synthetic benchmarks.
