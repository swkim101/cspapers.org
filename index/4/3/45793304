Factory scheduling can be considered as an instance of the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Factory scheduling differs from traditional forms of the CSP in that it is a dynamic or open problem. Constraints are added to and retracted from the problem as work progresses on the shop floor. Constraints alter as unexpected events occur, such as the breakdown of machines, the late arrival of work, the early arrival of work and the changing demands put upon the scheduling system by the user. A system is required that can generate and maintain a schedule in near-real time and exploit opportunities as they arise. A single resource scheduling agent has been developed to schedule incrementally and reactively in a dynamic environment using advanced CSP techniques.
