Automated assessment of computer programs submitted by students serves two main purposes: it may be used to increase grading efficiency and process optimization in large courses on one hand. On the other hand, if integrated properly into a suitable learning context, it may also improve student learning by supporting tutoring capabilities. Both aspects have been important in developing aSQLg, an automated grader for SQL statements ([1]). Unfortunately aSQLg so far only supports SQL queries. In order to provide a comprehensive efficiency and tutoring tool for SQL an extension to statements of the data manipulation (DML) and data definition language (DDL) is required. On this poster we present concepts for auto-grading of the most important DML and DDL statements as well as ideas on how to integrate those into the existing aSQLg grader.
