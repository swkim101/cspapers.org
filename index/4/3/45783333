This paper describes initial efforts to use open-source data to capture knowledge about forced migration in Iraq. Our goal is to understand the connection between open-source data and possible leading indicators of forced migration. For our preliminary analyses, we use a corpus of 2.6 million documents. Here we describe the techniques we used and challenges we faced. We conclude with recommendations for those using open-source data for grand-scale data science challenges.
