As the prevalence of producing devices equipped with multiple interfaces, the idea to enhance network resource usage by developing a multipath transmission control protocol has recently captured great attention from many researchers. Moreover, there is a considerable increase in user demand of transmitting data over high speed and/or long delay networks. Various algorithms have been proposed lately to improve the performance of end-to-end connections in such environments. However, most existing schemes belong to either loss-based approach or delay-based approach, which have well-known problems about fine-grained of load balancing achievement, or fairness, respectively. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multipath congestion control algorithm for high speed and/or long delay networks, named MCompound. As a design extended from Compound TCP, it can achieve high link utilization while remains good fairness. The performance of the algorithm shown in the simulation results is meliorated as compared to other algorithms.
