An article handling apparatus includes an arm which comprises a parallel linkage consisting of four links and is pivoted through a pivot to a support head, a motor provided at the free end of one of two links not coupled by the pivot, a carrier connected to the free end of the other link for carrying an article to be transported, a chain driven by the motor for lifting and lowering the arm and connected at one end to a mount fixed to that portion of said one link where a straight line including the free end of said other link and the pivot passes, and adjusting device provided on the support head for moving the chain horizontally, whereby the intermediate portion of the chain between the mount and support head is made perpendicular to the horizontal so that no change takes place in tension applied to the chain while the article is transported horizontally.
