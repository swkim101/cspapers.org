The Smart Energy Grid Security (SEGS) Workshop aims to foster innovative research and discussion about smart energy grid security and privacy challenges, issues, approaches, and solutions. SEGS publications offer perspectives from both academia and industry, and present novel research on theoretical and practical aspects of smart grid security and privacy, including design, analysis, experimentation, and fielded systems. SEGS also includes presentations from other communities, such as law, economics, and HCI, that present these communities' perspectives on technological issues. The scope of the workshop encompasses all aspects of the smart grid, including distribution, transmission, generation, metering, e-mobility, and integration of distributed energy resources.
