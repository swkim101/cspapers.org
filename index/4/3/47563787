The recruiting and retention of women in the computing sciences has been an area of study for many years. In 1992, 49% of all high school graduates were women prepared and interested in the computer science and engineering disciplines. Of the bachelor of science degrees awarded, only 31% went to women in these fields of study. Women represented only 28% of the master's degrees and 11% of the Ph.D.s awarded during that time. The following year, 1993, reported a drop of women earning B.S. degrees to 28%, with 27% and 14% of master's and Ph.Ds degrees awarded, respectively, to women.A panel of six discuss why women who are initially attracted to computer science bail out without completing degree requirements, most in the first two years of undergraduate study. The panelists present diverse positions as to why fewer women persevere and experimental efforts for increasing the retention rate among women. The action plans developed from the investigations include curriculum changes and support group activities. The panelists share feedback from surveys, program modifications, support group activities and personal experiences to provide a comprehensive view of the problem and possible solutions applicable to a wide range of environments. The panelists' positions follow.
