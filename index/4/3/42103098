This paper deals with stiffness analysis for effective peg-in/out-hole tasks using multifingered robot hand without inter-finger coupling. We first observe the fact that some coupling stiffness elements cannot be planned arbitrary. Then, we analyze the conditions of the specified stiffness matrix in the operational space to successfully and more effectively achieve the given peg-in/out-hole tasks. It is concluded that the location of compliance center on the peg and the coupling stiffness element between the translational and the rotational direction play important roles for successful peg-in/out-hole tasks. Simulation results are included to verify the feasibility of the analytic results.
