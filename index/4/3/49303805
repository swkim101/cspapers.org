Journaling of ext4 file system employs two FLUSH commands to make their data durable, even though the FLUSH is more expensive than the ordinary write operations. In this paper, to halve the number of FLUSH commands, we propose an efficient FTL, called OFTL, that completely ensures the write order of the journal data blocks in storage-level. For performance comparison, we implemented our OFTL on Jasmine OpenSSD and measured its performance with three different workloads. Our experimental results show that OFTL outperforms the up-to-date FTLs on the existing journaling modes by up to 1.97 times.
