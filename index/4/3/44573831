Network monitoring system is an important task for network administrator to monitor states of the operation of network devices, servers, network services, or network traffics. This task is often solved by setting-up a monitoring server and implement agents at monitored objects. This paper presents a solution to monitor Hot-IPs in high speed network at ISP side. It does not need to specify which objects should be monitored and also does not need to establish connections between the network monitoring system and these monitored servers or setup agents in these servers. This solution can be applied at ISP networks to reduce some risks on Internet network and early alert to customers. In proposed solution, Hot-IPs will be fast detected using Non-adaptive group testing and then transfer to monitor mode. At this mode, Hot-IPs are monitored to determine what is a risk and what is not.
