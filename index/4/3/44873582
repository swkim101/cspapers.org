In this paper, we consider a cognitive two-way relay system with multiple relay nodes and multiple primary receivers over Nakagami-m fading channels. Relay nodes process signal following selective decode-and-forward (DF) relay technique. The opportunistic relay selection is used to choose the best relay. We derive the exact closed-form expression of the overall outage probability over Nakagami-m fading channels. These analytical results are exactly verified by Monte-Carlo simulation.
