An array of transistors suitable for use in a read only memory includes a plurality of spaced apart first conductive lines insulated from a semiconductor substrate and a plurality of spaced apart second conductive lines insulated from the substrate and from the first lines and disposed to intersect the first lines. Diffusion regions formed in the substrate as current carrying electrodes are defined by the first and second lines. A plurality of spaced apart third conductive lines are arranged to intersect the first and second lines and to connect to the diffusion regions. When the array is used in a read only memory, selected transistors of the array are made to have a different threshold voltage than that of the remaining transistors and the first and second lines form word lines, the third lines form bit or sense and ground lines and the diffusion regions form the source and drain regions of the transistors, with each diffusion region serving up to four transistors or cells.
