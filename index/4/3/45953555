A computer science syllabus was designed for and taught to a group of gifted and talented high school students. A core course included segments on programming in LISP, software systems, digital hardware, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence. In addition, some students elected an independent programming project course. It was found that gifted pre-college students can be taught computer science, as opposed to merely computer programming.
