Contest activity can be staged in a wide variety of ways and the features of a contest design can be drawn from wide spectra of possibilities. The participants can be brought together for the contest or can stay home and send their programs to the contest; they can be from any level of expertise from high school student to professional programmer. A contest can reward producing a solution program in the shortest time or can be scored on bases like originality and program quality; it can focus upon any aspect of the programming process from algorithm synthesis to debugging or program modification.
 The panel will expose and explore the ranges of possible contest design features by describing the structures and workings of contests they have supervised. Each of the features mentioned above is represented in the contest experience of one or more members of this panel. The experiences gained in a diverse set of contests will be related to base a discussion of problems encountered and drawbacks noted as well as of strong points and alternative contest features that have been brought to mind but not yet tried out. The set of contests includes ACM's Regional and National Contests at the collegiate level for teams of four in a batch environment, team selection and training contests, an interactive BASIC contest for teams, the interactive individual contest at the 1977 NCC, a countywide contest for teams of high school students, and the well-established AEDS mail-in contest for secondary students.
