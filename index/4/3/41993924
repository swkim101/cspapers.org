C o n t e m p o r a r y S y n t a c t i c T h e o r i e s Pe te r Sells University o/California, Santa Cruz This tutorial will examine some recent developments in theoretical syntax centered in, or stemming from, work in Government-Binding Theory, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, and Lexical-Functional Grammar. I will try to explain the linguistic motivations for the proposals I will discuss, and also convergences among the theories. Little in the way of background will be assumed, beyond a rudimentary knowledge of phrase structure grammars and basic transformational mechanisms (movement, deletion, etc.). T e x t P r o c e s s i n g S y s t e m s Mar tha Palmer , Lyne t te Hirschman, and Deborah Dahl Unisys Defense Systems This tutorial will cover issues in text processing, focusing on the current state-of-the-art in text processing, the applications of text processing, the architecture of a text-processing system (using the Unisys PUNDIT system as an exampie), issues of portability and extenslbility, and Issues relating to large-scale computational linguistics projects. The section on system architecture will describe a modular architecture, with components that handle syntax, semantics and pragmatics, emphasizing the importance of segregating domain-specific and domain-independent data. We will then discuss, in the context of recent experiences with the PUNDIT system, the issue of portability across domains and the tools that support bringing up an application in a new domain. We will also look at the problems associated with building a large natural language processing system: how to integrate people with a variety of backgrounds (computer science, linguistics), how to manage and maintain a large system, and how to do development in multiple domains simultaneously. We will conclude with a survey of text-processing systems, comparing their strengths and weaknesses as related to their particular goals. N a t u r a l L a n g u a g e G e n e r a t i o n David McDonald Brattle Research Corporation This tutorial will take participants through the workings of a complete, albeit very simple, generation system from the underlying conceptual representation to the surface morphology. This mini-system, which uses a "direct replacement" algorithm, would be quite satisfactory for the demands of most present expert systems; its weaknesses will be used to motivate the research that is going on in generation today. The major themes of that research will be surveyed, concentrating on the rationales behind the adoption of specific frameworks, such as systemic, unification, or tree adjoining grammar. Illustrations will be taken from current and historically important systems. Emphasis will be on generation as a planning and construction process which has markedly different concerns and issues from language understanding, and on how this has led to the approaches generation researchers are taking today. E f f i c i e n t P a r s i n g A l g o r i t h m s Masaru T o m i t a Carnegie-Mellon University Parsing efficiency is crucial when building practical natural language systems. This is especially the case for interactive applications such as natural language database access, interfaces to expert systems and interactive machine translation. This tutorial covers several et~icient context-free parsing algorithms, including chart parsing, Earley's algorithm, LR parsing and the generalized LR algorithm. Augmentation to the context-free parsing algorithms is also discussed, to handle unification-based grammar formalisms such as Lexical-Functional Grammar, Functional Unification Grammar, and Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar.
