PEARL is an AI language developed with space and time efficiencies in mind. In addition to providing the usual facilities such as slot-filler objects, demons and associative data bases, PEARL introduces stronger typing on slots, user-assisted hashing mechanisms, and a forest of data bases. The resulting product is a simple, but powerful and efficient tool for AI research.
