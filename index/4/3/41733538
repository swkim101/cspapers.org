It is well understood and has been well documented that there is much to gain by using live projects, those that serve a real client with a real problem to solve, in the computer science classroom. However the use of live projects has always come with a variety of obstacles including providing support for the project once it is complete and limiting the scope of a project to the context of a single term. This paper describes the development of the Small Project Support Center at Radford University that has been designed to eliminate these obstacles.
