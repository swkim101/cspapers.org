In a sudden push for at-home learning, various simulation programs have been created to allow students to explore academic concepts in a variety of fields. But computer scientists are still forced to rely on trial-and-error test cases when trying to understand a tricky piece of code. In this poster the author reports on the results of a novel web-based educational tool that teaches coding through logical reasoning. Students are challenged to postulate symbolic relationships between generalized parameters within example code, and the tool evaluates the correctness and relevance of these answers within the context. Students may take comfort that their knowledge of the topic is comprehensive since the verification process takes into account all possible edge cases for parameter values.
