— Robot manipulation tasks can be subdivided into Manipulation Primitives —a promising concept that is being studied since three decades. Although the basic theory shows great potential to let robots perform useful manipulation tasks in human environments, we can hardly ﬁnd successful implementations. To realize highly reactive sensor-guided and sensor-guarded robot behaviors, Manipulation Primitives consist of three fundamental parts: (1) a controller reference frame, (2) a set of feedback controllers and set-points, and (3) a termination condition. This paper describes, how stable and continuous robot motion control behaviors can be achieved during abrupt transitions of Manipulation Primitives. The core idea is based on an On-Line Trajectory Generation algorithm that generates set-points for multiple lower-level controllers from arbitrary states of motion within one control cycle (typically less than one millisecond). This features gives robot manipulation control systems the ability to very rapidly switch controllers, and to permit non-zero controller accelerations at start-up. Simulation and real-world experimental results are shown to underline the relevance for robot manipulation tasks.
