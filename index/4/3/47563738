A float glass forming chamber with electrical heating means is provided with a plurality of compact housings to enclose electrical connections, thereby avoiding the conventional overhead plenum chamber. Also, a gas-tight casing directly overlying the roof elements serves to minimize the volume of the overhead structure. Both features reduce condensation and drippage of volatile materials within the chamber and improve access to forming chamber elements.
