Knowledge A c q . 1 : Fox 313 INTRODUCTION We demonstrate how the use of domain dependent knowledge can reduce the combinatorics of learn ing s t r u c t u r a l descri.pt ions, using as an example the creat ion of a l t e r n a t i v e pronunciat ions from examples of spoken words. B r i e f l y , c e r t a i n learn ing problems (Winston, 19 70; Fox & HayesRoth, 19 76) can be solved by present ing to a learn ing program exemplars ( t r a i n i n g data) representat ive of a c lass . The program constructs a cha rac te r i s t i c representat ion (Cl<) of the class that best f i t s the t r a i n i n g data. Learning can be viewed as search in the space of representa t ions . Applied to complex domains the search is h igh ly combinator ia l due to the: 1) Number of a l t e r n a t i v e CRs. 2) Size of t r a i n i n g se t . 3) Size of the exemplars.
