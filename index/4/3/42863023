In 1975 the authors began an undergraduate computer science major and devised a one year foundation course as the basic building block of this major. The dual objectives of this foundation course are explained; an easily accessible minicomputer environment for interactive FORTRAN program development work in this course is also described. As the authors now look back to 1975 the difficulties, positive results, and development of the foundation course content are considered. In addition, an upgrading of the minicomputer environment for the course to a PRIME 300 Timesharing Minicomputer is explained; students in the foundation course are now also able to do their ANS 74 COBOL program development work in an easily accessible, interactive environment.
