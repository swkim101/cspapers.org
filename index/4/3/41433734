A frequency reconfigurable Planar Inverted-F Antenna (RPIFA) antenna is proposed. From an initial 8-shape patch antenna by connecting or disconnecting one or more PIN diode, ten different structures are obtained. Corresponding to ten different geometries such as I-shape patch, U-shape patch, E-shape patch, etc, the antenna can be tuned in two frequency bands from 2GHz to 3GHz and from 4GHz to 7GHz. The novel RPIFA antenna is designed and optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and then it is implemented on FR4 substrate. The simulation and measurement results of antenna parameters are compared to show the performance of the developed antenna.
