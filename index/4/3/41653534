XQuery is the XML query language currently under development in the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). XQuery specifications have been published in a series of W3C working drafts, and several reference implementations of the language are already available on the Web. If successful, XQuery has the potential to be one of the most important new computer languages to be introduced in several years. This tutorial will provide an overview of the syntax and semantics of XQuery, as well as insight into the principles that guided the design of the language.
