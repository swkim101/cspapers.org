ASSIST is a high-speed assembler/interpreter system for IBM System/360 and related computers. It is designed primarily for efficient processing of student jobs, and offers a number of educational features. ASSIST is now being used at a number of installations under widely varying circumstances. This paper analyzes the design process and decisions leading to ASSIST, concentrating on the factors felt to be most important to its usage. Implementation problems and experiences are noted, and conclusions drawn from them regarding the design of student job processors and desired operating system facilities to support them.
