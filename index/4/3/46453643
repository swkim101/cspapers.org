This paper aims to numerically propose a modern light power divider, operating at optical communication wavelength λ = 1.55 µm having unique feature on equality of two throughputs with asymmetrical structure. As a result, the divider has high potential for integrating into high-density optical circuits. Based on the analysis of dispersion and calculation of wave-vector k of electromagnetic fields, we produce a simple configuration, comprising two defect points, one defect line, and one reflex mirror, for equally dividing light power inside the asymmetrical divider. Simulated results by the Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method show a good performance with transmittance of over 98% for both TE and TM waves.
