In a large number of fingerprint database, the na√Øve way to identify a person is to match the query image with all entries of the database. To speed up this processing, exclusive classification assigns each fingerprint into one of several subgroups. Thus the query image only needs to compare with the images in one subgroup. While exclusive classification is hard because of small inter-class variability and the large intra-class variability. And it is not so efficient as well due to the small number of classes and non-uniform distribution.
