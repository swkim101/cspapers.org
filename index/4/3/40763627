Currently, many specialized tools for monitoring and control of sensor networks are existing and being used separately. In this paper, an architecture of a component-based tool, named WiSeCoMaSys, is presented to integrate data monitoring from sensor networks, visualization, measurements and network management in a unique system. WiSeCoMaSys helps developers to debug their network deployments easily in many scenarios. Meanwhile, users can change a variety of parameters at any layer of the sensor node architecture to respond to network changes or optimize the performance. Moreover, statistic functionalities are also integrated in this tool to measure and evaluate the real time status of the entire network. With a completely integrated architecture, WiSeCoMaSys is a promising tool to interact with sensor networks visually in many sensing applications.
