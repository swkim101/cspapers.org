For three years, teams of Minnesota science, mathematics and technology teachers learned to use computational science in Envision It! under a National Science Foundation grant. Two cadres of middle, junior high and high school teachers participated in intensive summer institutes, school-year follow-up sessions and electronic networking.The instructional design and delivery team for Envision It! was a powerful collaboration of professionals from non-profit and for-profit organizations in Minnesota: Metro ECSU (post-service teacher development organization); Cray Research (supercomputer company); TIES (educational information technology support organization); Anoka-Hennepin School District (large urban/suburban school district); additional staff from several Minnesota colleges and high tech corporations (Cray Research, Medtronic, 3M, Honeywell, and others).Participating teachers learned much through Envision It!, but the training team learned even more. In this paper we share some of these learnings: what worked, what didn't work, why, and what modifications aided teacher success and application.
