In order to improve long-term retention, ad conversion rates, and so on, A/B testing has become the norm within Web portals, enabling efficient large-scale experimentation. While A/B testing is also increasingly used by academic researchers (with crowd-working platforms offering a large pool of artificial users), few platforms are freely available to this end. Academic researchers usually develop adhoc solutions, leading to many duplicated efforts and time spent on work not directly related to one's research. As an alternative, we have developed and open sourced APONE, an A cademic P latform for ON line Experiments. APONE uses PlanOut, a framework and high-level language, to specify online experiments, and offers Web services and a Web GUI to easily create, manage and monitor them. By building a user friendly Web application, we enable not only experts to conduct valid A/B experiments. In particular as a secondary use case, we envision large classrooms to also benefit from the deployment of APONE, a vision we put into practice in a graduate Information Retrieval course. We open-source APONE at https://marrerom.github.io/APONE. A demo version is running at http://ireplatform.ewi.tudelft.nl:8080/APONE.
