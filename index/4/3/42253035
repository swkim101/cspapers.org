This project describes an experimental course on open source software construction. The course has two twists on the standard project-based software construction course. The first twist is simple: all projects are developed and released on GitHub. The second twist is more radical: the course uses an "open source textbook." The textbook is hosted in a git repository that students are required to contribute to throughout the term. Contributions range from minor typo fixes to adding entire chapters. Currently, 88% of the textbook is written by students, including many of the assignments. We use student surveys, participation in social networking sites like GitHub, and web traffic logs to determine that these assignments had a positive effect on students' future contributions to the open source community.
