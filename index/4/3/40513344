This panel addresses the teaching of software development methods in undergraduate computer science and software engineering programs. Specifically, the panel focuses on the teaching of Extreme Programming (XP), which is one of the agile software development methods that have received much attention in the last decade. Following its origins in the industrial sector, XP has been explored in computer science and software engineering education, especially in educator symposiums that have been instituted in conferences on agile methods (e.g., [2]). This panel aims at discussing, together with the SIGCSE community, why and how to teach software development methods in general and XP in particular. Since the teaching of XP is discussed in this panel with respect to different courses, we believe that the panel is relevant for all SIGCSE members.
