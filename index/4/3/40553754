In this paper a new method for continuous tuning of the oscillation frequency is presented. The system is based on an optically tunable phase shifter obtained by controlling the current feeding a SOA. A variation of about 500 kHz has been obtained showing the feasibility of this method. An application could be a simple modulation technique in case of radio over fiber system.
