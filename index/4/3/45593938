A simple, model free computer vision program to determine the locations of non-overlapping parts on belt conveyors is described. This program illustrates a simple and effective procedure for segmenting objects from background in instances where simple thresholding of a gray-level image does not suffice. The procedure consists of a unique sequence of standard image enhancement processes. The resultant image exhibits silhouettes of the objects, which contain sufficient information for locating those parts whose orientation can be determined without observation of internal features. The technique has been implemented on a large research computer, as well as a mini-computer coupled to a prototype belt conveyor-robot arm part transfer system. The technique has been validated for a large variety of parts and belt surfaces. It can meet production rates and has the potential for actual production use.
