IDT is an intelligent hardware diagnostic tool that has been successfully used to identify faults in PDP 11/03 computers. It selects and executes tests, and interprets the results. IDT is able to modify its test selection strategy on the basis of results of previous tests as well as opinions offered to it by the user. Symbolic formulas are used to represent the relationship between the test results and the broken equipment. If we assume that there is only one broken component, then set operations can be shown to be sufficiently general for combining the results of multiple tests.
