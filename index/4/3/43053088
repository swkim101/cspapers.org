In this paper we present a packaged actuator to be applied for micro- and macro- robotic applications. The actuator is based on polymer dielectrics, and intrinsically has muscle-like characteristics capable of performing motions such as forward/backward/controllable compliance. The actuator is featured in several aspects such as simplicity and lightness in weight, cost-effectiveness, multiple DOF-actuation, and digital interface. In this paper, its basic concepts are briefly introduced and the issues about design, fabrication and applications are discussed.
