The advent of ubiquitous, context aware computing has made the problem of choosing how to present information to the user significantly more complex. The designer must consider the level of detail and abstraction determined by the physical form factor, the integration of information from other external and communicated information sources (and representations), and the use of represented information in collaborative acts and communications. Furthermore, it is a design decision which must be made in the context of the wider development process. In this paper, we re-evaluate the processes and models with which we can choose information representations, and put forward a framework based on the Resources Model. We consider how this can be done while obtaining leverage from modeling and requirements analysis effort carried out for other parts of the system development.
