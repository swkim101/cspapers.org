This paper proposes a new visualization and reification framework for the integrated interactive access and reuse of both database records and Web contents including services. Our framework has integrated the database visualization and reification framework and the Web application wrapping framework. The Web application wrapping framework allows users to specify arbitrary HTML nodes on an arbitrary Web page to work as IO ports called slots, and to wrap this page to work as a 2D meme media object. Our new framework introduces a 3D proxy meme media object for a wrapped Web application, and allows users to register such a proxy object as a record reification template in database visualization and reification framework.
