Human beings utilize a whole body motion such as weight shift to generate a large force while doing heavy works. Momentum is harnessed to increase an action force to the object. This paper discusses whole body cooperative motions of a humanoid robot for heavy works and the static stability during the motion. Pushing a wall and twisting a valve are taken as examples of heavy works in this study. Several whole body motion patterns are examined using a dynamic simulator, which efficiently solves dynamic equations of serial rigid body system using an O(n) algorithm. Static stability is evaluated through simulation results that include external force, joint torques, position of the center of gravity and ZMP, etc.
