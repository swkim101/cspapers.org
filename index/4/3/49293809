In this work, for the first time, we investigate Electro-Magnetic (EM) attacks on GPU-based AES implementation. In detail, we first sample EM traces using a delicate trigger; then, we build a heuristic leakage model and a novel leakage model to exploit the simultaneous EM leakages in parallel scenarios. After that, we evaluate the effectiveness of EM attacks on GPU-based AES implementation. Our evaluation results show that GPU-based AES implementation is vulnerable to EM attacks. This work also suggests that GPU-based AES implementation needs to be protected against EM attacks in real scenarios.
