This paper deals with the reduction of the ADM1 using the “state-variable association” method, to calibrate a simple model of microalgae anaerobic digestion (the MAD model). In simulation, we show that the behavior of the calibrated MAD model and of the ADM1 are identical. Using experimental data, the calibrated MAD model predicts well the real behavior of the digestion of a substrate composed of Chlorella vulgaris. Our study highlights the effectiveness of the adopted approach to provide, from complex phenomenological models, a reduced one, that can then be used for control and optimization purposes.
