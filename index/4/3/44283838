Conference time-tables provide information that is indispensable for all attendees. Since there are a lot of reusable data structures and tasks, we have designed the Conference TimeTable Management (CTTM) system, which is intended to be used as a reusable component in a large diversity of conference Web sites. CTTM features a flexible concept for timetables and provides users with personalization and notification services.
