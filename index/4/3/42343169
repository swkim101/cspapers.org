Mobile phone programming can provide teens an authentic and engaging hook into computer science. With App Inventor, developed by Google and moved to MIT, programming Android apps is as easy as clicking blocks together. App Inventor has been used successfully in after school programs, roadshows, summer camps, teacher workshops, and computer science classrooms from middle school through college. Participants will get an overview of App Inventor including project ideas and sample student code, hear outreach planning suggestions, write programs, develop outreach plans, and see how the Java Bridge helps transition from App Inventor to Java. Please bring a laptop with App Inventor. Even the most time-stretched professor or teacher can encourage students in computer science with App Inventor.
