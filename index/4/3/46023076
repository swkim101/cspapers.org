Scilab is a comprehensive scientific package freely distributed by INRIA. This paper presents the design and implementation of a fuzzy logic toolbox based on Scilab, which allows the user to solve his control problem using fuzzy logic with very little effort. The fuzzy logic toolbox is written in the Scilab language and Tcl/TK. It provides complete functions for inference, an easy to use graphical editor for building complex models of fuzzy logic systems, and a simulator for Scicos. Applications of fuzzy in systems and control, and the use of fuzzy toolbox are illustrated by a simple example
