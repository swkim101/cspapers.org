The authors discuss the specifications for constructing an ultra-micromanipulator system, and develop such a system under 3-D SEM observation using a joy-stick mechanism, with which an operator can deal with things smaller than 1 /spl mu/m. It is called a nanorobot system. Some experimental results giving knowledge about the difference between nanometer world and the macroscopic world are reported.
