In a handful of years only, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems have become an integral part of the Internet. After a few key successes related to music-sharing (e.g., Napster or Gnutella), they rapidly developed and are nowadays firmly established in various contexts, ranging from large-scale content distribution (Bit Torrent) to Internet telephony(Skype) or networking platforms (JXTA). The main idea behind P2P is to leverage on the power of end-computers: Instead of relying on central components (e.g., servers), services are powered by decentralized overlay architectures where end-computers connect to each other dynamically.
