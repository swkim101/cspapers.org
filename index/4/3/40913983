In several file systems, the data in a file is described by constructing lists of records. Each list contains exactly those records for which some property is true. The motivation for constructing and maintaining these lists is to facilitate the processing of retrieval requests -- in many situations only a subset of the file need be searched in order to determine those records from which information is to be retrieved.When each list is ordered (by, for example, the addresses of the records which occur on it) efficient retrieval algorithms may be devised. Specifically, we shall develop retrieval algorithms for inverted files and multilist files. The algorithms can be used to determine exactly those records which occur on a Boolean expression of lists. These algorithms are controlled by a "trace function" which is used iteratively to select the next candidate.
