The Logic Design System (LDS) is a set of FORTRAN Computer programs that convert Boolean equations and component descriptions into logic diagrams, parts lists, board layouts, wiring lists, and diagnostic data. This system decreases the cost of digital design work and eliminates errors that could be introduced by manual methods. More important, it reduces lead time and frees the designer for creative tasks. It does not yet perform printed circuit routing or artwork generation, although these packages are presently under design.
 The logic designer can use this tool without trying to describe his problem to a professional programmer. The system input is a free-form, problem oriented language that is readily learned by a designer, and is powerful enough to handle any design.
 The Logic Design System has been constructed to avoid built in hardware obsolesence. The designer can select parts from a library of standard components and integrated circuits, or specify tailor-made modules consisting of integrated circuit configurations that may repeat many times in the same combination to suit the individual designer's needs. The LDS is compatible with the use of both MSI/LSI logic elements.
