This paper describes a new style of programming, called "fill-in-the-form" programming, for the development of interactive database applications. The applications being developed and the application development environment use the same form and menu interface. High level tools are provided to define interfaces for database query/update and for generating reports or graphs. Our experiences with two Systems that are based on this programming paradigm are described.
