The viewing system parameters probably have to be explicitly taken into consideration in formulating computational solutions to the stereoscopic matching problem in binocular vision. An algorithm for computing the directions of gaze from purely visual information without a prior solution to the correspondence problem is outlined. It would seem that the availability of such (or similar) algorithm is a precondition for any stereo matching process using the epipolar constraint.
