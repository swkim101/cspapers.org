Today’s systems have become more and more complex and dynamic. The concept of complex dynamic systems (CDS) arises in many scientific fields, technological areas and everyday’s problems. The fundamental basics of complex dynamic systems are briefly presented and discussed. Modelling and controlling complex dynamic systems is a very difficult and challenging task. Different modelling approaches basically focus on the interaction between (microscopic) subsystems and the emergence of new qualities at the (macroscopic) system level. However, these models are not sufficient to describe the dynamic behavior of these systems. The need for new advanced and innovative approaches is justified. Theories of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps are proposed and mathematically formulated as a new way to model and control complex dynamic systems. Examples for modelling CDS are given and the obtained results are promising in provided a useful solution to many problems of CDS. Certain drawbacks and inefficiencies of FCM are described and certain solutions to overcome these drawbacks are given. Conclusions are given and future research directions are provided.
