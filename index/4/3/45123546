The purpose of this paper is to describe a senior level course in the applied computer science curriculum at Northern Illinois University. The course, Database and Data Communications, has been taught for four semesters, and enrollment has steadily grown.
 The course has a number of purposes. The primary one is to acquaint students with the principles of modern database management and teleprocessing applications and to instill proficiency in the writing of application programs for at least two of the major software systems supporting such applications, IBM's Information Management System (IMS) and Customer Information Control System (CICS). A secondary purpose is to consolidate and extend knowledge and techniques learned in previous courses. Course content which fulfills this purpose includes structured programming in both assembler language and COBOL, applied data structures, and access methods not previously covered (BDAM and VSAM).
