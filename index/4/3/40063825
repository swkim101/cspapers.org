Simulations that model in detail complex interactions in complex environments are now possible, and visualization is a uniquely powerful analysis tool. However, visualization features of simulation codes are typically intended for scientists designing simulations, providing little support for presenting simulation results in a form suitable for non-experts. Conversely, graphics software and hardware progress has been fueled by applications where precisely abiding by the laws of physics is of secondary importance compared to visual realism.This half-day tutorial presents an approach for state-of-the-art visualization of simulation data based on connecting the worlds of computer simulation and computer animation. Concretely, the attendees will learn how to simplify, import, and integrate the simulation data into the surrounding scene, with examples from our simulation of the September 11 Attack on the Pentagon. The resulting realistic visualization enables effective dissemination of simulation results, and helps simulations reach their full potential for high societal impact.
