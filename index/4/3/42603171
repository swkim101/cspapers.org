This paper discusses the objectives of a microcomputer laboratory established to support the Computer Science programmes at McMaster University. Three objectives are identified:
 1. To serve as the means of reinforcing the understanding of fundamental computer concepts by students;
 2. To enable faculty, staff, and students in any university department to learn about microcomputers and how microcomputers can be used to provide a solution of their problems;
 3. To provide facilities for high-school students and teachers to become familiar with microcomputers and their impact on society as well as for bringing “computer literacy” to the community at large.
 The equipment purchased for the microcomputer laboratory is described and future plans are outlined.
