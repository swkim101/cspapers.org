This paper is concerned with the problem of introducing user-defined heuristic control over the deduction process in a knowledge based system. Control information is seen as being just another piece of data, separated from the knowledge base the use of which it controls and from the theorem prover. A declarative approach to control expression was retained. Control information is embedded in user's metarules taken from the metalanguage presented in this paper. This metalanguage and a theorem prover interpreting it have been implemented. Examples of its use are given and discussed.
