Recently, there have been considerable interests in the multiprocessor job scheduling problem, in which a job can be processed in parallel on one of seveml alternative subsets of processors. In this paper, (I polynomial time approximation scheme is presented for the problem in which the number of processors in the system is a fixed constant. This result is the best possible because of the strong NP-hardness of the problem, and is a significant improvement cwer the past results: the best previous resuit was an appmzimation algorithm of ratio 716 + E for 3-processor systems, based on Goemansâ€™ algorithm for a restricted version of the problem.
