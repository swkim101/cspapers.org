A system, called GAP, which automatically produces LISP functions from example computations is described. GAP uses a knowledge of LISP programming to inductively infer the LISP function 'obviously' intended by a given 'iopair' (i.e. a single input to be presented to the function and the output which must result). The system is written in POPCORN (a CONNIVER-like extension of POP2) and represents its knowledge of LISP procedurally.
