Tandemâ€™s Data Mining Server (DMS) is a parallel data engine designed to enable data mining tools to store, access and analyse high volumes of data very efficiently. In contrast to traditional database management systems, data structures are optimized for analysis and pattern recognition, rather than for accessing individual rows. The data stored in DMS tables are encoded automatically, so the required disk space is typically 3 to 5 times less than the raw data size. This approach not only minimizes disk space and disk access time, it enables the majority of processing to be done in memory.
