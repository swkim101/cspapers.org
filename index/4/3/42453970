The vision system described below has the aim of recognizing objects on the plane by means of the binary information of their contour. The object's description consist of a sequence of curvatures which is obtained by contour tracking. The recognizing process is based on the measure of similitude between sequences corresponding to the analized object and to models memorized in a previous training phase. The vision system consists of a specialized circuit allowing the obtention of the object contour using a gradient operator, and a low cost microcomputer which is able to recognize the object and to calculate its orientation.
