Data warehousing is an essential element of decision support systems, which have become the largest growing segment of the database industry. Many products and services are now available, and all of the leading database vendors now have commercial offerings in these technologies. Very large (multiterabyte) data warehouses are being built and successfully deployed in the telecommunications, financial, retail and other industries, and are now routinely being used for on-line analytical processing and other decision support applications. Many organisations are deriving major operational benefits from the use of data warehousing solutions.
