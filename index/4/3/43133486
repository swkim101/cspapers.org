It is shown that the Hyper de Bruijn graph can be used for interconnection networks and a suitable structure for parallel computation, VLSI. Recent works have classified Hyper de Bruijn based routing algorithms into local routing and DeadLock-Free routing. However, their routing algorithms can only work in binary Hyper de Bruijn network. In this paper, we investigate on high degree of Hyper de Bruijn network which called Hyper de Bruijn Aster (HD*) network and shortest path routing algorithm on HD* (in the condition of none existing failure). Our fault tolerant properties and shortest path routing algorithm are proved to have the best performance among routing algorithms in Hyper-de Bruijn network. (Abstract)
