All current network mobility management protocols such as NEMO, NPMIPv6 which provide seamless Internet access on vehicles are based on a central mobility anchor. These protocols suffer several big issues such as a single point of failure, long handover delay and scalability. Mobile network is evolving toward a flat architecture and distributed schemes are researching for the purpose of replacing current centralized schemes. In this paper, we survey existing network mobility management schemes and propose a distributed scheme to support mobile networks in vehicular scenarios and in flat network architecture. Our new architecture takes advantages of distributed mobility management, meanwhile provide Internet access to users on vehicles in efficient manner. By numerical analysis, we show that our new scheme improves existing network mobility schemes in term of handover latency.
