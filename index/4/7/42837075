Receiving push notifications is one of the key features of smartwatches. In our recent measurement study involving 27 smartwatch users [1], we found that push notifications are used by more than 200 applications, dominated by instant messaging, emails, social media, etc. In this work, we propose a suite of methods to optimize the performance, energy efficiency, and usability of smartwatch push notifications, which have several salient features distinguishing them from regular notifications received on a smartphone: requiring heavy phonewatch cooperation, being delivered over short-range Bluetooth link, and incurring non-trivial energy consumption on watches with very limited battery capacity. Considering these factors, our proposed work focuses on four aspects as elaborated.
