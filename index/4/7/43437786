Designing the user interface for an interactive computer application is a difficult task and by no means an exact science. Experience has taught many designers that interfaces based exclusively upon intuition, artifacts, or even existing design principles often have poor usability, Fortunately, several empirical methods exist that, when applied, nearly always improve usability. Collecting input from users throughout the design process, rapid prototyping and other iterative design techniques, formal usability testing, and integrated design are now proven methods for assuring good user interfaces. In the years since Gould & Lewis’s “Designing for Usability” paper [2], evidence for the value of these methods has been steadily accumulating. Refinements and extensions of their “key principles” continue to appear at this conference and eksewhere in the CHI Literature. They have made their way into handbooks and textbooks, and are taught in the human factors curncuium.
