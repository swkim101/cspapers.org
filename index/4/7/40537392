This paper aims at developing the force-guided microassembly technology with in-situ PVDF piezoelectric force sensing and control. By using the designed force sensors with the effective signal processing techniques, the micro contact force/impact signal and its derivative can be extracted and processed. Furthermore, based on a new sensor-referenced control scheme, micro mirrors can be reliably assembled by regulating the micro contact force. Experimental results verify the performance of the developed micro force sensing and control system. Ultimately the technology will provide a critical and major step towards the development of automated manufacturing processes for batch assembly of micro devices.
