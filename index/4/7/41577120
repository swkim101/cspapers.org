This paper describes advanced control methods using virtual reality technology for solving the problems of guiding endoscopes and surgical instruments in minimally invasive surgery. The paper examines how the design of these instruments could be modified for integrating these control methods. Finally, the workstation used at the IPA for evaluating these concepts is presented.<<ETX>>
