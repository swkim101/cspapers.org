The basic structure of the Multi-Band Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) System is discussed in this paper. The fixed-point simulation platform using the WiMedia Alliance proposed by ECMA 368 standards has been implemented. An extension of the physical layer using the Alamouti method to a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system is also presented. Based on the theoretical Dual Carrier Modulation (DCM) supported by Media Alliance, we propose a scheme of the DCM-Modulation and DCM-Demodulation with Soft-decoding for a MB-OFDM MIMO system. The system performance is analyzed using the Saleh-Valenzuela channel model in terms of the bits error rate and the transmission range for indoor environments.
