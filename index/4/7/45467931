A fast triangulation photoelectric range scanner is proposed that uses an array of LED chips and a lateral-effect position-sensing detector. The essential advantages of the scanner are construction without any moving parts, small size, good stability, and low cost. A range map is obtained by means of fast electronic scanning of the chips in the integrated LED array. The operating principle of the scanner is illustrated, and the development of the theoretical model for the scanner and its simulation results are presented. An approach for designing a sensor prototype is also briefly reported.
