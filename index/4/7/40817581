The sensor fusion architecture is a General-purpose Aggregation Processor (GAP) designed to bridge the gap between low-level sensor data and the high-level knowledge needed by the backbone. By examining both the incoming data from attached sensor nodes and the interests of users on the network, the model reduces overall transmission costs by keeping local event information at the source, only reporting the higher-level alerts and knowledge to interested parties. The sensor fusion architecture possesses three distinct advantages worth noting.
