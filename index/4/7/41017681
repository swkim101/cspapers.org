Dozens of online communities have been developed to support high school computer science (CS) teachers by providing them with CS teaching resources. However, these sites have failed to meet teachers' needs and are widely underused. Despite this underutilization, organizations continue to create new communities with content that overlaps with the materials provided within existing communities. Our research explores the barriers to CS teachers' engagement with online resources and their attitudes toward online communities. We find that teachers are frustrated by the time and difficulty required to navigate the sites and find useful information. It appears the barriers to accessing these resources cannot be overcome by creating additional large, multipurpose communities. Even though it seems that having large communities would be valuable for increasing access to resources, our research indicates teachers prefer smaller, more specialized communities. We are eager to discuss ideas for designing new communities that provide more relevant content for teachers in a way that is easy for them to find.
