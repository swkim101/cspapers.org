As more data processing functions are integrated into systems-on-chip, data path is becoming a critical part of the whole VLSI design. However, traditional physical design methodology can not satisfy the data path performance requirement because it has no knowledge of the data path bit-sliced structure. In this paper, an Abstract Physical Model (APM) is proposed to extract bit-slice regularity information from Data Flow Graph (DFG) and it is used for interconnect and congestion planning. A two step heuristic algorithm is introduced to optimize the linear placement of APM to satisfy both the wire length and routing track budget.
