 
 In this demo we present a semantic framework for innovation and patent analytics powered by Mined Semantic Analysis (MSA). Our framework provides cognitive assistance to its users through a Web-based visual and interactive interface. First, we describe building a conceptual knowledge graph by mining user-generated encyclopedic textual corpus for semantic associations. Then, we demonstrate applying the acquired knowledge to support many cognition and knowledge based use cases for innovation analysis including technology exploration and landscaping, competitive analysis, literature and prior art search and others.
