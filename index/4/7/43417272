We present an extensible java-based platform for contextual retrieval based on the probabilistic information retrieval model. Modules for dual indexes, relevance feedback with blind or machine learning approaches and query expansion with context are integrated into the Okapi system to deal with the contextual information. This platform allows easy extension to include other types of contextual information.
