The present paper deals with a signal separation technique, which can be applied, to the ears of robots. When we want a robot to recognize a desired signal in a situation where there are some noises (undesired signals), there exists such a case that the robot cannot recognize the desired signal. In this case, one must consider of separating the desired signal from the mixtures of it and the undesired signals. In the present paper, we propose a method in which such a separation problem can be solved. Experimental results show that our proposed method can solve successfully the signal separation problem.
