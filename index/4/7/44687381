In this paper, we propose a collision detection system based on a nonlinear adaptive impedance control law. The collision detection detects collisions of a manipulator with its environment without using external sensors. The adaptive impedance control law is employed to estimate the dynamic parameters of the manipulators, and allows the manipulator to have interaction with its environment. The system detects collisions based on the difference between the actual input torque to the manipulator and the reference input torque, which is calculated based on the estimated parameters of the manipulator dynamics. The manipulator stops when a collision detection system is implemented in an industrial manipulator and experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed system.
