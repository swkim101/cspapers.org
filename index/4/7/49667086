We present the vision of BARNET (Backscattering Activity Recognition NEtwork of Tags), a network of passive RF tags that use RF backscatter for tag-to-tag communication. BARNET not only provides identification of tagged objects but also can serve as a 'device-free' activity recognition system. BARNET's key innovation is the concept of backscatter channel state information (BCSI) which can be measured via systematic multiphase probing of the backscatter tag-to-tag channel using innovative processing on the passive tags. So far such measurements were only possible using active radio receivers that consume much higher power. Changes in BCSI provide signatures for different activities in the environment that can be learned using suitable machine learning tools. We develop the BARNET tag architecture which shows that an ASIC implementation can run on harvested RF power. We develop a printed circuit board (PCB) prototype using discrete components to evaluate activity recognition performance. We show that the prototype can recognize human daily activities with an average error around 6%. Overall, BARNET uses passive tags to achieve the same level of performance as systems that use powered, active radios.
