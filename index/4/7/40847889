A process for the production of a catalyst based on a crystalline aluminosilicate having a silica to alumina molar ratio greater than 12:1 which is obtained by mixing a source of silica, a source of alumina, a source of alkali metal, water and a source of ammonium ions in defined proportions, crystallizing the mixture, recovering the crystalline aluminosilicate so-formed, cation-exchanging and/or impregnating the recovered crystalline aluminosilicate and finally calcining, wherein either the recovered crystalline aluminosilicate or the cation-exchanged aluminosilicate or the impregnated aluminosilicate is washed with a solution containing either an organic base, a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, a glycol, a phenol or an ester. The washing treatment results in a reduction in the rate of decline in catalytic activity in reactions such as the conversion of aliphatic to aromatic hydrocarbons.
