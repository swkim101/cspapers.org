Examples play a crucial role in automated theorem proving, not only as counterexamples to help prune unproductive subgoals, but also to help guide proof discovery. In this paper we show how examples (interpretations) might be used to help determine Instantiations of set variables. We also discuss the role of piecewise-linear continuous functions, and give some results of computer runs using these methods.
