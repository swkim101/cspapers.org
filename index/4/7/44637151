We show how recently-defined abstract models of the Branch & Bound algorithm can be used to obtain information on how the nodes are distributed in B&B search trees. This can be directly exploited in the form of probabilities in a sampling algorithm given by Knuth that estimates the size of a search tree. This method reduces the offline estimation error by a factor of two on search trees from MixedInteger Programming instances.
