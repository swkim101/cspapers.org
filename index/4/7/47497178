A survey of undergraduate software engineering courses was conducted. The survey covered the issues of course level, course content, course organization, project characteristics and department demographics. The descriptive statistics show that the typical course focuses on the software development life cycle and includes a project intended for actual use. The project is carried out by teams of students, with student leaders. The issues of suitable textbooks, staffing, obtaining suitable software and sources of materials and training for teaching user-interface design surfaced as problem areas.
