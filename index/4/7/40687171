A computer program has been developed for automatically producing least cost designs for welded plate girders meeting the requirements of the 1969 “Specification for the Design, Fabrication and Erection of Structural Steel for Buildings” of the American Institute of Steel Construction. Girder loading may consist of a uniform load and concentrated loads. Flange and web plate dimensions, bearing and intermediate stiffener dimensions and locations are produced, as required, for spans with unsymmetric loading. In addition, for spans with symmetric loading, a flange splice location and the reduced flange thickness at the ends of the span may be produced if the most economical girder is obtained by splicing the flange. Backtrack programming is applied in determining the optimal design.
