Humans can naturally understand an image in depth with the aid of rich knowledge accumulated from daily lives or professions. For example, to achieve fine-grained image recognition (e.g., categorizing hundreds of subordinate categories of birds) usually requires a comprehensive visual concept organization including category labels and part-level attributes. In this work, we investigate how to unify rich professional knowledge with deep neural network architectures and propose a Knowledge-Embedded Representation Learning (KERL) framework for handling the problem of fine-grained image recognition. Specifically, we organize the rich visual concepts in the form of knowledge graph and employ a Gated Graph Neural Network to propagate node message through the graph for generating the knowledge representation. By introducing a novel gated mechanism, our KERL framework incorporates this knowledge representation into the discriminative image feature learning, i.e., implicitly associating the specific attributes with the feature maps. Compared with existing methods of fine-grained image classification, our KERL framework has several appealing properties: i) The embedded high-level knowledge enhances the feature representation, thus facilitating distinguishing the subtle differences among subordinate categories. ii) Our framework can learn feature maps with a meaningful configuration that the highlighted regions finely accord with the nodes (specific attributes) of the knowledge graph. Extensive experiments on the widely used Caltech-UCSD bird dataset demonstrate the superiority of our KERL framework over existing state-of-the-art methods.
