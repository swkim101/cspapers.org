Classes of "phrase-structure grammars" are defined whose "languages" consist, not of strings of symbols, but of directed graphs with symbols at their vertices ("webs"). Examples of such "web grammars" are given, having languages consisting of trees, of two-terminal series-parallel networks, and of "triangular" networks. It is shown that if the graphs permitted in a "context-sensitive" web grammar are required to be acyclic, and the parsing rules are assumed to be graph homomorphisms, then any sub-graph which is parsed by a rule must be "convex", and any rule is a composite of rules each of which parses a subgraph having just two points. Foreword Since the early 1960's, considerable effort has been devoted to the problem of developing formal "picture languages" whose "sentences" are pictures of various types. This work (see^ for a recent survey) can be thought of as generalizing the concepts and methods of mathematical linguistics from conventional languages, in which sentences are strings formed by concatenating symbols, to "languages" in which "sentences" are formed by combining symbols in more general ways. The present paper describes a method of defining "languages" whose "sentences" are directed graphs with symbols at their vertices.
