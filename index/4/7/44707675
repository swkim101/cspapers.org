Sentences about motion are among those that requ i re mu l t i p le -even t -and-s ta te ana l ys i s . However the p red ica t ion of the l o c a t i o n of motion presents new d i f f i c u l t i e s . I t i s poss ib le to p re d ica te po in ts in mot ion, as in "He walked i n t o the house." . I t i s a lso poss ib le to pred ica te segments of mot ion, as in "He walked across the lawn", The sense of "across" here p a r r e l l e l l n g that in " the path across the lawn is made of b a r k . " . Further in mot ional events, m u l t i p l e pred icat ions can show order ing as in "He walked across the lawn up the s t a i r s i n t o the house. " . To a l low for these phenomena our proposal takes the l oca t i on of the movement as a h i s t o r y of the moving objects and uses two func t ions to produce from that h i s to ry segments of the journey. Figure II gives an example. The func t i on "SEGMENT" has the movement as i t s parameter, P-arc, and a segment, shown by " Q] ", as i t s va lue , V-arc . These segments are predicated by s p a t i a l re ferences. The funct ion "UNIT" produces another type of segment, shown by " [T) ". When a [] is predicated the asser t ion is that the r e l a t i o n held at the end but not bef o r e . The segments themselves are compared by rel i n k s to show o rder ing . This is the g i s t of our s p a t i a l reference proposal . But as w i l l be seen there are problems. Rela t ing Spat ia l and Temporal Reference At t h i s po in t two separate analyses have been re la ted to events and s ta tes of a f f a i r s . I t is claimed that they can and should be combined in to one. There are good reasons to do t h i s con jo in ing . These can begin to be seen through a problem w i th Figure I I in i n t e r p r e t i n g the l e s s than comparisons. These must have a scale fo r comparison. However being between segments of a journey, the only s p a t i a l scale ava i l ab le is the ad hoc one based on the journey i t s e l f . The way out of the dilemma is to associate the time of the journey w i t h the segments and to compare these t imes. The l oca t i on of the motion can be thought of as e x i s t i n g in four-d imensional space, we can c a l l i t a "space/t ime zone" ( f o l l ow ing a suggest i o n of Lemmon (1967). The UNIT and SEGMENT funct i o n can produce par ts of zones on the basis of parameters showing f i n a l t ime and i n t i a l and f i n a l t ime, r espec t i ve l y . The times appearing there can then be used fo r o rder ing . But now that time is a part of mot ion, at leas t here a separate temporal e n t i t y i s redundant. This is only ha l f the b a t t l e . What of nonmot ional events and states of a f f a i r s ? Apparently a space/time zone analys is is not out of order . F i r s t , i n apparent ly a l l du ra t i ona l events and s ta tes , i t i s poss ib le to make motional r e f e r ences. So w i t h "He sat on the books from New York to Bos ton . " , the mot ional problems reappear. Second, times must be found in order to locate objects used in ground ro les in s p a t i a l r e f e r ences, e . g . , the car in Figure I . Tf the e n t i t y in the f i g u r e ro le is a space/time zone, then the appropr ia te time is immediately a v a i l a b l e . From t h i s we conclude that space/time zones can be and should be used fo r both s p a t i a l and temporal re ference. We propose a s t y l e of ana lys i s exempl i f ied by Figure I I I . There would be a Space/Time-arc i d e n t i f y i n g a zone, " gj " . This zone could then be predicated by both s p a t i a l and temporal re ferences. Hence we have what we set out to f i n d a simultaneous analys is of s p a t i a l and temporal re ference.
