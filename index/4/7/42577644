At recent SIGCSE conferences, there appeared to be a refreshing revival of interest in game theory as a valuable pedagogical tool for educators [4,5]. Games can serve as an excellent resource for CS0, CS1, networking, user interface and software engineering projects. Games can be utilized to motivate students, enrich their intuition, and illustrate fundamental principles of algorithm design such as exploration of regularities, modularity, correctness, and efficiency. Many CS instructors look for ways to motivate, improve intuition, and illustrate the subject matter they teach, and games are a wonderful means of doing so.
