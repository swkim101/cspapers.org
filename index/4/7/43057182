Over the past five years or so, I've moved from academia to industrial research and now to an Internet startup. In this talk, I'll share some of the experiences I've had and some of the things that I've observed and learned along the way. Among the issues to be discussed are some of the technical and nontechnical " real-world constraints " that I've bumped into in trying to apply research-y thinking in practice. I'll also share some thoughts on where database systems may or may not be headed as a result. I'll close by describing some of what we're doing in " database space " at Propel, including how we're using database systems as off-the-shelf parts in assembling what we like to think of as " the e-commerce platform of the future.
