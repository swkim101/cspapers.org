This paper presents a very high security cryptosystem architecture that combines strengths of the symmetric key cryptography and the public key cryptography. The symmetric key cryptographic algorithm (ZUC) is used to encrypt/decrypt bulk data while the public key algorithm (RSA) performs the encryption/decryption of the secret key of ZUC. This architecture achieves high security thanks to the ease of key distribution from the public key cryptosystem, key changing during a session. This cryptosystem is implemented in Verilog-HDL, simulated on ModelSim and evaluated using Altera Cyclone IV-based DE2 Development Kit. The throughput of bulk data decryption achieves up to 1.79 Gbps at the operating frequency of 56 MHz, which satisfies applications with high bandwidth requirement such as video.
