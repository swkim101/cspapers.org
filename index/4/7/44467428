The paper presents some methods to improve characteristics of film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) devices. The FBAR devices were fabricated on Bragg reflectors. Thermal treatments were done by sintering and/or annealing processes. The measurement showed a considerable improvement of return loss (S11) and quality factor (Qs/p). These thermal treatment techniques seem very promising for enhancing FBAR resonance performance.
