This paper describes the design and performance of four Ku-band common-source dielectric resonator oscillators (DROs). The first uses open-circuited stubs at the source to create instability, while the second employs an additional dielectric resonator (DR) for the same purpose. The third has the source connected to a 50Omega impedance and the fourth has the source grounded. A comparison is made between the general characteristics of the four configurations.
