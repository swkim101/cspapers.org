This paper treats computer control of multijointed fingers. First, we discuss optimum operational direction of multijointed fingers. The direction is determined from motional structure of the fingers and is important in the control stage of arm part. second, general description about, software system is presented with primitive program:; to control hardware system. These have been implemented on the ETL object-handling system for manual industry. Third, experimental results of nut-turning task are, presented which verify the feasibility of manual task by computer control.
