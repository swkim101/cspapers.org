This paper presents a method for automatically analyzing programs and discusses why it is a useful way to look at programs. The method is based on the idea that there are only a few basic ways in which the logical structure Of programs is built up. An experiment is presented which shows that this accounts for the structure of a large class Of programs. The paper discusses how the method can be used to automatically analyze the structure of a program, and how the resulting analysis can be used to guide a proof of correctness for the program. An automatic system is described which performs this type of analysis. The paper discusses the relationship between the structure building methods presented and programming language constructs.
