In this paper, we introduces the configuration of a high-power solid-state transmitter to be used for modern radar system operating at UHF band (820MHz-900MHz). Specially, the power amplifier module (150W output power) does play a critically important role in such a system being consisting of two-stage 90W-and-200W amplifier that allows the output to reach up to 1.2kW per block, and even approximate 9.6 kW to whole system using the classical power combination method. Our work mainly targets to present the study, design, and fabrication of both 150-Watt basic module and high-power Wilkinson method, which are the key components in the topology. The design and simulated results were carried out by the microwave engineering professional design software, known as ADS2008 package. The achieved results meet the demand of modern radar transmitter. All simulations and experimental results will be reported.
