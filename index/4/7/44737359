The attached draft of the report was that used by the group prior to the May 27-28 Workshop, during which reactions from industry and professional society representatives were obtained.
 After a summary of the content of the report is given by the chairman of the ad hoc sub-committee, comments will be heard from panel participants. Afterwards, a brief critique will be given by a discussion leader, followed by discussion with the audience.
 Copies of the completed report should be available during the panel session.
