Rosetta is a European Space Agency (ESA) cornerstone mission that entered orbit around the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014 and will escort the comet for a 1.5 year nominal mission offering the most detailed study of a comet ever undertaken by humankind. The Rosetta orbiter has 11 scientific instruments (4 remote sensing) and the Philae lander to make complementary measurements of the comet nucleus, coma (gas and dust), and surrounding environment. 
 
The ESA Rosetta Science Ground Segment has developed a science scheduling system that includes an automated scheduling capability to assist in developing science plans for the Rosetta Orbiter. While automated scheduling is a small portion of the overall Science Ground Segment (SGS) as well as the overall scheduling system, this paper focuses on the automated and semi-automated scheduling software (called ASPEN-RSSC) and how this software is used.
