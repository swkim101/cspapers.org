The rationale behind anaphora resolution in Pashto language is to make it easier for computer to comprehend and further process Pashto text accurately. This paper is focused on the implementation of the algorithm (Ali et al., 2007) and modifying few of its rules. It also adds some new rules and eliminates an undesirable one to enhance the accuracy and efficiency. The algorithm uses a rule-based approach for the resolution of strong personal pronouns of Pashto language in their direct, oblique, and possessive cases. It has been implemented in Visual C#.NET and tested on real world text taken from different genres. The modified algorithm increases the accuracy from 80% to 85.14%.
