This problem can be solved by automatically labeling some negative (and more positive) examples from unlabeled examples before training a text classifier. But it is difficult to guarantee both high quality and quantity of the new labeled examples. In this paper, a multi-level example based learning method for partially supervised text classification is proposed, which can make full use of all unlabeled examples. A heuristic method is proposed to assign possible labels to unlabeled examples and partition them into multiple levels according to their labeling confidence. A text classifier is trained on these multi-level examples using weighted support vector machines. Experiments show that the multi-level example based learning method is effective for partially supervised text classification, and outperforms the existing popular methods such as Biased-SVM, ROC-SVM, S-EM and WL.
