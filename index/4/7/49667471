Reliable and timely delivery of periodic V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) broadcast messages is essential for realizing the benefits of connected vehicles. Existing MAC protocols for ad hoc networks fall short of meeting these requirements. In this paper, we present, CoReCast, the first collision embracing protocol for vehicular networks. CoReCast provides high reliability and low delay by leveraging two unique opportunities: no strict constraint on energy consumption, and availability of GPS clocks to achieve near-perfect time and frequency synchronization. Due to low coherence time, the channel changes rapidly in vehicular networks. CoReCast embraces packet collisions and takes advantage of the channel dynamics to decode collided packets. The design of CoReCast is based on a preamble detection scheme that estimates channels from multiple transmitters without any prior information about them. The proposed scheme reduces the space and time requirement exponentially than the existing schemes. The system is evaluated through experiments with USRP N210 and GPS devices placed in vehicles driven on roads in different environments as well as using trace-driven simulations. It provides 15x and 2x lower delay than 802.11p and OCP (Omniscient Clustering Protocol), respectively. Reliability of CoReCast is 8x and 2x better than 802.11p and OCP, respectively.
