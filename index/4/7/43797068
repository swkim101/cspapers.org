A 64-state 16-QAM space-time trellis code (STTC), which uses two transmitting antennas, is proposed and applied to a 2×2 MIMO-OFDM system for outdoor mobile transmission in the 800-MHz band. Although STTCs have been analyzed theoretically and the error performances have been simulated by many researchers, experimental results have rarely been reported. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of our 2×2 STTC-MIMO-OFDM in both a simulation and experiment in the 800-MHz-band urban mobile environment. As a result, excellent bit error rate (BER) performance obtained in the simulation was verified by the experiment.
