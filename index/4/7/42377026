In this paper, we describe a model that can be used to evaluate the impact of using imperfect information when routing supplies for disaster relief. Using two objectives, maximizing the population supported, and minimizing response time, we explore the potential tradeoffs (e.g. more information, but possibly less accurate) of using information from social media streams to inform routing and resource allocation decisions immediately after a disaster.
