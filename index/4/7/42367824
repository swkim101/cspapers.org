We discuss the importance of, and the prospect for, areas of mobile robot specification. The goal is to start a technical discussion in the mobile robotics community to create reusable building blocks that result in reliable, affordable robotics products are discussed. The form of this discussion is a roadmap for specifying building blocks for mobile robots.
