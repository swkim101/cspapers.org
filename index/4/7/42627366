In applications such as banking, reservation systems, inventory, and command and control it is desirable to allow updates to replicated data even during communications delays or failures. We present a technique that allows each site to process updates regardless of the state of the net- work -- to continue to update its own copy of the data and to process information about updates at other sites whenever it is available. Each site acts independently to revise its copy of the replicated data when it receives information about relevant updates. The process of merging newly received updates with those already processed is made more efficient by exploiting sim-ple semantic properties of the updates.
