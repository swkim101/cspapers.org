To protect vital control information from deep fades, repetition coding is recommended in mobile WiMAX. This paper considers repetition coding as a maximum ratio combining process and proposes an expression for the coding gain and its effect on BER. A 10- state finite state Markov channel (FSMC) model is also proposed for the implementation of the adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme in mobile WiMAX to maximize its spectral efficiency in a Rayleigh fading environment.
