The paper presents advances in the ANaConDA framework for dynamic analysis and testing of concurrent C/C++ programs. ANaConDA comes with several built-in analysers, covering detection of data races, deadlocks, or contract violations, and allows for an easy creation of new analysers. To increase the variety of tested interleavings, ANaConDA offers various noise injection techniques. The framework performs the analysis on a binary level, thus not requiring the source code of the program to be available. Apart from many academic experiments, ANaConDA has also been successfully used to discover various errors in industrial code.
