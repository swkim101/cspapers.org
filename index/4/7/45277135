This paper briefly describes an advanced teleoperator (ATOP) system and its control station where a variety of computer-based operator interface devices and techniques are integrated into a functional setting, accommodating a primary operator and secondary operators. Computer graphics is a key operator interface component in the control station where new types of manual interface devices also are employed. The results of some generic and application task experiments are summarized, including the performance of a simulated remote satellite servicing task, carried out under four to eight seconds communication time delay, using satellite TV and Internet computer communication links. In conclusion, the paper highlights the lessons learned so far.<<ETX>>
