The unprecedented use of social networking, the Web and other related technologies by all fringes of population, has not been accompanied by an adequate awareness of its potential for abuse, privacy violation and cybercrimes. Furthermore, technology nowadays provides extensive capabilities which often times clash with society's laws and ethics. In particular, modern societies have certain expectations of privacy; that may be contradicted by the capabilities of new technology. It seems then incumbent upon computer science instructors to raise awareness of these risks and threats among the students they teach. The purpose of this session is to provide a forum for discussing technologies that are widely used by CS and non CS professionals alike, and that may well be at variance with society's privacy expectations. A second purpose of this session is to introduce instructional modules currently under development that may assist instructors in addressing some of the relevant themes in courses, in particular privacy in social networks, on the internet, in mobile apps and also privacy in electronic voting and law enforcement. We expect that attendees will provide varying opinions and insight that will help shape the course offering. In addition, attendees will be invited to share their experience teaching or talking about privacy issues and the approaches, resources and techniques they have used in presenting the topic to students.
