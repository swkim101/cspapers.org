A method of detecting and measuring objects for the purpose of representing three-dimensional outdoor scenes, using data such as that obtained from stereo vision or from a scanning laser rangefinder, is described. Objects are approximated by ellipsoids. Segmentation of the objects from the background and from each other is done by finding the ground surface, forming a preliminary segmentation by clustering the points above the ground by more than a threshold, fitting ellipsoids to match these clusters and to avoid obscuring the other points, and adjusting the clusters according to the fits. The method is designed to produce results useful for obstacle avoidance and navigation in an exploring vehicle, such as a Mars rover. An example is given showing results obtained from a stereo pair of pictures of Mars from the Viking Lander.
