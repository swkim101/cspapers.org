The purpose of this paper is to relate experience we have had with our first course in computer science at the College of William and Mary. Like many other universities, we have had to deal with increased student demand from outside departments, differing levels of student mathematical maturity and problem solving skills, a variety of student goals, and a state legislature which will not allow the university to expand its faculty.
