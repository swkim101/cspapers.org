Product line engineering comprises many heterogeneous activities such as capturing the variability of reusable assets, supporting the derivation of products from the product line, evolving the product line, or tailoring the approach to the specifics of a domain. The inherent complexity of product lines implicates that tool support is inevitable to facilitate smooth performance and to avoid costly errors. Product line engineering tools have to support heterogeneous stakeholders involved in diverse activities. Tool integration therefore is of particular importance to foster their seamless cooperation. However, the integration is difficult to achieve due to the diversity of models and work products. This paper describes the DOPLER tool suite which has been developed to provide such integrated support. The tool suite is flexible and extensible to support domain-specific needs
