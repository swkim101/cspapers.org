In this paper we present theory and experiments on the algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). These diagrams extend BDD's by allowing values from an arbitrary finite domain to be associated with the terminal nodes. We present a treatment founded in Boolean algebras and discuss algorithms and results in applications like matrix multiplication and shortest path algorithms. Furthermore, we outline possible applications of ADD's to logic synthesis, formal verification, and testing of digital systems.
