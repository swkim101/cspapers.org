Android devices are an integral part of modern life from phone to media boxes to smart home appliances and cameras. With 38.9% of market share, Android is now the most used operating system not just in terms of mobile devices but considering all OSes. As applications' complexity and features increased, Android relied more heavily on code and data sharing among apps for faster response times and richer user experience. To achieve that, Android apps reuse functionality and data by means of inter-app message passing where each app defines the messages it expects to receive. In this paper, we analyze the proliferation of exploitable inter-app communication vulnerabilities using a rich corpus of 1) a representative sample of 32 Android devices, 2) 59 official Google Android versions, and 3) the top 18,583 apps from 2016 to 2017. This corpus covers $91$ Android builds from version 4.4 to present. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first longitudinal study looking into the propagation of vulnerabilities across AOSP builds, between AOSP and a diverse set of devices, and across app versions over a period of 13 months. To identify inter-app vulnerabilities, we developed Daze as a swift and fully-automated framework for extracting app components and fuzzing all app interfaces. Daze needs only about three hours for full-device analysis or two minutes per app on average. We identified 14,413 vulnerabilities and quantified their exposure time and the number of versions affected. Our findings revealed that $51.7%$ of Android devices and $49%$ of the top $300$ apps on Google Play contained at least one critical inter-app vulnerability. We found that about $15%$ of fixed vulnerabilities lived for more than $100$ days before being patched, more than $20%$ of unpatched vulnerabilities have existed for at least $180$ days, and $45%$ of unpatched vulnerabilities persisted through the latest two to four consecutive app versions in our dataset.
