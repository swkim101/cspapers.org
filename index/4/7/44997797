This paper describes a graduate Computer Science course in which all aspects of the programming process are examined.
 The course has been taught for the past three years, and represents an attempt to pull together various results of researchers working on this rather undeveloped but important area. Unfortunately space does not permit the inclusion here of many details or examples. Rather, the emphasis is on the form of the course and how the reference material is used in pursuing the course objectives. (The topic of program measurement is expanded on somewhat, being a topic of interest to the author and one about which little has been said elsewhere.)
