This workshop will conduct an exploration of the newly released Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot platform and its applicability to the college computer science curriculum. Participants will learn about the EV3 through handouts and hands-on programming exercises. The first part of the workshop will focus on demonstrating EV3 robots as well as the STEM concepts and computing concepts they illustrate. The second part of the workshop will focus in on the new capabilities of the EV3. This workshop will be more detailed than the vendor led workshop. It will be of benefit to participants new to Mindstorms robotics as well as those with NXT/RCX experience who want to see the evolution of the platform and new components featured in the EV3. These include a revision of the controller brick hardware and software, new color and gyroscopic sensors, and increased processing and memory capabilities. The organizers have a combined 20 years of experience using Mindstorms in CS courses (including courses in introductory programming, systems, and artificial intelligence) with Lego and third party programming environments. Participants must bring a Bluetooth-capable laptop (Mac or Windows), and will have a robot, software, and kit to use for the workshop. Participants will receive a promotion code to purchase a 10% discounted Mindstorms kit.
