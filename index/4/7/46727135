This paper presents a process model of plan inference for use in natural language consultation systems. It includes a strategy that can both defer unwarranted decisions about the relationship of a new action to the user's overall plan and sanction rational default inferences. The paper describes an implementation of this strategy using the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidential reasoning. Our process model overcomes a limitation of previous plan recognition systems and produces a richer model of the user's plans and goals, yet one that can be explained and justified to the user when discrepancies arise between it and what the user is actually trying to accomplish.
