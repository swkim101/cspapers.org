This paper considers some transformation and replacement of relations in a relational data base, called association and dissociation, which are intended to decrease the time of jobs processing and files updating, although it is accompanied by an increase of information redundancy. Some examples are examined. It is shown that in a considerable number of practical cases association and dissociation are effective means of processing time reduction and data base adaptation.
