This paper describes a method for constructing expert systems in which control information is automatically built from the actions of an expert trainer. This control information consists of sequencing and ooa1 information which is extracted from the trainer by a 'planning expert', and generalized by a 'generalization expert'. A set of extensions to the 0PS5 system is described which facilitates the implementation of this approach with in 0PS5. These extensions permit the use of meta productions to effect the conflict resolution procedure; the control information is expressed as a set of such meta productions. Preliminary experiments with the system are described.
