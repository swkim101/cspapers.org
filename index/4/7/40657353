This paper presents high-rate Space-Time Block Coded SpatialModulation (STBC-SM) schemes for 4 and 6 transmit antennas. In these schemes, transmit codeword matrices are divided into two separate matrices, namely, Spatial Constellation (SC) matrix and Space-Time Block Code (STBC) matrix. The introduction of SC matrix makes it convenient in the design of STBC-SM codewords and signal detection. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate BER performance and hardware complexity in comparison with the STBC-SM in [1].
