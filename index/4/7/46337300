This contribution was written basically with the two fold aim, i .e . (i) to respond to the claims of a declining Computer Science (see Garwick [1976] and the Comm ACM Forum [1976]), as well as (ii) to propose a new shape for Computer Science education at Universities, with a special emphasis on developing countries . The latter problem is brought forward, for it seems that nowhere else are the much bespoken drawbacks and inadequacie s of the prevailing status quo experience so painfull as in the developing countires o f Africa, Latin America and so on .
