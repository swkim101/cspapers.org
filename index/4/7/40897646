Various methods have been used to enhance the properties of steel during solidification. The continuous casting mold and submerged entry nozzles play an important part to produce the clean and defect free solidified slabs [7]. The melt flow structure in the mold has a greater impact on solidified slabs. The velocity and turbulence can be modified by SEN [8]. The SEN has few ports that can alter flow structure by modifying the angle. The research effort has been made to improve the quality of steel. Many studies reported that large vertical velocity and turbulence in the mold region causes many defects in the steel product. From previous work, it has been noted that fluid flow behavior in the mold region depends on the SEN different parameters such as mold thickness, port thickness, port angle etc [7,9-12]. In the present work, numerical investigation has been carried out to find out the effect of SEN port angle on the fluid flow behavior.
