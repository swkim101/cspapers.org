Inverse kinematic is one of the most interesting problems of industrial robot. The inverse kinematics problem in robotics is about the determination of joint angles for a desired Cartesian position of the end effector. It comprises of the computation need to find the joint angles for a given Cartesian position and orientation of the end effectors to control a robot arm. There is no unique solution for the inverse kinematics thus necessitating application of appropriate predictive models from the soft computing domain. Artificial neural network is one such technique which can be gainfully used to yield the acceptable results. This paper proposes a structured artificial neural network (ANN) model to find the inverse kinematics solution of a 4-dof SCARA manipulator. The ANN model used is a multi-layered perceptron neural network (MLPNN), wherein gradient descent type of learning rules is applied. An attempt has been made to find the best ANN configuration for the problem. It is found that multi-layered perceptron neural network gives minimum mean square error.
