The distance information is very important to operate a teleoperation robot in the teleoperation system. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to realize a distance man-machine interface, in order to present the distance information, because the human perceptive distance is different from the actual distance, and also the spatial scale of the real world is different from the virtual world. Therefore, it is very important to measure and analyze human characteristic of distance perception for the man-machine interface of teleoperation systems. In this study, the characteristics of human distance perception are measured, and a mathematical model of human distance perception is proposed. The results suggested that the human perceptive distances are larger (smaller) than the actual distances, if with using (not using) tactile information. The experimental results provide useful basic data to design the distance interface of teleoperation systems, and to investigate the human mechanism of distance perception.
