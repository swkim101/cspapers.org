This paper presents BAOBAB-2, a computer program built upon the MYCIN system [II], that is used for understanding medical summaries describing the status of patients. Due to the stereotypic way the physicians present medical problems in these summaries in addition to the constrained nature of medical Jargon, these texts have a very strong structure. BAOBAB-2 takes advantage of this structure by having a model of this organisation as a set of related schemas that facilitate the interpretation of these texts. Structures of the schemas and their relation to the surface structure of the text are described. Issues relating to selection and use of these schemas by the program during the interpretation are discussed.
