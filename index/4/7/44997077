We propose PipeProbe, a mobile sensor system for mapping hidden water pipelines inside cement walls or under floor coverings. PipeProbe works by dropping a sensor capsule into the source of the water pipelines. As the PipeProbe capsule traverses the pipelines, it gathers water pressure and accelerometer readings. Given the pressure sensor readings, we can identify the height of PipeProbe. Accelerometer is used to recognize different types of water pipeline shape when PipeProbe travels through. The PipeProbe system is non-intrusive and requires no alteration to the water pipeline infrastructure.
