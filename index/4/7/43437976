Dynamic preshaping is important for high speed capturing robot to catch a moving object successfully. This paper discusses dynamic preshaping for a capturing robot driven by a single wire. To control the finger posture while approaching an object, there are three essential factors, wiring, spring distribution among joints, and mass distribution in each finger link. Giving the final link posture of finger, mass distribution, and tension with respect to time, we explore hoe to determine both the wiring and the spring distribution. We first show how to find them under a quasi-static motion, where all dynamic effects are neglected. We further explore an approach to find them under a dynamic motion where the tension increases fast enough.
