This paper describes a compiler called ORACLE which allows a student to examine the actions performed by a simple compiler. Two features are provided to assist the student. The first called replacement mode, provides the necessary conditions to simulate the replacement of three compiler components: symbol table management, lexical analysis, and syntax analysis. Each replacement module is monitored by ORACLE in order to detect errors and to verify correct operation. The second, a trace option, permits source statements to initiate or terminate a selective monitoring of the actions of the compiler.
