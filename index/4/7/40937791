In this paper a robust Hâˆž dynamic output feedback control is designed for Networked Control Systems (NCSs). A new dynamic quantization technique, based on the difference of signals, is used to quantize data before transmitting it over the network. Dynamic quantizers are assumed both on system input and output. Network induced random delays are modeled using Markov chain and a stochastic stability criteria is proposed using a detailed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. On the basis of stability conditions, an innovative control law is proposed in terms of Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs). At the end, a numerical example is discussed and it is observed that the proposed technique assures stability for systems with fast dynamics.
