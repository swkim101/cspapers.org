Since its inception in the 1980s, robotic surgery has rapidly progressed into a variety of surgical fields including general surgery, urology, gynecology, cardiac surgery as well as thoracic surgery. In this review, we highlight the robotic assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) in primary lung cancer, focusing on basic surgical technique, anesthetic considerations, outcome, complications, and cost. We discuss our experience as a tertiary urban referral center that routinely performs robotic lung resections. Finally, we discuss potential hurdles and the future directions in robotic surgery.
