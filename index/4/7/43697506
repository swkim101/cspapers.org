This paper describes ways that storage allocation optimization, though “correct”, can convert a running program into one that fails. A general “safety condition” is proposed and applied to some existing and proposed storage allocation optimizations. These are shown to be unsafe or not general. Application of the safety condition yields several classes of storage allocations that may safely be optimized to stack allocations. For one useful class of allocations optimization is shown to be NP-complete.
