The paper presents two families of reversible transformations for a binary information model. The binary model is considered as a special case of a generalized n-ary relational model as are CODD'S and E/R models. This parenthood increases the power of the binary model and makes the transformation valid for other models. Two applications of the transformations are presented within the framework of an Information System Design Approach; they are namely a conceptual model conversion and a valid TOTAL schema production.
