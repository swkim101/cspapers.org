This paper describes experiences in evaluating and selecting integrated development environments for large enterprises. In the past, development environments were typicall y selected to support inhouse, “ green-field” development, for mostly homogenous target architectures. Today, it is common to find that the development environment must support an outsourced development approach, targeted to a heterogeneous, service-based architecture. Other current factors include the desire to utili ze common open source tools and to leverage legacy tool investments, alongside new COTS solutions. As these technical factors are key drivers for an evaluation, this paper will also emphasize that politi cal factors can be just as important to success.
