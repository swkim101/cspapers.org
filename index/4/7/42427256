This paper presents the system architecture of a real time multi-UAV simulator (RMUS). The simulator has been implemented as both a testing and validation mechanism for the real demonstration of multiple UAVs conducting both decentralised data fusion and control. These mechanisms include the off-line simulation of complex scenarios, hardware-in-the-loop tests, validation of real test results, and online mission control system demonstrations. The paper also present CommLibX, a novel communication framework for the system which allows simulation modules to communicate over single or multiple virtual channels. This unique communication system is then easily ported onto the real hardware allowing for maximum reuse of software and integrity.
