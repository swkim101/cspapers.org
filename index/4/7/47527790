We consider augmented ring-based networks with vertices 0,...,n-1, where each vertex is connected to its left and right neighbor and possibly to some further vertices (called long range contacts). The outgoing edges of a vertex v are obtained by choosing a subset D of {1,2,...n-1}, with 1, n-1 in D, at random according to a probability distribution mu on all such D and then for each i in D connecting v to (v+i) mod n by a unidirectional link. The choices for different v are done independently and uniformly in the sense that the same distribution mu is used for all v. The expected number of long range contacts is l=E(|D|)-2. Motivated by Kleinberg's (2000) Small World Graph model and packet routing strategies for peer-to-peer networks, the greedy routing algorithm on augmented rings, where a packet sitting in a node v is routed to the neighbor of v closest to the destination of the package, has been investigated thoroughly, both for the "one-sided case", where packets can travel only in one direction, and the "two-sided case", where there is no such restriction. In this paper, for both the one-sided and the two-sided case and for an arbitrary distribution mu, we prove a lower bound of Omega((log n)2/l) on the expected number of hops that are needed by the greedy strategy to route a package between two randomly chosen vertices on the ring. This bound is tight for Omega(1)<=l=O(log n).
