A manipulator which is able to move freely is more effective than one fixed on a floor. If the manipulator could operate while it is traveling, the time and energy efficiency could be increased further. Equations of motion for such a mobile manipulator have interference terms. As a result of the motions disturbing each other, the hand of the manipulator can not be controlled to the reference position and orientation in the work frame. The authors propose to remove the interferences using the Newton-Euler technique and present simulation results showing that the method is effective.
