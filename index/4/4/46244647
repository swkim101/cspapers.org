In this paper, a visible light communications (VLC) system prototype using OLED was realized and tested. Using simple DPPM technique and comparator, our prototype was able to transmit up to 127.5 kbps data rate using an OLED with only 7 kHz 3 dB modulation bandwidth. Exploiting the frequency response of OLED, we were able to achieve a better data rate to modulation bandwidth ratio than other recent reports using OLED for VLC.
