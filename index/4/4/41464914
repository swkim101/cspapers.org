Measuring the quality of web content, either at page level or website level, is at the heart of several key challenges in the Web. Without doubt, the main one is web search, to be able to rank results. However, there are other important problems such as web reputation or trust, and web spam detection and filtering. However, measuring intrinsic web quality is a hard problem, because of our limited (automatic) understanding of text semantics, which is even worse for other media. Hence, similarly to human trust assessing, where we use past actions, face expressions, body language, etc; in the Web we need to use indirect signals that serve as surrogates for web quality. In this keynote we attempt to present the most important signals as well as new signals that are or can be used to measure quality in the Web. We divide them using the traditional web content, structure, and usage trilogy. We also characterize them according to how easy is to measure these signals, who can measure them, and how well they scale to the whole Web.
