In presentation of multidimensional arrays, a common convention for presentation is the row major format. Unfortunately, the presentation of COBOL tables follows no conventional format. A survey of presentations in current texts demonstrates this lack of uniform presentation. The lack of uniformity adds complexity to classroom presentation and also is magnified due to little carry over of concepts learned when dealing with arrays. A presentation of arrays and tables is discussed along with a proposed standard for presentation of tables in COBOL.
