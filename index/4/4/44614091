Web services (a.k.a. web APIs) allow developers to build web and mobile applications using data from multiple online sources. This workshop is aimed at CS instructors that wish to teach how to use and write web services using Node.js on a cloud development environment. Node.js is an open source JavaScript platform that is currently used by companies like PayPal, DowJones, Walmart, Netflix, and Yahoo. Over 120 companies in the fortune 500 are not only using, but embracing Node.js in their everyday operations. Using and writing web services in Node.js is significantly easier than using other environments based on languages such as C# or Java. Because we will be using a cloud platform, all our tools are readily available through any modern web browser, thus eliminating the hassle related to installing a complete standalone development environment. Teaching web API design with Node.js on the cloud provides our students a relevant real life technical skill. Workshop participants will use the free service provided by Cloud9 IDE (https://c9.io/) to learn how to write scalable RESTful web services using Node.js, the Express web framework, MySQL, and jQuery. Participants should have a working knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and SQL. Additional information available at: http://node.arielortiz.info/ Laptop required.
