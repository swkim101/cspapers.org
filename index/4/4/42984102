This paper provides a brief overview of an underwater robotic system for autonomous inspection in confined offshore underwater structures. The system, which is currently in development, consist of heterogeneous modular robots able to physically dock and communicate with other robots, transport tools and robots, and recharge their batteries while underwater. These properties will provide the system, when fully developed, with unique capabilities such as ability to adapt robotic morphology and function to the current task and tolerate failures leading to long-term autonomous operations.
