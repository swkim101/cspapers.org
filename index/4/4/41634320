This paper proposes a new walking and jumping robot, that is expected to get over large debris in the disaster area which is difficult to move around by ordinary walking robot and to find out the victims efficiently as the rescue operation. To acquire stability on uneven terrain in landing, the robot is designed by legs which widely spread like spiders. The legs are consists of 4-bar linkage and driven by a pair of pneumatic cylinders which momentarily produce high power and speed. At this time, basic performance of the pneumatic cylinder is verified for the jumping use. Moreover the one leg model is developed and examined its jumping and landing performances.
