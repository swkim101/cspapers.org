In this paper, we consider the problem of how to represent the locations of Internet hosts in a Cartesian coordinate system to facilitate estimate of the network distance between two arbitrary Internet hosts. We envision an infrastructure that consists of beacon nodes and provides the service of estimating network distance between two hosts without direct delay measurement. We show that the principal component analysis (PCA) technique can effectively extract topological information from delay measurements between beacon hosts. Based on PCA, we devise a transformation method that projects the distance data space into a new coordinate system of (much) smaller dimensions. The transformation retains as much topological information as possible and yet enables end hosts to easily determine their locations in the coordinate system. The resulting new coordinate system is termed as the Internet Coordinate System (ICS). As compared to existing work (e.g., IDMaps [1] and GNP [2]), ICS incurs smaller computation overhead in calculating the coordinates of hosts and smaller measurement overhead (required for end hosts to measure their distances to beacon hosts). Finally, we show via experimentation with real-life data sets that ICS is robust and accurate, regardless of the number of beacon nodes (as long as it exceeds certain threshold) and the complexity of network topology.
