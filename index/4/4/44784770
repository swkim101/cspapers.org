The PAPI cross-platform interface to the hardware performance counters available on most microprocessors has become widely adopted and used for application performance analysis. PAPI is now incorporated into a number of end-user performance analysis tools, including both research and vendor tools. In years past, the PAPI Users BOF has provided an excellent opportunity for interaction between PAPI developers, performance tool developers, and other users of PAPI. Several suggestions from past BOFs have been implemented in subsequent versions of PAPI. The purpose of this BOF will be to present the features of the latest release of PAPI and to get feedback from tool developers and PAPI end-users on these features and on future directions for PAPI. Support for emerging architectures and interfaces, such as the Cell multiprocessor, and the perfmon2 effort to implement a standard Linux kernel interface to access the hardware counters, will also be discussed.
