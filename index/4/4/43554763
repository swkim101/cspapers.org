In this paper, we consider an incremental cooperative relaying network (IR-CRN), where a relay node harvests the radio energy from the source signal using the time-switching mechanism. Specif cally, we propose a scheme named as IR-CRN which enhances spatial diversity gain by utilizing the incremental relaying protocol. The destination node of the IR-CRN scheme employs maximal ratio combining (MRC) technique to combine the signals from the source node and the relay node. For performance evaluation, we derive exact expressions of outage probability of the proposed system over Rayleigh fading channels with half-duplex based that energy harvesting relaying. Our results show that the system performances of the proposed scheme are much better than of the direct transmission (DT) scheme. In addition, the optimal time splitting and the position of the cooperative relay are also investigated. Our derivations are validated by Monte Carlo simulations.
