In this paper, we propose a single-drone-based localization for radio frequency (RF) sources in an outdoor environment. For fast and accurate localization, we propose a dynamic trajectory planning scheme, which guides the RF scanning drone toward a direction minimizing the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) in order to minimize the uncertainty of location estimation for target RF sources.
