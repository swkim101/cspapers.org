This presentation illustrates a software and hardware solutions that provides a speedy but reliable and secure delivery of patient clinical trial data to a research data center. A wireless data entry terminal captures patient data and performs data cleaning during data entry. The data is later uploaded to a remote database via a wireless service gateway that is connected to the Internet over a high-speed broadband connection. This data is available immediately after being uploaded to the clinical database. The significant reduction in data delivery cycle time provides a considerable reduction in trial costs and faster time to market for the new procedure or device.
