Due to the increasing complexity of System-on-Chip (SoC) design, how to ensure that silicon implementations conform to their high-level specifications is becoming a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a novel specification-driven conformance checking approach that can automatically identify inconsistencies between different levels of designs. By extending SystemRDL specifications, our approach enables the generation of high-level Formal Device Models (FDMs) that specify access behaviors of interface registers triggered by driver requests. Based on the symbolic execution of the generated FDMs with the same driver requests to virtual/silicon devices, our approach can efficiently check whether the designs of an SoC at different levels exhibit unexpected behaviors that are not modeled in the given specification. Experiments on two industrial network adapters demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in troubleshooting bugs caused by inconsistencies in both virtual and post-silicon prototypes.
