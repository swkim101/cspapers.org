In this paper, an S-band mixer circuit used for both up- and down- conversion mixers is designed. The proposed mixer works in the range power levels from -20dBm to -3 dBm for the RF input of the down-converter, and for the IF input of the up-converter. The Local oscillator (LO) working at 2.87 GHz has the power level of +2dBm. The simulation and measurement exhibits the conversion loss greater than -10dB and good isolation between RF, IF, and LO ports (RF-LO isolation >30 dB, LO-IF isolation>30 dB, RF-IF isolation>25 dB).
