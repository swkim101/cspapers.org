In designing low power switching mode power supply (SMPS), its functions, tech-parameter and cost should be considered at the same time. TOP Switch has stronger functions than the discrete components. It is easy and flexible to design SMPS based on TOP Switch and the products always get less cost. SMPS based on UC3842 or UC3843 is compared with the one based on TOP Switch in the paper. Then an actual project used fly-back converter is put forward.
