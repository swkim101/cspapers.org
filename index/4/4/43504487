Computer science graduates who become professional programmers will have a direct and substantial influence on the impact of applications, but little in traditional computer science training curriculum prepares them for this serious responsibility. Recognizing this situation, we designed a two term sequence for advanced undergraduates and masters students which would not only provide them with the required academic knowledge. The educational atmosphere that we tried to create resembles the internship phase followed in teacher training, medical schools, law schools, clinical psychology and other disciplines.
