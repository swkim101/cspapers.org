Soft exosuits are a new approach for assisting with human locomotion, which applies assistive torques to the wearer through functional apparel. In this paper, we present a new version of autonomous multi-joint soft exosuit for gait assistance, particularly designed for overground walking. The soft exosuit assists with ankle plantarflexion, hip flexion, and hip extension, equally distributing the forces between ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion. A mobile actuation system was developed to generate high assistive forces, and Bowden cables are used to transmit the forces to the exosuit. A sensor harness connects two load cells and three IMU s per leg that are used to measure real-time data for a controller that commands desired force profiles as a function of the walking cycle. In addition, a control adaptation method was developed which adjusts control parameters while walking on irregular surfaces. In preliminary studies, the proposed method substantially improved the force consistency while walking over uneven terrain. Specifically, the number of steps where the peak force deviated from the target force decreased from 100 to 57 out of 250 steps, and RMS error on the peak force decreased from 90.0 N to 76.6 N with respect to 300 N target force. Also, a two-subject case study on country-course walking demonstrated the potential of this soft exosuit to improve human energy economy while walking overground.
