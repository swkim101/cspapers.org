The use of expert systems (ES) within information retrieval systems (IRS) seems to be an interesting way, particularly for the query process. Nevertheless we must examine what knowledge we need. We think that the thesaurus may be the kernel of which knowledge : for this, we must define it larger than in classical IRS.After some recalls about what may be the principal features of a query ES, we discuss about the relationship between thesaurus and a query expert system. The problem is to determine if the thesaurus must be integrated within the knowledge base.In fact this choice is an architecture problem of the ES. We analyze, in parallel, the effects of this choice about thesaurus representation, ES functionnalities, ES architecture.The choice of an architecture depends on the goal searched: ie a general IR expert system able to handle a set of thesauri (independent thesaurus) or a specialized IR expert system which can be very performant but strongly tied to a specific area (integrated thesaurus).
