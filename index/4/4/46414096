This paper describes the first stages of an experimental investigation into the effects of using various calculi to propagate uncertainty in an interactive expert system for information retrieval. We interpret uncertainty values as partial truths rather than probabilities, and draw upon the mathematics of multi-valued logic in developing our analysis. We conclude that specification of an uncertainty calculus is a subtle problem that interacts in several ways with the scheme used to represent the expert knowledge.
