To enable students and researchers to concentrate on individual primitives, an operating system is designed with replaceable program parts. In particular, classroom and individual study projects may be assigned which give the students actual practice with a real multiprogramming system. Such projects would replace the simulation exercises usually found in operating systems courses. The minicomputer hardware and software features described here are within reach of most small computer science departments.
