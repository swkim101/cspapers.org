The developing system described here is planned to provide the business executive with useful applications for the computer processing of correspondence in the office environment. Applications will include the synopsis and abstraction of incoming mail and a variety of critiques of newly-generated letters, all based upon the capability of understanding the natural language text at least to a level corresponding to customary business communication. Successive sections of the paper describe the Background and Prior Work, the planned System Output, and Implementation.
