In this paper, we propose a path planning and dispatch strategy of multiple mobile robots for cooperative applications in confined spaces. The proposed two level path planning method incorporates the segment reservation mechanism to maximize the utilization of robots. The two level path planning reduces the computational complexity while providing the flexibility for real-time adaptation. Any potential deadlock is completely eliminated and the starvation due to unpredictable service request patterns is avoided. Since the proposed methodology is used for confined areas, any possible path blockage due to idling robots is eliminated with idling robot relocation mechanism. The dynamic path planning is achieved by monitoring and controlling the speed of the robots. The dynamic replanning is triggered with periodic monitoring of the service constraints. The method can be effectively used for low power multiple robot navigation applications and the performance of the proposed system is evaluated with largescale simulations.
