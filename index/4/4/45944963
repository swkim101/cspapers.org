Our two-semester capstone classes are required for all computer science majors. Students must have completed a software engineering course — capstone classes are typically taken during their last two semesters. Project proposals come from a variety of sources, including industry, WSU faculty (from our own and other departments), local agencies, and entrepreneurs. We have recently targeted projects in AI — although students typically have little background, they find the ideas and methods compelling. This paper outlines our instructional approach and reports our experiences with three projects.
