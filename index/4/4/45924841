This paper decribes a mobile robot project which uses both a vision system and a plan- ning system in order to facilitate navigation by a mo- bile robot. Using a model of a known environment, a. global plan is prodiiccd and rcprcscnt.cd as an or- dered list of landmarks. In parallel, a vision system is used to build a world model in the form of a 3D surface occupancy grid. Having placed the landmark in the occupancy grid, a choice can be made between generating either a cautious or an economical local plan which provides a complete analogical route for the robot to follow in order to reach its goal.
