In order to relate machine learning problems we argue that we need to 
be able to articulate what is meant by a single machine learning problem. By 
attempting to name the various aspects of a learning problem we hope to clarify 
ways in which learning problems might be related to each other. We tentatively put 
forward a proposal for an anatomy of learning problems that will serve as scaffolding 
for posing questions about relations. After surveying the way learning problems are 
discussed in a range of repositories and services. We then argue that the terms 
used to describe problems to better understand a range of viewpoints within 
machine learning ranging from the theoretical to the practica
