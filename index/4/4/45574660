A generic control scheme is proposed to study the properties of a class of active compliant motion control methods that have been presented in literature. The paper concentrates on active force control methods. However, the similarity with other types of external sensor feedback is quite straightforward. It is shown that "type 1"-systems (i.e. one integration in the forward path) exhibit the most interesting properties. In addition it is shown that all active force control methods require a comparable degree of passive compliance in order to yield a comparable execution speed and disturbance rejection capability.
