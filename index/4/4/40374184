This paper discusses relationships between statistical modeling techniques and symbolic learning from examples, and indicates types of learning problem where a combined viewpoint may be very helpful. A novel computational approach is proposed which combines statistical modeling with a transformation procedure which maps the statistical model onto logical decision rules for the sake of domain experts' intuitions. The proposed algorithm is illustrated by working through a simple but challenging case-study on learning prognostic rules from clinical observational data.
