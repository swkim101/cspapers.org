A new exploration method for mobile robots is presented applicable especially in home and office environment. For calculating new robot positions, the method uses an iterative algorithm based on a cost function. The closer area surrounding each position is scanned and simultaneously cleaned, using an extensible arm with an end-effector. The new approach enables the robot to clean any floor space fast and thoroughly, requiring only low processing power.
