Virtual agents have been used as tools in negotiationâ€”from acting as mediators to manifesting as full-fledged conversational partners. Virtual agents are a powerful tool for teaching negotiation skills, but require an accurate model of human behavior to perform well both as partners and teachers. The work proposed here aims to expand the current horizon of virtual negotiating agents to utilize humanlike strategies. Further agents developed using this framework should be cognizant of the social factors influencing negotiation, including reputation effects and the implications of long-term repeated relationships. A roadmap of current efforts to develop agent platforms and future expansions is discussed.
