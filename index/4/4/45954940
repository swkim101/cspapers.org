This paper deals with a survey of the bachelor's and master's degree graduates from the Department of Computer and Information Science at The Ohio State University conducted during 1975. The purpose of the survey was (1) to determine what positions the graduates held, (2) to determine how effective the curricula had been, (3) to obtain an evaluation of these curricula, (4) to determine possible improvements, and (5) to see if there were distinctions between bachelor's and master's degree recipients. Some of the results about the bachelor's degree graduates have already been reported in Kalmey [74]. As of August 1974, the Department had conferred about 600 Bachelors, 280 Masters and 17 Ph.D. degrees.
