In this paper, we focused on optimizing the total cost of bidirectional ring topology in the metropolitan area by proposing an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation integrated with optimal traffic splitting. Our simulation results give the lowest total cost in comparison with random case and heuristic method based on maximizing total single-hop traffic. In case of considering only the bandwidth of ring, our typical result improve up to 22% more than the random case and around 4% more than the simple heuristic method.
