In this paper a nonlinear controller is presented for Doubly-Fed Induction Machine (DFIM) drives. The nonlinear controller is designed based on input-output feedback linearization control technique, using the fifth order model of induction machine in fixed stator d ,q axis reference frames with stator currents and rotor flux components as state variables. The nonlinear controller can perfectly track the torque and flux reference signals. Two level SVM-PWM back- to-back voltage source inverters are employed in the rotor circuit, in order to make the drive system capable of operating in the motoring and generating modes below and above synchronous speed. Computer simulation results obtained, confirm the effectiveness and validity of the proposed control approach.
