We present the framework of ontology-based data access, a semantic paradigm for providing a convenient and user-friendly access to data repositories, which has been actively developed and studied in the past decade. Focusing on relational data sources, we discuss the main ingredients of ontology-based data access, key theoretical results, techniques, applications and future challenges.
