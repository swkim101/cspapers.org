This paper proposes an MMSE detector applying the reciprocal lattice reduction (LR) in MIMO systems. The proposed detector achieves as good as or better BER performances than the LR aided detector using the conventional LLL algorithm and using the Seysen's algorithm in the 4×4 and the 8×8 MIMO systems. It also achieves BER curves to be as steep as or steeper than those using the maximum likelihood detector.
