Communication security for wireless sensor networks (WSN) is a challenge due to the limited computation and energy resources available at nodes. We describe the design and implementation of a public-key (PK) platform based on a standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip that extends the capability of a standard node. The result facilitates message security services such as confidentiality, authenticity and integrity. We present results including computation time, energy consumption and cost.
