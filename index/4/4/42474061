The file processing efficiency of the ICL Search Engine CAFS (Content Addressable File Store) is studied by means of detailed simulation experiments. The suitability of CAFS to different file structures and processing operations is critically assessed, and processing environments have been identified where the use of CAFS offers only marginal benefits and where it is actually counter-productive. We also provide concrete recommendations concerning the optimal deployment of CAFS as well as guidelines for the tuning of its performance parameters. In addition, the strengths and weaknesses of the CAFS architecture are assessed and some improvements to its current design are proposed.
