Autonomous driving system can assist to prevent the traffic accidents caused by the negligence of the driver. Obstacle detection and warning mechanism plays an important role in this research field. In this paper, we adopt the computer vision technology because of its large detecting range and abundant information when compared to other kinds of sensors. The proposed system is suitable for both the simplified environment such as freeway and the urban environment with complex background. Thus, the result here improves traffic safety not only for drivers, but also for all pedestrians on the road.
