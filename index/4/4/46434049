MEL HORSE has been developed for studying quadruped robots and biped robots. Biped robot "MEL Deinonychus II" is a fore-portion of "MEL HORSE II" developed by the author (1996, 1999). To develop a legged robot, one can not avoid the problem of how to control the robot in real-time. Particularly, the zero moment point (ZMP) control is hard work. In this paper, a new approach to generate ZMP reference trajectory of quadruped robot, biped robot and other type legged robot is proposed. Simulation results are also explained.
