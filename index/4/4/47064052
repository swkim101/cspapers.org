This paper describes our efforts to investigate factors in user's browsing behavior to automatically evaluate web pages that the user shows interest in. To evaluate web pages automatically, we developed a client-side logging/analyzing tool: the GINIS Framework. This work focuses primarily on client-side user behavior using a customized web browser and AJAX technologies. First, GINIS unobtrusively gathers logs of user behavior through the user.s natural interaction with the web browser. Then it analyses the logs and extracts effective rules to evaluate web pages using C4.5 machine learning system. Eventually, GINIS becomes able to automatically evaluate web pages using these learned rules.
