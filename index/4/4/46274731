OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) technique is a promising candidate for the most of current and future modern wireless communication systems. It however suffers from two major drawbacks, namely the high PAPR and ICI. The later is present only in time varying channels. To combat with these problems various researchers of the current era have proposed numerous techniques. However most of the known techniques fail considerably when the channel characteristics change considerably within symbol duration. An analytical model for an alternative technique is proposed in this paper. This model maintains the major advantages of OFDM and gives better solutions to both PAPR and ICI problems. It keeps all the global OFDM structure but unlike OFDM this model uses TDM technique instead of FDM, which is used in OFDM. This suggests considering it a symbol-level TDM (SLTDM) technique. In this paper we have proposed the SLTDM analytical model, which follows the similar steps as we have in OFDM analytic model. Simulation results confirmed the SLTDM supremacy over OFDM in time varying channels
