ELoquent Video ExpressionS (ELVES) is a communication system for people who have difficulty expressing complex ideas because of linguistic or neurological limitations. Users employ a simple gesture-based video editor to construct expressions that demonstrate their ideas visually. ELVES includes an extensive scenario library that contains detailed depictions of common activities. The user chooses scenarios with subsections that are useful for expressing a particular idea and then combines the subsections into a new video expression. The underlying technology is digital video, which is stored and transmitted electronically. Users can therefore create correspondence in addition to expressions that are used for immediate communication.
