In this paper, we proposes an actuator fault reconstruction scheme for a class of dynamical hybrid systems (DHS) based on sliding mode observer (SMO). To guarantee the asymptotically stability of the estimation error dynamic and compute the observer gains, the quadratic Lyaponov function and Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) are used. Finally, numerical example of hybrid model is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
