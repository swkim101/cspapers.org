To take advantage of the performance enhancements provided by multicore processors, new instruction set architectures (ISAs) and parallel programming libraries have been investigated across multiple industrial segments. This paper investigates the impact of parallelization libraries and distinct ISAs on the soft error reliability of two multicore ARM processor models (i.e., Cortex-A9 and Cortex-A72), running Linux Kernel and benchmarks with up to 87 billion instructions. An extensive soft error evaluation with more than 1.2 million simulation hours, considering ARMv7 and ARMv8 ISAs and the NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB) suite is presented.
