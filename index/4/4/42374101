Real-time systems with functional dependencies between tasks often require guarantees on end-to-end delays. For many of these systems, end-to-end deadline misses are accepted if one can limit their frequency. Such systems are called weaklyhard. Recent work has shown that typical worst-case analysis (TWCA) can compute an upper bound on the number of potential deadline misses in a sequence of activations of a task chain. In a joint collaboration between Thales and TU Braunschweig, the use of TWCA to limit the number of deadline misses in an aerial video tracking (AVT) system was evaluated. The AVT case-study, the complete automated model-based tool chain from the design environment to the timing verification using TWCA, as well as the results of the evaluation will be presented in the demonstration. The tool chain involves four tools: the design modeling tool CAPELLA extended by a performance viewpoint which allows annotating the design model with timing properties needed to perform TWCA, the pivot model TEMPO which handles mismatches between the semantics of the design model and the semantics of the model used in TWCA, the scheduling analysis tool pyCPA that performs TWCA and finally the graphical tool TimingGraphics used to visualize the TWCA results. To show the pertinence of the use of TWCA, we will also compare in the demonstration the obtained results with those obtained using worst-case analysis and simulation.
