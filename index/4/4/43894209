It's been said many times that semantic nets are more notational variants of "predicate calculas". But before we lay down our nets, and embraoe Logic, we ought at least to be clear about what "predicate calculas" is. We advance some clarificatory points to this effect. Moreover, there seams to be at least one feature of some net/frame schemes that defy simple translation into standard formalisms: "prototypes", Yet this feature is not itself without diffculties, some of which we address here. In the end, we plead for an open mind and a search for formal-semantical alternatives to "classical logic".
