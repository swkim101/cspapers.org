The Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado has recently developed a graduate curriculum in Business-Oriented Computing. The program was developed in recognition of the increasing demand for individuals who are trained in both business methodology and computer science. The 30 semester hour program is designed to produce masters level computer scientists capable of integrating the needs of the business community with the technology of computer science.
 Prerequisites for the program include a Bachelor's degree in Business (or the equivalent), ten semester hours of computing, and nine semester hours of upper division mathematics. The prerequisite computing courses are: Introduction to Computer Science for Business Majors (CS 202), a four hour course in COBOL programming; Business Data Processing Methods (CS 312), a three hour course in FORTRAN emphasizing business applications; and Assembly Language and System Software (CS 400). The mathematics courses are typically in the areas of statistics, probability theory, mathematical programming, computability, and linear algebra. At the University of Colorado, the programming and mathematics courses can be taken in the undergraduate Computer Based Information Systems option of the Business School curriculum.
