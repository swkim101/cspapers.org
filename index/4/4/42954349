In this paper, we consider a high-fidelity Convoy Movement Problem motivated by the coordination and routing of convoys within a road transportation network in an urban city. It encompasses two classical combinatorial optimization problems - vehicle routing and resource constrained scheduling. We present an effective hybrid algorithm to dynamically manage the movement of convoys, where we combine the standard Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm with constraint programming techniques. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated with testing on varying problem sizes and complexity.
