The purpose of this workshop was to discuss both recent experimental findings and computational models of the neurobiological implementation of selective attention. Recent experimental results were presented in two of the four presentations given (C.E. Connor, Washington University and B.C. Motter, SUNY and V.A. Medical Center, Syracuse), while the other two talks were devoted to computational models (E. Niebur, Caltech, and B. Olshausen, Washington University).
