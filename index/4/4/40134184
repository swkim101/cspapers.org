We all dream of the day when a design can be done at an abstract architectural level and then with the push of a button :t N converted to the real world silicon im lamentation of our choice. % Today this 1s not just a pipe dream for designers, It 1s a real worl im erative, demanded by the pressures of shrionkmg time to market, @creased end product & nationality and more com lex slh$on architectures. T@ panel wll examme the racticality of technology indeJ’ z pen ent desl nusing currently avadable technology (tools an ICS) and what the future should t and will hol from both a user and vendor perspective. Questions about technolo 8 independence -necessarily focus around logic synthes~s. Gate arrays, PLDs and now FP ~ pro~d~ des~gn engineers a broad sel~ctlon of loglc design reahzatlons. This ha~ resulted in a ro}lferatlon of solutlon-s eclflc design processes and tool d’ { sets su plied by semlconduc~or an third party vendors. Eac of them have their own unique E algorlt mlc a preach to solving the synthesis problem. PLD synthesis has taken advantage of ? the PLD’s re atively simple structure and has used exhaustive fitting of the optimized netlist to the available devices. ASIC synthesis (primarily Gate Array) has taken advantage of the large number and regular layout of gates.
