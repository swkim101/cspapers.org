Mobile Remote Presence (MRP) system that uses a smart device such as smartphone and tablet pc as video conferencing equipment is getting popular. There are varieties of smart devices, and the appearance of a smart device varies from one to another. We assumed that the appropriate interpersonal distance for an MRP system varies depending on the appearance of the smart device. To confirm our assumption, we conducted a preliminary experiment. The result of the experiment suggested that the value of the proper interpersonal distance increases as the video size increases. It is known that the task load of the remote operator of the MRP system increases if the operator is forced to manually control the MRP system to keep the interpersonal distance to the appropriate level, which adversely affects the quality of the communication through MRP. To resolve the problem, we propose PoliTel, a novel MRP system which autonomously adjusts the interpersonal distance according to the appearance of the smart device by controlling the position or video size of MRP, and allows the operator to concentrate more on the conversation with the person facing to the MRP system.
