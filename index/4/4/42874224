A six-step, iterative, empirical, human factors design methodology was used to develop <bold><italic>CAL,</italic></bold>a natural language computer application to help computer-naive business professionals manage their personal calendars. Language is processed by a simple, non-parsing algorithm having limited storage requirements and a quick response time. <bold><italic>CAL</italic></bold> allows unconstrained English inputs from users with no training (except for a 5 minute introduction to the keyboard and display) and no manual (except for a two-page overview of the system). In a controlled test of performance, <bold><italic>CAL</italic></bold> correctly responded to between 86% and 97% of the inputs it received, according to various criteria. This research demonstrates that the methodological tools of the engineering psychologist can help build user-friendly software that accommodates the unruly language of computer-naive, first-time users by eliciting the cooperation of such users as partners in an iterative, empirical development process.
 The principal purpose of the research reported here was to design and test a systematic, empirical methodology for developing natural language computer applications. This paper describes that methodology and its successful use in the development of a natural language computer application: <bold><italic>CAL,</italic></bold><bold><italic>C</italic></bold>alendar <bold><italic>A</italic></bold>ccess <bold><italic>L</italic></bold>anguage. The limited context or domain in which the application operates is the management of a personal calendar, or appointment book, data base by computer-naive business professionals.
