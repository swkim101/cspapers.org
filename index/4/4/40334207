Information technology projects are growing in complexity and require teams to solve problems and develop solutions. With current undergraduate, computer science and information systems curricula, students graduate with technical skills, but lack team project experiences. We have identified and developed team knowledge modules that are being taught to students in an effort to increase awareness of team process fundamentals and build the foundation of an effective team player. In this paper we present the challenges that we face with team projects and then discuss team knowledge modules that are being taught to incoming freshmen to engage students in a curriculum that requires team projects in each course. We conclude with our assessment results and show comparisons of student team knowledge by instruction and experience.
