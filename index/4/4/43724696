In this paper we propose a new production system called Interactive Graph Production System (IGPS) which represents situations which have interactions. An IGPS is constructed by two labelled directed graphs and two sets of production rules which control interactions and changing of situations. First, IGPS is defined. Then we show examples of IGPS: three coin problem and monkey and banana problem, for making clear structure and move of an IGPS. Next execution of IGPS is discussed. IGPS interpreter must have some functions for efficient execution of IGPS. And for making productions efficiently, we need graph production editting system which enables us to handle graph productions in graphical forms.
