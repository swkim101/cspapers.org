Curriculum 78 was developed to present an undergraduate degree program in Computer Science at any university, with appropriate adaptation to each specific environment; in general the degree program suggested applies most naturally to relatively large universities. Because small universities have limited resources—students, faculty, computing facilities—the implementation of Curriculum 78 requires careful modification to fit the particular environment. By organizing the topics covered by the suggested courses in Curriculum 78 in different combinations and emphasizing microcomputers, the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Loyola University can offer a complete degree program in Computer Science in spite of its limited resources.
