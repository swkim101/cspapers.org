Even as machine learning has expanded into the realm of social decision-making, where concerns of bias and justice often rise above those of efﬁ-ciency and accuracy, the ﬁeld has remained committed to standard ML techniques that conceive of fairness in terms of statistical metrics and rely heavily on historical data as accurate and neutral representations of the world. So long as the ﬁeld conforms to these methods and believes it can optimize systems according to universal notions of fairness, machine learning will be ill-suited to address the fundamentally political and ethical considerations at stake when deploying algorithms in the public sphere. The design and adoption of machine learning tools in high-stakes social contexts should be as much a matter of democratic deliberation as of technical analysis.
