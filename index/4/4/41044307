The talk will be a little sightseeing tour through some areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science that I found and find fascinating 
 
The tour may touch on the development of a gamblers fortune, the multiplication of numbers and of matrices, probabilistic tests of primality and the complexity of continued fractions.
