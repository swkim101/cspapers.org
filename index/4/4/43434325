The authors propose a method for detecting and following a half-faded lane mark on an asphalt road using image processing. It ensures reliable detection and high speed following in the actual outdoor environment. The method is based on a template matching between a lane mark model and a detected lane mark. The authors built a testbed robot, which aims to repaint a half-faded lane mark semi-automatically. The details of this testbed robot and experimental results of a half-faded lane mark detection and following are described. Experimental results (trajectories of this robot) for a actual half-faded lane mark show the availability of this method.
