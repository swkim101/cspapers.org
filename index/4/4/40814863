We present a recently proposed theory of grammar, Optimality Theory (OT; Prince & Smolensky 1991, 1993). The principles of OT derive in large part from the high-level principles governing computation in connectionist networks. The talk proceeds as follows: (1) we summarize OT and its applications to UG. The we present (2) learning and (3) parsing algorithms for OT. Finally, (4) we show how crucial elements of OT emerge from connectionism, and discuss the one central feature of OT which so far eludes connectionist explanation.
