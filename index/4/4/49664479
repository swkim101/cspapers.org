Existing static analyses model activity transitions in Android apps context-insensitively, making it impossible to distinguish different activity launch modes, reducing the pointer analysis precision for an activity's callbacks, and potentially resulting in infeasible activity transition paths. In this paper, we introduce Chime, a launch-mode-aware context-sensitive activity transition analysis that models different instances of an activity class according to its launch mode and the transitions between activities context-sensitively, by working together with an object-sensitive pointer analysis. Our evaluation shows that our context-sensitive activity transition analysis is more precise than its context-insensitive counterpart in capturing activity transitions, facilitating GUI testing, and improving the pointer analysis precision.
