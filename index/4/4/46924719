We demonstrate the serverless deployment of neural networks for model inferencing in NLP applications using Amazonâ€™s Lambda service for feedforward evaluation and DynamoDB for storing word embeddings. Our architecture realizes a pay-per-request pricing model, requiring zero ongoing costs for maintaining server instances. All virtual machine management is handled behind the scenes by the cloud provider without any direct developer intervention. We describe a number of techniques that allow efficient use of serverless resources, and evaluations confirm that our design is both scalable and inexpensive.
