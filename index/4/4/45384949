The simulator described functions within an object-cell oriented design environment. Leaf and composite cells are treated as abstract data types (objects) and their definition within a design is recursive. The leaf cells are simulated at the switch level using a functional description of transistor groups in terms of decision diagrams. These diagrams are extracted during a preprocessing step.
