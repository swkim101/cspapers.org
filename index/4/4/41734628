Electric cars sharing system is a new mode of urban ecologic transportation increasing in the world. The exploitation of this transport system requires repositioning strategies. Rebalancing system is costly for the operator (number of trucks, number of cars) and the high number of tours of redistribution trucks between stations leave a pollution impact on the environment, therefore car sharing systems their contribution to improving the environment remains one of its main assets, risk of not hold. In this paper we present a pertinent model capable to reproducing the real functioning of car sharing systems using the stochastic Petri Net. The proposed approach is envisioned to permit planners improving the organization, dimensioning and management of this system in the city.
