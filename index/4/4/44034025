A structure of intelligence is discussed and chosen as a conceptual background in a joint effort of a number of research teams working under supervision of the Belvoir Research and Development (R&D) Center. The structure is described as a multi-level hierarchy of production systems united by a single knowledge database. Some of the particular solutions for the components of this structure prove its generic character and trace a plan for the future research effort.
