This paper is concerned with the problem of generalizing theorems about recursively defined functions, so as to make these theorems amenable to proof by induction. Some generalization heuristics are presented for certain special forms of theorems about functions specified by certain recursive schemas. The heuristics are based upon the analysis of computational sequences associated with the schemas. If applicable, the heuristics produce generalizations that are guaranteed to be theorems.
