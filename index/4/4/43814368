The premise of this panel is that most introductory Computer Science courses are too narrowly focused on teaching students a programming language. This is a controversy that has been debated for years, but in recent years seems to have been forgotten. The writers of Computing Curricula 1991 stated:"Many feel that the amount of attention traditionally paid to the syntax of a programming language in the first course is excessive, and ought to be replaced with a more balanced introduction to the discipline. For these reasons, PR: Introduction to a Programming Language is defined as a separate knowledge unit in Part II, but is not a required part of the common requirements. "[1]This panel will present a review of current, typical first year courses and evidence for the case against focusing those courses on the teaching of a programming language. Next, each panelist will present his or her philosophy for a first course, followed by details of the courses at their school that implement their view, and conclude with outcomes and evidence of success of the courses.The panel includes four experienced CS-1/CS-2 educators, two of whom are members of the Computing Curriculum 2001 Pedagogy Focus Group on Introductory Courses and Topics (including the chair), and two of whom are authors of introductory texts that do not focus on teaching a programming language.
