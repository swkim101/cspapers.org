A system selection procedure, proposed in a previous paper is implemented in the selection of microprocessor equipment to satisfy specified design criteria. The procedure is composed of stages involving curve fitting and minimization. A particular example, illustrating the implementation of the procedure, along with final recommendations, is presented.
