A general solution to the data transformation problem is essential for the coexistence of arbitrary data models within one and the same data base application or system. The described method of data transformation is founded on the ideas of conceptualization and deep structure well-known in linguistics. A method of conceptualization as well as some notes on a conceptual or deep-structure data model are presented. The data transformation method can be applied to any data model, and in particular to the coexistence architecture of DBMS, where the deep structure of data is chosen as a basis for the central schema.
