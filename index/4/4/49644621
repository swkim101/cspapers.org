This paper describes work in continuous reasoning, where formal reasoning about a (changing) codebase is done in a fashion which mirrors the iterative, continuous model of software development that is increasingly practiced in industry. We suggest that advances in continuous reasoning will allow formal reasoning to scale to more programs, and more programmers. The paper describes the rationale for continuous reasoning, outlines some success cases from within industry, and proposes directions for work by the scientific community.
