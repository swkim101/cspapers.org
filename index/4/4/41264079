This paper presents a real-time speed control for a linear tubular permanent magnet direct current motor (LTPMDCM) by using artificial neural network (ANN). Firstly, a novel form of LTPMDCM prototype has been developed for linear motions. Then, a low cost motor drive has designed for expected rapid response and precise position control. Software developed in MATLAB environment is used for speed control. Through this software, real-time speed control of the motor with ANN has been performed. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is verified by experimental results and presented.
