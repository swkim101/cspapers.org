This paper proposes a distributed and autonomous control method for generating the shape of a group that consists of multiple mobile robots. This control method is called linear autonomous system (LAS). With LAS, the controllability of group shape can be defined. This is because a decision of a shape of the group corresponds to designing a potential field that is spread on a space of relative distance between mobile robots. Since each mobile robot has parameter for designing the spread potential field, a shape of the group can be adapted to various situations by means of changing the parameters with respect to state of environment, for example, the position of wall, a velocity of an obstacle, etc. Effectiveness of this control method is verified by a computer simulation. It means that a mobile robot is captured by a group that consists of multiple mobile robots.<<ETX>>
