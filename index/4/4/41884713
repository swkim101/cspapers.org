In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid fiber-wireless radio over fiber/ millimeter-wave (RoF/MMW) system using bidirectional amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying. Unlike conventional architecture, where only one type of transport media (e.g., copper, optical fiber, or wireless link) is used, both optical fiber and MMW wireless connection are employed in our proposal. We design the architecture of the central station (CS), the remote antenna unit (RAU), and the remote radio heads (RRHs) to implement the AF relaying technique. The proposed architecture is simplified significantly since it requires only a fiber with a single wavelength as well as a wireless link with a single MMW frequency for bidirectional transmission. The performance of the proposed system is investigated under the effect of various physical layer impairments. The numerical results not only demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed architecture but also indicate the gain in terms of throughput when AF relaying is used.
