This paper will focus on an approach to teaching a stylistic subset of COBOL in such a manner that students are equipped with the “safe” way to program from the outset, even if this means “hiding” some of the more “dangerous” features of the language from them until they can better cope with them. This approach places the highest priority on teaching techniques which go beyond effectiveness to the broader objectives of adaptability and continued effectiveness in the face of change.
