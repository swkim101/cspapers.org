Robot-assistance has been recently used to perform splenectomy for hematological disorders. Studies 
describing the technique and indications to robot-assisted splenectomy have been reviewed.Its use as an alternative to the standard laparoscopic splenectomy is particularly beneficial in more challenging cases due to anatomical or iatrogenic conditions. A careful preoperative work-up and intraoperative evaluation are mandatory to discriminate whether robot-assistance could be useful. Moreover, robot-assisted splenectomy remains an essential teaching model before approaching more difficult procedures.
