This machine is specially designed powerful enough to implement an efficient LISP interpreter in microcodes. A LISP processer module and a main memory module are connected to the unibus of a LSI-11 system. The LISP processer module is the microcoded device with a writable control storage that interprets a LISP program in the main memory. Four microprocesser slices(Am 2903) and one microprogram sequencer(Am 2910) are used.
