The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE), first administered in 1937, were initiated as a joint venture of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the graduate school deans of four eastern United States universities. When Educational Testing Service (ETS) began operations in January 1, 1948, it assumed responsibility for the examinations and the program in which they were used. Until 1966, ETS constructed the tests and operated the testing program with the advice of a committee appointed by the Association of Graduate Schools (AGS) within the Association of American Universities. After several graduate schools suggested that it would be both desirable and appropriate to have a broader representation of the graduate education community participate in the program's policy decisions, the Graduate Record Examinations Board was established in 1966.
