Failure can be defined as a state that occurs after the violation of an expectation; a common example of a dialogue failure would be a misunderstanding. Our first observation is that dialogue failure can be just as complex as any other sort of failure. Some dialogue failures require sophisticated analytic mechanisms to isolate their causes, and in some cases even detecting a failure will require substantial effort. In addition, dialogue failure introduces some complexities of its own. For example, it is necessary to distinguish between failures occurring in dialogue and those merely reported there. On the face of it this seems an obvious enough distinction, but in analyzing dialogue protocols there is a temptation to conflate the two. Many reports of non-dialogue failures are also dialogue failures since the reports violate some of the hearer's expectations about the course that the dialogue will take. (The report may come as an interruption of, say, a question-answer sequence.) One should not conclude from this, however, that all reports of external failure are necessarily dialogue failures as well; to do so would be to adopt an oversimplified model that will lead to confusion.
