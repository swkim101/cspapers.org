Building HPC systems from small, cost/effective production nodes has been a favored engineering approach for many years. Technology has driven a variety of solutions over time. Today, commodity SMP nodes and interconnection networks, together with highly evolved programming models and parallel software engineering tools make a compelling combination. An overview of these topics will be presented, together with some specific solution examples. Open problems and issues will be discussed.
