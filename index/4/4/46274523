An input/output system of intelligent, programmable, solid-state power I/O modules inherently distributed to the point of control through integrated serial communications has been developed to provide a stand-alone, user-configurable I/O module. Design of this special I/O product was driven by the demand for greater diagnostics capability and lower installed costs required by programmable controller users. The product development, involving a new 5,500 gate equivalent VLSI chip and a smart power switch, required a high degree of computer simulation to reduce development cycles and provide a design optimizing reliability without adding unnecessary cost. This paper will outline the product and its advances in the programmable control market followed by a discussion of how computer simulation was used in the design.
