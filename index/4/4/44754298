Real-time systems and systems to interface human work environments will dominate the growth of computer applications over the next decade. These systems must execute their functions with the time-liness and responsiveness required in these environments. The design, development and testing of such systems must guarantee performance as well as functionality and reliability. There is not yet in place a technology to support this requirement for engineering of performance. The research and development community in performance has focused primarily on analysis and deduction rather than the performance arena. This talk will define and discuss the tasks of engineering performance into software systems and describe the recent progress towards this goal.
