In this paper, audio servo robot system which was a servo system using audio information as feedback signal was considered. Since the sampling rate of audio signal and that of robot controller are usually different, the system is able to be treated as a multi-rate system. Since it is general that the sampling rate of the output is faster than that of the input, the controller obtains more information than a single-rate servo system. By using this property, an adaptive audio servo system was proposed. Results of a computer simulation and an experiment showed effectiveness of the method.
