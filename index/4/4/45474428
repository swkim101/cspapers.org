Genetic algorithm is very powerful tool at different optimization domain. It's known very well that pressure is one of the most important and effective parameter in fuel cell Performance. In this paper, two-variable GA was applied to determine the optimum value of anode and cathode pressure of a monocell PEMFC. A quasi two dimensional model is presented for the PEMFC and used as fitness function of genetic algorithm.
