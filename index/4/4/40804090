Outline The classical transaction concept has been widely adopted in academia and in industry. That transaction model guarantees the ACID properties atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability. In the last few years, for nontraditional applications like CAD/CAM, CASE, collaborative editing, etc. that traditional model has been found to be inadequate. To address the unique requirements of such applications and also to model business processes (workflow) which involve executing multiple interrelated transactions potentially on behalf of multiple users, several advanced transaction models have been proposed. Some of the latter are: Nested Transactions, Sagas, ConTract model, Flex Transaction model, Split-Transactions, etc. While much of the work has been done in academic research projects, some industrial groups are also actively working on these topics. Unfortunately, currently commercially available products incorporate very few of these results. Application writers have had to deal with the recovery and other consequences of splitting long running activities into multiple transactions. Even the decade-old nested transaction model is supported only by a handful of products, mostly in a primitive form.
