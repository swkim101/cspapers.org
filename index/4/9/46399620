This paper addresses the chaos synchronization of two identical drive-response Liu chaotic systems and its application in secure communication. Based on the vector norm approach, a control law is developed and applied to synchronize both systems' states. The obtained synchronization scheme is implemented using analog circuits and applied for chaos masking communication. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed communication system.
