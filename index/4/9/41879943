This paper proposes a new relay selection scheme for wireless cooperative networks that effectively distributes traffic of packets from source nodes to the sink. By estimating the rate in two hops from source to relay and relay to destination, the source can choose the most optimal relay node to forward its messages. Simulation results indicate that our scheme is efficient in increasing packet delivery ratio and decreasing average energy consumption.
