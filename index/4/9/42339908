Integrating Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) into our curricula can provide students with a rich, motivating learning experience that helps them develop technical as well as soft skills. However, integrating FOSS into curricula does have its challenges. This birds-of-a-feather (BoF) seeks to bring together faculty to discuss challenges, share resources, share solutions, and make connections. So, whether you are considering integrating FOSS into a class for the first time, or you are looking for ways to improve what you are already doing, this BoF is for you. Members of the Teaching Open Source (http://teachingopensource.org) and the foss2serve (http://foss2serve.org/) communities will help guide the discussion and be on hand for questions.
