Sadly we know that virtually all software of any significance has residual errors. Some of those errors can be traced back to requirements flaws or faulty design assumptions; others are just plain coding mistakes. Static analyzers have become quite good at spotting these types of errors, but they donâ€™t scale very well. If, for instance, you need to check a code base of a few million lines you better be prepared to wait for the result; sometimes hours. Eyeballing a large code base to find flaws is clearly not an option, so what is missing is a static analysis capability that can be used to answer common types of queries interactively, even for large code bases. I will describe the design and use of such a tool in this talk.
