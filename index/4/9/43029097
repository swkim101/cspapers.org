An alloy steel having superior ductility and a low rate of work hardening for use in severe cold forming processes to provide products with high static and dynamic strength, the alloy steel consisting essentially of from about 0.28% to about 0.33% by weight carbon, from about 0.25% to about 0.65% by weight manganese, up to about 0.15% by weight silicon, from about 0.0005% to about 0.0035% by weight boron, from about 0.4% to about 0.7% by weight nickel, from about 0.4% to about 0.6% by weight chromium, from about 0.15% to about 0.25% by weight molybdenum, and the remainder being iron with minor amounts of impurities and additional alloying elements; a high strength forged tool made from the alloy steel; and the method of forming high strength forged tools including the steps of providing a solid metal slug of the alloy steel, annealing the metal slug for spheroidization to a hardness in the range RB70 to RB76, cold forming the annealed metal slug into the final shape of the tool, and thereafter heat hardening the formed tool to a hardness in the range RC48 to RC52, the annealed yield strength of the alloy steel being about 41,290 PSI and the reduction of area of the alloy steel being about 72%.
