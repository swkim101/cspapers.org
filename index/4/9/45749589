The common instructional approach in first programming courses is to consider jointly programming technique and coding in a particular language. This has the inherent disadvantage of focusing on language details at the expense of the skills of problem solving. As an alternative, a separated, but coordinated, course in programming concepts and a laboratory on language coding are proposed. We submit that this approach allows emphasis to be placed on the creative aspects of problem solving and programming, and that it allows an efficiency in concepts instruction, through avoidance of language details, and an efficiency in language instruction by using algorithms developed in the concepts course. A suggested selection of concepts is given, and the separation of responsibilities between the program development and coding are illustrated.
