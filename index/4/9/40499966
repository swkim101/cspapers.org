A typical performance evaluation consists of the identification of resources, the definition of system boundaries, the measurement of external and internal performance variables, and finally the interpretation of data and projection of system performance to hypothetical environments. These projections may be used to estimate the cost savings to be expected when changes are made to the system.
 The fundamental external performance measures such as response time and thruput are intimately related, but may be defined differently depending on how the system is defined. They can be analyzed with respect to the internal performance measures (such as activities, queue lengths and busy times) by applying one or more interpretations such as: absolute utilizations, normalized busy times, system profiles, analysis of response, workload relaxation, and resource consumption hyperplanes. These models, which are generally free of assumptions regarding interarrival and service time distributions, can be adjusted to represent potential changes to the system. Then the interpretations may be used to evaluate the predicted external performance measures.
