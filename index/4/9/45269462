Molecular biology is the study of the molecules that make up living things. These molecules include DNA, RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids etc. Biologists seek to understand the function, structure, location, synthesis, regulation, dynamics, interaction and origin of these molecules. Such a discipline is motivated not only by practical problems in fields like medicine and biotechnology but also by curiosity about life itself. There are a number of data collections in molecular biology that would be much more powerful if they could be used in concert. Our ultimate aim is to be able to make arbitrarily complex queries across these data collections. Ultimately the computer naive user who is an expert biologist should be able to readily make any query without having to know where the data reside, how they are accessed or what programs are used In other words, the biologist should be able to work in an extremely high level way.
