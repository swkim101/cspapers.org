In this paper, a novel genetic algorithm based approach to path planning of a mobile robot is proposed. The major characteristic of the proposed algorithm is that the chromosome has a variable length. The location target and obstacles are included to find a path for a mobile robot in an environment that is a 2D workplace discretized into a grid net. Each cell in the net is a gene. The number of genes in one chromosome depends on the environment. The locations of the robot, the target and the obstacle are marked in the workplace. The proposed algorithm is capable of generating collision-free paths for a mobile robot in both static and dynamic environments. In a static environment, the generated robot path is optimal in the sense of the shortest distance. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by simulation studies.
