My research focuses on investigation and improvement of knowledge representation (KR) language P-log which was designed to reason about both logical and probabilistic knowledge. In particular, I aim to extend P-log with new constructs, clarify its semantics, develop a new efficient inference engine for it and establish its relationship with other related formalisms. Successful completion of this work will greatly increase the scope of practical applications of the language.
