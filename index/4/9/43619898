We study systems consisting of a number of service cells in tandem, each containing a finite buffer. Several policies governing the operation of such systems are described and compared. These include traditional and novel blocking schemes, with applications to computer communications and production lines. In particular, it is shown that kanban, a novel discipline for coordinating cells in a manufacturing context, is obtained by combining two, more basic, concepts: a blocking policy introduced here as minimal blocking, and shared buffers. The Kanban discipline is superior in terms of throughput to the ordinary transfer blocking policy.
A method for analyzing approximately the performance of the Kanban system is also presented. This is based on examining first a single cell in isolation and then combining the isolated cells through fixed-point equations. Some numerical results and comparisons with simulations are included.
