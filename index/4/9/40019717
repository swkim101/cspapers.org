Without question, the most valuable aspects of my experience were cultural. Mauritius is a primarily Hindu country, and I had an opportunity to learn about Hindu culture and traditions. Malaysia is primarily an Islamic country, and I had the chance to experience and learn more about Islam. Since Macalester is a very international college, these will help me greatly in dealing with students from Asia of both Hindu and Islamic origins. I also was able to travel to other schools in the area. For example, while I was in Malaysia, I gave a series of talks at the Hanoi Technical University in Viet Nam. It was a wonderful experience for me.
