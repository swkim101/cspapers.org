Starting in the fall of 2005 our department began a large-scale effort to incorporate hands-on robotics in many of our courses, including our introductory computer science sequence. This followed the establishment of a departmental robotics laboratory and the purchase of a number of different robots. Our efforts include testing a variety of projects and surveying students about their satisfaction with robots. A primary contribution is our development of an algorithmic programming environment for robotics (Robotran) and an associated robot simulator.
