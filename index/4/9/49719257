RAN slicing is one of the key enabler to enable virtualization of a BS and its delivery as a service with different levels of network isolation and sharing so as to accommodate the needs of mobile network operators and verticals. In this demonstration, we show a prototype of a RAN slicing runtime system to enable flexible slice customization on the top of a disaggregated RAN infrastructure [1] with different levels of isolation and sharing in terms of resources and network functions, while retaining the quality of service (QoS) for different slice instances. Furthermore, a novel plug & play network application chaining framework empowered by a network software development kit (SDK) is demonstrated to show how the multi-service programmability on per-slice basis can be achieved. Our demonstration is based on the OpenAirlnterface [3], Mosaic-5G FlexRAN [4] and LL-MEC [2] platforms. Finally, we highlight how the the proposed approach can be extended to an end-to-end network slicing scenario.
