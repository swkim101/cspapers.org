Techniques were developed by which an Algol-like program, given together with its specifications, may be documented automatically. This documentation expresses invariant relationships that hold between program variables at intermediate points in the program, and explains the actual workings of the program regardless of whether the program is correct. These techniques, formulated as deduction rules for both guaranteed invariants and candidate invariants, represent a unification of existing approaches, and sometimes improve upon them.
