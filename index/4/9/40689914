A new type of master robot for teleoperation is proposed. In the proposed master robot, several wires are stretched from a handle which is moved by a human operator. In this paper, the authors explain how many wires are necessary to control a handle with six degrees of freedom in a three dimensional space. Moreover, to feed forces from a slave robot to the handle, an algorithm to determine each wire tension is proposed. Finally, they show experimental results in which a handle is moved by seven wires in a three dimensional space.
