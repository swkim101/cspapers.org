Shore is a persistent object system under development at the University of Wisconsin that represents a merger of key features of object-oriented database (OODB) and file system technologies: Concurrency control and recovery and bulk operations on clustered data as in traditional databases; objects of widely varying sizes with individual identity, globally unique identifiers, and a rich object-oriented type system as in OODB systems; and an open architecture, a uniform, universal hierarchical name space, and controlled sharing of disks with reliably enforced ownership of data and space accounting. A more complete overview of the goals and structure of Share were presented at this conference last year [Carey et al, SIGMOD 94].
