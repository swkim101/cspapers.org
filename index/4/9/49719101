We introduce PassiveVLN, a flexible, modular and software-defined platform for visible light backscatter networks. PassiveVLN incorporates a modular hardware design and a full-stack software implementation, enabling convenient and scalable deployment as well as rapid prototyping for testing new protocols and applications.
