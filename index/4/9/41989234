This session will demonstrate best practices for integrating a variety of student engagement pedagogies into the classroom. Presenters play the role of instructors on the first day of class. Audience members play the role of students as they collaborate on a variety of sample activities. By providing models of active learning in computing contexts, we seek to motivate instructors to adopt these pedagogies in their classrooms. Attendees will be invited to join a growing community of faculty who share resources and best practices. Sufficient time will be reserved for questions and discussion.
