We propose a new real-time self-localization method for a mobile robot equipped with an omni-directional camera in a dynamically changing environment. This method uses direction of two landmarks and dead reckoning. Multiple localization process in parallel results robust and accurate localization. The proposed method applies to the soccer robot in the RoboCup middle-size league and an experimental result indicates that the approach is reliable.
