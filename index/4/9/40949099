Swarm intelligence assisted multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system is presented in this paper. Efficient symbol detection of MIMO system is performed using swarm-intelligence inspired iterative robust stochastic algorithm. Optimized detection based on "memetic" (local search) particle swarm optimization (MPSO) is also proposed. These PSO-MIMO and MPSO-MIMO system detectors significantly reduce the computational complexity as compared to the conventional maximum likelihood (ML) detection technique. The simulation results achieved with these detectors show near ML performance. These new heuristic based symbol detection techniques are efficient for systems using high-order modulation schemes and large number of antennas where conventional ML detector becomes computationally non-practical to use. These proposed detectors are best suited for high- speed wireless communication systems
