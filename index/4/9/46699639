This paper addresses a new active sensor system (Active Antenna) motivated by insect's antenna. The antenna can be characterized by its "flexibility" and "active motions". Based on these observations on insect's antenna, the authors' discuss an active sensor system composing of only four components, an insensitive flexible antenna, a position sensor, a torque sensor, and an actuator. The authors first consider the conditions which allow localisation of any contact point between the insensitive flexible antenna and environment by applying an active motion to the antenna. The authors show that the use of a straight antenna always makes it possible to localise the contact point irrespective of friction at the point of contact. The authors also show that contact point sensing by the use of a circular shaped antenna is weakly influenced by the friction at the point of contact.<<ETX>>
