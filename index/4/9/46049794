This paper presents a new method for determining capacitor placement in distribution networks. The capacitor placement problem consist of finding places to install capacitor bank in an electrical distribution network aiming to reduce losses due to the compensation of the reactive component of power flow. The capacitor placement is hard to solve in sense of global optimization due to the high non linear and mixed integer problem. To solve the problem efficiently, this paper focuses on ant colony algorithm. The approach is multilevel. Two seperate tables of pheromones are maintained by the algorithm. Ants generate solution stochastically, based on these pheromone tables. The pheromone tables are updated priodically, so that pheromone accure more along better solutions. We conclude that the proposed approach is an effective approach for optimally placing capacitors in a distribution network.
