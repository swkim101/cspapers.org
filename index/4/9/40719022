We proposed and developed an innovative active catheter with multi-segments that can bend in the narrow blood vessel. Micro hydraulic actuator system based on new principle has been developed by the authors. Moreover, new three dimensional micro fabrication method named "hybrid stereolithography" (IH process) to make hybrid structure without any assemble process is utilized for miniaturization and leakage-free packaging of the active catheter. Diameter has reached to 1.5 mm at the latest version. Total system with pressure control system was made. Good safety and drive performance were verified experimentally. We also devised theoretical models of these valves to facilitate quantitative design and to extend applications for safe medical tools.
