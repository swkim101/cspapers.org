A theorem is proven which shows that the position and orientation of a specular-reflecting object may be determined using a single camera and unconstrained light source. The camera and light are moved together in a straight line, and specular peaks are noted. From the changes in the location of the peaks, and knowledge of the surface function, the pose of the part may be determined. This paper includes the basic theorem and its proof. Experimental results will be presented at the conference.
