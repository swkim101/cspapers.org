We have proposed, designed and practically implemented Radio Frequency (RF) excitation setup to have an external control over optmechanical oscillations. Side coupled optomechanical structures were fabricated on 220 nm Silicon On Insulator (SOI) wafer and excited using RF excitation setup containing the designed monopole RF antenna.
