This paper treats the problem of programming a digital computer to formulate and solve the algebraic and differential equations characterizing linear and/or nonlinear networks, certain techniques are described which have been used successfully in an experimental program for analyzing transistor switching circuits. The techniques, predicated on a matrix formulation of network equations, include: (a) derivation of all the necessary topological and parameter matrices from input data which specify the network connections and parameters, (b) solution of the nonlinear d-c problem by an iteration procedure, and (c) solution of the transient problem by numerical integration of the nonlinear differential equations separately from the linear differential equations.
