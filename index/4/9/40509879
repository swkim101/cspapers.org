Edge extraction is an important part in the detection of infrared thermal images. Ant colony algorithm has the characteristics of high efficiency, high noise suppression, and comprehensive information of edge information. The basic principle of ant colony algorithm is analyzed. An ant colony optimization algorithm for image edge detection is established. And to have defective parts for analysis of infrared thermography The ant colony algorithm and the classical Canny operator are compared and analyzed. The experimental results show that the algorithm has high efficiency, comprehensive information and high computational efficiency.
