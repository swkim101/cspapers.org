Data sets are growing rapidly nowadays. Recent studies have shown that poor quality data is prevalent in large databases. Owing to missing tuples, the answers expected by users might not appear in the query results. Existing techniques enumerate possible missing tuples to explain why the expected answers are not returned, known as the whynot problem. However, the number of all possible explanations can be extremely large, which is too difficult (if not impossible) for users to verify. It is challenging, however, to reduce explanations. According to our examination in real data sets, there are still hundreds of thousands of explanations after the reduction by unique constraints. Hence, in this work, we want to study the reduction of explanations of non-answers by using conditional functional dependencies(CFDs) and give user more qualified explanations.
