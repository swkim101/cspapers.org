1 MOTIVATION AND INTRODUCTION The ongoing evolution of the power grid towards a highly dynamic supply and demand system poses challenges [1] to its operators and subscribers. The dependence on renewable electricity (e.g., wind, solar, and water) induces new grid characteristics: the volatility of electricity sources leads to an interplay of excess supply and demand, which results in fluctuating electricity prices. Thus, the operation of high-performance–computing (HPC) clusters canwork with the fluctuating electricity price to ensure cost effectiveness [2]. This poster abstract presents Albatross [3], a runtime system for heterogeneous HPC clusters. To ensure an energy-efficient and economic processing of HPC workloads, our system exploits heterogeneity at the hardware level and considers dynamic electricity prices. Early results of our Albatross prototype running on a heterogeneous HPC cluster in our lab show how the power demand of the cluster decreases when electricity prices are high (i.e., excess demand at the grid), and how our system purposefully increases the workload and, thus, power demand when electricity prices are low or even negative (i.e., excess supply to the grid)—to make profit.
