This paper presents an analysis of the choice of integrated inductor for energy conversion in order to improve the DC-DC converter efficiency and their monolithic integration. A comparative study using two forms of turns, allowed to choose the best form of inductor which provides good values of inductance and quality factor for the same area occupied. In addition, a comparison of the inductors characteristics was performed using two magnetic materials. The rectangular form provides a high inductance value than the circular form of the turns. This inductance value can be increased significantly with magnetic core Ni80Fe20.
