Distributed Data Base Management Systems (D-DBMS) are the converging point of apparently contrasting areas: networking and Data Bases, representative of distribution and integration respectively. 
 
Users should benefit from this new dimension when trying to make data processing architectures conform to managerial and organizational philosophies. 
 
This paper is a technical overview of research and development in D-DMBS. In the first section, various architectures and design strategies are examined, followed by a description of functional layers. The second section is dedicated to Data Base design and mappings between levels of representations. The last section addresses Integrity control and Recovery.
