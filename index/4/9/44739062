Measurements of themselves have tended to concentrate on specific computer configuration components (e.g., CPU load, channel load, disk data set contention, problem program optimization, operating system optimization, etc.) rather than at the total computer configuration level. As a consequence, since these components can have a high degree of interaction, the requirement currently exists for a workable configuration performance concept which will reflect the configuration performance change that is the resultant of single or multiple component change. It is the author's opinion that such a concept will provide management and measurement specialists a planning and analysis tool that can be well Used in evaluating the costs. It is to this configuration performance concept that this paper is addressed, and the concept by my choosing is named “The Computer Capacity Curve.”
