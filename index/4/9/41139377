In this paper, an advanced Computer Aided Design (CAD) methodology for Processor-In-the-Loop (PIL) cosimulation and rapid control prototyping of a Quad Tilt Wing (QTW) type of convertible Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is proposed and successfully implemented around an embedded NI myRIO target and a host PC. The developed software (SW) and hardware (HW) CAD solution is based on the Control Design and Simulation (CDSim) module of LabVIEW environment as well as a set-up Network Streams-based data communication protocol. A nonlinear dynamic model of the QTW drone is established using the Newton-Euler formalism. Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control approach is investigated as an implementation example for the proposed rapid control prototyping platform. A three-dimensional (3D) mechanical model of the QTW, with a H-type structure, is built under LabVIEW environment for the SW/HW real-time co-simulations. All obtained co-simulation results as well as our own developed LabVIEW interfaces are presented and discussed to improve the effectiveness of the given CAD methodology for the rapid flight controllers prototyping.
