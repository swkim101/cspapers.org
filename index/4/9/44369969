A mastication robot is a jaw motion simulator that has similar structure and function to the human masticatory system. This paper describes an optimal reduction of the jaw joint force focusing on the fan shape of the musculus temporalis (M.temporalis) spreading around the side of skull. The shape of M.temporalis is simplified as two independent lines, and the jaw joint force is computed by using linear programming. Furthermore the actuators corresponding to the anterior and posterior parts of M.temporalis are assigned separately. The 28% reduction of jaw joint force was confirmed experimentally by using robot.<<ETX>>
