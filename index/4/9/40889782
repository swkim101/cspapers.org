Presents the hardware of the upper body of the ETL-Humanoid system. It has 24 degrees of freedom with high performance actuators, which gives the system high mobility, such as is required for pushups, lifting itself or another person. The mechanical design is able to achieve human proportions, with smooth outer shape, and is light weight at a very high level, considering the high motor performance embedded inside. Custom compact electronics for AC servo control and fast embedded network for control and measurement was also developed. The system is still evolving, being used as a working testbed for versatile human interaction experiments.
