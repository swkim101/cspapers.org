The so-called "Moore's Law", by which the performance of the processors will increase exponentially by factor of 4 every 3 years or so, is slated to be ending in 10--15 year timeframe due to the lithography of VLSIs reaching its limits around that time, and combined with other physical factors. We are now embarking on a project to revolutionize the total system architectural stack in a holistic fashion in the Post-Moore era, from devices and hardware, abstracted by system software and programming models and languages, and optimized according to the device characteristics with new algorithms and applications that exploit them. Such systems will have multitudes of varieties according to the matching characteristics of applications to the underlying architecture, leading to what can be metaphorically described as Cambrian Explosion of computing systems. The diverse elements of such systems will be interconnected with next-generation terabit optics and networks, allowing metropolitan-scale computing infrastructure that would truly realize high performance parallel and distributed computing. However, which algorithms and applications would benefit the most from such future computing, given that some physical constants, e.g., communication latency, cannot be improved? We speculate on some of the scenarios that would change the nature of current Cloud-centric infrastructures towards the Post-Moore era.
