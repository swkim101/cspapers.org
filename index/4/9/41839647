XML tries to bring to natural language documents ("texts" for short), some of what databases have had for decades: explicit structure whose properties can be known; independence of data and structure from reporting (which we foreigners call "formatting"); various kinds of isolation; and so on. But the data buried in those XML elements is weird stuff: deep hierarchies, arbitrary and unpredictable orderings and repetitions, a painful number of atomic types, and enough aggregates to make one's head hurt.
