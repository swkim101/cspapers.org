Employers in business, entertainment, and education seek employees to help them meet the demands for web-based interactive technologies. This paper describes a thirty-credit, community college certificate program in Internet and Multimedia Technology (I/MMT), and plans to expand it to an associate's degree program. Detailed descriptions of two courses, Multimedia Authoring I and Internet Programming, central to the program are provided. The program immerses students in a technology-rich environment for their general education courses, and provides internships with local multimedia and web firms.
