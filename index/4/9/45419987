We see teaching cybersecurity through hands-on, interactive exercises as a way to engage students. However, we also want to assess how much students are learning from these exercises, and the exercises themselves could be used to assess what students know. Creating new hands-on exercises requires significant preparation on the part of the instructor. As a community we have begun to share exercises and discuss what works and what problems students and instructors have encountered. The purpose of this BOF is two-fold: 1) to continue to bring together instructors who have developed hands-on exercises with those who would like to use them, and 2) extend the discussion to include assessment of student learning. We recognize that few CS programs can afford new required courses, so we will discuss ways to integrate security-related exercises into existing ones. This could include networking, OS, computer architecture, programming languages, software engineering, algorithms and programming (CS0, CS1, CS2). The questions we will ask are, "What exercises have you tried? What are your experiences? What are you looking for? What are the learning goals for your students? How do you assess them?" Recent hiring forecasts indicate that there is still a tremendous need for skilled information security experts. Security is one of the core areas in the ACM/IEEE COMPUTER SCIENCE 2013 Curricula. It is particularly important to share stories from the classroom (what worked and what didn't), discuss ethical hacking, discuss how to teach and evaluate analytical skills, and discuss how we know if we are making a difference. We plan to share experiences, practices and ongoing efforts, including our own (e.g., our teaching experiences, Security Injections, the Security Knitting Kit project, The EDURange project and our dissemination of other infosec interactive exercises such as SEED labs). Both Security Injections and EDURange have features that address assessment.
