Automated program repair (APR) has great potential to reduce bug-fixing effort and many approaches have been proposed in recent years. APRs are often treated as a search problem where the search space consists of all the possible patches and the goal is to identify the correct patch in the space. Many techniques take a data-driven approach and analyze data sources such as existing patches and similar source code to help identify the correct patch. However, while existing patches and similar code provide complementary information, existing techniques analyze only a single source and cannot be easily extended to analyze both. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic program repair approach that utilizes both existing patches and similar code. Our approach mines an abstract search space from existing patches and obtains a concrete search space by differencing with similar code snippets. Then we search within the intersection of the two search spaces. We have implemented our approach as a tool called SimFix, and evaluated it on the Defects4J benchmark. Our tool successfully fixed 34 bugs. To our best knowledge, this is the largest number of bugs fixed by a single technology on the Defects4J benchmark. Furthermore, as far as we know, 13 bugs fixed by our approach have never been fixed by the current approaches.
