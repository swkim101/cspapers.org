We demonstrate an intelligent conversational agent system designed for advancing human-machine collaborative tasks. The agent is able to interpret a userâ€™s communicative intent from both their verbal utterances and non-verbal behaviors, such as gestures. The agent is also itself able to communicate both with natural language and gestures, through its embodiment as an avatar thus facilitating natural symmetric multi-modal interactions. We demonstrate two intelligent agents with specialized skills in the Blocks World as use-cases of our system.
