This paper purposes to implement fast and complicated tasks by a high-speed parallel robot, HEXA, for industrial applications and the others. Although this parallel robot does not use any force/torque sensors, it has sufficient capabilities to achieve various tasks by applying an integrated control of motion, force and compliance, which takes advantage of the back-driveability and friction compensation of the actuators. A key point is how simply and easily operators can bring out the performance. We develop an off-line task teaching system to realize the motion planning suitable for tasks. Some tasks are demonstrated by using this teaching and control system and we experimentally confirm the effectiveness of our system.
