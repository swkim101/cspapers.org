In this paper the application of some deep theorems of mathematical logic is shown in the field of artificial intelligence. Namely, using some of the results of definition theory we give the mathema - tical base to systems for automatic designing. /SAD/, These systems are capable of solving constructive tasks of such kind that need some creativity from the psychological point of view. Above tasks contain the imtlicite description of the object to be contructed. First of all that unit is investigated at SAD which provides an explicit definition to the circumscribed object.
