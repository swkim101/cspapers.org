The Analysis and Design of Distributed SystemsMehmet Aksit, University of Twente
The design of distributed object-oriented systems involves anumber of considerations that rarely arise in sequentialobject-oriented design or in non-object-oriented languages. Thetutorial describes analysis and design techniques for dataabstraction, inheritance, delegation, persistence, atomicity,concurrency, synchronization, and coordinated behavior in adistributed object-oriented framework. Special attention will bepaid to the uniform integration of these concepts with theobject-oriented paradigm. Discussions will be accompanied byexamples that arose from constructing such systems.
