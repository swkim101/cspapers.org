The tremendous demand for education in the use and application of computers and computer based systems in business, commerce and government has led to the establishment of Information Systems Departments and to the option of an Information Systems concentration in established Computer Science Departments. In fact, the Information Systems degree is now becoming one of the fastest growing and most popular in the area of computer education. This report is presented to the Computer Science and Information Systems education community as a preliminary proposal of ideas on which to base an accreditation standard. It was developed with the background that many Information Systems departments are incorporated in Schools and Colleges of Business, and an attempt was made to have the standard consistent with the American Association of Colleges and Schools of Business accreditation guidelines. The successful future of Information Systems depends on a firm foundation for graduating students; this work is directed towards offering a minimal or floor program for the Information Systems bachelors degree.
