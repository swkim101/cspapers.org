Incorporation of metal nanoparticles in Polyaniline composites could effectively improve its optical, thermal and electrical properties and making it an ideal for the use in semiconductor industry. In this study Ag nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed ultrasonically in the solution of polyaniline emeraldine base (PANIEB) and isopropyl alcohol. PANIEB used in this experiment were doped with polymer of methacrylic acid ester and vinyl verstate. The results about the morphological, optical and electrical properties of Ag-PANIEB with IPA colloid as a function of different concentration of Ag nanoparticles (Such as 25%, 50%, 100% by weight) were presented and discussed.
