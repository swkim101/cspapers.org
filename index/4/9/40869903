(To be presented by Deva Ramanan). In this talk, I will discuss recent work by colleagues and myself on discriminative latent-variable models for object detection. Object recognition is one of the fundamental challenges of computer vision. We specifically consider the task of localizing and detecting instances of a generic object category, such as people or cars, in cluttered real-word images. Recent benchmark competitions such as the PASCAL Visual Object Challenge suggest our method is the state-of-the-art system for such tasks. This success, combined with publicallyavailable code that runs orders of magnitude faster than comparable approaches, has turned our system into a standard baseline for contemporary research on object recognition (Felzenszwalb et al., 2008; 2009).
