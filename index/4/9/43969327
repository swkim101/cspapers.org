This work reviews the problem of detection in Forward-Looking Sonar images. In the underwater realm, most of the imaging is done by acoustic means, i.e. sonar. The Forward-Looking Sonar usually has a very low Signal to Noise Ratio therefore object detection in Forward-Looking Sonar images is still an open issue. The article will introduce our database and some conclusions that were gathered from working with it. It will also show results from a Convolutional Neural Network designed for Forward-Looking Sonar Images.
