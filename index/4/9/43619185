This paper proposes a triple-band antenna based on the fractal structure of Sierpinski gasket optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Relying on the highly desirable attributes including compact size, low profile, conformal and especially multiband of fractal structure, the feature of triple-band is not tricky to obtain. Implementing PSO permits the antenna to operate better. A finite element method simulator is used to simulate the proposed antenna. Results show the difference between the antenna without the optimization and the antenna using PSO.
