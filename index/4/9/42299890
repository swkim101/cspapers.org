Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing in which a third-party provider hosts virtualized computing resources over the Internet for executing tasks in the cloud computing. Whenever some VMs are overloaded and some VMs are under loaded, this situation may cause to SLA violation and leads to the reduction of customer satisfaction level and further affects the cloud provider leading to penalty. However, in this study, we propose a Multiple Agent-based Load Balancing Algorithm (MA) in which shift the load in the IaaS to achieve well dynamic load balancing across virtual machines for maximizing the utilization. The proposed algorithm with regard to changing environment and characteristics of the VMs, perform both of sender-initiated and receiver-initiated approach to balances the load of an IaaS in such a way that the amount of waiting time of the tasks in the queue is minimal and at the same time the SLA is guaranteed.We have compared the proposed algorithm with existing load balancing and scheduling algorithms via simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective and there is a good improvement in the load-balance, response time and makespan.
