This paper presents the structure of a beginning class in COBOL which stresses structured programming techniques and is organized as a series of stair-step type objectives. Three topics are stressed in this presentation: the application of student-centered objectives to a COBOL class, structured COBOL examples for commonly encountered logic constructs, and an approach to documenting structured COBOL through an indentation scheme.
