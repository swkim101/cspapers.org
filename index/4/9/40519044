With the advent of inexpensive microcomputers, which are mainly programmed in BASIC, and the widespread availability of BASIC on both minicomputers and large scale computers, the advantages of structured programming mandate that the techniques be extended to BASIC. Alternation (IF-THEN-ELSE) as well as repetition (DO WHILE and DO UNTIL) are easily implemented in BASIC. The CASE structure and necessary style conventions to insure readable, easy to write, easy to debug programs are readily implemented in BASIC. Structured pseudocode is used to express algorithms which are then written in structured BASIC.
