The evolution of programming languages (e.g. machine languages, assembly languages and high level languages) has been the driving force for the evolution of software development from the machine-centric to the application-centric. The 4th generation languages (4GLs), languages defined directly by the composition of domain features, serve as the language-based formalism for the emerging Domain Driven Development paradigm. The 4GLs are defined in Two-Level Grammar++ and can be compiled into 3GLs using the 4GL compiler framework.
