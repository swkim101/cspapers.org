For the past 25 years, the EDA industry has played a major role in the growth of the semiconductor industry, providing tools and services that have helped companies develop electronics products that permeate and improve every aspect of our daily lives.As the semiconductor industry moves into the nanometer era, they face many key questions when envisioning a new product. When do they want the product to reach the market? How will that product be differentiated? Where do they develop and manufacture that product?Less than a decade ago, these questions would have been answered completely independent of whatever EDA vendor a semiconductor company selected. However, in the nanometer era, the answers to these questions can be significantly influenced not only by EDA companies but also by the IP and pure-play foundries that make up the infrastructure of the semiconductor industry. In order to compete in a global marketplace, these companies must align their individual core competencies with those of the semiconductor industry to help IC companies create products with the optimal combination of performance, price, and time-to-market.In this panel, the CEOs of the three major EDA vendors, along with peers from the IP and manufacturing areas discuss these fundamental changes to the semiconductor industry, and the challenges of working together to help customers successfully bring new products to market.Jay Vleeschhouwer, a senior analyst for Merrill Lynch, will moderate a series of questions for the panelists from the customer's point of view that address how EDA, IP and pure-play foundries can impact the competitiveness of semiconductor companies and the products they develop.
