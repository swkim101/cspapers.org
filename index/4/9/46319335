Operating systems concepts are taught in many undergraduate curricula. Assignment of a student project involving the development of an operating system creates a difficult situation due to time and financial considerations. Using GPSS to simulate the behavior of the student-created operating system can diminish these problems and serve as an effective learning device. Many features and concepts can be simulated that might otherwise be ignored in a student project.
