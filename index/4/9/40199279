This paper presents a simple method of designing a protograph-based LDPC codes which has excellent performance with a small number of decoding iterations. In addition to designing LDPC codes based on the iterative decoding threshold as before, we add one more dimension into the design process which is a predefined number of decoding iterations. Simulation results show that the proposed codes have better performance than state-of-the-art protograph codes while the number of decoding iterations is small.
