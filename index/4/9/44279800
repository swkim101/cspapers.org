In this paper, we develop a novel approach to evaluating the feasibility of a planar grasp of an arbitrary polygonal object by a multifingered hand. Our definition of a feasible grasp takes into account both kinematic constraints and force constraints, and the algorithm is capable of handling power grasps involving finger tips as well as inner links of a dextrous hand. The proposed approach is based on first expressing the kinematic and force constraints in terms of equalities and inequalities in variables of the object and hand configurations, and then formulating and solving grasp feasibility as a constrained global optimization problem. An example is provided to illustrate the algorithm.
