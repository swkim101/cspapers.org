In one embodiment, the present invention is concerned with novel xanthene compounds selected from those of the formulae and wherein each R1 the same or different is alkyl, each R2 the same or different is an electron-withdrawing group having a positive sigma value greater than 0.6, X is wherein R3 is alkyl, Y is an electron-withdrawing group, n is 0 or 1 and A is an anion. In another embodiment, the present invention is concerned with photographic products and processes employing these xanthene compounds, e.g., as photographic light-screening dyes.
