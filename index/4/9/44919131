The ACM Curriculum Committee on Computer Education for Management last year issued a report containing a variety of curriculum recommendations for graduate professional programs in information systems [1]. The work of the Committee has been supported by the National Science Foundation.* A brief summary of the recommendations is given in the Proceedings of ACM 72 [2]. The report addresses the need for information systems programs as stand-alone offerings, or as part of Master's level education in graduate business schools, computer science departments, or other graduate departments. The implications of these recommendations for computer science departments may be addressed under three headings, depending on the role of the department as: (i) including offerings relevant to information systems in its regular Master's degree program; (ii) participating in the offering of an independent program leading to an MS degree in information systems, but as a collaborator with another unit, e.g. a business school; or (iii) undertaking to offer an independent program entirely on its own.
