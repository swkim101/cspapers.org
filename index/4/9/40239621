We demonstrate Transit Portal, a system that provides ondemand BGP Internet connectivity to multiple ISPs. Transit Portal provides connectivity to any virtual network or distributed service that needs to control its inbound and outbound route control. Examples of such services include virtual networks and distributed services in cloud computing environments (e.g., Amazonâ€™s EC2) that need to control inbound and outbound traffic. Transit Portal offers a conventional BGP session interface to its clients and presents the appearance of a direct connection to one or more upstream Internet service providers, without requiring each client to establish an explicit contract with each upstream provider. Transit Portal aggregates client sessions and provides a single, stable BGP session to upstream providers. As shown in Figure 1, Transit Portal can be deployed in geographically distributed popular exchange points, close to the local ISPs. Downstream networks (e.g., researchers, experimenters, operators of cloud services) peer with these upstream ISPs though BGP sessions terminating on Transit Portal using tunnels. The main goal of this demonstration is to show the following three aspects of Transit Portal:
