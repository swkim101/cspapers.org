1. SUMMARY In response to reports concerning the decline in enrollment in CS undergraduate programs nationwide [2], an effort began in 2006 to address this problem by running a workshop at Carnegie Mellon University titled CS4HS (Computer Science for High School). [1] This workshop provided high school teachers with course materials and information to show the breadth and application of CS to their students with the hope that this will help increase excitement about computing as a potential path for high school students when they enter college. The reach of the workshop was expanded in 2007 to include two additional universities: the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Washington. Each university had a different target audience of teachers for its workshop. In this special session, organizers at each university will describe the format of their individual workshops, describe several short exercises that were used in one or more of the workshops in the past year, show a sampling of photos and videos taken from the workshops to illustrate the effectiveness of the workshops, and share some collected data concerning the workshops with the audience. Presenters will then field questions from the audience concerning the workshops and time will be devoted to outlining how participants can get involved in running a new CS4HS workshop or attending a CS4HS workshop in their area as new workshops are organized.
