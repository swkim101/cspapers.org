A stereo algorithm developed for the Oxford AGV is described which matches connected chains of edgels (curves) between images. It is based on representing the curves as elastic strings and measuring tlie amount of deformation the strings have to undergo to transform between corresponding curves, and incorporates the ideas of the disparity gradient and tlle fact that matching sections of curve have to lie of a similar sliape. This explicit, use of shape information means that a precisely known epipolar geometry is no longer crucial. Pairs of potentially corresponding cnrves wllicli lead to a large deformation energy, are eliminated and the greatly reduced number of potentially matching pairs are passed on to a tree search stage. A typical result of running tlie algorithm on a stereo triple is presented.
