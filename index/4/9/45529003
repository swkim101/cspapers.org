This paper presents an overview of a framework for the analysis of motion from sequences of images by computer. The framework includes: (a) A representation of knowledge for motion concepts that is based on Minsky's frame theory and semantic networks; (b) Associated algorithms for recognizing these motion concepts. These algorithms implement a form of feedback, by allowing competition and co-operation among local processes. They also allow a change of attention mechanism that is based on similarity links between knowledge units. 
 
The framework is being realized with a system called ALVEN, whose structure and operation are described. The purpose behind this system is to provide an evolving research prototype for experimenting with the analysis of certain classes of biomedical imagery, and for refining and quantifying the body of relevant medical knowledge.
