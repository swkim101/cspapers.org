The Fulbright Scholar Program is the flagship academic exchange program of the U.S. Department of State; approximately 1,100 American scholars travel worldwide annually to lecture and conduct research. The program is open to all U.S. citizens with university teaching experience and a Ph.D. or equivalent professional/terminal degree. Opportunities for Computer Science educators to win Fulbright scholarships are many. The goal of this panel is to inform the community of computer science educators about the Fulbright program, including the application process, and to answer questions about the program. After an introduction to the program at large, the panelists will each give a 10-15 minute overview of their personal experience as a Fulbright scholar in 2011-2012, leaving ample time for questions from educators considering applying for a Fulbright scholarship. The panelists will offer diverse perspectives based on their experiences in India, Zambia, and Siberia.
