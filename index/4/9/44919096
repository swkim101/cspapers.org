The problem of achieving several goals simultaneously lias been central to domain-independent planning research, the nonlinear constraint-posting approach has been most successful Previous planners of this type ''. 4, 5. f> have been complicated, heuristic, and ill-defined. 1 have combined and distilled the state of the art into a simple, precise, implemented algorithm (TWEAK) which I have proved correct and complete The simplicity and rigor of this algorithm illuminate the workings of previous planners, the range of applicability of current planning technology, and suggest future directions for research. This paper presents the mathematical foundations for non-linear planning; due to space limitations, I have omitted proofs, some detail, and much discussion These appear in 1
