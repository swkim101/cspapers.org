Thriving in Our Digital World: AP provides high school teachers a complete, classroom-ready curriculum, including custom online resources and flexible curricular materials, designed to satisfy the College Board's requirements for its new course, AP Computer Science Principles. Organized in a series of project-based modules, the course focuses on current areas of research among real-world computer scientists, including Big Data, digital manipulation, and data security. Beginning in Summer 2016, UTeach--the highly successful STEM teacher preparation program that began at The University of Texas at Austin in 1997 and is now being replicated nationwide--will offer professional development, ongoing support, and incentives for teachers to teach the course. UTeach's PD model encourages the participation of teachers with a variety of backgrounds and levels of experience, and leverages participating teachers' diverse areas of expertise to improve PD and support opportunities for all participants. Individuals who teach Thriving in Our Digital World: AP will join a national community of educators dedicated to improving K-12 computer science education and better engaging girls and other historically underrepresented groups in computing. K-12 educators and school and district administrators should plan to attend this hands-on workshop. Presenters will engage participants in demonstration lessons and activities, and participants will leave with materials and handouts that are directly relevant to K-12 computer science classrooms. Laptops are required.
