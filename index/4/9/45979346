Isolation and separation of the target microbe is quite important. We propose a new touch sensor to get contact information that is needed for separation of the target microbe by the pipette. This sensor is sensitive enough to protect the fragile pipette tip from abrupt collision. Using this sensor, we developed a novel screening system for separation of target microorganisms from the randomly distributed samples on the plate by the local viscosity control of the thermosensitive hydro gel.
