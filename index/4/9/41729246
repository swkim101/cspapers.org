The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XML Query Working Group was originally chartered in September 1999 to develop a query language for XML documents. The WG has published several drafts of XML Query 1.0, XPath 2.0 and their associated data model and formal semantics. This panel will consist of two parts. First the Moderator will provide a summary of the current status of the XML Query WG efforts and the XQuery specifications. Then each of the panelists will outline the architecture and features of their current XQuery implementation. Each of the implementations will offer different insights in the strengths and weaknesses of the current XQuery specifications and the tradeoffs that need to made when implementing XQuery.
