A globally convergent visual feedback control scheme is proposed for the dynamic model of uncertain planar robot manipulators with uncalibrated camera. Additionally, a time-varying feedback gain induces a terminal attractor in the visual error manifold to guarantee finite-time convergence of image-based tracking errors. Simulations results of a two degrees-of-freedom manipulator with uncalibrated CCD camera are presented to illustrate the dynamic closed-loop performance.
