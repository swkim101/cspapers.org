Data Base Management Computers (DBMC) are special purpose computers in distributed systems. The dedicated role of the DBMC is to control the devices upon which data bases reside and to provide data base management services for other computers in the system. and how it relates to other computers, Depending upon how it operates a given DBMC can be classified either as an intelligent controller, a backend or a datacomputer. Prototypes of each class have been proposed and implemented. In addition there is a growing body of literature devoted to DBMC technology -- objectives, requirements, problems, performance issues, etc. The purpose of this paper is to present a survey of recent research and then to examine special DBMC requirements in the increasingly important areas of very large data bases and distributed data bases.
