This paper introduces a novel Shape Feedback Master Slave (M-S) arm system, which is inexpensive and robust to be equipped in the demining robot "TITAN-IX". A M-S arm system is an important element. However, it is very difficult to use the conventional M-S arm system into unpredictable environments such as a minefield, because the control parameters to adapt the environment are mostly unknown. The newly introduced Shape Feedback M-S Gripper (SPADE GRIPPER) for detecting and removing mines is composed of three unilateral position controls without bilateral force control, can work stably in such an unknown environment. The mechanical design and the operation principle of SPADE GRIPPER and several experiments are performed to examine its validities.
