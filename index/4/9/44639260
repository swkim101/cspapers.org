The Carnot research project [CARN, WOEL93] at MCC was initiated in 1990 with the goal of addressing the problem of logically unifying physically-distributed, enterprisewide, heterogeneous information. A prototype has been implemented that provides services for enterprise modeling and model integration to create au enterprise-wide view, semantic expansion of queries on the view to queries on individual resources, and interresource consistency management. Carnot also includes technology for 3D visualization of large information spaecs, knowledge discovery in databases, and software application design recovery. The Camot prototype software has been used by the sponsors of the Carnot project to develop a number of applications. These applications have included worldtow management, heterogeneous database access, knowledge discovery in large databases, and integrated access to both text databases and structured databases from a single initial query.
