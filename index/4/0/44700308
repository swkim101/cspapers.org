This paper is concerned with the development of an interactive error analysis system for a highly interactive programming language compiler. Although the proposed system should have reasonably wide applicability to various time-sharing systems and interactive compilers, the following is a description of the goals and constraints of a particular compiler in which the error system is to be implemented.
