Extended orthogonal space time block code (EO-STBC) schemes were demonstrated that they can achieve a significant improvement in performance for closed-loop multiple antenna systems with limited feedback channel. This paper investigates a new closed-loop multiple antenna scheme for four transmit antennas and single receive antenna under quasi-static flat Rayleigh fading. In comparison to conventional EO-STBC schemes, the proposed new scheme not only has simpler structure due to not using STBC encoder and decoder, but also has better BER performance without additional feedback bits.
