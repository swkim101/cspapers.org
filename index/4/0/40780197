News articles are a type of instantaneous and regional media, and provide the daily concerns of its publication area. This work proposes an analytical framework of the relations among nations using the similarities in the content of news articles published in different nations. Our key idea is that those relations exist in the news articles miss-classified by different nations from their original publication area. In order to clearly illustrate those relations, the classification results are visualized as bar graphs. We also carried out some experiments for the proposed framework using a small collection of news articles.
