INTRODUCTION & CONTRIBUTION The IoT interconnects off-the-shelf microcontrollers with the global Internet, and RIOT [1] is the friendly open source operating system that brings standard networking to many IoT nodes. Like in most OSes, networking, cryptography, and other daily routines require local random input of very low predictability. Generating unclonable individual numbers on microcontrollers, though, is surprisingly hard, since most devices run on a deterministic clock and show almost no distinguishing features. Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are a promising class of solutions to this problem. They extract unique or reconfigurable output from individual hardware properties. Recent work [2, 3] has identified SRAM memory as a feasible entropy source.
