Simulations of scientific programs running on traditional scientific computer architectures show that execution with hundreds of registers can be more than twice as fast as execution with only eight registers. In addition, execution with a small number of fast registers and hundreds of slower registers can be as fast as execution with hundreds of fast registers. A hierarchical organization of fast and slow registers is presented, register-allocation strategies are discussed, and a novel, indirect, register-addressing mechanism is described.
