Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied for software product lines (SPLs) to search for optimal or near-optimal solutions that balance multiple objectives. However, MOEAs usually produce invalid solutions that violate the constraints predefined. As invalid solutions are unbuildable in practice, we debate the preservation of invalid solutions during the search. We conduct experiments on seven real-world SPLs, including five largest SPLs hitherto reported and two SPLs with realistic values and constraints of quality attributes. We identify three potential limitations of preserving invalid solutions. Furthermore, based on the state-of-the-art, we design five algorithm variants that adopt different evolutionary operators. By performance evaluation, we provide empirical guidance on how to preserve valid solutions. Our empirical study demonstrates that whether or not to preserve invalid solutions deserves more attention in the community, and in some cases, we have to preserve valid solutions all along the way.
