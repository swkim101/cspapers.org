We introduce the vision of lifelong and intermittent learning, which will enable batteryless computing platforms to execute a certain class of machine learning tasks. We identify key properties and challenges to learning on harvested energy which relates to the semantics of machine learning tasks. Each of these challenges leads to a new research direction. We envision that a big chunk of research on batteryless IoT devices in the next 5-10 years will be about making them capable of continuously learning throughout their lifetime. Concepts related to intermittent learning will be at the heart of those works.
