While the task of language generation seems to separate quite naturally into the two aspects of language generation (text planning and text production), it is necessary to have the planning and the production interact at generator decision points in such a way that the former need not contain explicit syntactic knowledge, and that the latter need not contain explicit goal-related information. This paper describes the decision points, the types of plans that are used in making the decisions, and a process that performs the task. These ideas are embodied in a program.
