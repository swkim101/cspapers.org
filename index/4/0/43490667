The Biological Immune System is a remarkable information processing and self-learning system that offers stimulation to build Artificial Immune System (AIS).During the last two decades, the field of AIS is progressing slowly and steadily as a branch of Computational Intelligence (CI). At present the AIS algorithms such as Negative Selection Theory, Clonal Selection Theory, Immune Networks Theory, Danger theory and Dendritic Cell Algorithm are widely used to solve many real world problems in a vast range of domain areas such as Network Intrusion Detection (NID), Anomaly Detection, Clustering and classification and Pattern recognition. This review paper critically discusses the theoretical foundation, research methodologies and applications of the AIS.
