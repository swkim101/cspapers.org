VolksFlow is a real-time crowd mobility analytics system deployed in two pilot sites in New Zealand. In this demo we showcase real-time data analytics results from Wellington Railway Station. VolksFlow addresses the crowd estimation problem in a target area and provides an internet-of-things (IoT) service to share crowd estimation results across different applications. VolksFlow consists of three data analytics modules for analyzing crowd size, stay duration, and people flow. Our research for crowd estimation is based on correlating the Wi-Fi probes data with stereoscopic cameras to count people at specified "choke points".
