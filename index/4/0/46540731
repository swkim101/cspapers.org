A question answering system is described which uses a net structure for storage of infor­ mation. The net structure consists of nodes and labelled edges, which represent relations be­ tween the nodes. The labels are also nodes, and therefore definitions of relations may be stored in the net. It is demonstrated that the generality and complexity of this memory struc­ ture allows a surprisingly powerful question an­ swering system to be constructed using comparit ively simple executive routines. Output from the question answerer, which is currently run­ ning on an interactive, time sharing system, is included, showing its range of applicabi l i ty i n ­ cluding question answering, inductive and de­ ductive inference, simple theorem proving and problem solving.
