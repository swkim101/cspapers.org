Abstract: This paper addresses a modified optimal control strategy for a 14-degrees-of-freedom, five-finger robotic hand to improve accuracy and reduce convergence time by modifying the performance index embedded with an exponential term. First, the trajectory planning of the joints of each finger is designed by using cubic polynomial. Then the kinematic and dynamic equations of the robotic hand and feedback linearization technique are employed. Next, the original and modified optimal control methods are applied to the robotic hand. Finally, simulations show that the proposed modified optimal control technique provides much faster response with high accuracy compared to a hybrid genetic algorithmtuned PID control.
