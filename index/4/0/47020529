Synthesizing data extracted from primary studies is an integral component of the methodologies in support of Evidence Based Software Engineering (EBSE) such as System Literature Review (SLR). Since a large and increasing number of studies in Software Engineering (SE) incorporate qualitative data, it is important to systematically review and understand different aspects of the Qualitative Research Synthesis (QRS) being used in SE. We have reviewed the use of QRS methods in 328 SLRs published between 2005 and 2015. We also inquired the authors of 274 SLRs to confrm whether or not any QRS methods were used in their respective reviews. 116 of them provided the responses, which were included in our analysis. We found eight QRS methods applied in SE research, two of which, narrative synthesis and thematic synthesis, have been predominantly adopted by SE researchers for synthesizing qualitative data. Our study determines that a signifcant amount of missing knowledge and incomplete understanding of the defned QRS methods in the community. Our effort also identifes an initial set factors that may in?uence the selection and use of appropriate QRS methods in SE.
