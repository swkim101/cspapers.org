This paper describes initial results regarding navigation and control algorithms developed for Gamera, an autonomous underwater vehicle. In order to perform high precision controlled motions, the robot employs a novel propulsion system known as Nektons, and carries a comprehensive sensor suite to track orientation and position. A model of the robot has been developed that relates the 12 robot controlled propulsion outputs-frequency, amplitude, and center point of oscillation for each of the four motors-to the forces generated by the entire system. We explore the rationalization of control algorithms for this system. Using these algorithms, Gamera demonstrates a high level of control and successfully performs pre-specified maneuvers autonomously.
