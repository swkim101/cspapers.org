Object-Oriented User InterfacesDave Collins, IBM,
The principles of objects, polymorphism, classes, andinheritance can apply to the end users external view of a userinterface, just as it can apply to the language that is used toimplement it. This tutorial shows how to design (not implement) auser interface that is truly object-oriented. It gives guidance onthe design of the externals of object-oriented user interfaces, andshows how developers can capitalize on the isomorphism between theusers conceptual model of the interface and the constructs providedby object-oriented programming languages. The tutorial exposes a(perhaps surprisingly) deep analogy between object-orientedprogramming languages and object-oriented user interfaces. Thisanalogy is valuable because it can be used to map external userinterface design in a clear and natural way onto object-orientedapplication frameworks. The tutorial is illustrated with historicalexamples, many on videotape.
