In this paper, we study an electromagnetic optimization technique using Taguchi's method and apply it to concentric ring antenna array design. Taguchi's method was developped on the basis of the orthogonal array (OA) concept, which offers systematic and efficient characteristics. The newly proposed idea is the implementation of Taguchi optimization method for Concentric Circular Antenna Array (CCAA). The optimization procedure is then used to provide an optimum set of weights for different CCAAs. Obtained results show that the desired radiation pattern with optimum sidelobe level (SLL) reduction is successfully achieved. The numerically simulated patterns are obtained and compared with those of concentric circular isotropic arrays (12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 elements). Compared to traditional optimization techniques and well-known algorithms (Evolutionary Programming (EP) algorithm and Firefly Algorithm (FA)), Taguchi's method is easy to implement and efficient to reach the optimum solutions.
