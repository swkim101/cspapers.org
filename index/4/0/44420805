A method for designing a robust time-delayed teleoperator control system based on H/sub /spl infin// optimization is presented. The proposed teleoperator control system deals with the robustness of teleoperation especially during the contact phase. In the approach phase where the slave end-effector is assumed to be in free space such that no significant modeling uncertainties are present, an optimal time-delayed teleoperator control system designed based on Smith's principle may suffice. However, in the contact phase where the uncertainties of contact time and environmental dynamics are of major concern, a time-delayed teleoperator control system should be designed to be robust to modeling uncertainties. Here, we apply the H/sub /spl infin// methodology for the design of such a robust time-delayed teleoperator control system. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed method.<<ETX>>
