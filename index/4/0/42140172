In this paper, an early flood warning system has been studied and developed. The system consists of an early flood warning station powered by solar energy, a monitoring center, and a notification system. The flood warning station is equipped with the water level sensor and the precipitation sensor. The data, which is received from sensors, will be stored in memory card and transmitted to monitoring center via GPRS protocol. The functions of monitoring center are to receive, analyse data from the stations and send results to notification system where warning can be generated to the considered residential areas. The warning levels of flood can be set up easily by using the buttons in the circuit board or by using the SMS message from user's mobile phone. A website was also created to display the river water level, rainfall and the predicted information for the next few hours.
