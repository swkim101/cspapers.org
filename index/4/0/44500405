The wear due to the filaments on a circulating delivery belt having a surface for receiving thereon a stream of textile filaments and conveying them, for example in a false-twist texturing machine, is reduced by feeding the filaments, just prior to reaching the belt, through a thread-guide that has a reciprocating motion transverse to the filaments imparted thereto which is the resultant of two uniform components of reciprocation of different periods, so that the position of the filaments across the belt is varied in non-uniform cycles repeated in groups thereof. The thread-guide is carried by a rod in which is mounted a journal having eccentric pins at its opposite ends. A basic component of reciprocation is imparted to the rod by a track rotating eccentrically about a fixed axis and acting on one of the two pins to cause the journal and rod to reciprocate along the rod axis. An additional component is imparted by causing the journal to rotate about the eccentric pin axis by means of a gear on the other one of the two pins, this gear being in mesh with a second gear fixed to a third and parallel pin mounted for its axis to revolve round the fixed axis of the eccentric track. Preferably the belt circulates with a period different from the period of the basic component of reciprocation.
