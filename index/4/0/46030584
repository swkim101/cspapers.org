This paper copes with the problem of improving the quality of the curvelet interpolation in super-resolution image reconstruction. The curvelet interpolation has been proposed by some authors, however the quality of reconstructed images from their implementation is not as high as expected and the processing time is also not efficient. To improve the curvelet interpolation, a 2-stage interpolation algorithm in the curvelet domain combined to a filtering step for the reconstruction is proposed. The interpolated images are compared with images provided by other previous High-Resolution reconstruction methods and to the ideal interpolation. The experiments in Matlab and hardware based approach show the appropriate improvements of PSNR and MSE in comparison with the other previous methods.
