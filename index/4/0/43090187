This panel focuses on how new Web-based frameworks can enable academic research and development in VLSI CAD. Open-source initiatives, portals for research communities or for the EDA community at large, algorithm benchmarking support, etc. are a few of the possibilities. Each of the three panelists will describe the current status of efforts toward building new Web-based infrastructure for CAD research. The approaches and “mission statements” illustrate the literally unbounded potential for such frameworks to transform how CAD R&D is performed.
