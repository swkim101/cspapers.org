We devise a unified framework for the design of canonization algorithms. Using hereditarily finite sets, we define a general notion of combinatorial objects that includes graphs, hypergraphs, relational structures, codes, permutation groups, tree decompositions, and so on. Our approach allows for a systematic transfer of the techniques that have been developed for isomorphism testing to canonization. We use it to design a canonization algorithm for general combinatorial objects. This result gives new fastest canonization algorithms with an asymptotic running time matching the best known isomorphism algorithm for the following types of objects: hypergraphs, hypergraphs of bounded color class size, permutation groups (up to permutational isomorphism) and codes that are explicitly given (up to code equivalence).
