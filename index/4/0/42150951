The two key elements of decision-making in today's environment are (i)efficient information processing and management and (ii) a degree of maturity in effective use of a broad range of analytical tools and techniques which pass under the general label of Mathematical Sciences.
 The Department of Computer Science at Jackson State University started a Graduate Program during the 1974 academic year which offers a unique interdisciplinary program leading to a Master's Degree in Computer Science. This program emphasizes in programming languages, systems programming, operating systems, information systems analysis and design, the role of the computer as an integral part of the decision-making process, and the computer applications in the areas of statistics and management science. Advanced placement may be given via examination or acceptable certificate presentation from traditional or non-traditional institutions such as IBM Corporation. The students are presently using both the interactive and the batch capability of our IBM 360/40 for their course and project works. The university is upgrading to an IBM 370/145 during the spring semester (1976).
