Hardware platforms are evolving towards parallel and heterogeneous architectures to overcome the increasing necessity of more performance in the real-time domain. Parallel programming models are fundamental to exploit the performance capabilities of these architectures. This paper proposes a novel response time analysis (RTA) for verifying the schedulability of DAG tasks supporting heterogeneous computing. It analyzes the impact of executing part of the DAG in the accelerator device. As a result, the response time upper bound of the system is more precise than the one provided by currently existing RTA targeting homogeneous architectures.
