As VLSI technology scales to deep sub-micron, optical interconnect becomes an attractive alternative for on-chip communication. The traditional optical routing works mainly optimize the path loss, and few works explicitly exploit the optical-electrical co-design of on-chip interconnects. To overcome these limitations, we present an efficient framework that directs the hybrid optical and electrical routes with a global view of power optimization. In this framework, on-chip signal bits are processed as hyper nets; the combination of optical and electrical routes are designed for hyper nets; then a formulation is given to find the appropriate solution of each hyper net and follows a speed-up algorithm; a min-cost max-flow network is utilized to reduce the consumed optical waveguides. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
