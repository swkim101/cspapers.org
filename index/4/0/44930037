We propose “Attentive Workbench (AWB),” a new cell production system in which an intelligent system supports human workers. Using cameras, projectors, planar motor driven self-moving trays and other devices, the system supports workers from both physical and information aspects, recognizing worker’s condition and intention. This paper outlines AWB and deals with physical assembly support using self-moving parts trays. Two different schemes, centralized and decentralized, for controlling multiple parts trays are evaluated through experiments and simulations. The centralized control scheme is found to have the higher performance than the decentralized control scheme.
