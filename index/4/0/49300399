The increasing system complexity makes engineering change order (ECO) mostly inevitable and a common practice in integrated circuit design. Despite extensive research being made, prior methods are not effectively applicable to instances where rectification is to be done by simultaneously fixing multiple target points using intermediate signals. Moreover, how to efficiently generate low-cost patch functions is rarely addressed. These challenges are posed as a problem in the 2017 ICCAD CAD Contest. Based on Boolean satisfiability and interpolation, we propose a sound and complete algorithm for resource-aware patch generation of multi-target ECO. Experiments show our high quality results compared to other winning teams in the contest.
