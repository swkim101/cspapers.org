In the requirements elicitation phase, operation flows of software are often defined by scenarios. It is necessary to define appropriate operation flows as scenarios in terms of easily comprehended operation flows, efficiency, etc. Then scenarios are implemented as software Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). If the operation flows are defined inappropriately, the implemented GUIs may require modifications in the late software development phase. Although defining appropriate operation flows is difficult in the requirements elicitation phase, operation flows of GUIs cannot be always modified in the late software development phase. Thus, it is necessary for end users to evaluate the appropriateness of operation flows in scenarios. Herein we propose a method to generate GUI prototypes from scenarios. By parsing the events in the target scenarios, which are written in a natural language, GUI prototypes are automatically generated. Using the generated GUI prototypes, the appropriateness of operation flows can be evaluated by end users. If problems arise, the GUI prototypes can be modified in the early requirements elicitation phase.
