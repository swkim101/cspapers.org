One of the critical issues to be tackled for achieving routing efficiency in an ad hoc wireless network is the channel quality among the nodes. This paper tries to approach the stated issue from the physical layer perspective of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) ad hoc wireless network. It proposes an adaptive wireless routing scheme, namely the adaptive-all routing scheme, based on the channel quality, which is measured by its respective channel impulse response (CIR) value. The proposed scheme covers the scope of (a) best-route prediction for selecting the best route with the least bit error rate (BER) expected, and (b) adaptive OFDM modulation for data transmission over the selected best route. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves its goal in improving the network performance by reducing the error rate and increasing the data throughput.
