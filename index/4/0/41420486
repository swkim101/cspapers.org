A systematic multi-agent controller synthesis approach is presented in this paper. An abstract format for multi-agent task sequence is defined first. The typical elementary task sequences in multi-agent collaboration applications and the corresponding Petri Nets (PN) models are presented. This correspondence is used as templates to map a task sequence to a synthesized multi-agent PN controller model. We demonstrate the proposed approach using a two-agent controller synthesis problem in a layered manufacturing application.
