Here we describe an architecture and model to simulate a sub-set of human interactions and transitions in human emotions occurring via these interactions. The architecture is modular and highly scalable and draws from analogies in human physiology and modern neuroscience while exploiting common human physical phenomena to quantify persistency in long and short term memory and how these concepts affect emotion, emotional swings and reactions. The model is phenomenological in that it emulates phenomena rather than mechanisms. We further allow for enough flexibility to emulate a broad set of mechanisms and behavior so that, while our examples are not universal, there is room to explore a wide range of phenomena. We advance that the implementation and use of this architecture can be potentially exploited in psychology, psychiatry, sexuality and the study of emotional transitions and swings due to physical interactions
