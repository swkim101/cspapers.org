A new design approach to enhance a terminal sliding mode controller for linear systems with mismatched time-varying uncertainties is presented in this paper. The nonlinear sliding surface is used to have the system states arrive at the equilibrium point in the finite time period. The sliding coefficient matching condition is extended for the terminal sliding mode control. The uncertain system with the proposed terminal sliding mode controller is shown to be invariant on the sliding surface. The reaching mode of the sliding surface is guaranteed and the close-loop system is stable. Moreover, the undesired chattering is alleviated with the designed terminal sliding mode controller. Simulation results are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented terminal sliding mode controller.
