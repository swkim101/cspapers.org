As the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna system, two ultra low profile inverted L antennas are located on the rectangular conducting plane is proposed and numerically analyzed. The directive gain of 4.12 dBi and the return loss bandwidth of 3.27% are achieved when the size of conducting plane is 0.45 λ by 0.45 λ (λ: wavelength). The results show the weak mutual coupling of the proposed antenna and its characteristics are promising as MIMO antenna application.
