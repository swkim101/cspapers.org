The purpose of this paper is twofold: To consider the characteristics that a programming language for beginners ought to have, and to offer a new language from Germany that shows great promise for providing beginners with many of these characteristics. This language is called ELAN (Elementary LANguage) and was designed in 1974 by C. H. A. Koster and his associates at the Technical University of Berlin. An ELAN compiler was developed soon thereafter from two theses written by J. Liedtke and U. Bartling at the University of Bielefeld. It is hoped that this paper will bring to ELAN some of the recognition that it deserves but has not yet received in this country.
