Cloud computing is currently performed mostly by large server farms: these are expensive to build, operate, and maintain. Additionally, these centres of computationmay be far away fromwhere data is sourced from, increasing the latency of processing due to transportationoverheads. We present RaDiCS, distributed data processing over Raspberry Pi based cluster computing environment, where Unikernels [2] are exploited to improve data processing performance. RaDiCS builds a framework for decentralising computation by using many smaller nodes spread out over a large area. Client programs can then run on these nodes, performing computation and transmitting data to other connected nodes. Processes can be migrated to connected nodes in order to balance demand on the system, or move a data processor closer to the source of its data, to reduce latency.
