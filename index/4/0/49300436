Hardware accelerators are being increasingly deployed to boost the performance and energy efficiency of deep neural network (DNN) inference. In this paper we propose Thundervolt, a new framework that enables aggressive voltage underscaling of high-performance DNN accelerators without compromising classification accuracy even in the presence of high timing error rates. Using post-synthesis timing simulations of a DNN accelerator modeled on the Google TPU, we show that Thundervolt enables between 34%â€“57% energy savings on state-of-the-art speech and image recognition benchmarks with less than 1% loss in classification accuracy and no performance loss. Further, we show that Thundervolt is synergistic with and can further increase the energy efficiency of commonly used run-time DNN pruning techniques like Zero-Skip.
