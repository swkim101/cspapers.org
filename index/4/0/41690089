According to Michael Stonebraker’s experiences, if you select a group of well-known experts in database research and ask them to identify the domains where meeting use+ requirements is of primary importance and at the ‘same time more significant advances are needed and more research should be promoted, user interfaces comes out as number one in the list. This has been the case over the last decade. Despite such a strong incentive, research on user interfaces seems to remain marginal within the database community.
