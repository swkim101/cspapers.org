While ACM Curriculum â€˜82 is still a useful course reference, course content has changed drastically. The external job market has changed and new technologies have appeared: World Wide Web, end-user, data warehouses, rapid application development, and more. New concepts have appeared or have become important: competitive and strategic use of IS, project management, change management and group work. More skills are needed in GUI and object-oriented design.
