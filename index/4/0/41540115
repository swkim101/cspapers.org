The SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges was approved in late 2015 and began organizing itself at SIGCSE 2016. The Committee has made an initial survey of the liberal arts computer science landscape, and has identified some central issues for more detailed study. This session will present the Committee's initial findings and future plans, and will solicit audience participation in refining the set of central issues and identifying possible resolutions to them.
