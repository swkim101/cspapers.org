Online social networks (OSNs) are often flooded with scathing remarks against individuals or businesses on their perceived wrongdoing. This paper studies three such events to get insight into various aspects of shaming done through twitter. An important contribution of our work is categorization of shaming tweets, which helps in understanding the dynamics of spread of online shaming events. It also facilitates automated segregation of shaming tweets from non-shaming ones.
