If we want to measure a sensing parameter like moisture or temperature in abroad a broad area like desert or forest, we need to spread too many WSN in that area.3 In this situation, networking between them is probable but we need to supply more WSN nodes or increase their signal power to transmit data in the wider range.4,5 Although the transmitting ranges in WSNs is usually more than sensing range but in the situation that we don’t need to sense the whole field. Measuring of a sensing parameter by such approach has some disadvantages because placing more node is not economical and also putting the more sinks or relays between them is not appropriate.3 Furthermore, boosting the signal power because more energy being consumed as transmitter module in WSNs is the major energy consumer.2 Since for saving energy resources in WSNs, we need to tune the transmitter signal power in the lowest range.6 However, deploying WSN is another issue that needs concern in full networked WSN’s nodes, so it is needed to choose a point to place the nodes and sinks7 Indeed in non-networked nodes, we can spread them with a helicopter without any concern of their location when we want to make a random sample of some parameters in the field.8,9 So in this scenario, we can use the mobile robot to collect and harvest their data. By using mobile collector, without knowledge about WSNs position, we go through exploration algorithm in unknown environments. The problem of exploration area is a key for harvesting and servicing wireless sensor node. Moreover, this field is going to combine the wireless sensor network and robot we go through the new area named wireless sensor and robot networks (WSRNs). WSNs and multi-robot systems10 are the results of WSRNs systems. Swarm robot system which works like an ant, fish and any other biological collectives is appropriate kind of mobile robot which wants to do the job as a team work.11 In this paper, we use swarm robot as wireless sensor mobile sink to collect WSNs data. Swarm robots.12 Is a kind of multi-robot systems which is one of the current discussions in recent years? Swarm robotic consists of several mini smart robots; they can be used instead of very complicated robots, especially in exploration tasks as they can be separated easily in the area. As soon as swarm robots enter to unknown environment to fulfil the specific task, they start to communicate between each other to grasp more knowledge about environment and also the tasks.13 Swarm robot communication is similar to other multi-robot systems communication and several studies have been produced in this field.13–15
