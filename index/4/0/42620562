Mobile Sinks has been widely used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to increase the network lifetime, especially to distribute energy consumption among the nodes composing the network. The development of low cost multi窶田opters, capable of autonomous flights, turns this type of vehicle into a promising solution for acting as mobile sinks. This work presents a new approach to the problem of routing multi窶田opters to collect data in WSNs in order to extend the network lifetime. We consider that each multi窶田opter is allowed to stop in a pre窶電efined number of points (locations) within a monitored area for collecting data from sensors. We propose a genetic model that shows how the distribution of the nodes workload can extend the network lifetime. Simulations are performed to adjust the parameters of the model, and also to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy.
