This paper presents a geometric street scattering channel model for car-to-car (C2C) communication systems under line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) propagation conditions. Starting from the geometric model, we develop a stochastic reference channel model, where the scatterers are uniformly distributed in rectangles in the form of stripes parallel to both sides of the street. We derive analytical expressions for the probability density functions (PDFs) of the angle-of-departure (AOD) and the angle-of-arrival (AOA). We also investigate the Doppler power spectral density (PSD) and the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the proposed model, assuming that the mobile transmitter (MT) and the mobile receiver (MR) are moving, while the surrounding scatterers are fixed. To validate the reference channel model, its Doppler parameters are compared to those of a real-world measured channel for urban and rural areas. The numerical results show a good fitting of the theoretical results to the computer simulations. The proposed geometry-based channel model allows to study the effects of the street scatterers on the performance of C2C communication systems.
