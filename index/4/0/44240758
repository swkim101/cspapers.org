In this paper we present a novel mobile photo-conferencing system that enables collocated and remote users to share, converse and interactively construct social albums. Unlike existing lab based solutions, the solution presented in this paper was designed from the ground up to interoperate across existing 3G mobile networks, enabling collocated and distributed collaboration around captured photos.
