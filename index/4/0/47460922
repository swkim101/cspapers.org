This paper studies the logical complexity of geometric properties in the plane. These properties are characterized according to the length of formulas necessary to express them. In this study a portion of the plane X will be considered as a collection of squares {x1, ..., xn} arranged into a fine grid. A pattern P is a subset of X and the grid is assumed to be fine enough so that approximations to geometrical figures can be obtained. P can be defined by mapping m: X →{0,1} where for x ε X, m(x) = 1 iff x ε P. A set of patterns or a geometrical property ℘ can be expressed as a Boolean function f on the n variables x1, ..., xn such that the value of f is 1 under the assignment m iff P ε ℘.
