It is indeed a great honor and privilege for us to present the program of the EMSOFT 2006 conference. The program covers a wide spectrum of issues related to embedded systems software, including modeling and validation of embedded software, component/model-based software design, operating systems and middleware for embedded systems, QoS management and performance analysis, hardware-dependent software and interfaces, networked embedded systems and security, low-power embedded systems, scheduling and timing analysis, and real-time embedded systems.Interest in the conference has been confirmed by the submissions of papers from all over the world. A total of 94 submissions were received, of which 31 papers were accepted for presentation at the conference. The papers were selected after a rigorous review process based on their originality, technical quality, and relevance to the conference. Each submitted paper was reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The expert opinions of many external reviewers were invaluable, for which we express our sincere gratitude. The program also includes a special session organized by Frank Bellosa and Sam H. Noh on software for portable storage that is becoming increasingly important in mobile embedded applications.This year's EMSOFT is a continuation of the new tradition in embedded computing, Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK). EMSOFT is co-locating with both CODES+ISSS and CASES, two major embedded systems conference. We plan to continue Embedded Systems Week as a yearly event and further extend its scope.This year's keynote for EMSOFT is titled "Embedded System Development for Automotive Applications: Trends and Challenges" and is given by Werner Damm from OFFIS. EMSOFT will host four workshops related to various aspects of embedded systems software and also hold a panel on embedded software education organized by Jeff Jackson and John Zao.
