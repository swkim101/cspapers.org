The near ubiquitous availability and success of mobile broadband networks has motivated verticals that range from public safety communication to intelligent transportation systems and beyond to consider choosing them as the communication mean of choice. Several of these verticals, however, expect high availability of multiple nines. This paper leverages end-to-end measurements to investigate the potential of current mobile broadband networks to support these expectations. We conduct a large-scale measurement study of network availability in four networks in Norway. This study is based on three years of measurements from hundreds of stationary measurement nodes and several months of measurements from four mobile nodes. We find that the mobile network centralized architecture and infrastructure sharing between operators are responsible for a non-trivial fraction of network failures. Most episodes of degraded availability, however, are uncorrelated. We also find that using two networks simultaneously can result in more than five nines of availability for stationary nodes and three nines of availability for mobile nodes. Our findings point to potential avenues for enhancing the availability of future mobile networks.
