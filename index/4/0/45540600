A man machine interface (MMI) designed for human interaction with an autonomous mobile robot is presented. The authors define a high level language for mission specification. This language allows an operator to describe surveillance missions. The model chosen provided an efficient interaction and allowed to implement fundamentals properties for a good man/machine interaction. Several examples were detailed to prove the significance of a simultaneous design phase of the MMI and the functional core of the application, in this case the supervisor.
