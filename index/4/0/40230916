Quokka collected GPS telemetry from the Whitbread boats and stored these in a relational database. These geographic positions would then be overlaid on map images that were generated by chart servers and served on the web. These chart servers were designed to render a nautical chart image based on a pair on geographic coordinates describing the upper left and lower right coordinates of the desired chart.
