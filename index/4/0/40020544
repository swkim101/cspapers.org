The overall approach to programming languages taken in the course is to use PL/I (with the PL/C compiler) during the first part of the semester to introduce programming concepts and techniques, then teach Fortran (with the WATFIV compiler) during the last part of the semester [2,3]. Except for a brief discussion of conventional flowcharts to help students read the examples in the texts, Nassi-Shneiderman structured flowcharts are used throughout the lectures and labs [4]. Algorithms are written in PL/I using DO-WHILE as the primary control structure, and GOTOs are not introduced except in Fortran.
