Welcome to the Fifth ACM Workshop on Formal Methods in Security Engineering (FMSE 2007) held in conjunction with the 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS 2007) on the Campus of George Mason University. 
 
The tradition of FMSE is to bring together researchers from both the security and the software engineering communities, from academia and industry, who are working on applying formal methods to designing and validating large-scale security-critical systems. The scope of the workshop covers security-related and formal-methods-related aspects of all activities in software ndevelopment, including requirement and risk analysis, security models like access control, information flow and trust models, the specification and analysis of security properties, aspects of stepwise development by refinement and composition, computationally sound abstraction, static and dynamic security analysis techniques like program logics, type systems and security monitors, tool support for the development and analysis of security-critical systems, and applications of formal methods, for instance, in the design and analysis of security protocols or operating systems. 
 
The paper selection process was very competitive this year. The call for papers attracted 28 submissions by authors from 15 different countries. The program committee accepted 8 papers for presentation, which unfortunately means that also some high-quality papers had to be rejected. In addition, the program features invited talks by Jeff Lewis and by John D. McLean.
