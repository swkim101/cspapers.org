The pervasive use of social media generates massive data in an unprecedented rate and the information overload problem becomes increasingly severe for social media users. Recommendation has been proven to be effective in mitigating the information overload problem, demonstrated its strength in improving the quality of user experience, and positively impacted the success of social media. New types of data introduced by social media not only provide more information to advance traditional recommender systems but also manifest new research possibilities for recommendation. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of various recommendation tasks in social media, especially their recent advances and new frontiers. We introduce basic concepts, review state-of-the-art algorithms, and deliberate the emerging challenges and opportunities. Finally we summarize the tutorial with discussions on open issues and challenges about recommendation in social media.
