Tensor decomposition has received much attention because of its ability of identifying latent relations and predicting missing elements in high-dimensional data through operations on low rank forms of tensors. However, the sparseness and high dimensionality of real-world datasets make the tensor decomposition slow, inefficient, and unscalable. In this research, the performance of a sparse tensor decomposition toolkit called SPLATT is implemented and evaluated on the K computer, a cluster based on the Intel Xeon Gold processors, and the Oakforest-PACS supercomputer. The results show that the SPLATT has the best scalability in the K computer among three systems, and the cluster outperforms the other two supercomputers in computation because of its cores running at high clock frequency and large memory in each node.
