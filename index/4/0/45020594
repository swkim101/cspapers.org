The parser is part of a text understanding system in which structural ambiguity is a major problem. All components of the system use a message-passing control structure. A general advantage of this form of control is that it allows the flexible integration of diverse knowledge sources. The parser transmits sub-sentential constituents for semantic interpretation. A pseudo-parallel version of the left-corner parsing algorithm with top-down filtering is used. As blind transmission would send spurious constituents, a delay mechanism is used to queue constituents until all alternative analyses of a segment have been completed.
