We describe the process of calculating the execution time prole (ETP) in order to determine the probabilistic worst case execution time (WCET) using a model-based approach. By hierarchical state machines with probabilistic transitions and costs/reward speci- cations, we model the instructions with probabilistic execution time. From the model, our tool, pState, generates input code for a probabilistic model checker on which properties can be analysed.
