The proliferation of smart devices in close proximity to end users has massively increased availability of data about our surroundings and hence stimulated a plethora of new services. However, it has also increased the chances of leaking sensitive and private information about end users (e.g., geolocation data, biometric signatures). Loss of trust towards a Cloud provider can lead to a user boycott and requests for deletion of the their remotely stored personal information. While many Cloud services can handle this relatively easily, it is far more cumbersome for many smart services. In fact, the current market of smart services is composed of black-box systems dependent on tight coupling between deployed hardware and the Cloud hosted software stack leaving virtually no freedom to change service provider without considerable redeployment costs. In this demo, we present FADEX, a Xen based, edge offloading platform designed and developed to run on off-the-shelf devices. As shown in Figure 1, unikernels (we use MirageOS) are a key component allowing us to offload only the required code without additional overhead due to layering of runtimes, shared libraries or other dependencies. Therefore, we call this approach fine-grained offloading: each unikernel is a single-purpose appliance containing only the code required by the application, resulting in reduced image size, improved security and greater manageability. Our system is designed with two specific goals in mind: (1) offer a virtualized ecosystem on top of the edge computing infrastructure to host arbitrary services; (2) provide enhanced performance by exploiting data locality.
