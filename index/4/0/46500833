In recent years, wireless sensor network (WSN) achieved many accomplishments in theoretical studies and practical applications. However, WSNs are facing with many challenges, one of the biggest challenges that the energy source is limited and difficult to recharge. Clustering is the efficient technique used to extend the network lifetime through data aggregation. In this paper, we propose a new approach by combining the stable cluster selection method with particle swarm optimization and intelligent searching to minimize the distance between the nodes in each cluster and reduce the number of dead nodes over time. The simulation results show that our proposed protocols have the lower energy consumption and longer lifetime compared to other protocols.
