For those of us who are essentially high level programmers, the intricacies and lack of structure in assembly language programs are often an insurmountable barrier to effective assembly language programming. This paper attempts to show a way to overcome this barrier. Structured pseudocode is used to solve the problem just as if the solution were to be coded in PL/I, PASCAL, ADA, or some other structured high level language. Then the structured pseudocode is “compiled” into assembly language using appropriate labels to show the structure of the assembly language program.
