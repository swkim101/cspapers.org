The notion of continuing education is nowhere more relevant than in the computer context. The fact that many top managers completed their formal education before computer topics were a part of most university curricula, coupled with the elemental changes that have transformed our industry for even those computer specialists who completed their education a few years ago, make continuing education for “computer currency” a very real need.
 A continual passing from hand to hand of computer knowledge is essential if we are to deal with technology in a timely way. Understanding of computer concepts can be a medium of exchange with real financial value in our technologically oriented society; in other words, a money type of currency.
