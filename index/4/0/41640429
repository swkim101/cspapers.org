Design one-dimensional antenna array of eight-elements using composite materials for wireless imaging transmission system is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the single element is designed to resonate at Zeroth-order using a pair of Double positive (DPS) and Epsilon negative (ENG) materials meta-structured transmission line (MTL). Secondly, using seven of 1:2 T-Junction power dividers based on microstrip technology is designed for feeding the eight-elements array antenna. Finally, the proposed array is optimized using FEM-based simulation to operate at the frequency of 10.5 GHz has a bandwidth spreading from 10.26 GHz to 10.75 GHz and a maximum gain of 11.6 dB. As a result, the proposed array antenna has higher gain and smaller total size than in comparison with those of the conventional patch antenna array suitable for wireless imaging transmission system.
