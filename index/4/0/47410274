In the mobile wireless computing environment of the future a large number of users equipped with low powered palm-top machines will query databases over the wireless communication channels. Palmtop based units will often be disconnected for prolonged periods of time due to the battery power saving measures; palmtops will also frequencly relocate between different cells and connect to different data servers at different times. Caching of frequently accessed data items will be an important technique that will reduce contention on the narrow bandwidth wireless channel. However, cache invalidation strategies will be severely affected by the disconnection and mobility of the clients. The server may no longer know which clients are currently residing under its cell and which of them are currently on. We propose a taxonomy of different cache invalidation strategies and study the impact of client's disconnection times on their performance. We determine that for the units which are often disconnected (sleepers) the best cache invalidation strategy is based on signatures previously used for efficient file comparison. On the other hand, for units which are connected most of the time (workaholics), the best cache invalidation strategy is based on the periodic broadcast of changed data items.
