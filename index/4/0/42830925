Recent research in designing and developing digital library services has been focused on approaches to indexing and searching in a steadily increasing range of genres and materials. An important aspect of this research is concerned with providing effective and scalable IR services for digital libraries as these diverse collections grow to sizes measured in terabytes and petabytes. The Cheshire project has had a central research focus on large-scale digital library collections for more than a decade, with a current focus on supporting distributed digital libraries in a Grid evironment. At the same time we have have been prototyping systems for very long term digital preservation, and examining how grid-scale information retrieval systems can interoperate with petabytes of diverse data stored over many years. In order for Information Retrieval (IR) in the evolving “Grid” parallel distributed computing environment[1] to work effectively, there must be a single flexible and extensible series of “Grid Services” with identifiable objects and a known API to handle the IR functions needed for Digital Libraries or other retrieval tasks. The Cheshire3 system builds on the work of the Cheshire project[4] over the past decade to define and implement an easy to use set of IR objects with precisely defined roles that can effectively provide a Grid Service for IR. This demonstration will show how the Cheshire3 system is being applied in distributed information retrieval tasks in large-scale grid-based digital libraries. We will show how the system has been integrated with “Datagrid” services provided by distributed storage systems like the Storage Resource Broker (SRB)[3], and how this enables very large scale storage and retrieval systems with support for data preservation services using the “Multivalent Document” framework[2]. In this demo we will present the results of testing Grid-
