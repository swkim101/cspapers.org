This tutorial aims at outlining fundamental methods for studying typical social science research questions with organic data (i.e., data that has not been designed for a specific research purpose but can be found on the Web). Further, social theories, statistical methods and models that help to understand the processes that generated the data will be discussed. Participants will learn (1) how to turn theoretical assumptions into models and test them, (2) how to validate measurements and (3) how to approximate causality when working with organic data.
