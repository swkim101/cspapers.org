Circuit analysis is central to electrical engineering. It is important that students master the skills it requires. Most of circuit analysis is concerned with writing expressions that embody transtoamations, conservation laws and the electrical behaviors of various devices This paper describes work in progress or an expert system that can examine the expressions that students write, diagnose the errors in them and suggest corrections. The expert system is implemented in OPS5 and uses the strategies of divide and conquer, forward chaining and hypoihesize and-test. The system can now recognise most of the Common errors that students make in dealing with linear resistive circuits and operates at about the level of a competent human grader.
