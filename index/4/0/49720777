Visible light communication (VLC) has been enabling many applications related to Internet of Things (IoT) such as activity detection, occupation detection, and human sensing. Due to the emerging concern on IoT security and privacy, enforcing distance boundary is becoming a highly desired attribute for various IoT services. In theory, such distance boundary could be achieved by combining dedicated system design and communication technologies. In practice, we rarely find IoT services that can fully benefit from this safeguard feature. This is mainly due to the complexity of exploiting various radio-based communication technologies to attain the distance limit in different IoT environments. Since visible light does not pass through opaque objects, it is a good candidate to reinforce the spatial barrier control over different IoT services that demand for distance-bounding wireless communication. We present LocalVLC , a ready-to-deploy platform that takes advantage of VLC to realize distance-bounding services. The goal is to build a user friendly VLC-based system that can harness the unique property of visible light to respect spatial barriers like doors and walls. Our design suits for dense wireless IoT deployment as visible light does not interfere with other existing wireless infrastructure (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy). LocalVLC introduces a lightweight Morse data encoding adjusted for VLC to deliver fine-grained and low-cost distance boundary control. We have implemented a full-fledged platform prototype to demonstrate the practicality of LocalVLC . Our use case (Fig. 1(a)) aims to automate indoor wireless (Wi-Fi) authentication. We use VLC for machine-to-machine communication to ease the setup of Wi-Fi networks. LocalVLC streamlines the credential management and achieves a “touchless” authentication experience in a distance-bounding manner, avoiding manual distribution and tedious input of passwords for login.
