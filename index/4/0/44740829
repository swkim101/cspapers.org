In interactive intent modeling the user partici-pates in constructing a model of her search intent using an interactive user interface. This allows the user to iteratively reﬁne the model used for personalizing her search results, even in the pres-ence of high initial uncertainty of the search intent. This approach for personalization has been shown to be beneﬁcial in exploratory information retrieval. This extended abstract summarizes the key results from past studies and suggests possi-bilities for the generalization of this approach. keywords.
