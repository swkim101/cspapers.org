We propose an in-parallel actuate mechanism that can simultaneously realize fine positioning resolution and a large working space, and we discuss its infinitesimal displacement characteristics. Based on a kinematic synthesis of this mechanism, an experimental manipulator has been developed and we discuss the results of experiments regarding its fine positioning characteristics.
