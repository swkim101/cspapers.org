This past June, the National Science Foundation sponsored a workshop devoted to exploring the topic of how to integrate object-oriented programming g (OOP) concepts into the undergraduate curriculum Participants were chosen based, in pm on papers and lab materials that were submitted demonstrating practical experience with teaching 00P to undergraduates. One of the many surprises (to the conveners) to come out of the workshop was the large number of attendees who advocated teaching 00P (in a variety of languages) in the fiist programming course for majors (CS 1), and who had developed interesting approaches for doing so.
