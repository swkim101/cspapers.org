Due to their thin size, vivid colors, high contrast and power efficiency, OLED and its variants such as AMOLED screens are increasingly replacing traditional LCD screens in mobile phones (eg. Google Nexus One, Samsung Galaxy S phones). However, the power efficiency of OLED screens greatly depends on the luminance and colors of the displayed contents on the screen. Web browsing is one of the most widely used applications in mobile devices. We demonstrate our cloud service, which intelligently re-paints the web pages in real-time with power efficient colors and tone mapping techniques without adversely affecting the user experience in reading the page and the identity of the page. Transformation of images, flash contents and videos in client itself will incur significant computational and energy overhead. El-pincel is designed as a cloud service to avoid any additional overhead to the mobile device.
