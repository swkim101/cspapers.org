MEMS has been an enabling technology for biomedical applications recently. Not only does it provide an instrument to obtain information on molecular level, but it also allows us to manipulate bio-molecules efficiently. Micro devices and systems for manipulation of biological objects such as cells, proteins and DNA have been demonstrated. In this study, we report a technique using dielectrophoretic forces to manipulate micro particles. First, the concept of several manipulation techniques is reviewed. Then we focus on novel manipulation modes. With the help of these biochips, we are able to perform manipulation of micro particles/cells.
