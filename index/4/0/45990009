Biometric data are affected by physiological properties of people, including gender or age. The paper describes an experiment of discovering gender and age in computer mouse movement data that might be notably beneficial for profiling anonymous visitors browsing the Web. The proposed method extracts features, such as velocity, path straightness or pauses duration, that are used by a multiclassifier system to make an estimate. Age category estimation shows encouraging results of the early method, especially for statistical analysis of a website audience.
