For our undergraduate computer science architecture majors, we are making a major revision of our existing course sequence (three courses) on microprocessors. For effective utilization of microprocessors, a total system design and development methodology approach is used. In this paper, we discuss the development of the first course of the sequence. The first course emphasizes on various microprocessor architectures. Since our non-architecture major undergraduate students may take this first course as an elective, this course is designed as a self contained foundation course with proper mixes of hardware and software.
