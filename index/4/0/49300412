In modelling real-world knowledge, there often arises a need to represent and reason with meta-knowledge. To equip description logics (DLs) for dealing with such ontologies, we enrich DL concepts and roles with finite sets of attributeâ€“value pairs, called annotations, and allow concept inclusions to express constraints on annotations. We investigate a range of DLs starting from the lightweight description logic EL, covering the prototypical ALCH, and extending to the very expressive SROIQ, the DL underlying OWL 2 DL.
