Voting methods such as boosting and bagging provide substantial improvements in classification performance in many problem domains. However, the resulting predictions can prove inscrutable to end-users. This is especially problematic in domains such as medicine, where end-user acceptance often depends on the ability of a classifier to explain its reasoning. Here we propose a variant of the boosted naive Bayes classifier that facilitates explanations while retaining predictive performance.
