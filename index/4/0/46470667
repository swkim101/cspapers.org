From our ideas and the demand to control and to monitor household appliances (eg lights, fans, pumps, shower, etc) anywhere by using mobile handset through GSM technology, this paper is aimed to present a new idea of using the embedded system on FPGA platform with the microprocessor MicroBlaze and the real time operating system FreeRTOS to control and to monitor household appliances through GPRS and using the PIR sensor to carry out monitoring break-in. Due to the strict requirements of the time constraints, the use of resources and the importance of scheduling, real-time operating system (TRTOS) plays a very important role in the development of embedded systems.
