Research work in programming languages and in database systems is combating the same problems of scale, change and complexity. This paper looks at the present difficulties of relating persistent data with changing programs. It illustrates the influence that the present interfaces have on programming methodology and algorithm design. It recognises the need for new language primitives to encapsulate database concepts and a few putative primitives are examined. It is suggested that such primitives could simplify the use of databases by programmers. These ideas are illustrated with examples from geometric modelling using Algol 68.
