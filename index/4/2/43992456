Mobile robots facing a diversity of open environments and performing a variety of tasks and interactions need explicit deliberation in order to fulfill their missions. Deliberation is meant to endow a mobile robot system with extended, more adaptable and robust functionalities, as well as reduce its deployment cost. The ambition of this survey is to present a global overview of deliberation functions in mobile robots and to discuss the state of the art in deep learning theories. And the present article focuses on the study of the intelligent navigation techniques, which are capable of navigating a mobile robot autonomously in static as well as dynamic environments.
