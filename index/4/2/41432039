Evolutionary algorithms have previously shown promise in generating controllers for legged robots. Multiple evaluations across many evolutionary generations are typically required â€” simulators are frequently used to accommodate this. However, performance degradation is frequently observed when transferring controllers from simulation to reality due to inconsistencies between the two. In this paper we demonstrate a testbed that permits repeated, direct evolution of hexapod controllers as a closed-loop system. The testbed uses a two-stage evolutionary process. In stage 1, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm spreads a population of controllers across a space of desirable criteria. The second stage allows for specific criteria to be selected for on a per-mission basis, with promising initial controller parameters taken from the first stage. As the optimisation occurs directly on the robot, performance is guaranteed. Furthermore, controllers can be made specific to irregularities in e.g., motor wear, and robot mass distribution, creating controllers that are sensitive to the hardware state of the individual robot.
