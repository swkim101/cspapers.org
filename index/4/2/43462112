A solid state ion-sensitive measuring electrode is disclosed in which a filler solution comprising sodium silicate is provided between an outer glass membrane of the electrode and an internal metallic wire which serves as a conductor from the electrode to a meter. The filler solution is inserted into the electrode as a liquid, and is subsequently dehydrated to provide a permanent solid-state matrix which is electrically conducting between the outer glass membrane and the internal wire.
