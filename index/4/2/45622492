The problem of estimating the makespan for parallel applications is overly pessimistic bounds either due to load imbalance issues plaguing static scheduling methods or due to timing anomalies plaguing dynamic scheduling methods for multicore architectures. While dynamic scheduling (where tasks are not pre-assigned) offers better utilization of the processors, it suffers from timing anomalies. This paper contributes with a new timing-anomaly-free dynamic scheduling algorithm, called the Out-of-(priority)-order Lazy (O-Lazy) that offers safe and tighter estimation of the makespan of parallel applications.
