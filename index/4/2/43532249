Optical properties of tellurite nanowire core photonic crystal fiber (PCF) are compared with silica and germanium-doped core PCFs. Using finite element method (FEM) with a circular perfectly matched boundary layer (PML), superior performance of tellurite nanowire core PCF is reported to design highly nonlinear and high numerical aperture (NA) PCF. With the same structural dimension, tellurite nanowire core PCF is found to be 14.5 times higher nonlinear coefficient compared to pure silica core PCF and 7.5 times higher nonlinear coefficient compared to 3% germanium (Ge)-doped core PCF. In addition, tellurite nanowire core PCF shows higher NA compared to pure silica core PCF and 3% Ge-doped core PCF. Moreover, zero-dispersion manipulating techniques of tellurite nanowire core PCF are briefly described with simulation results.
