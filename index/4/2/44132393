The increasing use of models in specification and design phases makes them first class citizens. Models which had, till now, been used to gain a better grasp of the software to be designed, have been attributed a productive role that has become central to development. This new status of models and meta-models poses the problem of how they are established and especially, how they are validated. So, each activity in a process can be supported by MDE (Model-Driven Engineering) components realizing transformations and verifications. These operations require redefining the OCL type system for taking into account multi-model handling and side-effects. Checking the transformation consists of ensuring that the source models and the targets respect a set of properties that can be verified through transformation contracts. The NEPTUNE platform was designed having this logic as a driving force - allowing the verification of models and of their transformation.
