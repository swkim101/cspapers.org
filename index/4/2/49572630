Real-time navigation in the partially unknown environment is an interesting task for mobile robotics. This article presents the cascade neuro-fuzzy (CN-Fuzzy) architecture for intelligent mobile robot navigation and obstacle avoidance in static and dynamic environments. The array of ultrasonic range finder sensors and sharp infrared range sensors are used to read the front, left and right obstacle distances. The cascade neural network is used to train the robot to reach the goal. Its inputs are the different obstacle distance received from the sensors. The output of the neural network is a turning angle between the robot and goal. The fuzzy architecture is integrated with the cascade neural network to control the velocities of the robot. Successful simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in both static and dynamic environments. Moreover, the proposed CN-Fuzzy architecture gives better results (in terms of path length) as compared to previously developed techniques, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.
