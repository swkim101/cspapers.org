This paper examines the field of data base management from the perspective of software engineering. Key topics in software engineering are related to specific activities in data base design and implementation. An attempt is made to show the similarities between steps in the creation of systems involving data bases and other kinds of software systems. It is argued that there is a need to unify thinking about data base systems with other kinds of software systems and tools in order to build high quality systems. The progrming language PLAIN and its programning environment is introduced as a tool for integrating notions of programning languages, data base management, and software engineering.
