The improvement of micro vision sensor is required for milli-machines and micromachines. This paper proposes a compound-eye-type micro vision sensor with simple structure for milli-machines. The sensor consists of only a photo sensor array and a cover. A prototype of the sensor is constructed. As an application of the sensor, detection of shape and motion is discussed. Experiments with the prototype show that the proposed sensor can obtain rough shape and motion, and is applicable for practical use.
