It is our pleasure to welcome you from all over the world to ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Symposium on InformAtion, Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS). For the first time we bring an ACM-sponsored conference on information, computer and communications security to Asia. The venue for ASIACCS is Hotel Grand Hyatt Taipei and TAIPEI 101. You will find that TAIPEI is mnemonic for technology, art, innovation, people, excitement, and identity, while "101" symbolizes striving beyond perfection. We would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to the inaugural ACM Symposium on InformAtion, Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS). In today's world, the implications for information security are enormous, and the role of security researchers and practitioners has never been more important. Security continues to prove intangible in practice, and the rising computer crimes pose a great challenge to the deployment of information technology.
