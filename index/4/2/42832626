Effectively using the Grid computing environment requires a working knowledge of several interacting layers of technology, a potentially daunting task for the new user. GRIDS Center presents a hands-on, full-day tutorial moving the new Grid user through a guided series of activities introducing concepts such as the Globus toolkit, Grid security certificates, reliable file transfer, simple job management, and workflow management. The tutorial introduces essential skills that will be needed to conduct and support use of the Grid computing environment. Hands-on exercises will be presented using a small dedicated grid hosted for this purpose at NCSA.Reflecting attendee feedback from the SC 2005 workshop, we will include more material on grid security and account management tools and revise and extend workflow management examples.
