Human friendly service robots such as home service robots, cleaning robots, entertainment robots take great attention in order to create new markets for robots since the markets for conventional industrial robots are saturating. It is a step to change the working environments of robots from industries to homes and offices, and to extend markets for robots from industrial markets to commercial home appliance markets. This paper introduces a home service robot 'ISSAC' applicable for vacuum cleaning, home security to find intruders and to transfer captured images of the intruder to the police or security companies, voice-based information service, real-time image transfer through wireless TCP/IP Ethernet and/or CDMA-2000 wireless communication, and a telepresence controllable by mobile computers such as pocket PC's and/or cellular phones. The overall controller is developed as a network-based layered modular controller using CAN (controller area network). The robot is tested in an apartment for a week successfully.
