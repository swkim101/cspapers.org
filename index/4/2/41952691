In this paper, we propose to develop a new Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) using a new nonlinear model representation entitled bilinear-Laguerre model. This latter is resulting from the expansion of the bilinear model on Laguerre orthonormal bases which enables to identify a large class of nonlinear systems with significant parameter number reduction with respect to the classical bilinear model. By exploiting the simple recursive representation of the bilinear-Laguerre model, the predictive control strategy is applied using the classical technique that minimizes a quadratic criterion with respect to constraints due to sensors and actuators. The effectiveness of the proposed controller that takes into account physical constraints is illustrated by a numerical simulation example.
