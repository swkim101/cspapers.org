This paper describes our concept on the intelligent space. The intelligent spaces are rooms or areas that are equipped with sensors, which enable the spaces to perceive and understand what is happening in them. By using such features, people or systems in the intelligent space are supported and can use additional functions. The intelligent spaces are expected to have a broad range of applications such as in homes, offices, factories etc. The basic components, which compose our experimental system, are shown in this paper with descriptions.
