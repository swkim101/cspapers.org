There are many barriers preventing the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart communities and smart cities, including interoperability, concerns about vendor lock-in, economic constraints, and privacy issues. We present a “mar-ketecture” and platform called the Intelligent IoT Integrator (I3) that addresses these problems through the development of a marketplace that facilities the easy movement of real-time IoT data streams between device owners and third-party applications, based on the establishment of suitable incentives and usage agreements. We envision the system scaling gracefully over time as different I3 community instances peer with each other.
