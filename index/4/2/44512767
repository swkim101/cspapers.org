Ad hoc networks are a new wireless networking paradigm for mobile hosts. Unlike traditional mobile wireless networks, ad hoc networks do not rely on any fixed infrastructure. Instead, hosts rely on each other to keep the network connected. The military tactical and other security-sensitive operations are still the main applications of ad hoc networks, although there is a trend to adopt ad hoc networks for commercial uses due to their unique properties. One of the most important methods for evaluating the characteristics of ad hoc networking protocols is through the use of simulation. The topology and movement of the nodes in the simulation are key factors in the performance of the network protocol under study. Once the nodes have been initially distributed, the mobility model dictates the movement of the nodes within the network. In the performance evaluation of a protocol for an ad hoc network, the protocol should be tested under realistic conditions which should impersonate the real world conditions. In order to overcome the short comings of the problem, design and analysis of restricted mobility model is the key. In this restricted mobility model we used the fact that mobile nodes moving under OLSR protocol tend to concentrate or settle down in the center and define a smaller mobility region then defined in the simulation parameters.
