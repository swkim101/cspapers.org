Presents an analysis of the mechanics for multi-fingered grasps of planar objects. The main feature in the approach followed is a novel decomposition of the contact finger forces. At each grasp point, a contact force is resolved into components along the normal and tangential directions. This concept of decomposition gives deeper physical insights into the roles of the normal and tangential finger force components for multi-fingered manipulation.
