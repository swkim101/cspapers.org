Research in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) has been in-progress towards the real implementation of ad-hoc routing protocols to be used in the real-time applications. However, existing approaches implement ad-hoc routing protocols as standalone daemons to serve only pure routing functionalities, leading to difficulties on the network configuration once multiple routing protocols are running in the network. In this paper, we use another approach, in which ad-hoc routing protocols are integrated into the Quagga routing software suite, and aodvd, a re-active ad-hoc routing daemon, is used for the real integration demonstration.
