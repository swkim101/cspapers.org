How to reconstruct a high resolution and quality from low resolution images captured from a digital camera is always the top target of any image processing system. Exploit the aliasing feature of sampled images, we propose a new technique to register exactly the motions between images, including rotations and shifts, by using only frequency domain phase-shift method. Based on registered parameters, the precise alignment of input images are done to create a high-resolution by using interpolation methods. It is more exactly when we compare our algorithm to other algorithms in simulation and practical experiments. The visual results of super-resolution images reconstruced by our algorithm are better than that of other algorithms. It is possible to apply our algorithm to increase resolution of digital camera or video systems.
