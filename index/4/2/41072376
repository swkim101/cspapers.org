Testing Object-Oriented SoftwareEdward Berard, Berard Software Engineering
Testing of object-oriented software is just as important astesting non-object-oriented software, but the process isfundamentally different because of such factors as informationhiding, encapsulation, and inheritance. This tutorial teaches youthe terms and concepts of testing software in general, andobject-oriented software in particular; how to apply a number ofdifferent testing techniques to object-oriented software; how toconstruct test cases; and an appreciation of what is involved inplanning a successful software testing effort. The testingtechniques that are covered include both white-box testing such asbasis path testing and coverage testing, and black-box testingtechniques such as equivalence class partitioning and boundaryvalue analysis.
This course is designed for those with experience inobject-oriented software engineering who would like to follow amore rigorous approach to testing.
