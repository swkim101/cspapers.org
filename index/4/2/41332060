Accurate detection of emotion from natural language has applications ranging from building emotional chatbots to better understanding individuals and their lives. However, progress on emotion detection has been hampered by the absence of large labeled datasets. In this work, we build a very large dataset for fine-grained emotions and develop deep learning models on it. We achieve a new state-of-the-art on 24 fine-grained types of emotions (with an average accuracy of 87.58%). We also extend the task beyond emotion types to model Robert Plutickâ€™s 8 primary emotion dimensions, acquiring a superior accuracy of 95.68%.
