Recently, methods for concurrency control have been proposed which were called "optimistic". These methods do not consider access conflicts when they occur; instead, a transaction always proceeds, and at its end a check is performed whether a conflict has happened. If so, the transaction is backed up. 
 
This basic approach is investigated in two directions: First, a method is developed which frees read transactions from any consideration of concurrency control; all responsibility for correct synchronization is assigned to the update transactions. This method, has the great advantage that, in case of conflicts between read transactions and update transactions, no backup is performed. Then, the application of optimistic solutions in distributed database systems is discussed, a solution is presented.
