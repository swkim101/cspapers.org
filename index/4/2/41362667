Summary form only given. In this paper, the special estimation schemes for INS/GPS integration is addressed and implemented on real-time PC-box hardware. The Strapdown INS (SINS) using 2 Kalman Filters (KF) has been built so that the system can operate flexibly between feedforward and feedback modes in case of GPS outage. The experiment results shown that this INS/GPS system can be used for practical applications.
