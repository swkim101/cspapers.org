We show that every approximately differentially private learning algorithm (possibly improper) for a class H with Littlestone dimension d requires Ω(log*(d)) examples. As a corollary it follows that the class of thresholds over ℕ can not be learned in a private manner; this resolves open questions due to [Bun et al. 2015] and [Feldman and Xiao, 2015]. We leave as an open question whether every class with a finite Littlestone dimension can be learned by an approximately differentially private algorithm.
