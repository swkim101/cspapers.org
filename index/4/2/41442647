In this paper redundant actuation is used to generate internal preload that would not interfere with the task. This preload is controlled in order to achieve a desired end-effector stiffness, i.e. a desired relationship of applied forces and resulting displacements. This active stiffness yields immediate counteractions to load variations and thus strengthens the integrity of the manipulators. Differential EE-stiffness is defined and a stiffness control scheme is proposed. Results are shown for a planar manipulator
