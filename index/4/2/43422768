Any semantic cache query processing technique is said to be efficient, if it is able to find maximum possible or complete answer from the cache within tractable time. This work evaluates previous semantic cache query processing techniques on the basis of maximum data retrieval (MDR). For this several cases are provided where previous query processing techniques are unable to find maximum possible or complete answer even when it is present in the cache. It is due to neglecting implicit knowledge (Cross Attribute Knowledge) present in semantics of the cache. This knowledge is identified and formally presented here in this work.
