This paper proposes a novel Local Magnetic Actuation (LMA) based Laparoscopic Camera (LMALC) device attached to a cable-driven continuum arm for high dexterity and wide angle of vision. The main motivation of this magnetic-based camera design is to provide the camera the full mobility across all abdominal quadrants upon insertion through a laparoscopic incision. The magnetic coupling concept, implemented in the LMALC permanent magnet anchoring and actuation units, allows the camera to be completely detached from the external power unit and conveniently placed away from the incision point for better view triangulation, without taking up incision port space. In this study, the kinematic analysis of the magneticbased cable-driven manipulator is presented, relating the pose of the continuum arm and wires displacement to the actuator revolutions driven by the external magnetic field. Experiments performed on the developed LMALC prototype platform with respect to varying inter-magnetic distance show consistency and feasibility, closely simulating the theoretical model.
