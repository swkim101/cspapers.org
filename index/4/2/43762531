Summary form only given. This paper concentrates on studying, designing and manufacturing a broadband microstrip antenna able to operate within many frequency bands. Antenna is used for 3G mobile handsets operating within GSM, UTMS, and WLAN bands. This antenna is made from FR4-epoxy substrate having epsivr = 4.4, h = 0.8 mm (thickness). It is designed at 900 MHz and 2000 MHz frequencies. It has folded structure and includes three branches: two resonant branches and a tuning branch which are fed by 50Omega microstrip lines.
