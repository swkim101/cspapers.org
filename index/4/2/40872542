We prove the Isomorphism Conjecture for algebraic K-theory and L-theory for arbitrary coefficient rings for group which are subgroups of finite products of word-hyperbolic groups. The ingredients are controlled topology and flows on models of the classifying space for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups. This is probably one of my best results of the last five years and is a result of a project I have worked on for the last decade. It has many applications to conjectures by Bass, Moody and Kaplansky. The relevant papers are [5] and [6]. The paper [4] will play an important role in the proof. The L-theory version will be proved in a paper joint with Bartels which is in preparation. It will imply also the Borel Conjecture for such groups in high dimensions. The Borel Conjecture is the topological version of Mostow rigidity. It predicts for a group G that two closed aspherical manifolds M and N whose fundamental groups are isomorphic to G are homeomorphic and that actually every homotopy equivalence is homotopic to a homeomorphism. We can also show (see [7]) that both the Bost Conjecture and the Farrell -Jones Conjecture with coefficients are true for those group for which Higson-Lafforgue-Skandalis have disproved the BaumConnes Conjecture with coefficients. Bartels and I am currently working on proving all these results also for CAT(0)-groups.
