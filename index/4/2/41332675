The remarks which follow concern four design objectives for a shared computer system, and their relation to the selection of computing equipment and the design and programming of a time-sharing program at IDA-CRD during the last year. The principle objective was to bring as much computing power to our users as possible, consistent with budgetary bounds, and to provide as intimate a connection to the computer for each user as possible. A second objective was to provide a computing environment which allows each user the maximum freedom and control over the machine possible within balancing of our third objective, namely, maximum reliability of the system. Our fourth objective was one which we choose for any program of a lasting nature; that the programs be as simple as possible to still achieve their purpose. Adhering to this maxim usually, although not always, reduces the time involved in realizing the programs; and in addition, holds promise for increasing their reliability and in any event reduces maintenance problems if only by reducing the possible number of wrong symbols.
