In this paper, we propose the Ω-machine model for social machines. By introducing a cluster of "oracles" to a traditional Turing machine, the Ω-machine is capable of describing the interaction between human participants and mechanical machines. We also give two examples of social machines, collective intelligence and rumor spreading, and demonstrate how the general Ω-machine model could be used to simulate their computations.
