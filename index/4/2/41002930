Technological innovations in continuous-flow microfluidics require updated automated synthesis methods. As new microfluidic components and biochemical applications are constantly introduced, the current functionality-based application mapping methods and the fixed-time-slot scheduling methods are insufficient to solve the new design challenges. In this work, we propose a component-oriented general device concept that enables precise description of operations and devices, and adapts well to technological updates. Applying this concept, we propose a layering algorithm together with a mathematical modeling method to synthesize binding and hybrid-scheduling solutions that support both fixed schedule and real-time decisions. We also consider potential chip layout and optimize the number of flow channels among devices to save routing efforts. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution fully utilizes the chip resources and can handle operations with different requirements.
