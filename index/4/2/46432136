Data Warehousing and Online Analytical Processing have emerged as key technologies for enterprises wishing to streamline the management of their operational and business data and to improve decision support activities. In addition, data warehousing continues to take on broader roles, for example, in the context of integrating heterogeneous data sources, knowledge sharing in extended enterprises, and internet- based e-commerce.The Fourth ACM International Workshop on Data Warehousing and Online Analytical Processing (DOLAP 2001), which is held in Atlanta, GA, USA, provides an international forum for researchers and practitioners to share their findings in theoretical foundations, methodologies, practical experiences, and new research directions in the areas of data warehousing and online analytical processing.These proceedings contain the technical papers selected for presentation at the workshop. We received 31 submissions from 16 different countries. The submitted research papers covered the state- of- the- art in data warehousing and related fields including data warehouse architecture, design and evolution, multidimensional modeling, query optimization, indexing, view materialization and maintenance, data warehouse quality, XML- and object- based warehouses, and data warehousing and the Web. In addition, we received a number of industrial submissions describing ongoing data warehousing projects and novel applications for warehouses. After careful review by the program committee, 12 research and industrial papers were selected for the workshop.
