Simulations offer an engaging way to learn about decomposition of complex systems. Here I describe a project where the goal is to build a simulation of an ant colony consisting of five different ant behaviors in a 2D environment. Students design and build their simulations with no code provided except for the required GUI. Design issues include choice of appropriate data structures; traversal issues; and using inheritance to model ant behaviors. Students also learn about emergence, as characterized by the development of organized foraging trails by ants that respond only to their immediate surroundings. The visualization requirement enables students to quickly determine whether or not requirements have been met, and provides a way to rapidly grade a moderately large and complex assignment.
