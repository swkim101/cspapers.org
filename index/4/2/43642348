For ecient heart inspection with an automatic and non- invasive system it is imperative to collect dierent signals from human body. In the sequence of the development of a standalone Portable Deci- sion Support System for Heart Failure Detection and Medical Diagnosis it was decided to record heart sounds to help in diagnosis process. How- ever, automatic identication and parameter extraction of heart sounds deals with several challenges, such as, noise sources and low level signal pressures at microphone, as well as, abnormal sounds that overlaps nor- mal signals. This paper discusses phonocardiography and its signals, as well as, signal processing techniques able to extract important parame- ters and indicators from heart sounds.
