The scope and breadth of Graphic Data Processing, as indicated by the myriad of applications, industries, and disciplines to which is applies, is immense. Graphic technology and methodology, in turn, is new and growing. The individual problem areas of programming, drawing input, stored program graphic processing, console manipulation, digital image storage, and drawing output, are each subjects that could fill a book.
 This introduction will concentrate on one of these areas, drawing output. Graphics output is the “business” end of Graphic Data Processing, and by summarizing what is being produced by Graphic Data Processing systems today a good idea of the current scope of graphics can be achieved.
