This paper proposes a novel combined spatial and amplitude-phase modulation (APM) scheme based on the generalize space shift keying (GSSK) system. The so-called GSSK/APM scheme performs two independent modulations using the GSSK and APM constellations. The modulated symbols from the two modulators are multiplied to generate the transmit symbols. With the two different constellations the proposed scheme allows easy control of the spectral efficiency compared to the related multiple antenna systems. In order to detect the transmit symbols, three detectors based on maximum likelihood, linear detection, and correlation are proposed. Theoretical upper bound of the bit error probability (BEP) is also derived and used to validate the simulation results.
