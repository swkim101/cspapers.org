Aim of the WS This workshop concentrated on the process dimension of 00 analysis: how does one do OOA. The call for contributions identified the following topics: exploration of top-down-ness as a core strategy; delineation of the set of artifacts that are the stepping stones for the 00 analysis process; description of dependencies between these artifacts that can be identified as generic constituents of an 00 analysis process; formulation of entry and exit criteria for these generic constituents of an 00 analysis process; description of a " broad-brush " 00 analysis process, either on the basis of reasoned deliberations or on the basis of experience; merging strategies for reusing concepts et al obtained in an 00 domain analysis into an analysis for a specific system; formulation of metrics to monitor progress in the OOA process; experience reports that highlight the process dimension. The Workshop format was primarily presentation in the morning and early afternoon, with varying amount of discussing during the presentations. Informal discussions and a summary finished the day.
