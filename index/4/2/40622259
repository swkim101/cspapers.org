We describe the development of a Java bytecode optimisation algorithm by the methodology of program extraction. We develop the algorithm as a collection of proofs and definitions in the Coq proof assistant, and then use Coq's extraction mechanism to automatically generate a program in OCaml. The extraction methodology guarantees that this program is correct. We discuss the feasibility of the methodology and suggest some improvements that could be made.
