The concept of managing an entire database in main memory has been researched and studied for over fifteen years [l-7], and the benefits of such an approach have been well-understood in certain domains, such as telecommunications, for at least as long. But it is only recently, with decreasing memory prices and with the availability of 64-bit operating systems, that the size restrictions on in-memory databases have been removed. In-memory data management has become available for many more applications that are in dire need of high performance.
