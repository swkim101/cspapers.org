Complementing the topics of ACM SenSys 2015, the 3rd International Workshop on Energy Harvesting and Energy Neutral Sensing Systems (ENSsys) 2015 brings together researchers to explore the challenges, issues and opportunities in the research, design, and engineering of energy-harvesting and energy-neutral sensing systems. These are an enabling technology for future applications in smart energy, transportation, environmental monitoring and smart cities. Innovative solutions in hardware for energy scavenging, adaptive algorithms, and power management policies are needed to enable uninterrupted operation. This one-day workshop features invited and peer reviewed talks on these areas, and provides a forum for feedback, discussion and networking.
