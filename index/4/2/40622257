The development of an intelligent fixture for automatic assembly by the robots that can manipulate and fix a heavy object in three dimensions and make the relocation of the jigs unnecessary is addressed. A new mechanism, which is constructed by the rotational base and the one-DOF fingers, is proposed. It makes the manipulation (mainly rotation) of the heavy target object possible because of its simplicity, but the simplicity causes some problems. The kinematics and the dynamics of manipulation by this mechanism is derived, and it is shown how to plan the manipulation. Simulation and experimental results are reported.
