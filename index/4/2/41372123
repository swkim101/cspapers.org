Building on the success of ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) and ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC), the ACM Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC) formally established the annual ACM Symposium on InformAtion, Computer and Communications Security (ASIACCS), whose first edition was held in 2006. ASIACCS 2008 is the third conference of the series. The conference is hosted by National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), and sponsored by ACM SIGSAC and AIST, and held in Akihabara, Tokyo, Japan, in March 18-20 2008. 
 
The 40 papers, including 6 short ones, at the conference were selected from among 182 submissions. The proceedings cover widespread topics from security theory to high-level applications. Despite the intensive work of 48 program committee members and 126 external reviewers, time restrictions made it hard to provide extensive reviews for the papers in the proceedings. Furthermore, due to the space limitation, some papers had to be presented as short papers. It is thus expected that extended versions of many of the papers in these these proccedings will be published in various journals. The conference feature two invited talks, which are not included in the proceedings.
