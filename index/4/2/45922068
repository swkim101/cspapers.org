Programming environments must adapt to the challenges of new application domains. As digital produiction techniques diffuse through the media industry, we expect to see increasing demands for applications in such areas as content creation and management (e.g., authoring tools and multimedia databases); broadband group communication (e.g., tele-learning and telepresence); and media-rich virtual worlds (e.g., virtual museums). To build these applications we need highly extensible programming environments for distributed and interoperable components. Object-oriented technology appears to offer the needed flexibility. This talk will look at what object-oriented technology can contribute to multimedia programming we discuss the notion of “media objects” and introduce an object-oriente:d framework for media processing hardware and software components.
