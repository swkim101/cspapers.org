In this paper, we investigate two partial relay selection (PRS) protocols in underlay cognitive radio under impact of hardware impairment. In particular, the re-active and pro-active PRS schemes are proposed to compensate the performance loss due to the hardware noises and the interference constraints required by multiple primary users (PUs). Moreover, incremental relaying technique is also used to enhance spectrum efficiency. For performance evaluation and comparison, we drive exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions of outage probability over Rayleigh fading channel. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the analytical derivations.
