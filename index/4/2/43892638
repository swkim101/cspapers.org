Along with many other issues to be considered when converting a vehicle to CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), one of the primary concerns is the measurement of gas that is remaining in the cylinder. A conventional gas actuation system, which is fitted on the gas pipeline going to the pressure regulator, sends a signal to the unit installed inside of the vehicle that indicates the pressure, normally through four LEDs. A well-tested design is presented in this paper, which gives an accurate and precise measurement of gas pressure in NGVs (Natural Gas Vehicles) using a non-contact sensor mechanism. The final product has an accuracy of 2.0% having a gauge reading of 6000 psi, tested and verified at 4500 psi.
