TASK is a 'high level' specification language for defining software that executes on distributed computers. Software is in the form of task forcesâ€”collections of communicating parallel processes that cooperate to achieve a common goal. Using the TASK language, a programmer specifies the interrelated components of his task force: modules exporting functions which are potentially executed in parallel, multiple data and code objects, and processes. The user may adapt the configuration of the task force to enhance performance, reliability, or the degree of distribution. In particular, data or processes may be replicated, data may be partitioned into multiple memory units, and physical resource allocations may be controlled.
