The Active Manual is an extension of previous work on task oriented manuals. The techniques used for improvement are based on several concepts. While these concepts are not novel, in themselves being well-grounded in psychological research, the combination of these concepts is unique. The work has moved task manuals into the windowed on-line world of the computer to accommodate the extensions.
