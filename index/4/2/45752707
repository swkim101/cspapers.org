The feasibility of a 2-DOF fiber optic angular displacement sensor is investigated. Three fiber embedded joint models are created and tested and the physical parameters which affect optical loss are optimized. A successful setup is presented and its limitations are discussed. Theoretical results are compared and the sensor precision is calculated.
