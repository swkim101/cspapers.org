In this paper, we present a method to follow a planned trajectory in a highly cluttered environment for complex nonholonomic systems. This method ensures, under some hypotheses, that the robot never collides. When a collision is detected on the trajectory, we compute a deceleration interval to stop the robot while decelerating, we deform the trajectory in such a way that the trajectory is always feasible.
