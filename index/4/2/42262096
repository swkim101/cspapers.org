Selection of proper analysis and design methods is crucial to produce cost and time efficient applications. Effective strategies help developers to come up with more stable, reusable, and complete applications, which is the main purpose of software management. In order to express the importance of proper analysis and design methods, this poster compares two different modeling methods: traditional object oriented and software stability. The modeling methods are utilized for development of the same application: MRI visual analyzer (MRIVA).MRIVA is a computer application to help doctors gain a better understanding of Magnetic resonance image (MRI) pictures. It provides them the opportunity to access variant parts of the organ and study it from different points of view. The current poster shows the result of both methods; however, it is evident that SSM model is simpler and more complete. It offers a firm base for later reuses and is stable under changes over time or application area.
