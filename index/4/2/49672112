We present the first large-scale (9270-user) study of data from both mobile and networked appliances for Big-Five personality inference. We correlate aggregated behavioral and physical health features with personalities, and perform binary classification using SVM and Decision Tree. We find that it is possible to infer each Big-Five personality at accuracies of 75% from this dataset despite its size and complexity (mix of mobile and appliance) as prior methods offer similar accuracy levels. We would like to achieve better accuracies and this study is a first step towards seeing how to model such data.
