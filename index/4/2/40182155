This paper describes an approach to an introductory computer science course designed especially for students who are not specifically required to take a computer course and thus ordinarily receive no appreciation for computers or computing. This is the third semester this course has been offered. Student enrollment has been 31, 46 and 41 respectively. We anticipate higher enrollment figures next semester as more advisors are becoming aware of the course. In a typical semester students majoring in such disciplines as English, advertising, nursing, psychology, sports administration, sociology, broadcasting and communication, music, elementary education, art and anthropology have enrolled. This course is ideal for those majoring in mathematics education as one day they may be teaching such a course to high school students. To encourage this group of students to enroll in the course, we restricted students from engineering and physical sciences and business disciplines from attending. They are required to take a different computer course. We have observed that most students not required to take a computer course desire to learn something about computers, and because of the above restriction are less hesitant to enroll.
