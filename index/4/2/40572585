Presents a stabilizing controller design method for flexible joint robot manipulators, which incorporates an additional stabilizing control law with the sliding property. The simulations of a 2-D/O/F/ flexible joint manipulator show that the proposed scheme is effective for manipulators with highly flexible joints.
