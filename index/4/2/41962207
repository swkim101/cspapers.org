Problems which Induce performance that has the false appearance of success (garden path problems) may be an Inevitable consequence of the need (In both human and computer problem solving systems) to create abstract knowledge representations In order to make problem solving efficient. An example is presented from a domain of physics problem solving tasks in which a hierarchical organisation of lines of reasoning leads to errors of the garden path type. Several aspects of a possible model of the problem solving process In these tasks are briefly outlined.
