Web-based community is a self-defined web-based network of interactive communication organized around a shared interest or purpose. It provides the means of interactions among people in which they create, share, and exchange information and ideas in virtual space and networks. Working with big data often requires querying and reasoning that data to isolate information of interest and manipulate it in various ways. This editorial paper explores recent big data research topics -- stream querying and reasoning -- over data from web based communities. It combines aspects from some well-studied research domains, such as, social network analysis, graph databases, and data streams. We provide a brief synopsis of some research issues in supporting reasoning and querying tasks. This editorial also presents the WI&C-16 workshop's goal and programme.
