In this study, we have designed a system to enable hearing-impaired to enjoy the performance of tap dancers. This system transfers the haptic sensation of tap dancing from the stage to the audience and helps hearing-impaired people enjoy the vibration of the taps even if they cannot hear the sound. We organized an event to verify the effectiveness of the system. To do this, we collaborated with a tap dance unit and science museum. We found that our system succeeded in helping the tap dancers share the fun and enjoyment of dance with the audience comprising people with hearing disabilities.
