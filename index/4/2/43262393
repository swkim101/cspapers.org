It has previously been shown to be useful in characterizing knowledge-based reasoners, especially in a quantified setting. While this allows us to reason about incomplete knowledge in the sense of not knowing whether a formula is true or not, there are many applications where one would like to reason about the degree of belief in a formula. In this work, we propose a new general first-order account of probability and only knowing that admits knowledge bases with incomplete and probabilistic specifications. Beliefs and non-beliefs are then shown to emerge as a direct logical consequence of the sentences of the knowledge base at a corresponding level of specificity.
