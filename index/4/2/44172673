This work takes a first step toward movie content analysis by tackling the novel task of movie overview generation. Overviews are natural language texts that give a first impression of a movie, describing aspects such as its genre, plot, mood, or artistic style. We create a dataset that consists of movie scripts, attribute-value pairs for the movies’ aspects, as well as overviews, which we extract from an online database. We present a novel end-to-end model for overview generation, consisting of a multi-label encoder for identifying screenplay attributes, and an LSTM decoder to generate natural language sentences conditioned on the identified attributes. Automatic and human evaluation show that the encoder is able to reliably assign good labels for the movie’s attributes, and the overviews provide descriptions of the movie’s content which are informative and faithful.
