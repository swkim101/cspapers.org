Pointing is a fundamental interaction technique where user movement is translated to spatial input on a display. Conventionally, this is based on a rigid configuration of a display coupled with a pointing device that determines the types of movement that can be sensed, and the specific ways users can affect pointer input. Spontaneous spatial coupling is a novel input technique that instead allows any body movement, or movement of tangible objects, to be appropriated for touchless pointing on an ad hoc basis. Pointer acquisition is facilitated by the display presenting graphical objects in motion, to which users can synchronise to define a temporary spatial coupling with the body part or tangible object they used in the process. The technique can be deployed using minimal hardware, as demonstrated by MatchPoint, a generic computer vision-based implementation of the technique that requires only a webcam. We explore the design space of spontaneous spatial coupling, demonstrate the versatility of the technique with application examples, and evaluate MatchPoint performance using a multi-directional pointing task.
