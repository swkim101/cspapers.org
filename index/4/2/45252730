A motion planning and self-referencing approach has been developed, simulated and applied to an actual robot. Although there are several novelties to these approaches, the fact that both are based on traversability vectors (t-vectors) is one aspect of this research that is unique. Through their application it has been found that t-vectors enhance the detection of path obstructions and geometric beacons and expedite the identification of features that are visible (or hearable) to sensors in both static and dynamic environments. T-vectors also reduce the data size and complexity of standard V-graphs and variations thereof. This paper provides the t-vector models step-by-step so that the reader will be able to apply them to mobile robot motion planning and self-referencing.<<ETX>>
