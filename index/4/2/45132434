The Deep Net refers to the thousands of topic-specific search engines on the Internet, including those that are inaccessible to traditional crawler-based search engines. Commercial metasearch engines have been slow to provide a simple, universal interface to these smaller topic-specific search engines. Turbo10 has developed a commercial metasearch engine that connects to these resources en masse (http://turbo10.com). Turbo10 automates the process of creating and maintaining software adapters that connect to, search, and extract results from a multitude of search engines. This poster outlines the functional mechanics of how Turbo10 searches the Deep Net.
