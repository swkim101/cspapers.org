For AR/VR systems, tapping-in-the-air is a user-friendly solution for interactions. Most prior in-air tapping schemes use customized depth-cameras and therefore have the limitations of low accuracy and high latency. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained depth-aware tapping scheme that can provide high accuracy tapping detection. Our basic idea is to use light-weight ultrasound based sensing, along with one COTS mono-camera, to enable 3D tracking of user's fingers. The mono-camera is used to track user's fingers in the 2D space and ultrasound based sensing is used to get the depth information of user's fingers in the 3D space. Using speakers and microphones that already exist on most AR/VR devices, we emit ultrasound, which is inaudible to humans, and capture the signal reflected by the finger with the microphone. From the phase changes of the ultrasound signal, we accurately measure small finger movements in the depth direction. With fast and light-weight ultrasound signal processing algorithms, our scheme can accurately track finger movements and measure the bending angle of the finger between two video frames. In our experiments on eight users, our scheme achieves a 98.4% finger tapping detection accuracy with FPR of 1.6% and FNR of 1.4%, and a detection latency of 17.69ms, which is 57.7ms less than video-only schemes. The power consumption overhead of our scheme is 48.4% more than video-only schemes.
