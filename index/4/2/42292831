It is well-known that inductive learning algorithms are sensitive to the way in which examples of a concept are represented. Constructive induction reduces this sensitivity by enabling the inductive algorithm to create new terms with which to describe examples. However, new terms are usually created as functions of existing terms, so an extremely poor initial representation makes the search for new terms intractable. 
 
This work considers inductive learning within a problem-solving environment. It shows that information about the problem-solving task can be used to create terms that are suitable for learning search control knowledge. The resulting terms describe the problem-solver's progress in achieving its goals. Experimental evidence from two domains is presented in support of the approach.
