The main objective of work package WP3 of the FP7 project EUWB is to allow for innovations, evaluation of multiple antenna specific algorithms and verification of enhanced implementation solutions developed within the EUWB project. This work package has the objective to identify and provide system concepts, requirements and measurement set-ups for certain application environments, in particular for MIMO-UWB in home entertainment, in automotive environment and in public transport. Further a MIMO-UWB test-bed for evaluation and verification of specific multiple antenna algorithms and system designs will be provided. The evaluation of this initial test-bed allows the study of multi-user and interfering scenarios by providing access to the real MIMO channel. Also application aware algorithms will be developed to enable link quality improvement, range extension, and multi-user enhancements, so as to exploit the benefits offered by the multiple antenna technology.
