One of the challenging fields of computer science is the computer graphics field which, because of its relatively high cost, has not been used extensively for educational purposes. Recent hardware developments in the graphics technology and price breakthroughs in digital equipment are beginning to influence the educational uses of computer graphics. If “a picture is worth a thousand words” and if the cost is not at this ratio, one can provide the student, not necessarily of computer sciences, with the possibility of a continuous interaction in which the student can see the results of his decision and thus allows him to experiment and practice with ideas not completely understood yet.
 This paper presents a design for an interactive educational system incorporating the recent development of the video-disc.
