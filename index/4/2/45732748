This paper describes the design and implementation of two alternative techniques for jamming cell-phone communication, noise attack and spectrum distortion technique. Foreign leading electronic companies have already introduced the first technique of jamming through noise attack or denial of service, in market. Our aim is to come up with a new technique which is more robust and cost effective. In this research paper, we have compared the performance of old jamming technique with the new technique in various aspects like cost, power consumption, design complexity, robustness, coverage area, components availability and performance.
