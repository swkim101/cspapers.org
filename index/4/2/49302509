Reliability is a major concern in chip multi-processors (CMPs) due to shrinking technology and low operating voltages. Today’s processors designed at sub-10nm technology nodes have high device densities and fast switching frequencies that cause fluctuations in supply voltage (Vdd) and ground networks, which can adversely affect the execution of applications running on them. In this paper, we propose a novel runtime framework to reduce the power supply noise (PSN) in cores and routers at runtime. Experimental results for 7nm FinFET process nodes show that our framework not only achieves up to 4.5× reduction in PSN, and up to 34.3% improvement in application performance, but also manages to map up to 38% more applications when the CMP is oversubscribed, compared to the state-of-the-art.
