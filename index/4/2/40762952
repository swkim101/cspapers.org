The discussion of whether ethical and social issues of computing should be explored in undergraduate computer science education has resulted in most academic institutions and educators agreeing that they are important topics that must be included. Further support has been provided by Curricula '91 [16], the CSAC/CSAB accreditation [2] and ImpactCS [12]. Many books [7, 8, 9, 10] and papers [6, 14] have discussed what topics should be covered and what techniques can be used either in a dedicated course or in modules across the curriculum. However, explicit detailed examples that have worked successfully, particularly in lower level computer science courses, are still rare. This paper will discuss several examples that have been successfully used in CS1 and CS2 at a medium-sized university.
