We present a method for calculating odome- try in three-dimensions for car-like ground ve- hicles with an Ackerman-like steering model. In our approach we use the information from a single camera to derive the odometry in the plane and fuse it with roll and pitch informa- tion derived from an on-board IMU to extend to three-dimensions, thus providing odometric altitude as well as traditional x and y transla- tion. We have mounted the odometry module on a standard Toyota Prado SUV and present results from a car-park environment as well as from an off-road track.
