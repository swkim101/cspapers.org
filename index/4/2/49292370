We present tight bounds on the social welfare ratio of the combinatorial clock auction under the basic price increment rule used in practice. Specifically, under the assumption of truthful bidding, we prove that the welfare ratio is Θ(m^\frac23)$ in the case of unit-demand bidders, and Θ(m)$ for general bidders. We explain how changes to the price increment rule effect the welfare guarantee, and extend our results to settings with strategic bidding.
