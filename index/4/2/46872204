We introduce a new microarchitectural timing covert channel using the processor memory order buffer (MOB). Specifically, we show how an adversary can infer the state of a spy process on the Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures when predicting dependent loads through the store buffer, called 4K-aliasing. The 4K-aliasing event is a side-effect of memory disambiguation misprediction while handling write-after-read data hazards wherein the lower 12-bits of a load address will falsely match with store addresses resident in the MOB. In this work, we extensively analyze 4K-aliasing and demonstrate a new timing channel measureable across processes when executed as hyperthreads. We then use 4K-aliasing to build a robust covert communication channel on both the Amazon EC2 and Google Compute Engine capable of communicating at speeds of 1.28 Mbps and 1.49 Mbps, respectively. In addition, we show that 4K-aliasing can also be used to reliably detect multi-tenancy.
