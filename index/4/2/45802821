This paper present algorithms for relational algebra and set operations based on hashing. Execution times are computed and performance is compared to standard methods based on nested loop and sort-merge. The algorithms are intended for use on a monoprocessor computer with standard disks for data base storage. It is indicated however that hashing methods are well suited to multi processor or especially multi machine database machines. The relational algebra operatrons described in this paper are under implementation In TECHRA (TECHBC), a database system especially designed to meet the needs of technical applications, like CAD systems, utility maps, oil field exploration, etc.
