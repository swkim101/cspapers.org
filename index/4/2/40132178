What Does A Body Know? is a concert work for Digital Ventriloquized Actor (DiVA) and sound clips. A DiVA is a real time gesture-controlled formant-based speech synthesizer using a Cyberglove®, touchglove, and Polhemus Tracker® as the main interfaces. When used in conjunction with the performer's own voice solos and "duets" can be performed in real time.
