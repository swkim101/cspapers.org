This paper proposes a potential switching scheme that enlarges the stable region of feature-based visual servoing. Relay images that interpolate initial and reference image features are generated by using affine transformation. Artificial potentials defined by the relay images are patched around the reference point of the original potential to enlarge the stable region. Simulations with simplified configuration and experiments on a 6 DOF robot show the validity of the proposed control scheme.
