In Android 6.0, Google revamped its long criticized permission model to prompt the user during runtime, and allow her to dynamically revoke granted permissions. Towards steering developers to this new model and improve user experience, Google also provides guidelines on (a) how permission requests should be formulated (b) how to educate users on why a permission is needed and (c) how to provide feedback when a permission is denied. In this paper we perform, to the best of our knowledge, the first measurement study on the adoption of Android's new model on recently updated apps from the official Google Play Store. We find that, unfortunately, (1) most apps have not been migrated to this new model and (2) for those that do support the model, many do not adhere to Google's guidelines. We attribute this unsatisfying status quo to the lack of automated transformation tools that can help developers refactor their code; via an IRB approved study we find that developers felt that there was a non-trivial effort involved in migrating their apps to the new model. Towards solving this problem, we develop Droid M+, a system that helps developers to easily retrofit their legacy code to support the new permission model and adhere to Google's guidelines. We believe that Droid M+ offers a significant step in preserving user privacy and improving user experience.
