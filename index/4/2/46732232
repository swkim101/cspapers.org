The next generation of civil aircraft may be produced using Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA). A component of IMA is APEX, a standard operating system interface. This supports a two-level scheduling scheme consisting of fixed priority scheduling within a statically generated cyclic schedule. This paper illustrates how APEX applications can be analysed for their response times and shows that there is potential for a large amount of release jitter.
