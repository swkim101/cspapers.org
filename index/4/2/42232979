Online advertising is a rapidly growing, multi-billion dollar industry. It has become a significant element of the Web browsing experience. Online advertising providers use sophisticated ad targeting and ranking algorithms with the dual aim of maximizing revenue while providing a superior user experience. As a result, advertising optimization is a very complex research problem, since it combines relevance with user interaction models, advertiser valuations, and commercial constraints. Online advertising integrates a number of core research areas: machine learning, data mining, search, auction theory, and user modeling.
 This workshop is intended to serve as an open forum for discussion of new ideas and current research in the field of online advertising. We expect that the workshop will promote a community of researchers interested in this area and yield future collaboration and exchanges. The research included should address problems faced by advertisers, end-users, advertising platforms, and the market.
