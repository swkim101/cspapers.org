This paper studies the compensation of internal joint stick-slip friction effects for desired trajectory tracking of robotic manipulators. A PD type iterative learning control, which incorporates a stabilizing feedback control for robot dynamics, is applied to compensate for the friction. Simulations of a two-link robotic manipulator show that our friction compensation scheme is effective for different friction models whose characteristics are not exactly known a priori.<<ETX>>
