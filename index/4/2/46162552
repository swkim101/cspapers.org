We present a novel proof system R for First-order (Linear) Temporal Logic. This system extends our Propositional Temporal Logic proof system ([AM]). The system R is based on nonclausal resolution; proofs are natural and generally short. Special quantifier rules, unification techniques, and a resolution rule are introduced. We relate R to other proof systems for First-order Temporal Logic and discuss completeness issues. The system R should be useful as a tool for such tasks as verification of concurrent programs and reasoning about hardware devices.
