The paper proposes a visual servoing scheme based on object motion estimation. A long term prediction algorithm with multiple motion models is developed. The object position and velocity of a few hundreds of samples ahead is predicted. Thus object tracking without visual information can be achieved during this period. As an example, pick up task of moving object is conducted. The task requires object motion prediction because the hand mounted camera loses the object when the hand approaches the object. Simulations show convergence of prediction. Real-time experiments of picking up a moving object demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed long term predictor.
