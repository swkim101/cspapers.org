A modular multichannel receiver is presented in this work to offer a flexible solution for the scalable active antenna array. Both the antenna array architecture and relevant hardware are introduced. The proposed receiver adopts direct digital synthesis (DDS) based phase shifting to achieve a phase resolution in sub-degree level. The hardware design of the RF front-end, multichannel phased signal generator, and microwave interconnection structures implemented with substrate integrated coaxial line (SICL) are detailed. The fabricated receiver prototype and corresponding laboratory measurement give an insight into the implementation of the real system. The measurement results, including the wideband RF image rejection, DDS output spectrum, and transmission performance of interconnection structures, are well demonstrated.
