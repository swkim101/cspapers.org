A novel technique is proposed to greatly enhance the convergence property of stationary iterative solvers applied for the solution of scattering from two-dimensional random rough surfaces. The proposed method extends the standard improvement step to enable the use of multiple correction vectors, leading to a significantly improved convergence rate of stationary iterative methods with negligible increases in computational complexity. Spectral acceleration technique is also applied to reduce a computational burden and storage requirements. Numerical results are shown to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed technique.
