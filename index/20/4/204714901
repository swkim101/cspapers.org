Domain-Specific Modeling raises the level of abstraction beyond programming by specifying the solution directly using visual models to express domain concepts. In many cases, final products can be generated automatically from these high-level specifications. This automation is possible because both the language and generators fit the requirements of only one domain. This paper introduces Domain-Specific Modeling and describes the related workshop that took place 20th October 2019.
