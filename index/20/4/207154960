A high level model of the concept of operations of NASA's Small Aircraft Transportation System for Higher Volume Operations (SATS-HVO) is presented. The model is a non-deterministic, asynchronous transition system. It provides a robust notion of safety that relies on the logic of the concept rather than on physical constraints such as aircraft performances. Several safety properties were established on this model. The modeling and verification effort resulted in the identification of 9 issues, including one major flaw, in the original concept. Ten recommendations were made to the SATS-HVO concept development working group. All the recommendations were accepted and incorporated into the current concept of operations. The model was written in PVS. The verification is performed using an explicit state exploration algorithm written and proven correct in PVS.
