This paper presents a novel design of a compact and light-weight robotic hand for a social humanoid robot. The proposed system is able to perform common hand gestures and self-adaptable grasps by mixing under-actuated and self-adaptable hand kinematics in a unique design. The hand answers the need for precise finger postures and sensor-less force feedback during gestures and for finger adaptation and autonomous force distribution during grasps. These are provided by a dual actuation system embodied within the palm and the fingers. Coexistence is ensured by compliant transmissions based on elastomer bars rather than classical tension springs, thanks to their high elastic coefficient at reduced sizes and strains. The proposed solution significantly reduces the weight and the size of the hand by using a reduced number of small actuators for gesturing and a single motor for grasping. The hand prototype (ALPHA) is realized to confirm the design feasibility and functional capabilities. It is controlled to provide safe human-robot interaction and preserve mechanical integrity in order to be embodied on a humanoid robot.
