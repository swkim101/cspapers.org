This paper identifies procedures for selecting the appropriate admittance to achieve reliable planar force-guided assembly for single-point frictional contact cases. A set of conditions that are imposed on the admittance matrix is presented. These conditions ensure that the motion that results from contact reduces part misalignment. We show that, for bounded misalignments, if an admittance satisfies the misalignment-reduction conditions at a finite number of contact configurations and a given coefficient of friction /spl mu//sub M/) then the admittance will also ensure that the conditions are satisfied at all intermediate configurations for all coefficients less than /spl mu//sub M/.
