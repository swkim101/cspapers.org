We present a new quasi-affine reconstruction of a scene and its application to camera self-calibration. We refer to this reconstruction as QUARCH (QUasi-Affine Reconstruction with respect to Camera centers and the Hodographs of horopters). A QUARCH can be obtained by solving a semidefinite programming problem when, (i) the images have been captured by a moving camera with constant intrinsic parameters, and (ii) a vague knowledge of the relative orientation (under or over 120 degrees) between camera pairs is available. The resulting reconstruction comes close enough to an affine one allowing thus an easy upgrade of the QUARCH to its affine and metric counterparts. We also present a constrained Levenberg-Marquardt method for nonlinear optimization subject to Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints so as to ensure that the QUARCH LMIs are satisfied during optimization. Experiments with synthetic and real data show the benefits of QUARCH in reliably obtaining a metric reconstruction.
