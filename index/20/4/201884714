In a social and economic context characterized by a constantly aging population, the research for new technologies able to assist elderly people is getting more and more attention. In this extended abstract we illustrate the main components of the European project MoveCare, a multi-actor framework designed to assist pre-frail elders living alone. The proposed system is centered around an assistive mobile robot that provides the user with a set of functionalities to support cognitive and social stimulation, assistance, and transparent monitoring.
