In this paper, we introduce a generic inference hybrid framework for Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (conv-RNN) of semantic modeling of text, seamless integrating the merits on extracting different aspects of linguistic information from both convolutional and recurrent neural network structures and thus strengthening the semantic understanding power of the new framework. Besides, based on conv-RNN, we also propose a novel sentence classification model and an attention based answer selection model with strengthening power for the sentence matching and classification respectively. We validate the proposed models on a very wide variety of data sets, including two challenging tasks of answer selection (AS) and five benchmark datasets for sentence classification (SC). To the best of our knowledge, it is by far the most complete comparison results in both AS and SC. We empirically show superior performances of conv-RNN in these different challenging tasks and benchmark datasets and also summarize insights on the performances of other state-of-the-arts methodologies.
