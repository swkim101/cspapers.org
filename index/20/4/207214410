Shapelets are discriminative sub-sequences of time series that best predict the target variable. For this reason, shapelet discovery has recently attracted considerable interest within the time-series research community. Currently shapelets are found by evaluating the prediction qualities of numerous candidates extracted from the series segments. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, this paper proposes a novel perspective in terms of learning shapelets. A new mathematical formalization of the task via a classification objective function is proposed and a tailored stochastic gradient learning algorithm is applied. The proposed method enables learning near-to-optimal shapelets directly without the need to try out lots of candidates. Furthermore, our method can learn true top-K shapelets by capturing their interaction. Extensive experimentation demonstrates statistically significant improvement in terms of wins and ranks against 13 baselines over 28 time-series datasets.
