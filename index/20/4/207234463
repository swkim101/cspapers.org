I argue for a vital relationship between current understanding of Big Data and how we might move toward new modes of mobile application design that draw on affective and generative "data sets". Toward this end, I look at projects that use the city as a living laboratory, including mobile apps, social media mapping, and various civic uses of Internet of Things (IoT) and surveillance technology. I chose these case studies for their appropriation of psychogeographic "small data" to map a city as they engage affective and immersive aspects of interaction and spatial design.
