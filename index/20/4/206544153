Biological snakes' diverse locomotion modes and physiology make them supremely adapted for environment. To realize these snakes' noticeable features, we have developed a snake-like robot that has no any forward direction driving force. To enlarge the environment-adaptable ability of our robot, in this study we discuss the creeping locomotion of our snake-like robot on a slope. A computer simulator is presented for analysis of the creeping locomotion of our snake-like robot on a slope, and the environment-adaptable body shape for the creeping locomotion of the snake-like robot on slope is also derived through this simulator.
