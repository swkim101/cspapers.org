The self-adaptation of software system is a complex process that depends on several factors that may change during the system operational lifetime. Hence, the process for coordinating the self-adaptation should also be adaptable to changes that may occur during run-time. As the means for coordinating the self-adaptation process of software systems, we are applying workflows that are dynamically generated for dealing with the variability associated with the self-adaptation process. In this context, this research aims to define and develop techniques for automatically generate workflows for coordinating the self-adaptation of software systems. For demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach, architectural reconfiguration of software systems is used as an example, whereby the reconfiguration is managed by workflows that are dynamically generated depending on the availability of resources.
