Over the last 25 years the Web has evolved into a critical global infrastructure. Since its emergence in the 1990s, it has exploded into hundreds of billions of pages that touch almost all aspects of modern life. Little appreciated, however, is the fact that the Web is more than the sum of its pages and it is more than its technical protocols. Vast emergent properties have arisen that are transforming society. Web Science is the study of the Web as a socio-technical system. As the Web becomes increasingly significant in all our lives, studying it from an interdisciplinary perspective becomes even more important. We are now rapidly moving into a world of data on and about the Web, which gives rise to even more opportunities and challenges. In this talk we will explore the role of observatories and data analytics for the development of new methodologies for longitudinal research in Web Science that could help us understand more about how the Web evolves as a social-technical network. After many years of speculation about the potential of on-line learning, web technology has finally developed to a point where on-line learning is today a reality -- from MOOCS to complete on-line degree courses. All rely on the use of social media to enhance the learning environment for the students. We will discuss the application of the web observatory approach to the study of on-line learning and the insights such an approach can reveal that would not be possible in a traditional learning environment -- potentially giving rise to world-wide studies in this area.
