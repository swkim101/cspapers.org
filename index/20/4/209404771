Job-shop scheduling is an important task for manufacturing industries. We are interested in the particular task of scheduling payload processing for NASA's space shuttle program. This paper summarizes our previous work on formulating this task for solution by the reinforcement learning algorithm TD(λ). A shortcoming of this previous work was its reliance on hand-engineered input features. This paper shows how to extend the time-delay neural network (TDNN) architecture to apply it to irregular-length schedules. Experimental tests show that this TDNN-TD(λ) network can match the performance of our previous hand-engineered system. The tests also show that both neural network approaches significantly outperform the best previous (non-learning) solution to this problem in terms of the quality of the resulting schedules and the number of search steps required to construct them.
