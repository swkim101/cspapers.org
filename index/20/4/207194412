We introduce the Million Song Dataset Challenge: a large-scale, personalized music recommendation challenge, where the goal is to predict the songs that a user will listen to, given both the user's listening history and full information (including meta-data and content analysis) for all songs. We explain the taste profile data, our goals and design choices in creating the challenge, and present baseline results using simple, off-the-shelf recommendation algorithms.
