We propose a method for a concept-centric semantic analysis of an evolving corpus, highlighting the persistent concepts, emergence of new concepts, and the changes in the semantic associations between concepts. We report our findings on a corpus of computer science literature that spans six decades, revealing interesting patterns about the progress of the discipline.
