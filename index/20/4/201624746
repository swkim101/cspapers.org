This paper proposes a human-aware deblurring model that disentangles the motion blur between foreground (FG) humans and background (BG). The proposed model is based on a triple-branch encoder-decoder architecture. The first two branches are learned for sharpening FG humans and BG details, respectively; while the third one produces global, harmonious results by comprehensively fusing multi-scale deblurring information from the two domains. The proposed model is further endowed with a supervised, human-aware attention mechanism in an end-to-end fashion. It learns a soft mask that encodes FG human information and explicitly drives the FG/BG decoder-branches to focus on their specific domains. Above designs lead to a fully differentiable motion deblurring network, which can be trained end-to-end. To further benefit the research towards Human-aware Image Deblurring, we introduce a large-scale dataset, named HIDE, which consists of 8,422 blurry and sharp image pairs with 65,784 densely annotated FG human bounding boxes. HIDE is specifically built to span a broad range of scenes, human object sizes, motion patterns, and background complexities. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and our dataset demonstrate that our model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art motion deblurring methods, especially in capturing semantic details.
