Both cameras and IoT devices have their particular capabilities in tracking moving objects. Their correlations are, however, unclear. In this work, we consider using a drone to track ground objects. We demonstrate how to retrieve IoT data from devices, which are attached on human objects, and correctly tag them on the human objects captured by a drone view. This is the first work correlating IoT data and computer vision from a drone camera. Potential applications of this work include aerial surveillance, people tracking, and intelligent human-drone interaction.
