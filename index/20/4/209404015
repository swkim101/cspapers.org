An apparatus for guiding a span of high-speed magnetic recording tape past a recording/transducing head. Low volume pressurized air is utilized to lift the tape off of the guide assembly thereby eliminating sliding friction between the apparatus and the tape. The periphery of the guide is provided with a means to facilitate the formation of an air seal with the edges of the tape thereby substantially isolating the pressurized air from the atmosphere. Air jets are provided at the tangent points where the tape enters and departs from the air guide so as to prevent the tape from touching any portion of the guide during the transport operation. The pressurized air emitted from the air jets located at the tangent point where the tape enters the guide forms a supporting boundary layer of air along the surface of the tape which is carried along by the tape across the guide.
