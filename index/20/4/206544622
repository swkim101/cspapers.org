The human body motion synthesis is highly necessary for humanoid robots' motion planning and computer animations. In this paper, new method for generating human-like natural motions based on the motion database acquired by motion capture systems is described. On the analysis step, the acquired motions are divided into some motion segments, and then the characteristic poses and motions are archived as 'motion styles'. The motion style is a kind of the human skill, and it's unique to the motions' scenario, such as the different kinds of dances. On the synthesis step, users direct the key poses of human figures. The system generates the characteristic motions according to the user's directions and motion style database. The experiment result shows that this method can synthesize the realistic 'stylized' motions with this framework.
