Edge-preserving image operations aim at smoothing an image without blurring the edges. Many excellent edge-preserving filtering techniques have been proposed recently to reduce the computational complexity or/and separate different scale structures. They normally adopt a user-selected scale measurement to control the detail/texture smoothing. However, natural photos contain objects of different sizes which cannot be described by a single scale measurement. On the other hand, edge/contour detection/ analysis is closely related to edge-preserving filtering and has achieved significant progress recently. Nevertheless, most of the state-of-the-art filtering techniques ignore the success in this area. Inspired by the fact that learning-based edge detectors/classifiers significantly outperform traditional manually-designed detectors, this paper proposes a learning-based edge-preserving filtering technique. It synergistically combines the efficiency of the recursive filter and the effectiveness of the recent edge detector for scale-aware edge-preserving filtering. Unlike previous filtering methods, the propose filter can efficiently extract subjectively-meaningful structures from natural scenes containing multiple-scale objects.
