This paper proposes a switching control strategy for nonlinear dynamic systems. No special assumptions are made about the type of nonlinearities of the system, except that such nonlinearities are smooth. Stability proof of the switching control, and an example for using the switching control are given in this paper. The switching control framework has been applied extensively for feedback stabilization of the Pendubot - a two link under-actuated mechanical system [Mingjun Zhang et al., March 2002].
