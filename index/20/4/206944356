Flower stick juggling is a dexterous task done by skillful jugglers. We aim to realize dexterous tasks done by humans using robotic systems. This work focuses on flower stick juggling and proposes a feedback control strategy for a flower stick juggling task called “propeller” as one of the robotic dexterous manipulations. The propeller motion is modeled by considering combined flower stick and a robotic manipulator. We developed a control strategy that allows stable cyclic rotation of the flower stick in the air. The control parametars in the control strategy are searched through numerical simulation. Finally, the flower stick propeller motion is realized using an actual robotic system.
