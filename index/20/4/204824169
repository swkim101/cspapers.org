Person re-identification is a challenging task due to various complex factors. Recent studies have attempted to integrate human parsing results or externally defined attributes to help capture human parts or important object regions. On the other hand, there still exist many useful contextual cues that do not fall into the scope of predefined human parts or attributes. In this paper, we address the missed contextual cues by exploiting both the accurate human parts and the coarse non-human parts. In our implementation, we apply a human parsing model to extract the binary human part masks and a self-attention mechanism to capture the soft latent (non-human) part masks. We verify the effectiveness of our approach with new state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03.
