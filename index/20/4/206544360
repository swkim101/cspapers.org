This paper describes an air pressure sensor based auto-teach/re-teach methodology for industrial multi-link robots. This kind of auto-teach/re-teach function can be easily applied to bio-product manufacturing automation to reduce human-robot interactions. Section 1 introduces the background and objective of auto-teach/re-teach in industrial robotics applications. Section 2 describes the hardware and software of this approach. Section 3 describes the algorithms used in this application. Section 4 shows the user interface and testing result. Section 5 summarizes this approach and indicates the areas for further improvements.
