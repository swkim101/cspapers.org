One of the main contributions that Marshall McLuhan made to the fields of culture, technology and communication was the idea of ‘the extensions of man,’ the subtitle of his masterpiece “Understanding Media” (1964). Here the idea of ‘human extension’ is explored for application in 
human-social sciences, along with the notion of ‘the extended case method’ promoted by current President of the International Sociological Association, Michael Burawoy with its origins in the Manchester School of Social Anthropology. ‘Human extension’ is offered as an alternative approach to the ‘evolution’ of artefacts and 
is connected to the communications works of Marshall and his son Eric, reaching to the recent idea of a general ‘human equation.’
