This tutorial aims to provide a unifying account of current research on diversity and novelty in different web information systems. In particular, the tutorial will cover the motivations, as well as the most established approaches for producing and evaluating diverse results in search engines, recommender systems, and data streams, all within the context of the World Wide Web. By contrasting the state-of-the-art in these multiple domains, this tutorial aims to derive a common understanding of the diversification problem and the existing solutions, their commonalities and differences, as a means to foster new research directions.
