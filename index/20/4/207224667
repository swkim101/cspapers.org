My proposed research addresses fundamental deficiencies in social media-based event detection by discovering high-impact moments and evaluating their credibility rapidly. Results from my preliminary work demonstrate one can discover compelling moments by leveraging machine learning to characterize and detect bursts in keyword usage. Though this early work focused primarily on language-agnostic discovery in sporting events, it also showed promising results in adapting this work to earthquake detection. My dissertation will extend this research by adapting models to other types of high-impact events, exploring events with different temporal granularities, and finding methods to connect contextually related events into timelines. To ensure applicability of this research, I will also port these event discovery algorithms to stream processing platforms and evaluate their performance in the real-time context. To address issues of trust, my dissertation will also include developing algorithms that integrate the vast array of social media features to evaluate information credibility in near real time. Such features include structural signatures of information dissemination, the location from which a social media message was posted relative to the location of the event it describes, and metadata from related multimedia (e.g., pictures and video) shared about the event. My preliminary work also suggests methods that could be applied to social networks for stimulating trustworthy behavior and enhancing information quality. Contributions from my dissertation will primarily be practical algorithms for discovering events from various social media streams and algorithms for evaluating and enhancing the credibility of these events in near real time.
