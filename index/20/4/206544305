This paper describes the most significant design issues related with the development of an embedded FPGA-based control system for a human-like robotic hand. Specific features of the mechanical design of the system are discussed firstly, then a general approach to the problem of controlling the motion of the robotic device is provided. Finally a candidate distributed control architecture is presented.
