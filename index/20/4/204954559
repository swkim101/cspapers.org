In a highly reliable networked control system, active replication of critical system components is necessary for instantaneous recovery from crash or a network partition failure. However, due to Byzantine errors, the replicas can diverge and produce incorrect outputs. In this work, we target the specific problem of replica coordination in presence of environmentally-induced Byzantine errors, while addressing challenges and constraints specific to the CPS domain.
