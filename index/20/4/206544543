A Hyper-Flexible Manipulator (HFM, for short) is a kind of continuum robots with a simple mechanical structure like a cable, rope and string, which are useful tools utilized everywhere in various forms. In this paper, in order to achieve dexterous and useful manipulation by this type of robot, we discuss kinematics and dynamics of an HFM. We rigorously derive a spatial, nonlinear and continuum dynamics model with an underactuated mechanism using special kinematics based on curve geometry and theory of robot manipulation.
