During times of disasters online users generate a significant amount of data, some of which are extremely valuable for relief efforts. In this paper, we study the nature of social-media content generated during two different natural disasters. We also train a model based on conditional random fields to extract valuable information from such content. We evaluate our techniques over our two datasets through a set of carefully designed experiments. We also test our methods over a non-disaster dataset to show that our extraction model is useful for extracting information from socially-generated content in general.
