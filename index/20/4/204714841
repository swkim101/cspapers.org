Although communication networks have been constantly evolving and increasing their capacity with state-of-the-art solutions, it is still hard to provide reliable and high capacity communications in some cases referred to as challenged networks. In these networks, ensuring performance guarantees is hard either due to the lack of infrastructure or its limitations, such as in public safety networks, or due to the challenging communication medium, such as in mmWave networks. Challenged networks face now new constraints with the proliferation of services and applications, increasing number of connected devices, the high computing and control demands, unpredicted human behavior, and only partially-available information. CHANTS'19 aims at bringing researchers together to have a platform for discussing the challenges emerging with new use cases and real-life applications, such as edge computing or autonomous driving, and corresponding innovative approaches in tackling the limitations of the challenged networks. Moreover, this workshop aims at providing another perspective to the broader audience by listing a subset of problems that communication networks, despite the advances on many fronts, still have to tackle. The expected outcomes of CHANTS'19 have the potential to influence industrial thinking about the technologies of next-generation challenged networks.
