This paper proposes a smartphone-based cyber-physical system, called All-You-Can-Bike, for bikers to ride a bicycle around the world through street view and virtual reality based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. On the bicycle side, a microcontroller, a rotation sensor, and a Bluetooth module are used to calculate the cycling speed of the biker, sense the rotation period of wheels, and communicate with the biker's smartphone, respectively. On the biker side, a smartphone is used to detect the riding direction (through the built-in gyroscope), receive the cycling speed data (through Bluetooth communications), and determine the feasible frame updating rate of street view/virtual reality (through the proposed fuzzy control mechanism). Based on the current and historical cycling speeds, All-You-Can-Bike can derive the feasible frame updating rate based on the defined fuzzy sets of wheel rotation periods and cycling acceleration. An Android-based prototype with the Arduino developing board is implemented to verify the feasibility and superiority of our All-You-Can-Bike system.
