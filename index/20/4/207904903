In this paper, we introduce the problem of K-best transformation synchronization for the purpose of multiple scan matching. Given noisy pair-wise transformations computed between a subset of depth scan pairs, K-best transformation synchronization seeks to output multiple consistent relative transformations. This problem naturally arises in many geometry reconstruction applications, where the underlying object possesses self-symmetry. For approximately symmetric or even non-symmetric objects, K-best solutions offer an intermediate presentation for recovering the underlying single-best solution. We introduce a simple yet robust iterative algorithm for K-best transformation synchronization, which alternates between transformation propagation and transformation clustering. We present theoretical guarantees on the robust and exact recoveries of our algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of our approach against state-of-the-art transformation synchronization techniques on both synthetic and real datasets.
