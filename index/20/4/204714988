While the application of the NFV paradigm into the network is proceeding full steam ahead, there is still one last mile- stone to be achieved in this context: the virtualization of the radio access network (vRAN). Due to the very complex de- pendency between the radio conditions and the computing resources needed to provide the baseband processing func- tionality, attaining an efficient resource control is particularly challenging. In this demonstration, we will showcase vrAIn, a vRAN dynamic resource controller that employs deep re- inforcement learning to perform resource assignment deci- sions. vrAIn, which is implemented using an open-source LTE stack over a Linux platform, can achieve substantial sav- ings in the used CPU resources while maintaining the target QoS for the attached terminals and maximize throughput when there is a deficit of computational capacity.
