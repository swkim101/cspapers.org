Automatic detection and classification of dynamic hand gestures in real-world systems intended for human computer interaction is challenging as: 1) there is a large diversity in how people perform gestures, making detection and classification difficult, 2) the system must work online in order to avoid noticeable lag between performing a gesture and its classification, in fact, a negative lag (classification before the gesture is finished) is desirable, as feedback to the user can then be truly instantaneous. In this paper, we address these challenges with a recurrent three-dimensional convolutional neural network that performs simultaneous detection and classification of dynamic hand gestures from multi-modal data. We employ connectionist temporal classification to train the network to predict class labels from inprogress gestures in unsegmented input streams. In order to validate our method, we introduce a new challenging multimodal dynamic hand gesture dataset captured with depth, color and stereo-IR sensors. On this challenging dataset, our gesture recognition system achieves an accuracy of 83:8%, outperforms competing state-of-the-art algorithms, and approaches human accuracy of 88:4%. Moreover, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SKIG and ChaLearn2014 benchmarks.
