Even though parallel manipulators are uncontrollable at force singular positions, our analysis reveals that motion through force singularities may be possible using a path tracking type of approach. This article establishes the condition for trackability of paths in the presence of force singularities, and presents the tools required to verify path trackability. Simulation results of a 2 DOF planar parallel manipulator are shown.
