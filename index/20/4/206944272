Despite their ubiquitous presence, texture-less objects present significant challenges to contemporary visual object detection and localization algorithms. This paper proposes a practical method for the detection and accurate 3D localization of multiple texture-less and rigid objects depicted in RGB-D images. The detection procedure adopts the sliding window paradigm, with an efficient cascade-style evaluation of each window location. A simple pre-filtering is performed first, rapidly rejecting most locations. For each remaining location, a set of candidate templates (i.e. trained object views) is identified with a voting procedure based on hashing, which makes the method's computational complexity largely unaffected by the total number of known objects. The candidate templates are then verified by matching feature points in different modalities. Finally, the approximate object pose associated with each detected template is used as a starting point for a stochastic optimization procedure that estimates accurate 3D pose. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method yields a recognition rate comparable to the state of the art, while its complexity is sub-linear in the number of templates.
