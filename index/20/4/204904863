We consider the problem of training machine learning models in a risk-averse manner. In particular, we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm for stochastically optimizing the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of a loss distribution. We use a distributionally robust formulation of the CVaR to phrase the problem as a zero-sum game between two players. Our approach solves the game using an efficient no-regret algorithm for each player. Critically, we can apply these algorithms to large-scale settings because the implementation relies on sampling from Determinantal Point Processes. Finally, we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on large-scale convex and non-convex learning tasks.
