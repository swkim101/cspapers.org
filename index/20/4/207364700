The focus of this panel is on issues surrounding the use of C++ in modeling, integration of silicon IP and system-on-chip designs. In the last two years there have been several announcements promoting C++ based solutions and of multiple consortia (SystemC, Cynapps, Accellera, SpecC) that represent increasing commercial interest both from tool vendors as well as perhaps expression of genuine needs from the design houses. There are, however, serious questions about what value proposition does a C++ based design methodology bring to the IC or system designer? What has changed in the modeling technology (and/or available tools) that gives a new capability? Is synthesis the right target? or VAlidation? Tester modeling or testbench generation? This panel brings together advocates and opponents from the user community to highlight the achievements and the challenges that remain in use C++ for use in microelectronic circuits and systems.
