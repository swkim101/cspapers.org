Object shape information is essential for robot manipulation tasks, in particular for grasp planning and collision-free motion planning. But in general a complete object model is not available, in particular when dealing with unknown objects. We propose a method for completing shapes that are only partially known, which is a common situation when a robot perceives a new object only from one direction. Our approach is based on the assumption that most objects used in service robotic setups have symmetries. We determine and rate symmetry plane candidates to estimate the hidden parts of the object. By finding possible supporting planes based on its immediate neighborhood, the search space for symmetry planes is restricted, and the bottom part of the object is added. Gaps along the sides in the direction of the view axis are closed by linear interpolation. We evaluate our approach with real-world experiments using the YCB object and model set [1].
