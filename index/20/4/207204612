With the rapid growth of the demands for mobile data, wireless network faces several challenges, such as lack of efficient interconnection among heterogeneous wireless networks, and shortage of customized QoS guarantees between services. The fundamental reason for these challenges is that the radio access network (RAN) is closed and ossified. We propose OpenRAN, an architecture for software-defined RAN via virtualization. It achieves complete virtualization and programmability vertically, and benefits the convergence of heterogeneous network horizontally. It provides open, controllable, flexible and evolvable wireless networks.
