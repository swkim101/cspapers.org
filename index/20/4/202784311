In this work, we apply the CycleGAN image-to- 
image translation framework to Mel-scaled log- 
amplitude spectrograms, successfully realizing 
audio texture transfer between excerpts from two 
musically related genres. Such automatic musical 
transfer could provide music producers and DJs 
with new creative tools, e.g. to quickly prototype 
a remix of an existing song in another genre, or 
to use as an advanced effect during a live perfor- 
mance. We show that meaningful style transfer 
can be realized using only a limited amount of 
data and computational resources. A high-quality 
audio reconstruction is obtained from the gener- 
ated amplitude spectrogram by simply using the 
phase of the original audio as an approximation 
for the phase of the generated spectrogram. This 
results in a significant quality improvement over 
traditional phase reconstruction methods.
