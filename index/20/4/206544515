A nano laboratory-a prototype nano manufacturing system-is presented, which is composed with a nanorobotic manipulation system with 4 units and 16 degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), a nano fabrication system based on electron-beam-induced deposition (EBID) with an internal or external precursor evaporation reservoir equipped with a thermal field emission electron source or a nanotube cold cathode, and a real-time observation and measurement system based on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with 3-4 conventional atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers, piezoresistive levers or nanotube probes. Nanotube devices including a mass flow sensor, a linear bearing, and nanotube scissors are fabricated in the nano laboratory.
