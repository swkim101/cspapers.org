Web search engines help users find useful information on the World Wide Web (WWW). However, when the same query is submitted by different users, typical search engines return the same result regardless of who submitted the query. Generally, each user has different information needs for his/her query. Therefore, the search result should be adapted to users with different information needs. In this paper, we first propose several approaches to adapting search results according to each user's need for relevant information without any user effort, and then verify the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. Experimental results show that search systems that adapt to each user's preferences can be achieved by constructing user profiles based on modified collaborative filtering with detailed analysis of user's browsing history in one day.
