Term dependency, or co-occurrence, has been studied in language modelling, for instance by Metzler & Croft who showed that retrieval performance could be significantlyenhanced using term dependency information. In this work, weshow how term dependency can be modelled within the Divergence From Randomness (DFR) framework. We evaluate our term dependency model on the two adhoc retrieval tasks using the TREC .GOV2 Terabyte collection. Furthermore, we examine the effect of varying the term dependency window size on the retrieval performance of the proposed model. Our experiments show that term dependency can indeed besuccessfully incorporated within the DFR framework.
