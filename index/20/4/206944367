In this paper, a dual-mode twisting actuation mechanism with an active clutch is newly presented for a high performance tendon-driven robot (e.g., robot hand). This mechanism is a kind of mechanical automatic power transmission mechanism which provides fast motion and large contraction force by two geared motors. One of the motors is adopted for main actuation and the other is utilized for active clutch. The active clutch consisting of low-power DC motor and gear set allows easy control of the dual-mode twisting actuation and simplifies relaxation process of twisted strings which was a critical problem by a passive brake in previous research [17]. Kinematics of the proposed mechanism is represented and its simulation is performed to verify the performance numerically. By using BLDC & DC motor with 8 W & 0.3 W power, we developed a prototype of the dual-mode twisting actuation with the weight of 45.7 g and the size of 71 mm × 21.5 × 15 mm. Despite of simple structure, the proposed mechanism shows that operation mode-change can be easily managed and the relaxation time was much more reduced than that of the passive brake version.
