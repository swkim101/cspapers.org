Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs)-- which augment a traditional Deep Neural Network (DNN) with an external, differentiable memory-- are emerging as a promising direction in machine learning. MANNs have been shown to achieve one-shot learning and complex cognitive capabilities that are well beyond those of classical DNNs. We analyze the computational characteristics of MANNs and observe that they present a unique challenge due to soft reads and writes to the differentiable memory, each of which requires access to all the memory locations. This results in poor performance of MANNs on modern CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators. To address this, we present Manna, a specialized hardware inference accelerator for MANNs. Manna is a memory-centric design that focuses on maximizing performance in an extremely low FLOPS/Byte context. The key architectural features from which Manna derives efficiency are: (i) investing most of the die area and power in highly banked on-chip memories that provide ample bandwidth rather than large matrix-multiply units that would be underutilized due to the low reuse (ii) a hardware-assisted transpose mechanism for accommodating the diverse memory access patterns observed in MANNs, (iii) a specialized processing tile that is equipped to handle the nearly-equal mix of MAC and non-MAC computations present in MANNs, and (iv) methods to map MANNs to Manna that minimize data movement while fully exploiting the little reuse present. We evaluate Manna by developing a detailed architectural simulator with timing and power models calibrated by synthesis to the 15 nm Nangate Open Cell library. Across a suite of 10 benchmarks, Manna demonstrates average speedups of 39x with average energy improvements of 122x over an NVIDIA 1080-Ti Pascal GPU and average speedups of 24x with average energy improvements of 86x over a state-of-the-art NVIDIA 2080-Ti Turing GPU.
