We consider a large distributed service system consisting of n homogeneous servers with infinite capacity FIFO queues. Jobs arrive as a Poisson process of rate λn/kn (for some positive constant kn and integer kn). Each incoming job consists of ???? identical tasks that can be executed in parallel, and that can be encoded into at least ???? ?replicas" of the same size (by introducing redundancy) so that the job is considered to be completed when any kn replicas associated with it finish their service. Moreover, we assume that servers can experience random slowdowns in their processing rate so that the service time of a replica is the product of its size and a random slowdown. First, we assume that the server slowdowns are shifted exponential and independent of the replica sizes. In this setting we show that the delay of a typical job is asymptotically minimized (as n - ∞) when the number of replicas per task is a constant that only depends on the arrival rate λ, and on the expected slowdown of servers. Second, we introduce a new model for the server slowdowns in which larger tasks experience less variable slowdowns than smaller tasks. In this setting we show that, under the class of policies where all replicas start their service at the same time, the delay of a typical job is asymptotically minimized (as n - ∞) when the number of replicas per task is made to depend on the actual size of the tasks being replicated, with smaller tasks being replicated more than larger tasks.
