When robots work together with a human or contact with a human body directly in such as a medical welfare field, in order to avoid an accident from crash and so on, a flexibility is required for the robot. The purpose of this study is to realize a safe mechanism for a human-friendly robot. In this paper, the structure and the fundamental characteristics of a pneumatic rubber muscle and soft mechanism are described, and then the structure and the fundamental operation of the developed soft hand are shown. Finally, the shaking hands is discussed as an example of force communication tasks between a robot and a human.
