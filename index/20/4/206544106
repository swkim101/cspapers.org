In this paper, an iterative framework for projection-based image sequence registration to be used by a non-holonomic mobile robot is introduced. Since obtaining complete registration has shown to be difficult and error prone, it is claimed that it is worth pursuing trying to gather at least partial and qualitative information from projections. A tracking method is adapted to select and track features between projections. Some results are shown with sequences of images taken when a mobile robot was heading forward, approximately along its optical axis, and rotating approximately around its optical center. It is shown that is possible to interpret camera motion from the projection of individual frames in an image stream.
