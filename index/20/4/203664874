Developing real-time software is particularly challenging since the complexity of the physical world has to be accommodated as well as stringent resource and timeliness constraints. Such circumstances require special language support over and above what can be found in general-purpose programming languages. ROOM is both an object-oriented modeling language and a development method specifically designed for dealing with large real-time systems. It supports automatic code generation to ensure reliability and increase productivity.
