Interactive fashion image manipulation, which enables users to edit images with sketches and color strokes, is an interesting research problem with great application value. Existing works often treat it as a general inpainting task and do not fully leverage the semantic structural information in fashion images. Moreover, they directly utilize conventional convolution and normalization layers to restore the incomplete image, which tends to wash away the sketch and color information. In this paper, we propose a novel Fashion Editing Generative Adversarial Network (FE-GAN), which is capable of manipulating fashion images by free-form sketches and sparse color strokes. FE-GAN consists of two modules: 1) a free-form parsing network that learns to control the human parsing generation by manipulating sketch and color; 2) a parsing-aware inpainting network that renders detailed textures with semantic guidance from the human parsing map. A new attention normalization layer is further applied at multiple scales in the decoder of the inpainting network to enhance the quality of the synthesized image. Extensive experiments on high-resolution fashion image datasets demonstrate that the proposed FE-GAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on fashion image manipulation.
