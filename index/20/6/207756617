With the increasing popularity and diversity of social media, users tend to join multiple social platforms to enjoy different types of services. User identity linkage, which aims to link identical identities across different social platforms, has attracted increasing research attentions recently. Existing methods usually focus on pairwise identity linkage between two platforms, which cannot piece up the information from multi-sources to depict the intrinsic figures of social users. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial learning based framework MSUIL with partially shared generators to perform Semi-supervised User Identity Linkage across Multiple social networks. The isomorphism across multiple platforms is captured as the complementary to link identities. The insight is that we aim to learn the desirable projection functions (generators) to not only minimize the distance between the distributions of user identities in arbitrary pairs of platforms, but also incorporate the available annotations as the learning guidance. The projection functions of different platform pairs share partial parameters, which ensures MSUIL can capture the interdependencies among multiple platforms and improves the model efficiency. Empirically, we evaluate our proposal over multiple datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MSUIL model.
