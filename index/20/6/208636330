This paper describes an implementation in progress of a C-based framework for execution of deterministic, concurrent, real-time software components called "reactors." The component interfaces and their interconnections are given a coordination language called Lingua Franca, while the work done by the components is given in ordinary C. The implementation described here can exploit multiple cores and is capable of realizing rate monotonic and earliest deadline first scheduling policies.
