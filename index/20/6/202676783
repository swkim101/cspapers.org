Monocular depth estimators can be trained with various forms of self-supervision from binocular-stereo data to circumvent the need for high-quality laser-scans or other ground-truth data. The disadvantage, however, is that the photometric reprojection losses used with self-supervised learning typically have multiple local minima. These plausible-looking alternatives to ground-truth can restrict what a regression network learns, causing it to predict depth maps of limited quality. As one prominent example, depth discontinuities around thin structures are often incorrectly estimated by current state-of-the-art methods. Here, we study the problem of ambiguous reprojections in depth-prediction from stereo-based self-supervision, and introduce Depth Hints to alleviate their effects. Depth Hints are complementary depth-suggestions obtained from simple off-the-shelf stereo algorithms. These hints enhance an existing photometric loss function, and are used to guide a network to learn better weights. They require no additional data, and are assumed to be right only sometimes. We show that using our Depth Hints gives a substantial boost when training several leading self-supervised-from-stereo models, not just our own. Further, combined with other good practices, we produce state-of-the-art depth predictions on the KITTI benchmark.
