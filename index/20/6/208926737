A game machine which can be played by two or more players includes an elongated box-like housing in which a game ball can be inserted, the housing including elongated side members with transparent windows therein and opposed end members with openings in their upper portions through which the game ball can be projected, the housing also including two projector elements in respective opposite ends thereof which are capable of utilization by competing players to project the game ball towards the opposite end member, and at least two activator elements in the housing between the two projector elements which are capable of utilization by competing players to contact and move a game ball in the desired fashion. A flooring structure inside the housing forms a contoured playing deck surface above the bottom of the housing and provides multiple, uniform and equally spaced-apart spaces which extend from one end member of the housing to the other. The projector elements and the activator elements include portions which can move within these spaces from a positioning below the playing deck surface to varying positionings above the playing deck surface so as to cause suitable manipulations of the game ball, including dribbling, when contacted by the noted projector element and activator element portions.
