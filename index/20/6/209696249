Complex systems require runtime monitoring of their operation, and this task can be performed by a separate monitoring process. A hacked monitor however could use the system traces it receives to attack the system or leak the information to competitors. We introduce private runtime verification, in which the monitoring process learns nothing about the traces, and yet is still able to correctly monitor them for satisfaction of temporal specifications.
