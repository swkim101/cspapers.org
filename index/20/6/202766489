Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is widely used as a similarity measure in various domains. Due to its invariance against warping in the time axis, DTW provides more meaningful discrepancy measurements between two signals than other dis- tance measures. In this paper, we propose a novel component in an artificial neural network. In contrast to the previous successful usage of DTW as a loss function, the proposed framework leverages DTW to obtain a better feature extraction. For the first time, the DTW loss is theoretically analyzed, and a stochastic backpropogation scheme is proposed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the DTW learning. We also demonstrate that the proposed framework can be used as a data analysis tool to perform data decomposition.
