Aspect-level sentiment classification is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task, which aims to predict the sentiment of a text in different aspects. One key point of this task is to allocate the appropriate sentiment words for the given aspect.Recent work exploits attention neural networks to allocate sentiment words and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. However, the prior work only attends to the sentiment information and ignores the aspect-related information in the text, which may cause mismatching between the sentiment words and the aspects when an unrelated sentiment word is semantically meaningful for the given aspect. To solve this problem, we propose a HiErarchical ATtention (HEAT) network for aspect-level sentiment classification. The HEAT network contains a hierarchical attention module, consisting of aspect attention and sentiment attention. The aspect attention extracts the aspect-related information to guide the sentiment attention to better allocate aspect-specific sentiment words of the text. Moreover, the HEAT network supports to extract the aspect terms together with aspect-level sentiment classification by introducing the Bernoulli attention mechanism. To verify the proposed method, we conduct experiments on restaurant and laptop review data sets from SemEval at both the sentence level and the review level. The experimental results show that our model better allocates appropriate sentiment expressions for a given aspect benefiting from the guidance of aspect terms. Moreover, our method achieves better performance on aspect-level sentiment classification than state-of-the-art models.
