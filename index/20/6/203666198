Strongly adherent layers of electroless metals on glass or ceramic substrates are obtained by first applying a film of an alkali metal silicate solution containing dissolved therein a catalytically effective amount of nickel, palladium or platinum to the substrate, drying and firing the film onto the substrate and electroless plating the coated substrate.
