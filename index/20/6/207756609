The diversity of job requirements and the complexity of job seekers' abilities put forward higher requirements for the accuracy and interpretability of Person-Job Fit system. Interpretable Person-Job Fit system can show reasons for giving recommendations or not recommending specific jobs to some people, and vice versa. Such reasons help us understand according to what the final decision is made by the system and guarantee a high recommending accuracy. Existing studies on Person-Job Fit have focused on 1) one perspective, without considering the variances of role and psychological motivation between interviewer and job seeker; 2) modeling the matching degree between resume and job requirements directly through a deep neural network without interaction matching modules, which leads to shortage on interpretation. To this end, we propose an Interpretable Person-Job Fit (IPJF) model, which 1) models the Person-Job Fit problem from the perspectives/intentions of employer and job seeker in a multi-tasks optimization fashion to interpretively formulate the Person-Job Fit process; 2) leverages deep interactive representation learning to automatically learn the interdependence between a resume and job requirements without relying on a clear list of job seeker's abilities, and deploys the optimizing problem as a learning to rank problem. Experiments on large real dataset show that the proposed IPJF model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and also gives promising interpretable recommending reasons.
