We consider the problem of detecting anomalies in a large dataset. We propose a 1 definition that captures the intuition that anomalies are easy to distinguish from 2 the overwhelming majority of points by relatively few attribute values: we call this 3 partial identification. Formalizing this intuition, we propose a geometric anomaly 4 measure for a point that we call PIDScore, which measures for the minimum 5 density of data points over all subcubes containing the point. We present PIDForest: 6 a random forest based algorithm that finds anomalies based on this definition. We 7 show that it performs favorably in comparison to several popular anomaly detection 8 methods, across a broad range of benchmarks. PIDForest also provides a succinct 9 explanation for why a point is labelled anomalous, by providing a set of features 10 and ranges for them which are relatively uncommon in the dataset. 11
