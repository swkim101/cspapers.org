We present Prema, a tool for Precise Requirement Editing, Modeling and Analysis. It can be used in various fields for describing precise requirements using formal notations and performing rigorous analysis. By parsing the requirements written in formal modeling language, Prema is able to get a model which aptly depicts the requirements. It also provides different rigorous verification and validation techniques to check whether the requirements meet users' expectation and find potential errors. We show that our tool can provide a unified environment for writing and verifying requirements without using tools that are not well inter-related. For experimental demonstration, we use the requirements of the automatic train protection (ATP) system of CASCO signal co. LTD., the largest railway signal control system manufacturer of China. The code of the tool cannot be released here because the project is commercially confidential. However, a demonstration video of the tool is available at https://youtu.be/BX0yv8pRMWs.
