Many 4D light field processing applications rely on superpixel segmentations, for which occlusion-aware view consistency is important. Yet, existing methods often enforce consistency by propagating clusters from a central view only, which can lead to inconsistent superpixels for non-central views. Our proposed approach combines an occlusion-aware angular segmentation in horizontal and vertical EPI spaces with an occlusion-aware clustering and propagation step across all views. Qualitative video demonstrations show that this helps to remove flickering and inconsistent boundary shapes versus the state-of-the-art approach, and quantitative metrics reflect these findings with improved boundary accuracy and view consistency scores.
