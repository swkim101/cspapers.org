Modern sophisticated walking machines are very capable, but expensive. We propose a greatly simplified system based around Control Moment Gyroscopes, which use reaction torque from a high-speed spinning flywheel to induce control torques, independently of the leg locomotion movements. This allows much cheaper sensors and actuators to be used. In this paper we describe the principles of operation and control strategy for such bipeds, as well as the mechanical construction of a sub-scale proof of concept called the Tiny Giant Robot (TGR). We report experiments to verify that the TGR's gyroscope is able to provide effective pitch control in the feet-together dual support stance. It was found that a small residual bias moment caused the gyroscope to creep, eventually saturating after 25 seconds of balance.
