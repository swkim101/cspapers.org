With the rich functionalities and enhanced computing capabilities available on mobile computing devices with touch screens, users not only store sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) but also use privacy sensitive applications (such as online banking) on these devices, which make them hot targets for hackers and thieves. To protect private information, such devices typically lock themselves after a few minutes of inactivity and prompt a password/PIN/pattern screen when reactivated. Passwords/PINs/patterns based schemes are inherently vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks and smudge attacks. Furthermore, passwords/PINs/patterns are inconvenient for users to enter frequently. In this paper, we propose GEAT, a gesture based user authentication scheme for the secure unlocking of touch screen devices. Unlike existing authentication schemes for touch screen devices, which use what user inputs as the authentication secret, GEAT authenticates users mainly based on how they input, using distinguishing features such as finger velocity, device acceleration, and stroke time. Even if attackers see what gesture a user performs, they cannot reproduce the behavior of the user doing gestures through shoulder surfing or smudge attacks. We implemented GEAT on Samsung Focus running Windows, collected 15009 gesture samples from 50 volunteers, and conducted real-world experiments to evaluate GEAT's performance. Experimental results show that our scheme achieves an average equal error rate of 0.5% with 3 gestures using only 25 training samples.
