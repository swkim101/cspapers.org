An approach to control of multiagent flexible manufacturing work cells is described. The concept is based on a strategic architectural model for hierarchical manufacturing control, which focuses on process sequence coordination in the bottom hierarchical layers. A work cell control system with universal applicability and free programmability is introduced. By utilization of user-defined device drivers the system can be adapted to different applications. The process sequence in the work cell depends on the individual product type and is described by process plans. A process planning system which supports user programming of the work cell controller is introduced.
