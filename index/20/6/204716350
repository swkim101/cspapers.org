We propose a novel motion sensing/recognition system, called DF-Mose, which marries low-power wireless backscattering and device-free sensing in one clean sheet. DF-Mose is an accurate, interference tolerable motion-recognition system that counts repetitive motions without using scenario-dependent templates or profiles within 5% count error and enables multiuser to perform certain motions simultaneously based on the nature of backscattered signals and dedicated signal separation method. With little efforts in learning the patterns, our method could achieve 95.2% motion-recognition accuracy for a variety of 7 typical motions.
