Analyzing links among pages from different mobile apps is an important task of app analysis. Currently, most efforts of analyzing inter-app page links rely on static program analysis, which produces a lot of false positives, requiring significant manual effort to verify the links. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose LinkRadar, a data-driven approach to assisting the analysis of inter-app page links. Our key idea is to use dynamic program analysis to gather a set of actual inter-app page links, based on which we train a model to predict whether there exist links among pages from different apps to help verify the results of static program analysis. The challenge is that inter-app page links are hard to be triggered by dynamic program analysis, making it difficult to collect enough inter-app page links to train the model. Considering the similarity between intra-app page links and inter-app page links, we use transfer learning to deal with the data scarcity problem. Evaluation results show that LinkRadar is able to infer the inter-app page links with high accuracy.
