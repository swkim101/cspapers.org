Previous work on adversarially robust neural networks for image classification requires large training sets and computationally expensive training procedures. On the other hand, few-shot learning methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. The goal of our work is to produce networks which both perform well at few-shot classification tasks and are simultaneously robust to adversarial examples. We develop an algorithm for producing adversarially robust meta-learners, and we thoroughly investigate factors which contribute to adversarial vulnerability. Moreover, our method achieves far superior robust performance on few-shot image classification tasks, such as Mini-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS, than robust transfer learning.
