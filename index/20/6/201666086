Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN) has been widely used in recommender systems (RSs). In previous HIN-based RSs, meta-path is used to compute the similarity between users and items. However, existing meta-path based methods only consider first-order relations, ignoring higher-order relations among the nodes ofsame type, captured bymotifs. In this paper, we propose to use motifs to capture higher-order relations among nodes of same type in a HIN and develop the motif-enhanced meta-path (MEMP) to combine motif-based higher-order relations with edge-based first-order relations. With MEMP-based similarities between users and items, we design a recommending model MoHINRec, and experimental results on two real-world datasets, Epinions and CiaoDVD, demonstrate its superiority over existing HIN-based RS methods.
