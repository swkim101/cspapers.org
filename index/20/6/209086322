It is a great honor and privilege for us to present the program of the EMSOFT 2009 conference. The program covers a wide spectrum of issues related to embedded systems software, including modeling and model-based design, analysis and verification, scheduling and timing/performance analysis, memory subsystems, and energy-aware design. 
 
As in the previous editions of this conference, this year too we received submissions from all over the world. A total of 106 submissions were received, of which 33 full papers were accepted for presentation at the conference. Most submitted papers were rigorously reviewed by four program committee members and all papers received at least three reviews. The expert opinions of many external reviewers were invaluable, for which we express our sincere gratitude. This year, for the first time at EMSOFT, we conducted a rebuttal process where all authors were given a chance to provide clarifications related to the reviews they received before the final acceptance decisions were made. The program committee conducted a final round of discussions based on these clarifications and then came up with the list of accepted papers. We would like to thank all EMSOFT 2009 program committee members for their hard work and for the expert opinions they provided, without which it would not have been possible to conduct this conference. 
 
EMSOFT 2009 is again co-locating with CODES+ISSS and CASES, two major embedded systems conferences within ESWEEK. ESWEEK also includes a number of satellite workshops and tutorials, on topics ranging from education to multimedia, security, cyber-physical systems, system design, and storage. We hope that you will find the program interesting and thought provoking, and we hope that the symposium will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share your ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.
