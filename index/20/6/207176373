Wireless Sensor Networks enable scientists to collect information about the environment with a granularity unseen before, while providing numerous challenges to software designers. Since sensor devices are often powered by small batteries, which take considerable effort to replace, it is of major importance to use energy carefully. We present two efficient ways of extending the lifetime of such systems: 1. an adaptive duty cycling protocol and 2. an adaptive data management protocol. Further, we present some details of our deployed sensor network in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire.
