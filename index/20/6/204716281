Comparing the mutation scores achieved for test suites, one is able to judge which test suite is more effective. However, it is not known if the mutation score is a fair metric to do such comparison. In this paper, we present an empirical study, which compares developer-written and automatically generated test suites in terms of mutation score and in relation to the detection ratios of 7 mutation types. Our results indicate fairness on the mutation score.
