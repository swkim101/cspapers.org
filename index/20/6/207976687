The attention of a deep neural network obtained by back-propagating gradients can effectively explain the decision of the network. They can further be used to explicitly access to the network response to a specific pattern. Considering objects of the same category but from different domains share similar visual patterns, we propose to treat the network attention as a bridge to connect objects across domains. In this paper, we use knowledge from the source domain to guide the network's response to categories shared with the target domain. With weights sharing and domain adversary training, this knowledge can be successfully transferred by regularizing the network's response to the same category in the target domain. Specifically, we transfer the foreground prior from a simple single-label dataset to another complex multi-label dataset, leading to improvement of attention maps. Experiments about the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation task show the effectiveness of our method. Besides, we further explore and validate that the proposed method is able to improve the generalization ability of a classification network in domain adaptation and domain generalization settings.
