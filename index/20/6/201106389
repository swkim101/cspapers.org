Almost all approaches to model-based diagnosis presume that the system being diagnosed behaves non-intermittently and analyze behavior over a small number (often only one) of time instants. In this paper we show how existing approaches to model-based diagnosis can be extended to diagnose intermittent failures as they manifest themselves over time. In addition, we show where to insert probe points to best distinguish among the intermittent faults those that best explain the symptoms and isolate the fault in minimum expected cost.
