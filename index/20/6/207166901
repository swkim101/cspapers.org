In 2003, MIT Technology Review listed Grid computing as one of 'Ten Emerging Technologies That Will Change the World' [5]. Five years later, is Grid computing ready for the undergraduate classroom? In this panel, a group of educators share their experiences in teaching Grid computing over the past several years and in various settings, and discuss how the subject materials should be developed for the future. Key points under discussion include the place in the undergraduate curriculum, the role of programming exercises, bottom-up versus top-down approaches, and the necessary Grid computing platform. This panel will be of interest to those who teach the subject, and those who wish to introduce Grid computing into their programs. It will also interest those who do not want to offer a full Grid computing course but may wish to introduce Grid computing into existing distributed systems, networking, or parallel programming courses.
