Ferroelectric FETs (FEFETs) offer intriguing possibilities for the design of low power nonvolatile memories by virtue of their three-terminal structure coupled with the ability of the ferroelectric (FE) material to retain its polarization in the absence of an electric field. Utilizing the distinct features of FEFETs, we propose a 2-transistor (2T) FEFET-based nonvolatile memory with separate read and write paths. With proper co-design at the device, cell and array levels, the proposed design achieves non-destructive read and lower write power at iso-write speed compared to standard FE-RAM. In addition, the FEFET-based memory exhibits high distinguishability with six orders of magnitude difference in the read currents corresponding to the two states. Comparative analysis based on experimentally calibrated models shows significant improvement of access energy-delay. For example, at a fixed write time of 550ps, the write voltage and energy are 58.5% and 67.7% lower than FERAM, respectively. These benefits are achieved with 2.4 times the area overhead. Further exploration of the proposed FEFET memory in energy harvesting nonvolatile processors shows an average improvement of 27% in forward progress over FERAM.
