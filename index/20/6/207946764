Decompilation is frequently used to analyze binary programs. In Android, however, decompilers all perform differently with varying apps due to their own characteristics. Obviously, there is no universal solution in all conditions. Based on this observation, we present a practical Android app decompilation system (called Kerberoid) that automatically stitches the results from multiple decompilers together to maximize the coverage and the accuracy of decompiled codes. We evaluate the performance of Kerberoid with 151 Android apps in which their corresponding source codes are publicly available. Kerberoid fully recovered all functions for 17% of the apps tested and gained a similarity score over 50% for 40% of the apps tested, increased by 7% and 9%, respectively, compared with the best existing decompiler.
