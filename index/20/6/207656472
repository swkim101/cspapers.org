People are used to log their life on the social media platform. Life event can be expressed explicitly or implicitly in a text description. However, a description does not always contain life events related to a specific individual. To tell if there exist any life events and further know their categories is indispensable for event retrieval. This paper explores various LSTM models to detect and classify life events in tweets. Experiments show that the proposed Multi-Task LSTM model with attention achieves the best performance.
