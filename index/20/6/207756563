In this paper, we study the machine reading comprehension of temporal order in text. Given a document of instruction sequences, a model aims to find out the most coherent sequences of activities matching the document among all answer candidates. To tackle the task, we proposeOrdMatch model, which is able to match each activity in a sequence to the corresponding instruction in the document and regularizes the partial order of activities to match the order of instructions. We evaluate the task using the RecipeQA dataset, which includes step-by-step instructions of cooking recipes. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models with a wide margin. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel ordering regularizer. Our code will be made available at \hrefhttps://github.com/Aolius/OrdMatch https://github.com/Aolius/OrdMatch.
