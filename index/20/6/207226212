This paper describes our deep learning system for sentiment analysis of tweets. The main contribution of this work is a new model for initializing the parameter weights of the convolutional neural network, which is crucial to train an accurate model while avoiding the need to inject any additional features. Briefly, we use an unsupervised neural language model to train initial word embeddings that are further tuned by our deep learning model on a distant supervised corpus. At a final stage, the pre-trained parameters of the network are used to initialize the model. We train the latter on the supervised training data recently made available by the official system evaluation campaign on Twitter Sentiment Analysis organized by Semeval-2015. A comparison between the results of our approach and the systems participating in the challenge on the official test sets, suggests that our model could be ranked in the first two positions in both the phrase-level subtask A (among 11 teams) and on the message-level subtask B (among 40 teams). This is an important evidence on the practical value of our solution.
