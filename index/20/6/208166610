We present a system for automating Semantic Role Labelling of Hindi-English code-mixed tweets. We explore the issues posed by noisy, user generated code-mixed social media data. We also compare the individual effect of various linguistic features used in our system. Our proposed model is a 2-step system for automated labelling which gives an overall accuracy of 84% for Argument Classification, marking a 10% increase over the existing rule-based baseline model. This is the first attempt at building a statistical Semantic Role Labeller for Hindi-English code-mixed data, to the best of our knowledge.
