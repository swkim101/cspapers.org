Obstacles facing accurate identification and localization of diseases in chest X-ray images lie in the lack of high-quality images and annotations. In this paper, we propose a Contrast Induced Attention Network (CIA-Net), which exploits the highly structured property of chest X-ray images and localizes diseases via contrastive learning on the aligned positive and negative samples. To force the attention module to focus only on sites of abnormalities, we also introduce a learnable alignment module to adjust all the input images, which eliminates variations of scales, angles, and displacements of X-ray images generated under bad scan conditions. We show that the use of contrastive attention and alignment module allows the model to learn rich identification and localization information using only a small amount of location annotations, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in NIH chest X-ray dataset.
