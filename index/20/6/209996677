A magnetic fluid transducer for producing a low-frequency sound field in a fluid medium. The device comprises a non-magnetic cylindrical housing with end windows. The housing is surrounded by a magnetic-field-generator means and contains a magnetic fluid within the housing. The magnetic field penetrates the housing and interacts with the magnetic fluid. A body force is developed within the fluid which produces an internal pressure in local regions defined by the lines of magnetic flux. This internal pressure is transmitted by an acoustic transmitting medium to the surrounding fluid as a sound pressure level.
