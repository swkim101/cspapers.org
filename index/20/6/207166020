Web search engines consistently collect information about users interaction with the system: they record the query they issued, the URL of presented and selected documents along with their ranking. This information is very valuable: It is a poll over millions of users on the most various topics and it has been used in many ways to mine users interests and preferences. Query logs have the potential to partially alleviate the search engines from thousand of searches by providing a way to predict answers for a subset of queries and users without knowing the content of a document. Even if the predicted result is at rank one, this analysis might be of interest: If there is enough confidence on a user's click, we might redirect the user directly to the page whose link would be clicked. In this paper, we present three different models for predicting user clicks, ranging from most specific ones (using only past user history for the query) to very general ones (aggregating data over all users for a given query). The former model has a very high precision at low recall values, while the latter can achieve high recalls. We show that it is possible to combine the different models to predict with high accuracy (over 90%) a high subset of query sessions (24% of all the sessions).
