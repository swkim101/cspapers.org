The success of deep convolutional neural networks in the domains of computer vision and speech recognition has led researchers to investigate generalizations of the said architecture to graph-structured data. A recently-proposed method called Graph Convolutional Networks has been able to achieve state-of-the-art results in the task of node classification. However, since the proposed method relies on localized first-order approximations of spectral graph convolutions, it is unable to capture higher-order interactions between nodes in the graph. In this work, we propose a motif-based graph attention model, called Motif Convolutional Networks, which generalizes past approaches by using weighted multi-hop motif adjacency matrices to capture higher-order neighborhoods. A novel attention mechanism is used to allow each individual node to select the most relevant neighborhood to apply its filter. We evaluate our approach on graphs from different domains (social networks and bioinformatics) with results showing that it is able to outperform a set of competitive baselines on the semi-supervised node classification task. Additional results demonstrate the usefulness of attention, showing that different higher-order neighborhoods are prioritized by different kinds of nodes.
