In high-throughput distributed applications, such as large-scale banking systems, synchronization between objects becomes a bottleneck. This short paper focusses on research, in close collaboration with ING Bank, on the opportunity of leveraging application specific knowledge captured by model driven engineering approaches, to increase application performance in high-contention scenarios, while maintaining functional application-level consistency.
