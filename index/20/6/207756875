Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been extensively used to annotate text, e.g., news articles, in order to enhance its comprehension by readers. This requires to map entities occurring in the news to the target entities of the KG and to extract a so-called relationship sub-graph (RSG) that spans these entities. RSG extraction is computationally demanding and cannot scale to large KGs. Existing approximation algorithms that focus on structurally compact RSGs are not satisfactory since they often return no answers. We address this problem and develop an efficient algorithm to find approximations that connect the most salient subset of the target entities. Moreover, we propose a context-aware method to rank RSGs by their relevance to the news and their semantic cohesion. In the demo we will present our approach and the attendees will be able to experience how our system MiCRon helps to make sense of news article by computing and presenting RSGs relevant to these articles.
