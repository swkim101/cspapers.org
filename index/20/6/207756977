In this paper, we study abstractive review summarization. Observing that review summaries often consist of aspect words, opinion words and context words, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning approach, which first predicts the output word type from the three types, and then leverages the predicted word type to generate the final word distribution. Experimental results on two Amazon product review datasets demonstrate that our method can consistently outperform several strong baseline approaches based on ROUGE scores.
