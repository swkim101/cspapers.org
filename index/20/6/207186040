Spam is unsolicited bulk email which is extremely annoying to the recipients and the ISPs. However, most of the traditional spam filtering methods commonly neglect the bulk character of spam. This paper proposes a model of cooperative anti-spam system based on multilayer agents. We compared our model to the state-of-the-art and found that our model achieved better performance and robustness on several known corpora.
