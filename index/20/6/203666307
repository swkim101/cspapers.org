The computational cost of conventional filter methods for junction characterization is very high. This burden can be attenuated by using steerable filters. However, in order to achieve a high orientational selectivity to characterize complex junctions a large number of basis filters is necessary. From this results a yet too high computational effort for steerable filters. In this paper we present a new method for characterizing junctions which keeps the high orientational resolution and is computationally efficient. It is based on applying rotated copies of a wedge averaging filter and estimating the derivative with respect to the polar angle. The new method is compared with the steerable wedge filter method [13] in experiments with real images. We show the superiority of our method as well as its adaptability to scale changes and robustness against nozse.
