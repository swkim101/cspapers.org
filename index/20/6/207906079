In this work we address the challenge of predicting the missing dimension (elevation angle) from 2D underwater sonar images. The high noise levels in these images, from phenomena such as non-diffuse reflections, frequently limits the usefulness of physical models. We thus propose the utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a powerful method to extract meaningful information without being misled by noisy data. We also introduce a self-supervised method that uses the physics of the sonar sensor to train the network on real data without ground-truth elevation maps. Our method can produce accurate elevation angle estimates given only a single image. Finally, we demonstrate that our method produces more accurate 3D reconstructions than competing methods, both in simulation and on real data.
