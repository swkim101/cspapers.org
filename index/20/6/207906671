With development of ubiquitous urban sensory infrastructures, large scale human mobility data have various applications and benefits in mobile networking and urban planning. Demands for sharing these sensing data to research communities have proliferated causing concerns over privacy. Traditional privacy solution is to apply comprehensive perturbation at feature level, which may results in significant utility loss. In this paper, we propose a learning-based generative model with designed classifiers to generate realistic synthetic mobility data with privacy protection at label/system property level. With two plug-in classifiers, i.e., privacy classifier and utility classifier, the trade-off between sensitive and non-sensitive mobility properties would be balanced with customization. To validate the performance, we implement our model based on the urban-scale cellphone data from the Shenzhen city as a case study. The resilience of smart attacks is tested and potential applications are pictured for this semi-supervised learning-based model.
