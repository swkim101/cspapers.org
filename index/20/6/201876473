This article considers the different ways took by the State applied to make visible their action against urban violence. The security policy management is revealed through tools against the complaints of citizen-victims in the Argentina post-crisis of 2001. The analysis is methodologically developed from 1) examples of state intervention with victims of insecurity and 2) interviews with people that belong to areas of criminal policy. Four categories are 
constructed to understand the management of the conflict: i) the policy of the message, ii) the control of the media visibility, iii) the segmentation of the victims, and iv) the use of criminal rhetoric. Despite the existence of these forms of intervention, every violent act put back on the media the stateâ€™s inability to care for the victim.
