Multi-scale representation provides an effective way to address scale variation of objects and stuff in semantic segmentation. Previous works construct multi-scale representation by utilizing different filter sizes, expanding filter sizes with dilated filters or pooling grids, and the parameters of these filters are fixed after training. These methods often suffer from heavy computational cost or have more parameters, and are not adaptive to the input image during inference. To address these problems, this paper proposes a Dynamic Multi-scale Network (DMNet) to adaptively capture multi-scale contents for predicting pixel-level semantic labels. DMNet is composed of multiple Dynamic Convolutional Modules (DCMs) arranged in parallel, each of which exploits context-aware filters to estimate semantic representation for a specific scale. The outputs of multiple DCMs are further integrated for final segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our DMNet on three challenging semantic segmentation and scene parsing datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, Pascal-Context, and ADE20K. DMNet achieves a new record 84.4% mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012 test set without MS COCO pre-trained and post-processing, and also obtains state-of-the-art performance on Pascal-Context and ADE20K.
