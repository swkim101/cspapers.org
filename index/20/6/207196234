Sequential pattern mining plays an important role in many applications, such as bioinformatics and consumer behavior analysis. However, the classic frequency-based framework often leads to many patterns being identified, most of which are not informative enough for business decision-making. In frequent pattern mining, a recent effort has been to incorporate utility into the pattern selection framework, so that high utility (frequent or infrequent) patterns are mined which address typical business concerns such as dollar value associated with each pattern. In this paper, we incorporate utility into sequential pattern mining, and a generic framework for high utility sequence mining is defined. An efficient algorithm, USpan, is presented to mine for high utility sequential patterns. In USpan, we introduce the lexicographic quantitative sequence tree to extract the complete set of high utility sequences and design concatenation mechanisms for calculating the utility of a node and its children with two effective pruning strategies. Substantial experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that USpan efficiently identifies high utility sequences from large scale data with very low minimum utility.
