We consider applying computer vision to video on cloud-backed mobile devices using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The computational demands of DNNs are high enough that, without careful resource management, such applications strain device battery, wireless data, and cloud cost budgets. We pose the corresponding resource management problem, which we call Approximate Model Scheduling, as one of serving a stream of heterogeneous (i.e., solving multiple classification problems) requests under resource constraints. We present the design and implementation of an optimizing compiler and runtime scheduler to address this problem. Going beyond traditional resource allocators, we allow each request to be served approximately, by systematically trading off DNN classification accuracy for resource use, and remotely, by reasoning about on-device/cloud execution trade-offs. To inform the resource allocator, we characterize how several common DNNs, when subjected to state-of-the art optimizations, trade off accuracy for resource use such as memory, computation, and energy. The heterogeneous streaming setting is a novel one for DNN execution, and we introduce two new and powerful DNN optimizations that exploit it. Using the challenging continuous mobile vision domain as a case study, we show that our techniques yield significant reductions in resource usage and perform effectively over a broad range of operating conditions.
