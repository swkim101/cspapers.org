We obtain improved algorithms for finding small vertex covers in bounded degree graphs and hypergraphs. We use semidefinite programming to relax the problems and introduce new} rounding techniques for these relaxations. On graphs with maximum degree at most $\Delta$, the algorithm achieves a performance ratio of $2-(1-o(1))\frac{2 \ln \ln \Delta}{\ln \Delta}$ for large $\Delta$, which improves the previously known ratio of $2-\frac{\log \Delta + O(1)}{\Delta}$ obtained by Halld{orsson and Radhakrishnan. Using similar techniques, we also present improved approximations for the vertex cover problem in hypergraphs. For k-uniform hypergraphs with n vertices, we achieve a ratio of $k-(1-o(1))\frac{k\ln \ln n}{\ln n}$ for large n, and for k-uniform hypergraphs with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ the algorithm achieves a ratio of $k-(1-o(1))\frac{k(k-1)\ln \ln \Delta}{\ln \Delta}$ for large $\Delta$. These results considerably improve the previous best ratio of $k(1-c/\Delta^\frac{1}{k-1})$ for bounded degree k-uniform hypergraphs, and $k(1-c/n^\frac{k-1}{k})$ for general k-uniform hypergraphs, both obtained by Krivelevich. Using similar techniques, we also obtain an approximation algorithm for the weighted independent set problem, matching a recent result of Halldorsson.
