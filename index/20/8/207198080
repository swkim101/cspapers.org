It is widely known how to generate random spanning trees of an undirected graph. Broder showed how at FOCS [6], and Aldous too found the algorithm [2]. Start at any vertex and do a simple random walk on the graph. Each time a vertex is first encountered, mark the edge from which it was discovered. When all the vertices are discovered, the marked edges form a random spanning tree. This algorithm is easy to code up, has small running time constants, and has a nice proof that it generates trees with the right probabilities. This paper gives a new algorithm for generating random spanning trees. It too is simple, easy to code up, and has nice proofs. The new algorithm also has the following advantages:
