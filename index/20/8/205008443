We present a new technique for obtaining decision procedures for modal logics of programs. The technique centers around a new class of finite automata on infinite trees for which the emptiness problem can be solved in polynomial time. The decision procedures then consist of constructing an automaton <italic>A</italic><italic><subscript>f</subscript></italic> for a given formula <italic>f</italic>, such that <italic>A</italic><italic><subscript>f</subscript></italic> accepts some tree if and only if <italic>f</italic> is satisfiable. We illustrate our technique by giving an exponential decision procedure for deterministic propositional dynamic logic and a variant of the &mgr-calculus of Kozen.
