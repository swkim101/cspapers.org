In a generous interview granted in March to professor Jeder Janotti Jr. from the Graduate Studies Program on Communication at UFPE, Will Straw updates and reconsiders a number of controversial issues which still configure the discussions around the idea of music scenes. As it is possible to observe in his answers, 
Straw shows how his proposal attempts to give an account of the relationships established in the global circulation of massive popular music, without ruling out possible agreements with restricted circulations and regionalized references. Before stating the validity of a 
strict notion of scene, the Canadian researcher acknowledges that, similarly to the music consumption and production, the notion of music scenes has also undergone significant transformations in recent times.
