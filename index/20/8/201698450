We present FastRP, a scalable and performant algorithm for learning distributed node representations in a graph. FastRP is over 4,000 times faster than state-of-the-art methods such as DeepWalk and node2vec, while achieving comparable or even better performance as evaluated on several real-world networks on various downstream tasks. We observe that most network embedding methods consist of two components: construct a node similarity matrix and then apply dimension reduction techniques to this matrix. We show that the success of these methods should be attributed to the proper construction of this similarity matrix, rather than the dimension reduction method employed. FastRP is proposed as a scalable algorithm for network embeddings. Two key features of FastRP are: 1) it explicitly constructs a node similarity matrix that captures transitive relationships in a graph and normalizes matrix entries based on node degrees; 2) it utilizes very sparse random projection, which is a scalable optimization-free method for dimension reduction. An extra benefit from combining these two design choices is that it allows the iterative computation of node embeddings so that the similarity matrix need not be explicitly constructed, which further speeds up FastRP. FastRP is also advantageous for its ease of implementation, parallelization and hyperparameter tuning. The source code is available at https://github.com/GTmac/FastRP.
