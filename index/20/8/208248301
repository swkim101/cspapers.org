Opinion summarization from online product reviews is a challenging task, which involves identifying opinions related to various aspects of the product being reviewed. While previous works require additional human effort to identify relevant aspects, we instead apply domain knowledge from external sources to automatically achieve the same goal. This work proposes AspMem, a generative method that contains an array of memory cells to store aspect-related knowledge. This explicit memory can help obtain a better opinion representation and infer the aspect information more precisely. We evaluate this method on both aspect identification and opinion summarization tasks. Our experiments show that AspMem outperforms the state-of-the-art methods even though, unlike the baselines, it does not rely on human supervision which is carefully handcrafted for the given tasks.
