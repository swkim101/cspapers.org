We will introduce and demonstrate CoLTE, an all-in-one solution for LTE-based community networks. CoLTE is a lightweight, Internet-only LTE core network (EPC) based on OpenAirInterface. CoLTE is designed to facilitate the deployment and operation of small-scale, community owned and operated LTE networks, with a particular eye towards expanding Internet access into rural areas with limited and unreliable backhaul. CoLTE comes paired with a basic, IP-based network manager called Haulage, as well as basic locally-hosted webservices. The key differentiator of CoLTE, when compared to existing LTE solutions, is that in CoLTE the EPC is designed to be located in the field and deployed alongside a small number of cellular radios (eNodeBs), as opposed to the centralized model seen in large-scale telecom networks.
