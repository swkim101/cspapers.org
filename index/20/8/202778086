Based on massive amounts of data, recent pretrained contextual representation models have made significant strides in advancing a number of different English NLP tasks. However, for other languages, relevant training data may be lacking, while state-of-the-art deep learning methods are known to be data-hungry. In this paper, we present an elegantly simple robust self-learning framework to include unlabeled non-English samples in the fine-tuning process of pretrained multilingual representation models. We leverage a multilingual modelâ€™s own predictions on unlabeled non-English data in order to obtain additional information that can be used during further fine-tuning. Compared with original multilingual models and other cross-lingual classification models, we observe significant gains in effectiveness on document and sentiment classification for a range of diverse languages.
