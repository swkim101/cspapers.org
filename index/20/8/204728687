With the widespread adoption of concurrent programming, debugging of non-deterministic failures becomes increasingly important. Record & replay debugging aids developers in this effort by reliably reproducing recorded bugs. Because each concurrency model (e.g., threads vs actors) is particularly suited for different tasks, developers started combining them within the same application. Record & replay solutions are typically designed for one concurrency model only. In this paper we propose a novel multi-paradigm record & replay that is based on abstracting concurrency models to a common set of concepts and events.
