Enterprises often assume their data is up-to-date, where the presence of a timestamp in the recent past qualifies the data as current. However, entities modeled in the data experience varying rates of change that influence data currency. We argue that data currency is a relative notion based on individual spatio-temporal update patterns, and these patterns can be learned and predicted. We develop CurrentClean, a probabilistic system for identifying and cleaning stale values, and enables a user to interactively explore change in her data. Our system provides a Web-based user-interface, and a backend infrastructure that learns update correlations among cell values in a database to infer and repair stale values. Our demonstration provides two motivating scenarios that highlight change exploration, and cleaning features using clinical, and sensor data from a data centre enterprise.
