Textual entailment is a central problem of language variability, which has been attracting a lot of interest and it poses significant issues in front of systems aimed at natural language understanding. Recently, various frameworks have been proposed for textual entailment recognition, ranging from traditional computational linguistics techniques to deep learning model based methods. However, recent deep neural networks that achieve the state of the art on textual entailment task only consider the context information of the given sentences rather than the real-world background information and knowledge beyond the context. In the paper, we propose a Knowledge-Context Interactive Textual Entailment Network (KCI-TEN) that learns graph level sentence representations by harnessing external knowledge graph with graph attention network. We further propose a text-graph interaction mechanism for neural based entailment matching learning, which endows the redundancy and noise with less importance and put emphasis on the informative representations. Experiments on the SciTail dataset demonstrate that KCI-TEN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
