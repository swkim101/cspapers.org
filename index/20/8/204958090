Fashion recommendation is the task of suggesting a fashion item that fits well with a given item. In this work, we propose to automatically synthesis new items for recommendation. We jointly consider the two key issues for the task, i.e., compatibility and personalization. We propose a personalized fashion design framework with the help of generative adversarial training. A convolutional network is first used to map the query image into a latent vector representation. This latent representation, together with another vector which characterizes user's style preference, are taken as the input to the generator network to generate the target item image. Two discriminator networks are built to guide the generation process. One is the classic real/fake discriminator. The other is a matching network which simultaneously models the compatibility between fashion items and learns users' preference representations. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on thousands of outfits composited by online users. The experiments show that the items generated by our model are quite realistic. They have better visual quality and higher matching degree than those generated by alternative methods.
