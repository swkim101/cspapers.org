While Datalog provides a high-level language for expressing static program analyses, it depends on external tooling to extract the input facts from the analyzed programs. To remove this dependency, we present MetaDL. The MetaDL system consists of a Datalog language extension for source-level program analysis and tools for generating the language extension from a description of the analyzed language.
