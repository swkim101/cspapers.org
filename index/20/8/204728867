Video surveillance is an important application of Internet of Thing (IoT) that provides convenience remote monitoring service to end users. How to reduce the power consumption of mobile devices with limited energy has become a research hotspot. We propose an energy-efficient architecture that includes smartphones' various power saving solutions for video transmission over wireless networks. Results demonstrate that each of our proposed solutions is significantly outperforms than the standard scheme.
