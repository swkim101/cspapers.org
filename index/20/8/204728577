After three highly successful editions of the Internet-QoE workshop organized at ACM SIGCOMM 2016, ACM SIGCOMM 2017, and IEEE ICDCS 2018, the goal of the fourth edition of the Internet-QoE workshop is to scale the concepts of Quality of Experience (user satisfaction, user engagement, and behavioral analysis) out of the lab studies context and bring it to the analysis and operation of distributed systems and communication networks, giving a user-centric perspective to the research performed by the MOBICOM community. By fostering an explicit and deep integration of the end-user directly into the design, analysis and management of large-scale operational networks, we expect to reduce the gap between QoE research and its application to future network management paradigms, as well as to provide a more targeted end-user perspective to the research on distributed communication systems. The 4th edition of Internet-QoE also focuses on novel end-user services enabled by next generation technologies such as immersive media (3D, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality), self-driving cars, intelligent manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0 and tactile Internet, 5G ultra-low-latency mobile networks, and real-time applications.
