We present a novel approach for the detection of 2-plexes, a popular relaxation of cliques used for modeling network communities. Specifically, with the purpose of identifying theoretically sound methods for community detection on a large scale, we introduce the first shared-nothing distributed algorithm for this problem. This result opens a new research direction for scalable community detection. Our proposal has three main ingredients: (i) we reduce the problem of finding 2-plexes to that of finding cliques; (ii) we leverage known algorithms for fast computation of cliques; (iii) we exploit a decomposition technique for a distributed shared-nothing computation. Preliminary experiments on a 10-nodes cluster running Spark confirm the effectiveness of our approach.
