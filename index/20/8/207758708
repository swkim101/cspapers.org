Recent technological advent in virtual reality (VR) has attracted a lot of attention to the VR shopping, which thus far is designed for a single user. In this paper, we envision the scenario of VR group shopping, where VR supports: 1) flexible display of items to address diverse personal preferences, and 2) convenient view switching between personal and group views to foster social interactions. We formulate the Multiview-Enabled Configuration Recommendation (MECR) problem to rank a set of displayed items for a VR shopping user. We design the Multiview-Enabled Configuration Ranking System (MEIRS) that first extracts discriminative features based on Marketing theories and then introduces a new coupled tensor factorization model to learn the representation of users, Multi-View Display (MVD) configurations, and multiple feedback with content features. Experimental results manifest that the proposed approach outperforms personalized recommendations and group recommendations by at least 30.8% in large-scale datasets and 63.3% in the user study in terms of hit ratio and mean average precision.
