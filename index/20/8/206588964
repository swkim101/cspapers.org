Recent work in computer vision has demonstrated positive results in reasoning about possible object function based on analysis of only the object shape. While shape properties are important, verification of actual functionality generally requires consideration of properties beyond pure static shape. In particular, dynamic physical properties such as the degree of deformation or rigidity under applied force are essential to the function of many objects. The work described in this paper combines reasoning about object shape with reasoning about deformation under applied forces for recognizing (categorizing) an object according to its function. Initial reasoning about the static 3-D object shape provides a function verification plan. This plan is a sequence of interactions that lead to confirming or rejecting the suggested object function. The interactions involve applying test forces to elements of the object structure as identified in the reasoning about static 3-D shape. >
