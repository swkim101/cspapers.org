In nowaday, there are more and more popular smartphone apps. It is important for us to know why a certain app is chosen and whether an alternative app will be selected if the reasons using this app are changing. Once we know the reasons of current app choice, it will be helpful for us to design better app or provide better services so that more users are attracted to use this app. In this paper, we propose a causal inference model to analyze the reasons why a certain app is used. In this model, we define a regret loss function to evaluate the causal influence of a cause on its effect after an intervention on this cause. And, we use maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameter of a tranfer distribution.
