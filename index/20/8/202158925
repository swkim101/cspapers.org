This work encompasses the design and development of garment-based shape memory alloy (SMA) compression technology that is dynamic, low-mass, and remotely controllable. Three garment design iterations are presented, consolidated from past user studies [1], [2], [3]. The designed garment system has potential to serve as a research tool for understanding parameters necessary to create a desired compression haptic experience; for broadening the scope of medical/clinical interventions; as well as for enabling new modes of interaction between users separated by distance, especially in areas such as tele-rehabilitation and social mediated touch.
