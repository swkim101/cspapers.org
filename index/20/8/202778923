Known finite-sample concentration bounds for the Wasserstein distance between the empirical and true distribution of a random variable are used to derive a two-sided concentration bound for the error between the true conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of a (possibly unbounded) random variable and a standard estimate of its CVaR computed from an i.i.d. sample. The bound applies under fairly general assumptions on the random variable, and improves upon previous bounds which were either one sided, or applied only to bounded random variables. Specializations of the bound to sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential random variables are also derived. A similar procedure is followed to derive concentration bounds for the error between the true and estimated Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) value of a random variable, in cases where the random variable is bounded or sub-Gaussian. These bounds are shown to match a known bound in the bounded case, and improve upon the known bound in the sub-Gaussian case. The usefulness of the bounds is illustrated through an algorithm, and corresponding regret bound for a stochastic bandit problem, where the underlying risk measure to be optimized is CVaR.
