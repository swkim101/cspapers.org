An information structure (IS) that is regarded as a formal description of a domain of discourse is proposed. This IS is aimed at increasing the effectiveness of an information retrieval system. It is shown how the retrieval algorithm can take into account the term dependencies that are provided by the IS. Moreover, these term dependencies can be used by an automatic indexing procedure in order to interpret polysemic terms. The theoretical framework of our IS has some favorable properties. As a consequence, the construction and maintenance of such an IS is simpler than that of a thesaurus.
