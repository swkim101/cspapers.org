Hashtags, a user provides to a micro-video, are the ones which can well describe the semantics of the micro-video's content in his/her mind. At the same time, hashtags have been widely used to facilitate various micro-video retrieval scenarios (e.g., search, browse, and categorization). Despite their importance, numerous micro-videos lack hashtags or contain inaccurate or incomplete hashtags. In light of this, hashtag recommendation, which suggests a list of hashtags to a user when he/she wants to annotate a post, becomes a crucial research problem. However, little attention has been paid to micro-video hashtag recommendation, mainly due to the following three reasons: 1) lack of benchmark dataset; 2) the temporal and multi-modality characteristics of micro-videos; and 3) hashtag sparsity and long-tail distributions. In this paper, we recommend hashtags for micro-videos by presenting a novel multi-view representation interactive embedding model with graph-based information propagation. It is capable of boosting the performance of micro-videos hashtag recommendation by jointly considering the sequential feature learning, the video-user-hashtag interaction, and the hashtag correlations. Extensive experiments on a constructed dataset demonstrate our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. As a side research contribution, we have released our dataset and codes to facilitate the research in this community.
