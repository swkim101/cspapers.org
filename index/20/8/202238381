This essay aims to consider the relation between journalism and daylife from a theoretical point of view guided by the notion of reality. We take this concept as a guideline, pointing to its main bases in the context of sociological and philosophical perspectives manifested by a reflective look of the field of so-called Theory of Journalism. In this movement, we seek to discuss the idea of a “journalistic reality” and its importance for thinking about products and information practices, as well as their reading of the social environment. In the course of the text, it called attention to the role of language and how the “social 
reality” logic intertwines the logic of “journalistic reality”, forming part of a mediation of daylife in an inseparable way.
