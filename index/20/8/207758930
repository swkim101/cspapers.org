Networks are ubiquitous in many real-world applications due to their capability of representing the rich information in the data. One fundamental problem of network analysis is to learn a low- dimensional vector representation for nodes within the attributed networks. However, there is little work theoretically considering the information heterogeneity from the attributed networks, and most of the existing attributed network embedding techniques are able to capture at most k-th order node proximity, thus leading to the information loss of the long-range spatial dependencies between individual nodes across the entire network. To address the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel MAnifold-RegularIzed Network Embedding (MARINE) algorithm inspired by minimizing the information discrepancy in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space via Maximum Mean Discrepancy. In particular, we show that MARINE recursively aggregates the graph structure information as well as individual node attributes from the entire network, and thereby preserves the long-range spatial dependencies between nodes across the network. The experimental results on real networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed MARINE algorithm over state-of-the-art embedding methods.
