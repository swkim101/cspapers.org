Welcome to the first international workshop on Software Qualities and their Dependencies (SQUADE). The workshop is collocated with ICSE, the International Conference on Software Engineering, in Gothenburg, Sweden. SQUADE focuses on increasing the understanding of the nature of Software Qualities (SQs), -ilities, non-functional properties or extra-functional requirements (reliability, usability, affordability, etc.), and their interrelationships with the aim of bringing them into balance in the practice of software engineering. The relevance and timeliness of this topic reflects the current and future trends toward more software-intensive systems, with greater complexity, autonomy, speed of change, and need for interoperability within systems of systems, given the frequent system shortfalls and overruns that occur when their SQ balance is not achieved. For this reason, the primary goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to help create more solid foundations for dealing with SQs.
