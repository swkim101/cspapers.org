With the advent of bandwidth-hungry applications and the new advancements in wireless LAN standards (802.11ad, 802.11ay) and cellular technologies (5G), modern smartphones need to be able support multi-Gbps data rates. In this work, we explore if today's smartphones are capable of handling such high-speed network traffic. Using two high-end smartphones, we show that, contrary to previous beliefs, they can indeed support Gbps data rates without significant strain on their hardware resources. Using projections, we further show that up to 12.8 Gbps could be supported with just 50% CPU utilization. Finally, we explore the factors that make this possible and the contribution of each of them.
