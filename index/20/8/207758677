Unsupervised domain adaptation is a popular but challenging problem setting. Existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods are based on the single manifold assumption, i.e., data are sampled from a single low-dimensional manifold, and thus may not well capture the complex characteristic of the real-world data. In this paper, we propose to transfer knowledge across domains under the multiple manifolds assumption that assumes the data are sampled from multiple low-dimensional manifolds. Specifically, we develop a multiple manifolds information transfer framework (MMIT). The proposed MMIT aims to transfer the multiple manifolds information, which is represented by the data manifold neighborhood structure, with the the best adaptation capacity. To do so, we propose to couple the multiple manifolds information transfer with the domain distribution discrepancy minimization in the adaptation procedure. Experimental studies demonstrate that MMIT achieves the promising adaptation performance on various real-world adaptation tasks.
