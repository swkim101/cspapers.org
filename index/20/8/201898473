Through a brief theoretical rescue of the concept of mediation in Latin American tradition of cultural studies, especially in the proposals for Jesus Martin-Barbero, this article intends to demonstrate its theoretical and methodological importance in studies of television. We understand television genre as a mediation between the practices of production, critical and audience (Martin-Barbero, 2001). We will adopt the principles of cultural analysis of television genre as proposed by Jason Mittell 
(2004). Our study alligns with Mittellâ€™s perspective that cultural practices are constitutive of media practices, and genre is seen as an important key to understanding, when it comes to capturing the meanings constructed and configured by the media. In order to demonstrate empirically our purposes of analysis, we will invest in the cultural construction of television genre miniseries.
