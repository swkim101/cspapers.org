AI Planning has been shown to be a useful approach for the generation of narrative in interactive entertainment systems and games. However, the creation of the underlying narrative domain models is challenging: the well documented AI planning modelling bottleneck is further compounded by the need for authors, who tend to be non-technical, to create content. We seek to support authors in this task by allowing natural language (NL) plot synopses to be used as a starting point from which planning domain models can be automatically acquired. We present a solution which analyses input NL text summaries, and builds structured representations from which a pddl model is output (fully automated or author in-the-loop). We introduce a novel sieve-based approach to pronoun resolution that demonstrates consistently high performance across domains. In the paper we focus on authoring of narrative planning models for use in interactive entertainment systems and games. We show that our approach exhibits comprehensive detection of both actions and objects in the system-extracted domain models, in combination with significant improvement in the accuracy of pronoun resolution due to the use of contextual object information. Our results and an expert user assessment show that our approach enables a reduction in authoring effort required to generate baseline narrative domain models from which variants can be built.
