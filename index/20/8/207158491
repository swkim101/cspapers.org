Visualization and interactivity are valuable active learning techniques that can improve mastery of difficult concepts. In this paper we describe jFAST, an easy-to-use graphical software tool for teachers and students, with an emphasis on introductory level finite state machine topics. The jFAST software enables visual design, exploration and simulation of a variety of finite state machines, with a primary goal of enhancing teaching effectiveness in this subject, particularly for less advanced computer science students. The architecture and functionality of jFAST are explained, and results of preliminary evaluation are provided.
