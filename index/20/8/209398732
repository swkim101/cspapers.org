The specification discloses improved wheel washers, in one embodiment of which a pair of cupped-face brushes and a cylindrical brush are mounted on a bar forming one side of a parallelogram linkage. The bar is spring biased toward a normal position in which each cupped-face brush faces somewhat toward an approaching car wheel to be washed, and, as the body of the car engages and progressively moves past feeler rollers, each cupped-face brush on the bar is swung thereby with the car to a position in which it will face the side of the wheel when the wheel comes alongside the brush. This initial canting of the cupped-face brushes causes them to enter into the somewhat hollow area of the wheel to clean the tire supporting structure and hub cap. In another embodiment, the feeler rollers are omitted and two rocker panel brushes are mounted on opposite ends of a bar with a single canted, cupped-face brush mounted on the bar between the rocker panel brushes, the rocker panel brushes acting as feelers (or pushers) to be moved by the side of a car to provide desired cleaning positions for all the brushes.
