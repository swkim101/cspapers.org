This paper describes a process for establishing and maintaining a computer science education research group. Its purpose is to tell the story of one long-standing group, describe the benefits afforded by collaborative research groups and provide advice about how to form such a group. The intended audience is faculty members at teaching-intensive institutions who wish to establish or revive a research program in computer science education. We discuss establishing and maintaining a computer science education research agenda in a teaching-intensive environment.
