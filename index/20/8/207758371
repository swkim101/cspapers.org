Many data analysis and knowledge mining tasks require a basic understanding of the content of a dataset prior to any data access. In this demo, we showcase how data descriptions---a set of compact, readable and insightful formulas of boolean predicates---can be used to guide users in understanding datasets. Finding the best description for a dataset is, unfortunately, both computationally hard and task-specific. This demo shows that not only we can generate descriptions at interactive speed, but also that diverse user needs---from anomaly detection to data exploration---can be accommodated through a user-driven process exploiting dynamic programming in concert with a set of heuristics.
