An evolving pattern graph is defined by an initial pattern graph and a graph update stream consisting of edge insertions and deletions. Identifying and monitoring evolving graph patterns in the data graph is important in various application domains such as Cyberthreats surveillance. This motivates us to explore matching patterns with evolvement, and the investigation presents a novel algorithm \incepg for continuously matching of evolving patterns. Specially, we propose a concise representation \Index of partial matching solutions, and its execution model allows fast incremental maintenance. We also conceive an effective model for estimating step-wise cost of pattern evaluation to drive the matching process. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of \incepg.
