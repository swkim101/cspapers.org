As connected and autonomous vehicle technology evolves, the design of in-vehicle network architecture, which connects multiple electronic control units (ECUs) and internal sensors and supports connectivity to the outside of the vehicle, has increased significantly to meet security needs. However, the heterogeneous structure of the in-vehicle network and lack of security consideration has introduced a lack of scalability and security concerns. In this work, we propose a shuffling-based moving target defense (MTD) technique aiming to disturb network reconnaissance attacks and deployed it in the proposed software-defined networking (SDN)-based in-vehicle network architecture. To validate the proposed MTD, we compare the service availability of our proposed MTD and non-MTD counterpart in the presence of the reconnaissance-based false message injection attacks.
