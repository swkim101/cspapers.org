A plurality of binary pseudo noise generators are used to develop a Gaussian code that appears thermal noiselike in both amplitude and phase. Half of the pseudo noise generators are provided in an in-phase section and half in a quadrature section, with each said generator output being mixed with data to be transmitted and applied to modulate a carrier, the outputs from the various sections being combined for transmission. A receiver having the same number of pseudo noise generators and generating the same code synchronously demodulates the received data.
