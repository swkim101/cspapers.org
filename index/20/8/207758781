Reasoning is an important ability that we learn from a very early age. Yet, reasoning is extremely hard for algorithms. Despite impressive recent progress that has been reported on tasks that necessitate reasoning, such as visual question answering and visual dialog, models often exploit biases in datasets. To develop models with better reasoning abilities, recently, the new visual commonsense reasoning(VCR) task has been introduced. Not only do models have to answer questions, but also do they have to provide a reason for the given answer. The proposed baseline achieved compelling results, leveraging a meticulously designed model composed of LSTM modules and attention nets. Here we show that a much simpler model obtained by ablating and pruning the existing intricate baseline can perform better with half the number of trainable parameters. By associating visual features with attribute information and better text to image grounding, we obtain further improvements for our simpler & effective baseline, TAB-VCR. We show that this approach results in a 5.3%, 4.4% and 6.5% absolute improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on question answering, answer justification and holistic VCR.
