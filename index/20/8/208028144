Based on a case study of the afternoon talk show Casos de Familia (from SBT network), this article aims to provide new analytical perspectives on the pleasures, meanings, and socio-political implications of the present trend of exposing the private lives of ordinary people. How does Casos de Familia connect to, or distance itself from, the parameters of melodrama and grotesque realism usually embraced by popular TV shows in Brazil? What values are privileged by the talk show? How do they connect to the construction of forms of subjectivity that are crucial to the exercise of power in contemporary society? These are key inter-related issues that we intend to answer. This article is part of a wider research project on the renewed strategies of incorporation and interpellation of the popular on TV.
