Transactional Memory (TM) has been considered as a promising alternative to existing synchronization operations, which are often the largest stumbling block to unleashing parallelism of applications. Efficient implementations of TM, however, are challenging due to the tension between lowering performance overhead and avoiding unnecessary aborts. In this paper, we present Reachability-based Optimistic Concurrency Control for Transactional Memory (ROCoCoTM), a novel scheme which offloads concurrency control (CC) algorithms, the central building blocks of TM systems, to reconfigurable hardware. To reduce the abort rate, an innovative formalization of mainstream CC algorithms is developed to reveal a common restriction that leads to unnecessary aborts. This restriction is resolved by the ROCoCo algorithm with a centralized validation phase, which can be efficiently pipelined in hardware. Thanks to a high-performance offloading engine implemented in reconfigurable hardware, ROCoCo algorithm results in decreased abort rates and reduced performance overhead. The whole system is implemented on Intel's HARP2 platform and evaluated with the STAMP benchmark suite. Experiments show 1.55x and 8.05x geomean speedup over TinySTM and an HTM based on Intel TSX, respectively. Given the fast-growing deployment of commodity CPU-FPGA platforms, ROCoCoTM paves the way for software programmers to exploit heterogeneous computing resources with a high-level transactional abstraction to effectively extract the parallelism in modern applications.
