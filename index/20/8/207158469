We describe a framework in which to consider designing an entire course for Computer Science majors that covers both technical communications as well as more general communication issues. By utilizing abstraction, we're able to fashion a framework that allows instructors to design specific course elements that meet their needs or priorities. We take advantage of many other efforts reported upon in the past that discuss processes that students can follow in developing effective communication artifacts, blend writing or speaking assignments into individual courses, or talk about communication-intensive courses.
