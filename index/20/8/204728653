Database applications typically undergo several schema changes during their life cycle due to performance and maintainability reasons. Such changes to the database schema not only require migrating the underlying data to a new schema, but also re-implementing large chunks of the application code that query and update the database. In this talk, Dillig will describe her recent work on programming languages support for evolving database applications. Specifically, she will first describe her work on verifying equivalence between database applications that operate over different schema, such as those that arise before and after schema refactoring. Next, she will describe how to use this verification procedure to solve the corresponding synthesis problem: That is, given a database application and a new schema, how can we automatically generate an equivalent program over this new schema?
