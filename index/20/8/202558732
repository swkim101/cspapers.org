In this paper, we present a modular robotic system to tackle the problem of generating and performing antipodal robotic grasps for unknown objects from the n-channel image of the scene. We propose a novel Generative Residual Convolutional Neural Network (GR-ConvNet) model that can generate robust antipodal grasps from n-channel input at real-time speeds (âˆ¼20ms). We evaluate the proposed model architecture on standard datasets and a diverse set of household objects. We achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 97.7% and 94.6% on Cornell and Jacquard grasping datasets, respectively. We also demonstrate a grasp success rate of 95.4% and 93% on household and adversarial objects, respectively, using a 7 DoF robotic arm.
