We use social media and WWW data to analyse international educational migration from Russia. We find substantial regional differences in migration patterns for three contrast directions: the Nordic countries, China and the Middle East. We built a model of migration flows with geographic distances to destination countries, various socio-demographic data and institutional characteristics of educational organisations.
