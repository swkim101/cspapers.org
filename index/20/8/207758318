Personalization plays a key role in electronic commerce, adjusting the products presented to users through search and recommendations according to their personality and tastes. Current personalization efforts focus on the adaptation of product selections, while the description of a given product remains the same regardless of the user who views it. In this work, we propose an approach to personalize product descriptions according to the personality of an individual user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of generating personalized product descriptions. We first learn to predict a user's personality based on past activity on an e-commerce website. Then, given a user personality, we propose an extractive summarization-based algorithm that selects the sentences to be used as part of a product description in accordance with the given personality. Our evaluation shows that user personality can be effectively learned from past e-commerce activity, while personalized descriptions can lead to a higher interest in the product and increased purchase likelihood.
