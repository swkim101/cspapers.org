Language designers and early adopters make different claims about their languages to differentiate them from others in order to attract users. Unfortunately, some of such claims are not supported by strong evidence. Moreover, the nature of languages as a special software tool makes it difficult to find objective measures to quantify and compare them per se. One approach to provide objective information about languages is empirical comparison. Hence, this research studies the usage and practice of programming languages based on mining modern, popular, existing software repositories in order to understand and characterize their effect on developing open source software. That is, to compare open source projects written in different languages to understand similarities and examine differences among them.
