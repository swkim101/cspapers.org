This paper presents a comprehensive, domain-driven framework for software development. It consists of a meta-programmable domain-specific modeling environment and a model transformation generator toolset based on graph transformations. The framework allows the creation of custom, domain-oriented programming environments that support end-user programmability. In addition, the framework could be considered an early, end-to-end implementation of the concepts advocated by the OMG's Model Driven Architecture initiative.
