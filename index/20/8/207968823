This work addresses the problem of 3D human shape reconstruction from point clouds. Considering that human shapes are of high dimensions and with large articulations, we adopt the state-of-the-art parametric human body model, SMPL, to reduce the dimension of learning space and generate smooth and valid reconstruction. However, SMPL parameters, especially pose parameters, are not easy to learn because of ambiguity and locality of the pose representation. Thus, we propose to incorporate skeleton awareness into the deep learning based regression of SMPL parameters for 3D human shape reconstruction. Our basic idea is to use the state-of-the-art technique PointNet++ to extract point features, and then map point features to skeleton joint features and finally to SMPL parameters for the reconstruction from point clouds. Particularly, we develop an end-to-end framework, where we propose a graph aggregation module to augment PointNet++ by extracting better point features, an attention module to better map unordered point features into ordered skeleton joint features, and a skeleton graph module to extract better joint features for SMPL parameter regression. The entire framework network is first trained in an end-to-end manner on synthesized dataset, and then online fine-tuned on unseen dataset with unsupervised loss to bridges gaps between training and testing. The experiments on multiple datasets show that our method is on par with the state-of-the-art solution.
