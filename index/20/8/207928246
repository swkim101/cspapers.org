We present a system for automatically extracting pertinent medical information from dialogues between clinicians and patients. The system parses each dialogue and extracts entities such as medications and symptoms, using context to predict which entities are relevant. We also classify the primary diagnosis for each conversation. In addition, we extract topic information and identify relevant utterances. This serves as a baseline for a system that extracts information from dialogues and automatically generates a patient note, which can be reviewed and edited by the clinician.
