With the increasing use of wearable devices equipped with various sensors, human activities, biometric information, and surrounding situations can be obtained via sensor data regardless of time and place. When position-free wearable devices are attached to an arbitrary part of the body, the attached position should be identified because the application process changes relative to the position. For systems that use multiple wearable devices to capture body-wide movement, estimating the attached position of the devices is meaningful. Most conventional studies estimate the loading position of the sensor using accelerometer and gyroscope data; therefore, users must perform specific motions so that each sensor produces values unique to the given position. We propose a method that estimates the load position of wearable devices without forcing the wearer to perform specific actions. The proposed method estimates the time difference between a heartbeat obtained by an electrocardiogram and a pulse wave obtained using a pulse sensor and classifies the sensor position from the estimated time difference. We assume that pulse sensor is embedded in the wearable devices to be attached to the user. From the results of an evaluation experiment with five subjects, an average F-measure of 0.805 was achieved over 15 body parts. The left ear and the right finger achieved an F-measure of 0.9+ when the proposed system uses data of approximately 20 seconds as an input.
