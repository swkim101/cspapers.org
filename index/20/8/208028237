This demo presents a distanceless networking approach for wireless sensor networks sparsely deployed in large areas. We implement the proposed scheme and deploy the sensor network in a large urban reservoir of 2.5km * 3.0km to monitor the field wind distribution. We show the in-field deployment procedure of the wind field measurement system and demonstrate the performance of the data collection protocol by a small testbed on site.
