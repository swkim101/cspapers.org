This volume contains the proceedings of the 2017 32nd Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS), held at Reykjavik University in Iceland from 20 to 23 June 2017. LICS is an annual international forum on the broad range of topics that lie at the intersection of computer science and mathematical logic. In addition to the main symposium, seven workshops were co-located with LICS 2017: • INFINITY: Verification of Infinite-State Systems • LearnAut: Learning and Automata • LCC: Logic and Computational Complexit • LMW: Logic Mentoring Workshop • LOLA: Syntax and Semantics of Low-Level Languages • Metafinite model theory and definability and complexity of numeric graph parameters • WiL: Women in Logic
