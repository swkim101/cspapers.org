This paper describes a new programming learning system. It consists of a Web-based flowchart application and Light Emitting Diode (LED) display kits. The LED kits produce various animations or static images according to a flow chart. The flowchart tool allows students to manipulate program elements through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Survey results show that the proposed system makes learning how to program less challenging and more interesting for beginners. Encouraged by these initial findings, the authors are developing a system with add-on features including sensor accessory options and compatibility with well known LEGOÂ® products.
