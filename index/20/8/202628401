To guide the design of interactive image annotation systems that generalize to new domains and applications, we need ways to evaluate the capabilities of new annotation tools across a range of different types of image, content, and task domains. In this work, we introduce Corsica, a test harness for image an- notation tools that uses calibration images to evaluate a tool's capabilities on general image properties and task requirements. Corsica is comprised of sets of three key components: 1) synthesized images with visual elements that are not domain- specific, 2) target microtasks that connects the visual elements and tools for evaluation, and 3) ground truth data for each mi- crotask and visual element pair. By introducing a specification for calibration images and microtasks, we aim to create an evolving repository that allows the community to propose new evaluation challenges. Our work aims to help facilitate the robust verification of image annotation tools and techniques.
