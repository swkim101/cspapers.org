We study ontology-mediated querying over probabilistic data for the case when the ontology is formulated in EL(hdr), an expressive member of the EL family of description logics. We leverage techniques that have been developed (i) for classical ontology-mediated querying and (ii) for probabilistic logic programming and provide an implementation based on our findings. We include both theoretical considerations and an experimental evaluation of our approach.
