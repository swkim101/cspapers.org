In this paper, we present an approach to generate robot motions for robust parts assembly. The computation of motions for parts assembly usually requires an exact model of all relevant objects. Generating detailed object models, including friction and dynamics, is often complex and time-consuming, especially in the context of elastic parts. In addition, executing motions on real hardware will usually introduce further uncertainty. For this reason, we propose an approach that is inherently robust against model parameter uncertainties and unknown characteristics of elastic parts. Our planner explicitly takes into account the internal states of articulated objects, as well as uncertain model parameters, by constructing a search tree in the belief-parameter-space. It yields successful assembly motions from coarse object models and thus eliminates the need for detailed parameter tuning. We evaluated our approach with respect to four assembly tasks. Extensive simulations show that our planner significantly increases the success-rate compared to previous approaches. Numerous experiments on a real robot confirm the simulated results.
