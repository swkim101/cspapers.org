When studying operating systems, students need to understand user-mode system interfaces (U), they need to learn about tools to monitor and measure OS behavior (M), and they finally should understand central implementation details of the OS kernel (K). Following the UMK approach, even complex projects such as modifying the memory management inside the Windows kernel can be carried out in an undergraduate OS curriculum.
 Here we concentrate on the kernel- and measurement part and present the Abstract Memory Management (AMM) project. AMM provides a framework for modifying the working set management in Windows while still hiding many implementation details of the kernel. AMM has been used in OS courses at U of Washington Bothell and HPI/U of Potsdam, Germany, with very good results.
 The AMM lab - together with other labs - is based on the Windows Research Kernel (WRK) as available in source from Microsoft. These labs complement our previously developed Curriculum Resource Kit (CRK) and are available for download.
