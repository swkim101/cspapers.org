We are delighted to join Ari Juels in welcoming you to the 13th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, held October 30 to November 3, 2006 at the Hilton Alexandria Mark Center, Alexandria, Virginia, USA. These proceedings contain 38 papers presented in the research track and a paper contributed by our keynote speaker, Peter Neumann. The conference also comprises an industry track, tutorials, and workshops.The 38 research track papers contained in this proceedings were selected from 256 received submissions. These submissions were carefully reviewed by at least three members of the program committee, or four in the case of papers authored by program committee members. Reviewing was double-blind, meaning that the program committee was not able to see the names and affiliations of the authors, and the authors were not told which committee members reviewed which papers. Program committee members were allowed to use external reviewers, but were responsible for the contents of the review and representing papers during the decision making. The review phase was followed by a three-week discussion phase in which each paper with at least one supporting review was discussed, outside experts were consulted where needed, and final decisions were made.
