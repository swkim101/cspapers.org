The approaches based on spatio-temporal features for video action recognition have emerged such as two-stream based methods and 3D convolution based methods. However, current methods suffer from the problems caused by partial observation, or restricted to single information modeling, and so on. Segment-level recognition results obtained from dense sampling can not represent the entire video and, therefore lead to partial observation. And a single model is hard to capture the complementary information on spacial, temporal and spatio-temporal information from video at the same time. Therefore, the challenge is to build the video-level representation and capture multiple information. In this paper, a video-level multi-model fusion action recognition method is proposed to solve these problems. Firstly, an efficient video-level 3D convolution model is proposed to get the global information in the video which assembling segment-level 3D convolution models. Secondly, a multi-model fusion architecture is proposed for video action recognition to capture multiple information. The spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal information are aggregate with SVM classifier. Experimental results show that this method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the datasets of UCF-101(97.6%) without pre-training on Kinetics.
