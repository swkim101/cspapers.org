Proof of Retrievability (PoR) and Provable Data Possession (PDP) schemes have been proposed to ensure the integrity of stored data on untrusted servers. A successful PoR audit ensures, with high probability, that every piece of stored data is recoverable by the server. Most PoR schemes proposed have focused on bandwidth and computation cost, but in some deployment scenarios the size of remote storage can be the most expensive factor. We propose a simple PoR scheme which is a variant on some existing PDP work. Compared to existing audit routines, the server computation cost and bandwidth are higher, but the server storage cost is minimal. Our preliminary work indicates that deploying this scheme may be less costly in commercial cloud settings, depending on the cost structure and frequency of audits.
