Digital voice assistants or smart speakers have rapidly changed the landscape of voice user interfaces
over the past few years. In this paper we discuss how we could utilise the affordances of these devices
to create a novel crowdsourcing platform that deliver crowd tasks through voice with particular focus
on creative tasks. We describe the potential benefits and challenges of using this technology for these
purposes, and outline our future work in this research area
