In robotics and computer vision, there are many inference problems that come down to fusing the information from many different sensors, or a small number of sensors deployed over time. Dellaert will review how these and other problems can be posed in terms of factor graphs, which provide a graphical language in which to develop and collaborate on such problems. The talk will emphasize the advantages and intuition that come with these graphical languages, leading to both offline and online sensor fusion algorithms. One of Frank Dellaertâ€™s current research directions is exploring the use of code generation to create high-performance, certifiable code to support autonomous systems in the real world.
