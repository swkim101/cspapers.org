Cyber physical systems (CPS) typically contain multiple control loops, where the controllers use actuators to trigger a physical process, based on sensor readings. Attackers typically coordinate attack with multiple corrupted devices; defenses often focus on detecting this abnormal communication. We present the first provably-covert channel from a 'covertly-transmitting sensor' to a 'covertly-receiving actuator', interacting only indirectly, via a benign threshold-based controller. The covert devices cannot be practically distinguished from benign devices. The covert traffic is encoded within the output noise of the covertly-transmitting sensor, whose distribution is indistinguishable from that of a benign sensor (with comparable specifications). We evaluated the channel, showing its applicability for signaling and coordinating attacks between the sensor and the actuator. This capability requires to re-evaluate security monitoring and preventing systems in CPS.
