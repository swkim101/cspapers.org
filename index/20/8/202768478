The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has recently received tremendous interests for distributed large scale optimization in machine learning, statistics, multi-agent networks and related applications. In this paper, we propose a new parallel multi-block stochastic ADMM for distributed stochastic optimization, where each node is only required to perform simple stochastic gradient descent updates. The proposed ADMM is fully parallel, can solve problems with arbitrary block structures, and has a convergence rate comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art ADMM methods for stochastic optimization. Existing stochastic (or deterministic) ADMMs require each node to exchange its updated primal variables across nodes at each iteration and hence cause significant amount of communication overhead. Existing ADMMs require roughly the same number of inter-node communication rounds as the number of in-node computation rounds. In contrast, the number of communication rounds required by our new ADMM is only the square root of the number of computation rounds.
