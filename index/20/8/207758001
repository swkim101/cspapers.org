Data driven Knowledge Graph is rapidly adapted by different societies. Many open domain and specific domain knowledge graphs have been constructed, and many industries have benefited from knowledge graph. Currently, enterprise related knowledge graph is classified as specific domain, but the applications span from solving a narrow specific problem to Enterprise Knowledge Management system. With the digital transform of traditional industry, Enterprise knowledge becomes more and more complicated, it involves knowledge from common domain, multiple specific domains, and corporate-specific in general. This tutorial provides an overview of current Enterprise Knowledge Graph(EKG). It distinguishes the EKG from specific domain according to the knowledge it covers, and provides the examples to illustrate the difference between EKG and specific domain KG. The tutorial further summarizes EKG into three types: Specific Business Task Enterprise KG, Specific Business Unit Enterprise KG and Cross Business Unit Enterprise KG, and illustrates the characteristics, steps, challenges, and future research in constructing and consuming of each of these three types of EKG .
