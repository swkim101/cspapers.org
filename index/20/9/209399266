A new visual notation is proposed for precisely expressing constraints in object-orie models, as an alternative to mathematical logic notation used in methods such as Syntropy an ysis. The notation is intuitive, expressive, integrates well with existing visual notations, and ha clear and unambiguous semantics. It has similarities with informal diagrams used by mathema for illustrating relations and borrows much from Venn diagrams. It may be viewed as a generali of instance diagrams.
