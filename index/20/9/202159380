In this paper, we examine the effect of wrinkling and bending generated in coils when used in wearable devices and investigate how they affect the wireless power supply system. A wrinkle is modeled as a semi-cylindrical deformation in a coil, and a bend is modeled as the deformation of an entire coil plane. The effect of these deformations w evaluated by simulation. The result showed that the maximum efficiency is decreased by both deformations, and wrinkling decreases average efficiency more than bending. In addition, efficiency decreases more from multiple wrinkles than from one bigger wrinkle.
