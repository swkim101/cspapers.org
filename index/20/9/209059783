This paper, studies human poses classification and human body movement. It was built a convolutional neural network to approach the problem of classification, who they were defined 6 ideal poses to classify. The approach has the advantage of reasoning about pose in a controlled, with an 84.78% of precision. For each pose, a descriptor was located in an area of the human body, were the movement is high. The different descriptors was located in head, torso, arms and legs, were the activity recognition approach an 82.35% of precision.
