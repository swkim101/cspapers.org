A gesture, as the term is used here, is a handmade mark used to give a command to a computer. The attributes of the gesture (its location, size, extent, orientation, and dynamic properties) can be mapped to parameters of the command. An operation, operands, and parameters can all be communicated simultaneously with a single, intuitive, easily drawn gesture. This makes gesturing an attractive interaction teehnique. ~pically, agestural interactions completed (e.g. the styIus is lifted) before the the gesture is classified, its attributes computed, and the intended command performed. There is no opportunity for the interactive manipulation of parameters in the presence of application feedback that is typical of drag operations indirect manipulation interfaces. This lack of continuous feedback during the interaction makes the use of gestures awkward for tasks that require such feedback, The video presents a two-phase interaction technique that combines gesture and direct manipulation. A two-phase interaction begins with a gesture, which is recognized during the interaction (e.g. while the stylus is still touching the writing surface). After recognition, the application is informed and the interaction continues, allowing the user to manipulate parameters interactively, The result is a powerful interaction which combines the advantages of gesturing and direct manipulation.
