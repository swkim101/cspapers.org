Motion retargeting between heterogeneous polymorphs with different sizes and kinematic configurations requires a comprehensive knowledge of (inverse) kinematics. Moreover, it is non-trivial to provide a kinematic independent general solution. In this study, we developed a cyclic three-phase optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning for human-robot motion retargeting. The motion retargeting learning is performed using refined data in a latent space by the cyclic and filtering paths of our method. In addition, the human- in-the-loop based three-phase approach provides a framework for the improvement of the motion retargeting policy by both quantitative and qualitative manners. Using the proposed C- 3PO method, we were successfully able to learn the motion retargeting skill between the human skeleton and motion of the multiple robots such as NAO, Pepper, Baxter and C-3PO.
