The Great Hanshin-Awaji (Kobe) earthquake killed more than 6500 on January 17, 1995. Many people barely escaped from the debris and actively saved buried people. Rescue facilities are really important for robust social systems. Robotics and mechatronics are effective for advanced rescue equipment and systems. However, there has been little research and development performed until now. In order for robotics researchers to start, analysis of the tasks and requirements is necessary. In this research, the processes of rescue activities just after the disaster were investigated. Specifications of rescue robotic facilities are proposed on the basis of the analysis.
