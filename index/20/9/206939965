An essential task for a multiple autonomous mobile robot system is to search for and to gather objects. To accomplish such a task effectively, it is essential that all the agents share common information on locations of objects, comrade agents and the place to deposit the objects. The authors have proposed a method called "COMPASS" to realize this only using two functions of each agent-to estimate the location of the objects by dead reckoning and to exchange the information with each other by one to one bidirectional proximity communication. In the paper, a new concept "figure of confidence (FOC)" is introduced to the COMPASS for higher performance and additional capability. The FOC is a self-estimated measure for accuracy of information in each agent. Using the FOC, agents can accelerate information sharing and handle multiple objects without significantly increasing complexity of the algorithm. The validity of FOC is confirmed through computer simulations.
