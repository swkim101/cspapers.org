The mobile humanoid Rollin'Justin is a versatile experimental platform for research in manipulation tasks. Previously, different state of the art control methods and first autonomous task execution scenarios have been demonstrated. In this video two new applications with challenging task requirements are presented. One is the catching of one or even two flying balls using all of Justin's degrees of freedom. The other is the autonomous preparation of coffee. Both applications need adequate sensors to support local referencing. The required precision in position and timing is realized in software, using the sensor information, taking the varying precision of Justin's kinematic sub-chains into account and handling all timings in sub-millisecond range.
