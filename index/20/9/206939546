Recently, the artificial "sensitive skin" concept, which incorporates intelligent, flexible large area sensor arrays along with software and data processing capabilities, has been proposed. In this paper, we report on fabrication, characterization and properties of polycrystalline semiconductor and metal films and thin-film structures chemically deposited on large area flexible substrates at low temperatures (close to room temperature). This technology will find applications for the development of the "sensitive skin". Examples are discussed using CdSe and Cu/sub x/S films.
