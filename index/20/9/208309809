Robust estimation of camera motion under the presence of outlier noise is a fundamental problem in robotics and computer vision. Despite existing efforts that focus on detecting motion and scene degeneracies, the best existing approach that builds on Random Consensus Sampling (RANSAC) still has non-negligible failure rate. Since a single failure can lead to the failure of the entire visual simultaneous localization and mapping, it is important to further improve the robust estimation algorithm. We propose a new robust camera motion estimator (RCME) by incorporating two main changes: a model-sample consistency test at the model instantiation step and an inlier set quality test that verifies model-inlier consistency using differential entropy. We have implemented our RCME algorithm and tested it under many public datasets. The results have shown a consistent reduction in failure rate when comparing to the RANSAC-based Gold Standard approach and two recent variations of RANSAC methods.
