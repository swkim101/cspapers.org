Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious disorder in which people repeatedly stop breathing during sleep. This paper presents the Technology Integrated Apnea Respiration Analyser (TIARA), an innovative wearable device as an alternative to polysomnography (PSG) that has the potential to enable cost-effective and repeated overnight tests of OSA even in a home environment. PSG normally collects bio-signals such as brain waves, oxygen saturation, heart rate in a controlled environment (e.g. sleep lab) to diagnose sleep disorders. Here we present the design and development of the TIARA device and demonstrate its potential to perform as well as PSG at differentiating sleep and wake states and different phases of sleep, based on machine learning models.
