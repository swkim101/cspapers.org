Inverted-F antenna elements are proposed to design a platform-mounted antenna at HF band. Due to utilizing the inverted-F antenna elements to design the platform-mounted antennas, the complexity is significantly reduced because impedance matching capacitances are no need while the expected radiation pattern of the platform-mounted antenna are obtained. High efficiencies of the inverted-F antenna elements can be also achieved almost close to 100%. Moreover, the characteristic mode theory is used to analyze the radiation pattern of the platform-mounted antenna.
