Deep learning has thrived by training on large-scale datasets. However, in robotics applications sample efficiency is critical. We propose a novel adaptive masked proxies method that constructs the final segmentation layer weights from few labelled samples. It utilizes multi-resolution average pooling on base embeddings masked with the label to act as a positive proxy for the new class, while fusing it with the previously learned class signatures. Our method is evaluated on PASCAL-$5^i$ dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art in the few-shot semantic segmentation. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require a second branch to estimate parameters or prototypes, which enables it to be used with 2-stream motion and appearance based segmentation networks. We further propose a novel setup for evaluating continual learning of object segmentation which we name incremental PASCAL (iPASCAL) where our method outperforms the baseline method.
