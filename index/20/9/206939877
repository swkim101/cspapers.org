A fuzzy behavior-based system, which act as a planning system, is realized for the task control of a six-degree of freedom PUMA robot manipulator. A fuzzy behavior control system that was applied to a three-link manipulator by Dassanayake et al. (1999) is modified as a planning system for the PUMA robot. Fuzzy behavior elements are trained by a genetic algorithm. This has been conducted for three behavior groups namely objective behavior group, free behavior group and reactive behavior group. Simulation has been carried out for the PUMA robot to reach a target from a given point while avoiding an obstacle. Result shows that the fuzzy behavior based approach can be applied to plan the manipulator's joint angles and angular velocities to reach a particular point while avoiding obstacles.
