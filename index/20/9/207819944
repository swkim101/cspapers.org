Our cloud based Smart Order Online System is a cloud based and context-aware online retailing system with real time updates. It is designed to verify our framework and handle the operations of various types of e-commerce business. It is aimed at helping customers to obtain order information through cloud based platforms such as mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers. The system allows customers to place orders, to find location and direction to branches, and allows managers to track the delivering driversâ€™ locations and display them on the map. The clustering/grouping algorithm plays a very important role in our framework. It is also discussed in the paper.
