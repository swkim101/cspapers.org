Wt? provide a new approach for analyzing both static and dynamic randomized load balancing strategies. We demonstrate the approach by providing the first analysis of the following model: customers arrive as a Poisson stream of rate ;\n, X < 1, at a collection of n servers. Each customer chooses some constant d servers independently and uniformly at random from the n servers, and waits.for sewice at the one with the fewest customers. Customers are served according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) protocol, and the sewice time for a customer is exponentially distributed with mean I. We call this problem the supermarket model. We wish to know how the system behaves, and in particular we are interested the expected time a customer spends in the system in equilibrium. The model provides a good abstraction of a :rimple, eficient load balancing scheme in the setting where jobs arrive at a large system of parallel processors. This model appears more realistic than similar models studied p,reviously, in that it is both dynamic and open: that is, customers arrive over time, and the number of customers is notjixed. Our approach consists of two distinct stages: we first develop a limiting, deterministic model representing the behavior as n -+ 00, and then show how to translate results from this model to results for large, but$nite, values of n. The analysis of the deterministic model is interesting in its own ,right. This methodology proves effective for studying a number of similar problems, and simulations demonstrate that fhe method accurately predicts system behavior even for relatively small systems.
