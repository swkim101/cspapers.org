In this paper we propose a robust visual tracking method by casting tracking as a sparse approximation problem in a particle filter framework. In this framework, occlusion, corruption and other challenging issues are addressed seamlessly through a set of trivial templates. Specifically, to find the tracking target at a new frame, each target candidate is sparsely represented in the space spanned by target templates and trivial templates. The sparsity is achieved by solving an â„“1-regularized least squares problem. Then the candidate with the smallest projection error is taken as the tracking target. After that, tracking is continued using a Bayesian state inference framework in which a particle filter is used for propagating sample distributions over time. Two additional components further improve the robustness of our approach: 1) the nonnegativity constraints that help filter out clutter that is similar to tracked targets in reversed intensity patterns, and 2) a dynamic template update scheme that keeps track of the most representative templates throughout the tracking procedure. We test the proposed approach on five challenging sequences involving heavy occlusions, drastic illumination changes, and large pose variations. The proposed approach shows excellent performance in comparison with three previously proposed trackers.
