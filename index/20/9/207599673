A difficult problem in networking courses is to find hands-on projects that have the right balance between the level of realism and complexity. This is especially true for projects that focus on the internal functionality of routers and other network devices. We developed a capstone course called "Network Design and Evaluation" that uses a network processor-based platform for networking projects. This platform is more realistic than traditional approaches based on software emulation environments or PC-based routers running Unix, but it is significantly less complex to work with than real commercial routers or even PC-based routers. We are currently teaching this course for the third year, and our experience has been extremely positive. Students enjoy the realism of the platform and not only learn a lot about the internal operation of the network, but also about network configuration and management.
