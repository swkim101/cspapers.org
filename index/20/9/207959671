Sharding-based consensus protocols were introduced to enable the parallelization of the consensus work and storage for blockchain systems. However, existing sharding-based consensus algorithms are not sufficiently designed for distributing miners and transactions to shards in a fair and secure manner, which would make the blockchain systems vulnerable to several attacks. To overcome such limitations of the existing sharding-based consensus protocols, we present a new sharding-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain protocol using fair and dynamic sharding management. To show the security of the proposed consensus protocol, we numerically analyze attack probabilities and found that the proposed protocol is secure when the number of shards is less than or equal to 6. Moreover, the proposed protocol is approximately 186 times more efficient than Ethereum with the real parameter settings obtained by the Ethereum network.
