The lack of real innovation is one of the problems the fashion system suffers from. But there is so much interesting mathematics available now, with such deep meanings, that it is a shame not to exploit it, or at least seriously try. We are interested in the aesthetic reasons, finding new forms and exploiting new types of algorithmic approaches, mixed with innovative mathematics and digital production tools. In this paper we explain how we modified a mathematical principle so that it can be applied in garments. This principle is the most famous fractal: Mandelbrot. We present 2 garments based on modified Mandelbrot principles. The lemniscates lines are used as the stitching seams to create interesting volumes. The garments are realized via an alternating process between sublimation printing, draping, first-person on-body fitting, pinning, stitching, digital pattern making and hand / laser cutting. Designers of wearables are more open to innovation than the fashion industry. That is why we address this community first. We hope to inspire the wearable community to apply more interesting and innovative methods to develop their garments via this interesting look at how data can be used to develop aesthetics and forms. The connection to wearable technology - as in electronics integrated in garments - is not there, but makes a case for it being an example of wearable algorithms. In future this might enable advanced production processes for wearable technology.
