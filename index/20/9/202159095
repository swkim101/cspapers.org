Proficiency in any form of reading requires a considerable amount of practice. With exposure, people get better at recognising words, because they develop strategies that enable them to read faster. This paper describes a study investigating recognition of words encoded with a 6-channel vibrotactile display. We train 22 users to recognise ten letters of the English alphabet. Additionally, we repeatedly expose users to 12 words in the form of training and reinforcement testing. Then, we test participants on exposed and unexposed words to observe the effects of exposure to words. Our study shows that, with exposure to words, participants did significantly improve on recognition of exposed words. The findings suggest that such a word exposure technique could be used during the training of novice users in order to boost the word recognition of a particular dictionary of words.
