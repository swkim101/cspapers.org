We provide upper and lower bounds for the length of controlled bad sequences over the majoring and the minoring orderings of finite sets of Nd. The results are obtained by bounding the length of such sequences by functions from the Cichon hierarchy. This allows us to translate these results to bounds over the fast-growing complexity classes. The obtained bounds are proven to be tight for the majoring ordering, which solves a problem left open by Abriola, Figueira and Senno (Theor. Comp. Sci, Vol. 603). Finally, we use the results on controlled bad sequences to prove upper bounds for the emptiness problem of some classes of automata.
