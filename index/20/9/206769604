Our objective is to obtain a state-of-the art object category detector by employing a state-of-the-art image classifier to search for the object in all possible image sub-windows. We use multiple kernel learning of Varma and Ray (ICCV 2007) to learn an optimal combination of exponential Ï‡2 kernels, each of which captures a different feature channel. Our features include the distribution of edges, dense and sparse visual words, and feature descriptors at different levels of spatial organization.
