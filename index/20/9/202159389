Humans are capable of identifying and categorizing objects in their environment with the aid of their sensory organs. DualSkin is a wearable which equips the user with ambient electric field sensing. The aim of the project is to develop a new sense that will increase peripersonal space, alter the human perception and their relationship between electronic, organic and inorganic objects that surrounds our lives. Dual-Skin is a vest that uses a circuit which consists of embedded micro-controllers, sensors, and actuators. It uses capacitive sensors to sense surroundings and uses electrical stimulation as a feedback mechanism around the user's waist.
