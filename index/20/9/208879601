Developing advanced healthcare applications to cater to the requirements of an ever-growing population has become one of the key areas of research in engineering. One major application in this area is medical video streaming, which is often used for remote monitoring of patients. Medical video streaming helps to overcome geographical barriers and offers medical services at the convenience of the patient. However, as medical videos carry critical and time-sensitive information, retaining the quality and reducing latency during transmission is paramount for accurate medical diagnosis. This paper presents the concept of effective medical video streaming, which incorporates novel methods in video pre-processing, video compression, and transmission of medical data over optical networks.
