With the rise of photo-sharing websites such as Facebook and Flickr has come dramatic growth in the number of photographs online. Recent research in object recognition has used such sites as a source of image data, but the test images have been selected and labeled by hand, yielding relatively small validation sets. In this paper we study image classification on a much larger dataset of 30 million images, including nearly 2 million of which have been labeled into one of 500 categories. The dataset and categories are formed automatically from geotagged photos from Flickr, by looking for peaks in the spatial geotag distribution corresponding to frequently-photographed landmarks. We learn models for these landmarks with a multiclass support vector machine, using vector-quantized interest point descriptors as features. We also explore the non-visual information available on modern photo-sharing sites, showing that using textual tags and temporal constraints leads to significant improvements in classification rate. We find that in some cases image features alone yield comparable classification accuracy to using text tags as well as to the performance of human observers.
