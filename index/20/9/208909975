We suggest a generative model of 2D and 3D natural textures with diversity, visual fidelity and at high computational efficiency. This is enabled by a family of methods that extend ideas from classic stochastic procedural texturing (Perlin noise) to learned, deep, non-linearities. Our model encodes all exemplars from a diverse set of textures without a need to be re-trained for each exemplar. Applications include texture interpolation, and learning 3D textures from 2D exemplars.
