In this paper, we propose a level-aware progressive network (LAP-Net) for single image dehazing. Unlike previous multi-stage algorithms that generally learn in a coarse-to-fine fashion, each stage of LAP-Net learns different levels of haze with different supervision. Then the network can progressively learn the gradually aggravating haze. With this design, each stage can focus on a region with specific haze level and restore clear details. To effectively fuse the results of varying haze levels at different stages, we develop an adaptive integration strategy to yield the final dehazed image. This strategy is achieved by a hierarchical integration scheme, which is in cooperation with the memory network and the domain knowledge of dehazing to highlight the best-restored regions of each stage. Extensive experiments on both real-world images and two dehazing benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
