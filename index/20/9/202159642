We present the system CoRSA to incorporate integrated sensors in millimeter-scale packages for continuous cardiorespiratory (CR) evaluation in sports activities. CoRSA retrofits trending sports apparel to add on CR sensing capability. The system uses an air pressure sensor inside a vented mask to approximate a spirometer, and an earlobe pulse-oximeter (PO) to monitor heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2). CoRSA also includes an inertial measurement unit for tracking activity and future study on motion artifact correction on the CR signals in active sports. An aerobic exercise evaluation is also performed which shows results similar to sports studies using bulkier conventional medical equipment in the CR signals' characteristics.
