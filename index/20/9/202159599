We present the design and prototype of the Linn Dress, a transforming dress that allows its wearer to dynamically reveal and conceal areas of skin, as they feel comfortable and appropriate for different contexts. Electrochromic displays are employed as the elements enabling the garment's dynamic transparency. The Linn Dress is designed for office workers with a lively lifestyle, who shift directly from the work environment to social evening events. The dress presents professional working attire, and when transformed to reveal exciting open cuts and patterns, a cocktail dress.
