Investigating the human aspect of software development is becoming prominent in current research. Studies found that the misalignment between the social and technical dimensions of software work leads to losses in developer productivity and defects. We use the technical and social dependencies among pairs of developers to predict the success of a software build. Using the IBM Jazz#8482; data we found information about developers and their social and technical relation can build a powerful predictor for the success of a software build. Investigating human aspects of software development is becoming prominent in current research. High misalignment between the social and technical dimensions of software work lowers productivity and quality.
