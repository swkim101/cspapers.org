The IKEA Furniture Assembly Environment is one of the first benchmarks for testing and accelerating the automation of long-horizon and hierarchical manipulation tasks. The environment is designed to advance reinforcement learning and imitation learning from simple toy tasks to complex tasks requiring both long-term planning and sophisticated low-level control. Our environment features 60 furniture models, 6 robots, photorealistic rendering, and domain randomization. We evaluate reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods on the proposed environment. Our experiments show furniture assembly is a challenging task due to its long horizon and sophisticated manipulation requirements, which provides ample opportunities for future research. The environment is publicly available at https://clvrai.com/furniture.
