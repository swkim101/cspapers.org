Connections to international distributed networks, and the Internet in particular, are no longer a luxury for many organizations. As these networks continue to grow, the need for security services will increase and become more complex. At the same time, this connectivity provides potential intruders with greater access to both other systems and other intruders. Sophisticated attacks which were once scarce due to the relatively small number of intruders able to mount them, have increased greatly because of the sharing of toolkits that implement the attacks. Increasingly, the very infrastructure of the networks is being attacked and flaws exploited. Although much research has been done in network security and much practical experience is available, that knowledge has yet to be widely deployed and used.
