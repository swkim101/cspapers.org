As proud co-chairs of the 6th workshop on Automation of Software Test, we would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to AST2011 and to thank all participants for taking the time out from their busy lives and the work in their home countries to make the effort to attend this workshop. 
 
The theme of this year's workshop, aligned with the ICSE 2011 conference theme, is Relating Software Design to Test Automation. The theme covers several prominent perspectives both in Software Design and Automation of Software Test practice. The broad scope of AST is reflected in the wide range of topics covered by the 36 submissions that we received. Of these, with the 32 members of the AST Program Committee from both academic and industrial research labs, we selected 15 regular research papers that are grouped into six sessions, representing a diversity of test automation related topics. The six sessions are: 
Model-Based Testing 
Testing for Web and Service-Based Systems 
Testing Strategies I and II 
Application of Testing I and II 
 
 
 
The schedule of the two workshop days will be intensive yet productive. Besides the six regular paper sessions, we will have two poster sessions covering promising ongoing research work in test automation. The program of each day will start from a prominent keynote speech, one from academy and the other from industry. A multi-day charette on the key near-term challenges in relating software architecture and automated software test will be the highlight of this workshop. On the first day, the participants will identify challenges related to software architecture support for testing and divide into teams of a half dozen people. Each team will take up one of the related questions and create a feasible near-term research pathway to effectively address it. On the second day, each team will finalize a presentation on their challenge and pathway, and will then present their ideas to the workshop as a whole.
