This project explores ways to augment the sense of awareness. The human senses are exceptional, this project attempts to empower them in order to augment the senses further. The project aim is to elevate the senses by deleting distractions. Although the main sense that has been augmented is awareness, the project is offering a device for the other senses to operate better. There has been substantial progress in measuring the level of awareness, however is it not known of any instrument or precise method for the possibility to measure the contents of awareness directly (Seth et al. 2008). The current methodology suggests verbal reporting for the most direct method used to find out the level of a person's awareness of some specific knowledge.
