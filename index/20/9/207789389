Deep neural network representations play an important role in computer vision, speech, computational linguistics, robotics, reinforcement learning and many other data-rich domains. In this talk I will show that learning-to-learn and compositionality are key ingredients for dealing with knowledge transfer so as to solve a wide range of tasks, for dealing with small-data regimes, and for continual learning. I will demonstrate this with several examples from my research team: learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent, neural programmers and interpreters, and learning communication.
