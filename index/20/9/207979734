Recent research in 4D saliency detection is limited by the deficiency of a large-scale 4D light field dataset. To address this, we introduce a new dataset to assist the subsequent research in 4D light field saliency detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is to date the largest light field dataset in which the dataset provides 1465 all-focus images with human-labeled ground truth masks and the corresponding focal stacks for every light field image. To verify the effectiveness of the light field data, we first introduce a fusion framework which includes two CNN streams where the focal stacks and all-focus images serve as the input. The focal stack stream utilizes a recurrent attention mechanism to adaptively learn to integrate every slice in the focal stack, which benefits from the extracted features of the good slices. Then it is incorporated with the output map generated by the all-focus stream to make the saliency prediction. In addition, we introduce adversarial examples by adding noise intentionally into images to help train the deep network, which can improve the robustness of the proposed network. The noise is designed by users, which is imperceptible but can fool the CNNs to make the wrong prediction. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model on the popular evaluation metrics. The proposed method performs favorably compared with the existing 2D, 3D and 4D saliency detection methods on the proposed dataset and existing LFSD light field dataset. The code and results can be found at https://github.com/OIPLab-DUT/ ICCV2019_Deeplightfield_Saliency. Moreover, to facilitate research in this field, all images we collected are shared in a ready-to-use manner.
