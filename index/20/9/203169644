We present an end-to-end learned system for fusing multiple misaligned photographs of the same scene into a chosen target view. We demonstrate three use cases: 1) color transfer for inferring color for a monochrome view, 2) HDR fusion for merging misaligned bracketed exposures, and 3) detail transfer for reprojecting a high definition image to the point of view of an affordable VR180-camera. While the system can be trained end-to-end, it consists of three distinct steps: feature extraction, image warping and fusion. We present a novel cascaded feature extraction method that enables us to synergetically learn optical flow at different resolution levels. We show that this significantly improves the networkâ€™s ability to learn large disparities. Finally, we demonstrate that our alignment architecture outperforms a state-of-the art optical flow network on the image warping task when both systems are trained in an identical manner.
