Awe is a heightened emotional state of fear and wonder that creates a physiological response resulting in a cascade of hairs standing on end, also known as piloerection or goose-bumps. This latent sense once served an animalian purpose of survival, but now lies dormant and is often not experienced consciously. In fact, 55 percent of the population reports to not feel this sensation that is noted to be healthy. The AWE Goosebumps artifact is an emotion prosthesis that animates the latent sensation of awe for embodiment and externalizes cues for communication. As the sensation is not experienced consciously, the techno fashion invites an opportunity to be a second skin for frisson biofeedback, behavior training, and expression to others as a tool to transform the doldrums of modern day to performative states of wonder.
