In this paper we present an approach to designing wearer-centered biotelemetry for non-human (and human) animal wearers. Drawing from fundamental values and principles of user-centered design, we describe a wearer-centered framework to heuristically establish design requirements, which was used during a series of workshops to perform a requirements analysis for a cat-tracking device. The resulting requirements informed a feline-centered prototype whose wearability was evaluated with cat wearers. Compared to the wearability of previously tested off-the-shelf devices, our findings show an improvement and suggest that our framework-based approach can help design teams with a range of skills to systematically design for wearability.
