Existing works on control of tractor-trailers systems only consider the kinematics model without taking dynamics into account. Also, most of them treat the issue as a pure control theory problem whose solutions are difficult to implement. This paper presents a trajectory tracking control approach for a full-scale industrial tractor-trailers vehicle composed of a carlike tractor and arbitrary number of passive full trailers. To deal with dynamic effects of trailing units, a force sensor is innovatively installed at the connection between the tractor and the first trailer to measure the forces acting on the tractor. The tractorâ€™s dynamic model that explicitly accounts for the measured forces is derived. A tracking controller that compensates the pulling/pushing forces in real time and simultaneously drives the system onto desired trajectories is proposed. The propulsion map between throttle opening and the propulsion force is proposed to be modeled with a fifth-order polynomial. The parameters are estimated by fitting experimental data, in order to provide accurate driving force. Stability of the control algorithm is rigorously proved by Lyapunov methods. Experiments of full-size vehicles are conducted to validate the performance of the control approach.
