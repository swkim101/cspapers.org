In real-time systems, FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) is playing and potentially going to play a more important role. Priority-based (preemptive) FRP (P-FRP), a variant of FRP with more real-time characteristics, demands more research in its scheduling and timing analysis. Its abort-and-restart nature indicates that reducing preemptions can be critical for improving system performance. In this paper, we present a non-work conserving scheduling model, Deferred Start, to reduce certain preemptions. Experiments show the improvement on schedulability and task response time.
