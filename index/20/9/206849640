In this article we show that the concept of screws and wrenches gives us tools to geometrically establish the relation between the ground reaction wrench and the Zero-Moment Point. In order to arrive at this, we show how a wrench can be decomposed into separate components. The proposed method gives a general, completely coordinate-free way to find the ZMP and contributes in improving the geometrical insight.
