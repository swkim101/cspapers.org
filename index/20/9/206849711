We report on the design and the experimental results of DustCart, a wheeled autonomous robot for door-to-door garbage collection. DustCart is able to navigate in urban environments avoiding static and dynamic obstacles and to interact with human users. The robot is managed by an Ambient Intelligence system (AmI) through a wireless connection: it navigates to collect garbage bags to the houses of users and then moves to discharge the collected waste to a dedicated area. The architecture, navigation and localization systems are described along with the results achieved in different urban sites. In particular, a localization approach based on optical beacons was used and guaranteed position errors sufficient for a safe robot navigation. We report also the first results of a long-term experimentation of the DustCart robot in Peccioli, a small town of Tuscany (Italy). This can be considered as a first step in using robotics in the everyday life of a real town for providing a real service.
