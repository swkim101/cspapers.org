Telepresence takes place when a user is afforded the experience of being in a remote environment or a virtual world, through the use of immersive technologies. The development of a humanoid robot and a control apparatus that correlates the operator's movements, and provides sufficient sensory feedback, encompass efforts to create such immersive technologies. This paper considers the control mechanisms that afford telepresence, the requirements for continuous or extended telepresence control, and the health implications of engaging in complex time-constrained tasks. We present the Telesuit - a full-body telepresence control system used to operate a humanoid telepresence robot. The suit is part of a larger system that considers the physical constraints of controlling a dexterous bimanual robotic torso, and the need for modular hardware and software that allow for high-fidelity immserviness. It incorporates a health-monitoring system that allows the robotic platform to leverage information such as respiratory effort, galvanic skin response, and heart rate, to adjust the telepresence experience and apply control modalities that automate manipulation tasks. Furthermore, the design of the garment considers both functionality and aesthetics, and sets preface for future implementations of wearable telepresence control systems that integrate into the Internet of Actions (IoA) - allowing operators to interchangeably transition between the physical world and mixed-reality or virtual worlds.
