A user creates a Shoebox into which photographs (or other images) may be placed. These can be grouped by the user into "rolls" of arbitrary size. Functions are supplied to correct basic colour properties, rotate images, and send the photographs to any image manipulation tools for further editing. Photographs may be printed, sent via email, or published as a set of web pages together with their accompanying annotations.
