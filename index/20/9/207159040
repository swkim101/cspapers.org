The amount of software in cars grows exponentially. Driving forces of this development are cheaper and more powerful hardware and the demand for innovations by new functions. The rapid increase of software and software based functionality brings various challenges (see [21], [23], [25], [26]) for the automotive industries, for their organization, key competencies, processes, methods, tools, models, product structures, division of work, logistics, maintenance, and long term strategies. From a software engineering perspective, the automotive industry is an ideal and fascinating application domain for advanced techniques. Although the automotive industry may adopt general results and solutions from the software engineering body of knowledge gained in other domains, the specific constraints and domain specific requirements in the automotive industry ask for individual solutions and bring various challenges for automotive software engineering. In cars we find literally all interesting problems and challenging issues of software and systems engineering.
