We introduce a unary “self-synchronization” operation on concurrent processes that synchronizes concurrent transitions within a process. Standard parallel synchronization and communicating action refinement operations can be reduced to simple combinations of self-synchronization and unsynchronized noncommunicating operations. We show that modifying familiar fully abstract process semantics so that ac
