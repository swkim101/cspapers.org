An induction heating apparatus comprising a static power converter operative to produce high-frequency power from low-frequency power and a heating unit to produce a time-varying magnetic field in response to the high-frequency power. The power converter includes a switching circuit and control means for triggering at high frequency during an incipient stage of operation of the apparatus and lower frequency varying according to the input power to the power converter and the load of the heating unit after the incipient stage.
