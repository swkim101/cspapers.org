This paper describes a strategy of a mobile robot walkway following using color image. There are different colors in a walkway and lawn area along side the walkway. The walkway area is extracted by an image processing using the difference of color. The robot moves to the direction of vanishing point which is obtained from the image processing. Repeating these processes, the walkway following will be accomplished.
