Walking robots are useful for uneven terrain where wheels or crawlers are unsuitable. The biped robot is a kind of walking robot that we can use under human-live environments. There are many research works on biped robots. The biped robots need ability to adapt itself to uneven or non-horizontal plane if we want to use them in our environment although the robots walked on flat horizontal plane or fixed inclined plane in most of these works. In this paper, we propose a control method for walking of biped robots on undulating ground. This method contains grade estimation of ground using stereo vision and walk of robot on slope. Experimental results that indicate ability of this method are also shown.
