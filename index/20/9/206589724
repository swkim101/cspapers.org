This paper presents a methodology and results of evaluating edge detection algorithms using an object recognition task. A dataset consisting of 37 real images with 5 different jeep-like vehicles is used. Five edge detectors are compared using ROC curve analysis. The Heitger detector gives the best results. The work is being extended to include more images and a train-and-test style evaluation.
