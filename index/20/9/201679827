Accurate grading of skin disease severity plays a crucial role in precise treatment for patients. Acne vulgaris, the most common skin disease in adolescence, can be graded by evidence-based lesion counting as well as experience-based global estimation in the medical field. However, due to the appearance similarity of acne with close severity, it is challenging to count and grade acne accurately. In this paper, we address the problem of acne image analysis via Label Distribution Learning (LDL) considering the ambiguous information among acne severity. Based on the professional grading criterion, we generate two acne label distributions considering the relationship between the similar number of lesions and severity of acne, respectively. We also propose a unified framework for joint acne image grading and counting, which is optimized by the multi-task learning loss. In addition, we further build the ACNE04 dataset with annotations of acne severity and lesion number of each image for evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. We make the code and dataset publicly available at https://github.com/xpwu95/ldl.
