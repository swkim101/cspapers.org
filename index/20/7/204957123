Recognizing unseen attribute-object pairs never appearing in the training data is a challenging task, since an object often refers to a specific entity while an attribute is an abstract semantic description. Besides, attributes are highly correlated to objects, i.e., an attribute tends to describe different visual features of various objects. Existing methods mainly employ two classifiers to recognize attribute and object separately, or simply simulate the composition of attribute and object, which ignore the inherent discrepancy and correlation between them. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial fine-grained composition learning model for unseen attribute-object pair recognition. Considering their inherent discrepancy, we leverage multi-scale feature integration to capture discriminative fine-grained features from a given image. Besides, we devise a quintuplet loss to depict more accurate correlations between attributes and objects. Adversarial learning is employed to model the discrepancy and correlations among attributes and objects. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks indicate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors by a large margin.
