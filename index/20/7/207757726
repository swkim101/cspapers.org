The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), powerful computational hardwares like graphics processing units, affordable sensing devices like smart bands, wearables, smartphones pave ways for large number of useful and intelligent applications hitherto never commonly envisaged. However, it is felt that applications, which positively influence human life and society, need distinct attention from the perspective of the researchers, application developers as well as industry. It is understood that knowledge-driven initiatives in terms of technology, application and practical deployment have strong capability to enable long term human-centric convergence of cyber-physical systems. Our endeavor is to discuss those finer details, research directions and application development aspects of analytics and systems intended for impacting human quality of life.
