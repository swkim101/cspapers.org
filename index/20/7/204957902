Deep learning models have shown their vulnerabilities to universal adversarial perturbations (UAP), which are quasi-imperceptible. Compared to the conventional supervised UAPs that suffer from the knowledge of training data, the data-independent unsupervised UAPs are more applicable. Existing unsupervised methods fail to take advantage of the model uncertainty to produce robust perturbations. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised universal adversarial perturbation method, termed as Prior Driven Uncertainty Approximation (PD-UA), to generate a robust UAP by fully exploiting the model uncertainty at each network layer. Specifically, a Monte Carlo sampling method is deployed to activate more neurons to increase the model uncertainty for a better adversarial perturbation. Thereafter, a textural bias prior to revealing a statistical uncertainty is proposed, which helps to improve the attacking performance. The UAP is crafted by the stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a boosted momentum optimizer, and a Laplacian pyramid frequency model is finally used to maintain the statistical uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves well attacking performances on the ImageNet validation set, and significantly improves the fooling rate compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
