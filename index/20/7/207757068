To help databases users who have just started learning SQL or are not familiar with their database, we propose ExplIQuE, an exploration interface with query extensions. Its purpose is to assist users to smoothly dive into data exploration, and to be able to express imprecise questions over their data. Indeed, such situations are more and more current with the increasing desire for users to get value out of their data. In this configuration, in addition to classic SQL querying possibilities, ExplIQuE offers the possibility to extend a given SQL query, by suggesting a set of possible selection predicates to add to the query, that aim at dividing the initial answer set to identify interesting exploration zones. In addition, ExplIQuE proposes some indicators to help the user in choosing its desire extension and in understanding her data, as well as interactive visualizations of the result set, in two dimensions revealed by PCA techniques. In this demonstration, we offer the audience the possibility to try the various functionalities of ExplIQuE by trying to express an imprecise question over a scientific database on bacterial colonies, through an iterative process. A video of the proposed demonstration is available at \urlhttps://youtu.be/oK8xWGCWj_A.
