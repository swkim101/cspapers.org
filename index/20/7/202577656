Rotation invariance has been an important topic in computer vision tasks. Ideally, robot grasp detection should be rotation-invariant. However, rotation-invariance in robotic grasp detection has been only recently studied by using rotation anchor box that are often time-consuming and unreliable for multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a rotation ensemble module (REM) for robotic grasp detection using convolutions that rotates network weights. Our proposed REM was able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods by achieving up to 99.2% (image-wise), 98.6% (object-wise) accuracies on the Cornell dataset with real-time computation (50 frames per second). Our proposed method was also able to yield reliable grasps for multiple objects and up to 93.8% success rate for the real-time robotic grasping task with a 4-axis robot arm for small novel objects that was significantly higher than the baseline methods by 11-56%.
