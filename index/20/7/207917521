In deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), local pooling operation is a key building block to effectively downsize feature maps for reducing computation cost as well as increasing robustness against input variation. There are several types of pooling operation, such as average/max-pooling, from which one has to be manually selected for building CNNs. The optimal pooling type would be dependent on characteristics of features in CNNs and classification tasks, making it hard to find out the proper pooling module in advance. In this paper, we propose a flexible pooling method which adaptively tunes the pooling functionality based on input features without manually fixing it beforehand. In the proposed method, the parameterized pooling form is derived from a probabilistic perspective to flexibly represent various types of pooling and then the parameters are estimated by means of global statistics in the input feature map. Thus, the proposed local pooling guided by global features effectively works in the CNNs trained in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results on image classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pooling method in various deep CNNs.
