We propose an edit-centric approach to assess Wikipedia article quality as a complementary alternative to current full document-based techniques. Our model consists of a main classifier equipped with an auxiliary generative module which, for a given edit, jointly provides an estimation of its quality and generates a description in natural language. We performed an empirical study to assess the feasibility of the proposed model and its cost-effectiveness in terms of data and quality requirements.
