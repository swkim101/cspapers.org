Aircraft that can launch ballistically and convert to autonomous, free-flying drones have applications in many areas such as emergency response, defense, and space exploration, where they can gather critical situational data using onboard sensors. This paper presents a ballistically-launched, autonomously-stabilizing multirotor prototype (SQUID - Streamlined Quick Unfolding Investigation Drone) with an onboard sensor suite, autonomy pipeline, and passive aerodynamic stability. We demonstrate autonomous transition from passive to vision-based, active stabilization, confirming the multirotorâ€™s ability to autonomously stabilize after a ballistic launch in a GPS-denied environment.
