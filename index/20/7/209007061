Domain-Specific Modelling Languages (DSML) provide an opportunity to have end-users at the centre of the software development process. Although end-users are seldom software developers, providing a language that both the end-users and software developers understand enables fluent communication between the stakeholders. In this paper, work in progress in the development of a DSML for navigation applications on positioning enabled S60 mobile phones is presented. The presented language enables the end-user to instantly experience the impact of changes in the models, by utilising a code generator that produces complete applications from the models. The architecture of both the supporting software framework and the generated applications are also discussed.
