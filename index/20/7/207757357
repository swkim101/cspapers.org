Review rating prediction is an important task in data mining and natural language processing fields, and has wide applications. Users usually express opinions towards many aspects in their reviews, and the overall review rating is a synthesis of these opinions. However, most existing review rating prediction methods ignore users' opinions on aspects, which is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a neural aspect-aware rating prediction approach for Chinese reviews. In our approach we propose a collaborative learning framework to jointly train review-level rating predictor and multiple aspect-level rating predictors. In our framework different rating predictors share the same review encoder model to exploit the inherent relatedness between them, but have different attention networks to focus on different informative texts for each task. The final review representation for rating prediction is a concatenation of the review representations from all predictors. Since word segmentation of Chinese reviews is usually inaccurate, we propose a multi-view learning model to learn review representations from both words and characters. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach.
