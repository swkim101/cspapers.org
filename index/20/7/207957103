Anomaly detection is essential towards ensuring system security and reliability. Powered by constantly generated system data, deep learning has been found both effective and flexible to use, with its ability to extract patterns without much domain knowledge. Existing anomaly detection research focuses on a scenario referred to as zero-positive, which means that the detection model is only trained for normal (i.e., negative) data. In a real application scenario, there may be additional manually inspected positive data provided after the system is deployed. We refer to this scenario as lifelong anomaly detection. However, we find that existing approaches are not easy to adopt such new knowledge to improve system performance. In this work, we are the first to explore the lifelong anomaly detection problem, and propose novel approaches to handle corresponding challenges. In particular, we propose a framework called unlearning, which can effectively correct the model when a false negative (or a false positive) is labeled. To this aim, we develop several novel techniques to tackle two challenges referred to as exploding loss and catastrophic forgetting. In addition, we abstract a theoretical framework based on generative models. Under this framework, our unlearning approach can be presented in a generic way to be applied to most zero-positive deep learning-based anomaly detection algorithms to turn them into corresponding lifelong anomaly detection solutions. We evaluate our approach using two state-of-the-art zero-positive deep learning anomaly detection architectures and three real-world tasks. The results show that the proposed approach is able to significantly reduce the number of false positives and false negatives through unlearning.
