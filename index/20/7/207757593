Neural network methods have achieved great success in sentiment classification. Recent studies have found that incorporating user and product information can effectively improve the performance of review sentiment classification. However, most of these studies only concentrate on the influence of users and products, ignoring the inherent correlation between users or products. This information is important for users or products since they can obtain more information from similar users or products. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for review rating prediction with user and product memory. First, besides the original user or product representations, we construct inferred representations from representative users or products which are stored in memory slots. These memory units can be viewed as refined knowledge representations of users or products learned from the data. Then, we employ two hierarchical networks with user attention and product attention using both the original and inferred representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Besides, our approach performs much more better in cold-start scenarios where the training data is scarce.
