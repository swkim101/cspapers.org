Existing face deblurring methods only consider single frames and do not account for facial structure and identity information. These methods struggle to deblur face videos that exhibit significant pose variations and misalignment. In this paper we propose a novel face video deblurring network capitalizing on 3D facial priors. The model consists of two main branches: i) a face video deblurring sub-network based on an encoder-decoder architecture, and ii) a 3D face reconstruction and rendering branch for predicting 3D priors of salient facial structures and identity knowledge. These structures encourage the deblurring branch to generate sharp faces with detailed structures. Our method not only uses low-level information (i.e., image intensity), but also middle-level information (i.e., 3D facial structure) and high-level knowledge (i.e., identity content) to further explore spatial constraints of facial components from blurry face frames. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.
