Machine learning and computational intelligence have facilitated the development of recommendation systems for a broad range of domains. Such recommendations are based on contextual information that is explicitly provided or pervasively collected. Recommendation systems often improve decision-making or increase the efficacy of a task. Real-time strategy (RTS) games are one domain where computationally determined recommendations for moves that a player should, and should not, make can provide a competitive advantage. The goal of our research is to develop an accurate predictive recommendation system for multiplayer strategic games that is based on frequent subgraph mining. Herein we present that approach and validate it using the historical data of one RTS game.
