Erasure Coding (EC) NIC offload is a promising technology for designing next-generation distributed storage systems. However, this paper has identified three major limitations of current-generation EC NIC offload schemes on modern SmartNICs. Thus, this paper proposes a new EC NIC offload paradigm based on the tripartite graph model, namely TriEC. TriEC supports both encode-and-send and receive-and-decode operations efficiently. Through theorem-based proofs, co-designs with memcached (i.e., TriEC-Cache), and extensive experiments, we show that TriEC is correct and can deliver better performance than the state-of-the-art EC NIC offload schemes (i.e., BiEC). Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that TriEC outperforms BiEC by up to 1.82x and 2.33x for encoding and recovering, respectively. With extended YCSB workloads, TriEC reduces the average write latency by up to 23.2% and the recovery time by up to 37.8%. TriEC outperforms BiEC by 1.32x for a full-node recovery with 8 million records.
