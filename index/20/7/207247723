Choosing input devices for interactive systems that best suitusers needs remains a challenge, especially consid- ering theincreasing number of devices available. The choice often has to bemade through empirical evalua- tions. The most frequently usedevaluation task hitherto is target acquisition, a task that can beaccurately modeled by Fitts law. However, todays use of computerinput devices has gone beyond target acquisition alone. Inparticular, we often need to perform trajectory-based tasks, suchas drawing, writing, and navigation. This paper illustrates how arecently discovered model, the steering law, can be applied as anevaluation paradigm complementary to Fitts law. We tested fivecommonly used computer input devices in two steering tasks, onelinear and one circular. Results showed that subjects performancewith the five devices could be generally classified into threegroups in the following order: 1. the tablet and the mouse, 2. thetrackpoint, 3. the touch- pad and the trackball. The steering lawproved to hold for all five devices with greater than 0.98correlation. The ability to generalize the experimental results andthe limitations of the steering law are also discussed.
