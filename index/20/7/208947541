Recent databases are implemented as in-memory column-stores. Adjustable encryption offers a solution to encrypted database processing in the cloud. We show that the two technologies play well together by providing an analysis and prototype results that demonstrate the impact of mechanisms at the database side (dictionaries and their compression) and cryptographic mechanisms at the adjustable encryption side (order-preserving, homomorphic, deterministic and probabilistic encryption).
