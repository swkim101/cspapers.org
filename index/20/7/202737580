Shannon’s information theory, since its first introduction in 1948, has received much attention and successful applications in many domains. Apart from Fitts’ law and Hick’s law, which came out when experimental psychologists were enthusiastic about applying information theory to various areas of psychology, the relation of information theory to human-computer interaction (HCI) has not been clear. Even the two above-mentioned “laws” remain controversial in both psychology and HCI. On the other hand, in recent years, information theory has started to directly inspire or contribute to HCI research.
