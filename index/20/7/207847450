We consider the problem of mapless collisionavoidance navigation where humans are present using 2D laser scans. Our proposed method uses ego-safety to measure collision from the robot’s perspective and social-safety to measure the impact of robot’s actions on surrounding pedestrians. Specifically, the social-safety part predicts the intrusion impact of the robot’s action into the interaction area with surrounding humans. We train the policy using reinforcement learning on a simple simulator and directly evaluate the learned policy in Gazebo and real robot tests. Experiments show the learned policy smoothly transferred to different scenarios without any fine tuning. We observe that our method demonstrates timeefficient path planning behavior with high success rate in the mapless navigation task. Furthermore, we test our method in a navigation task among dynamic crowds, considering both low and high volume traffic. Our learned policy demonstrates cooperative behavior that actively drives our robot into traffic flows while showing respect to nearby pedestrians.
