Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth in the number of academics and practitioners who are interested in big scholarly data as well as closely-related areas. Quite a lot of papers reporting recent advancements in this area have been published in leading conferences and journals. Both non-commercial and commercial platforms and systems have been released in recent years, which provide innovative services built upon big scholarly data to the academic community. Examples include Microsoft Academic Graph, Google Scholar, DBLP, arXiv, CiteSeerX, Web of Knowledge, Udacity, Coursera, and edX. The workshop will contribute to the birth of a community having a shared interest around big scholarly data and exploring it using knowledge discovery, data science and analytics, network science, and other appropriate technologies.
