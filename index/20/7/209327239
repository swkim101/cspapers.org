PARAFAC2 is a widely applicable method often used for analyzing multi-way chromatographic data. We recently proposed a probabilistic framework for PARAFAC2[1]. The probabilistic formulations allow for a principled way of determining the number of latent components as well as modeling heteroscedastic noise. In this work we present a summary of the probabilistic PARAFAC2 models and their properties by revisiting the previous results of the analyzed data sets in a concise fashion.
