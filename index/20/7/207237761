Recent years have observed a significant progress in information retrieval and natural language processing with deep learning technologies being successfully applied into almost all of their major tasks. The key to the success of deep learning is its capability of accurately learning distributed representations (vector representations or structured arrangement of them) of natural language expressions such as sentences, and effectively utilizing the representations in the tasks. This tutorial aims at summarizing and introducing the results of recent research on deep learning for information retrieval, in order to stimulate and foster more significant research and development work on the topic in the future. The tutorial mainly consists of three parts. In the first part, we introduce the fundamental techniques of deep learning for natural language processing and information retrieval, such as word embedding, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. In the second part, we explain how deep learning, particularly representation learning techniques, can be utilized in fundamental NLP and IR problems, including matching, translation, classification, and structured prediction. In the third part, we describe how deep learning can be used in specific application tasks in details. The tasks are search, question answering (from either documents, database, or knowledge base), and image retrieval.
