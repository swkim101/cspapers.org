Operative mortality rates are currently not predictable; there are no tools to help health professionals determine prognoses and assist patients in making informed decisions. To address this issue, a machine learning algorithm was developed in this study to predict operative mortality for lung cancer patients, which provides accurate information as to whether or not a lung-cancer patient should undergo surgery based on this mortality prediction. We implemented a comparison of six different computational models: Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Adaptive Boost, Extreme Gradient Boost, and Artificial Neural Network. Of the six algorithms tested, XGBoost, a powerful yet relatively new algorithm that is just beginning to make its presence in the field of medical research, produced the best results, giving a testing-accuracy over 97% when aided with data balancing and feature engineering, a 10% increase over previous research. The strength of this project is that we demonstrate an accurate big data-driven, machine learning approach to predictive analytics in perioperative care, which can be used to improve surgical risk prediction for patients, healthcare professionals, and hospitals. Although our current example utilizes only data on thoracic surgery for lung cancer, this concept of machine learning-assisted decision-making can be expanded to incorporate more patients, more diseases, and more institutions in the future.
