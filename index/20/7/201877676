The chapter examines the limits and the sociopolitical 
effects of the Brazilian National Broadband Plan (PNBL). The discussion considers the main transformations witnessed in the telecommunications landscape in Brazil during the second half of the twentieth century. On the one hand, the end of state monopoly on telecommunications services and the provision of such services by the private sector called for greater investments in infrastructure. On the other hand, the Brazilian regulatory agencies have failed, for example, in lowering prices and promoting competition in the sector. The PNBL was launched in order to deal with these difficulties. The Plan, however, has at least three important problems: (1) the low-speed connection offered to users, (2) the unattractive prices, and (3) the lack of reflection 
on issues such as net neutrality. The text argues that only taking into consideration such questions the Plan will ensure innovation, economic growth, diversity and freedom of informational access.
