The promise of real-time detection and response to life-crippling diseases brought by the Implantable Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) has recently spurred substantial advances in implantable technologies. Yet, existing devices do not provide at once the miniaturized end-to-end sensing-computation-communication-recharging capabilities to implement IIoMT applications. This paper fills the existing research gap by presenting U-Verse, the first FDA-compliant rechargeable IIoMT platform packing sensing, computation, communication, and recharging circuits into a penny-scale platform. U-Verse uses a single miniaturized transducer for data exchange and for wireless charging. To predict U-Verse's performance, we (i) derive and experimentally validate a mathematical model of U-Verse's charging efficiency; and (ii) experimentally calculate the resistance-reactance parameters of our ultrasonic transducer and rectifying circuit. We design a matching circuit to maximize the amount of power transferred from the outside. We also go through the challenge of fabricating a full-fledged cm-scale printed circuit board (PCB) for U-Verse. Extensive experimental evaluation indicates that U-Verse (i) is able to recharge a 330mF and 15F energy storage unit - several orders of magnitude higher than existing work - respectively under 20 and 60 minutes at a depth of 5cm; (ii) achieves stored charge duration of up to 610 and 40 hours in case of battery and supercapacitor energy storage, respectively. Finally, U-Verse is demonstrated through (i) a closed-loop application where a periodic sensing/actuation task sends data via ultrasounds through real porcine meat; and (ii) a real-time reconfigurable pacemaker.
