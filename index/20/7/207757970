The widespread use of machine learning algorithms and the high level of expertise required to utilize them have fuelled the demand for solutions that can be used by non-experts. One of the main challenges non-experts face in applying machine learning to new problems is algorithm selection - the identification of the algorithm(s) that will deliver top performance for a given dataset, task, and evaluation measure. We present AutoGRD, a novel meta-learning approach for algorithm recommendation. AutoGRD first represents datasets as graphs and then extracts their latent representation that is used to train a ranking meta-model capable of accurately recommending top-performing algorithms for previously unseen datasets. We evaluate our approach on 250 datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness both for classification and regression tasks. AutoGRD outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning and Bayesian methods.
