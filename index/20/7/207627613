We propose a novel interactive system to simplify the process of indoor 3D CAD room modeling. Traditional room modeling methods require users to measure room and furniture dimensions, and manually select models that match the scene from large catalogs. Users then employ a mouse and keyboard interface to construct walls and place the objects in their appropriate locations. In contrast, our system leverages the sensing capabilities of a 3D aware mobile device, recent advances in object recognition, and a novel augmented reality user interface, to capture indoor 3D room models in-situ. With a few taps, a user can mark the surface of an object, take a photo, and the system retrieves and places a matching 3D model into the scene, from a large online database. User studies indicate that this modality is significantly quicker, more accurate, and requires less effort than traditional desktop tools.
