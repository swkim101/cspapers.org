We propose a new objective for network research: to build a fundamentally different sort of network that can assemble itself given high level instructions, reassemble itself as requirements change, automatically discover when something goes wrong, and automatically fix a detected problem or explain why it cannot do so.We further argue that to achieve this goal, it is not sufficient to improve incrementally on the techniques and algorithms we know today. Instead, we propose a new construct, the Knowledge Plane, a pervasive system within the network that builds and maintains high-level models of what the network is supposed to do, in order to provide services and advice to other elements of the network. The knowledge plane is novel in its reliance on the tools of AI and cognitive systems. We argue that cognitive techniques, rather than traditional algorithmic approaches, are best suited to meeting the uncertainties and complexity of our objective.
