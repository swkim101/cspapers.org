We discuss motion planning in the configuration spaces of robots containing continuum elements. The configuration space structure of extensible continuum sections is first analyzed, with practical constraints unique to continuum elements identified. The results are applied to generate the configuration space of a hybrid continuum lamp/mobile base robot. A conventional motion planning RRT/A* approach is subsequently applied for the robot in an aging in place application scenario.
