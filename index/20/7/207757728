Started in 2006 as a specialized workshop in the field of text mining applied to biomedical informatics, DTMBIO (ACM international workshop on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics) has been held annually in conjunction with one of the largest data management conferences, CIKM, bringing together researchers working on computer science and bioinformatics area including text mining and genomic data analysis. The purpose of DTMBIO is to foster discussions regarding the state-of-the-art applications of data and text mining on biomedical research problems. DTMBIO 2019 will help scientists navigate emerging trends and opportunities in the evolving area of informatics related techniques and problems in the context of biomedical research.
