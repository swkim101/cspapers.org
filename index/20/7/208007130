In this paper we consider the problem of relative pose estimation from two images with per-pixel polarimetric information. Using these additional measurements we derive a simple minimal solver for the essential matrix which only requires two point correspondences. The polarization constraints allow us to pointwise recover the 3D surface normal up to a two-fold ambiguity for the diffuse reflection. Since this ambiguity exists per point, there is a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. However, since our solver only requires two point correspondences, we only need to consider 16 configurations when solving for the relative pose. Once the relative orientation is recovered, we show that it is trivial to resolve the ambiguity for the remaining points. For robustness, we also propose a joint optimization between the relative pose and the refractive index to handle the refractive distortion. In experiments, on both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that by leveraging the additional information available from polarization cameras, we can improve over classical methods which only rely on the 2D-point locations to estimate the geometry. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach by integrating it into a state-of-the-art global Structure-from-Motion pipeline.
