Automated cyber defense tools require the ability to analyze binary applications, detect vulnerabilities and automatically patch those vulnerabilities. The insertion of security mechanisms that operate at function boundaries (e.g, control flow mitigation, stack guards) require automated detection of those boundaries. This paper introduces a publicly available function boundary detection tool for 32 and 64-bit Intel binaries running under Linux, that is more accurate than other reported approaches.
