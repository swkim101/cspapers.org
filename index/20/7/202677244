In this work we describe the system from Natural Language Processing group at Arizona State University for the TextGraphs 2019 Shared Task. The task focuses on Explanation Regeneration, an intermediate step towards general multi-hop inference on large graphs. Our approach consists of modeling the explanation regeneration task as a learning to rank problem, for which we use state-of-the-art language models and explore dataset preparation techniques. We utilize an iterative reranking based approach to further improve the rankings. Our system secured 2nd rank in the task with a mean average precision (MAP) of 41.3% on the test set.
