Product review summarization is a special form of text summarization, which gives a brief summary of an online product review. It is useful for both sellers to get feedback and consumers to make purchase decisions. Compared to traditional well-studied text summarization, product review summarization is highly personalized and targeted. Users have their own styles to write reviews and summaries, and products have different aspects to focus on. In this paper, we explore different ways to leverage the user and product information to help review summarization. Experiments show that our approaches are very effective and our models outperform the strong summarization baselines with a large margin.
