A protective enclosure for the human ear entirely closed except for a single opening sized to receive the outer ear. This opening is surrounded by a band of pressure sensitive adhesive to anchor the enclosure to the skull in a fluid tight manner. The opposite lateral edges of the enclosure are pleated inwardly to receive the operator's fingers in areas closely spaced to the adhesive while installing the enclosure over the ear.
