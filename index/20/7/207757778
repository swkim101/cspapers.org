Time series prediction plays a key role in wide applications and has been investigated for a couple of decades. Nevertheless, most of the prior works fail to identify the most effective frequency components of time series before passing through the prediction, which induces the drop of the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel predictor which integrates the sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model based on long short-term memory units (LSTM) with interpretable data reconstruction, where the learned hidden state is taken as a bridge. The reconstructor can effectively regularize data based on the learned frequency components and extract the effective components of time series. Moreover, we present an alternative training mechanism and a dedicated loss function to guarantee the success of prediction. Experimental results on extensive real-world datasets show a prominent superiority in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.
