Recommender systems have strongly attracted the attention of the machine learning research community with prosperous real-life deployments in the last few decades. The performance and success of most applications developed in this domain highly depend on an elaborate selection of models and configuration of their hyperparameters. The international MoST-Rec 2019 workshop addresses the issues of algorithm selection and parameter tuning for recommender systems. The workshop aims to bring together researchers from the model selection and hyperparameter tuning community in the general scope of machine learning with researchers from the recommender systems community for discussing and exchanging recent advances and open challenges in the field.
