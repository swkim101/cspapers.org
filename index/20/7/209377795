Mining gene expression profiles has proven valuable for identifying signatures serving as surrogates of cancer phenotypes. However, the similarities of such signatures across different cancer types have not been strong enough to conclude that they represent a universal biological mechanism shared among multiple cancer types. Here we describe a network-based approach that explores gene-to-gene connections in multiple cancer datasets while maximizing the overall association of the subnetwork with clinical outcomes. With the dataset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we studied the characteristics of common gene expression of three types of cancers: Rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), Breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). By analyzing several pairs of highly correlated genes after filtering and clustering work, we found that the co-expressed genes across multiple types of cancers point to particular biological mechanisms related to cancer cell progression , suggesting that they represent important attributes of cancer in need of being elucidated for potential applications in diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic products applicable to multiple cancer types.
