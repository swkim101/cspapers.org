Entity retrieval has received increasing research attention from both the Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Web communities. This workshop series provides a platform where interdisciplinary studies of entity retrieval can be presented, and focused discussions can take place. We also organize two shared tasks related to entity retrieval. The 2nd International Workshop on EntitY REtrieval (EYRE 2019) was a half-day workshop co-located with the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2019) in Beijing, China.
