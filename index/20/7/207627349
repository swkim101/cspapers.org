Computer users working with large visual documents, such as large layouts, blueprints, or maps perform tasks that require them to simultaneously access overview information while working on details. To avoid the need for zooming, users currently have to choose between using a sufficiently large screen or applying appropriate visualization techniques. Currently available hi-res "wall-size" screens, however, are cost-intensive, space-intensive, or both. Visualization techniques allow the user to more efficiently use the given screen space, but in exchange they either require the user to switch between multiple views or they introduce distortion.In this paper, we present a novel approach to simultaneously display focus and context information. Focus plus context screens consist of a hi-res display and a larger low-res display. Image content is displayed such that the scaling of the display content is preserved, while its resolution may vary according to which display region it is displayed in. Focus plus context screens are applicable to practically all tasks that currently use overviews or fisheye views, but unlike these visualization techniques, focus plus context screens provide a single, non-distorted view. We present a prototype that seamlessly integrates an LCD with a projection screen and demonstrate four applications that we have adapted so far.
