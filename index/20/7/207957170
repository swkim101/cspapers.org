The increase in network traffic volumes challenges the scalability of security analysis tools. In this paper, we present NetLearn, a solution to identify potentially malicious network entities from large amounts of network traffic data. NetLearn applies recently developed natural language processing algorithms to discover security-relevant relationships between the observed network entities, e.g., domain names and IP addresses, without requiring external sources of information for its analysis.
