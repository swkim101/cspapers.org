In web image search, items users search for are images instead of Web pages or online services. Web image search constitutes a very important part of web search. Re-ranking is a trusted technique to improve retrieval effectiveness in web search. Previous work on re-ranking web image search results mainly focuses on intra-query information (e.g., human interactions with the initial list of the current query). Contextual information such as the query sequence and implicit user feedback provided during a search session prior to the current query is known to improve the performance of general web search but has so far not been used in web image search. The differences in result placement and interaction mechanisms of image search make the search process rather different from general Web search engines. Because of these differences, context-aware re-ranking models that have originally been developed for general web search cannot simply be applied to web image search. We propose CARM, a context-aware re-ranking model, a neural network-based framework to re-rank web image search results for a query based on previous interaction behavior in the search session in which the query was submitted. Specifically, we explore a hybrid encoder with an attention mechanism to model intra-query and inter-query user preferences for image results in a two-stage structure. We train context-aware re-ranking model (CARM) to jointly learn query and image representations so as to be able to deal with the multimodal characteristics of web image search. Extensive experiments are carried out on a commercial web image search dataset. The results show that CARM outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of personalized evaluation metrics. Also, CARM combines the original ranking can improve the original ranking on personalized ranking and relevance estimation. We make the implementation of CARM and relevant datasets publicly available to facilitate future studies.
