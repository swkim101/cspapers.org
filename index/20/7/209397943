The method includes positioning a plurality of rotary milling saw stations about a path of travel for successive screw blanks. Two longitudinally overlapping fluting cuts are made on each side of each blank to configure a drilling point. The blanks are rotated about their axis a predetermined amount, during travel between work stations, to expose the appropriate peripheral surface of the blank to the appropriate work station. The method and apparatus described in the invention is capable of producing a drill screw with relatively long flutes behind the cutting edges while not appreciably weakening the point structure. The turret carrying the blanks is intermittently indexed in timed relationship with the activation of the milling saw, the work stations and means to clamp the blanks at the work stations.
