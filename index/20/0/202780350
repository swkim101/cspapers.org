Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) represents each data point as a sparse linear combination of other data points in the dataset. In the representation learning step SSC finds a lower dimensional representation of data points, while in the spectral clustering step data points are clustered according to the underlying subspaces. However, both steps suffer from high computational and memory complexity, preventing the application of SSC to large-scale datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Selective Sampling-based Scalable Sparse Subspace Clustering (S5C) algorithm which selects subsamples based on the approximated subgradients and linearly scales with the number of data points in terms of time and memory requirements. Along with the computational advantages, we derive theoretical guarantees for the correctness of S5C. Our theoretical result presents novel contribution for SSC in the case of limited number of subsamples. Extensive experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.
