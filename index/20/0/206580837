A smart-card run-time environment must provide proper transaction support for the reliable updating of data, especially on multi-application cards like the Java Card. The transaction mechanism must meet these demands by means of the applications and the system itself, within the minimal resources offered by current smart-card hardware. This paper presents the current transaction model implied by the Java Card 2.1 specification, highlights its shortcomings and presents a detailed discussion of possible implementation schemes and their optimizations. It especially addresses the problem of object instantiations within a transaction in the Java Card 2.1 specification and presents an effective solution.
