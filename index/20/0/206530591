Robotic manufacturing cells are heterogeneous systems consisting of such different components as machine tools, robots and programmable logic units. The efficient management of a cell depends on the integration of these different elements. This paper discusses the challenging problems and perspectives relating to the use of advanced communication and programming methodologies which rely on the local area network as the interconnection structure for the cell components.
