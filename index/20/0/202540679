Heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding has gained increasing interests recently. However, the current way of random-walk based HIN embedding methods have paid few attention to the higher-order Markov chain nature of meta-path guided random walks, especially to the stationarity issue. In this paper, we systematically formalize the meta-path guided random walk as a higher-order Markov chain process,and present a heterogeneous personalized spacey random walk to efficiently and effectively attain the expected stationary distribution among nodes. Then we propose a generalized scalable framework to leverage the heterogeneous personalized spacey random walk to learn embeddings for multiple types of nodes in an HIN guided by a meta-path, a meta-graph, and a meta-schema respectively. We conduct extensive experiments in several heterogeneous networks and demonstrate that our methods substantially outperform the existing state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms.
