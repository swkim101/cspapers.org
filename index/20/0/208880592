This paper proposes an improved puncturing scheme exploiting the feature of systematic polar codes and verifies its effectiveness in MIMO-OFDM transmission. Puncturing is the process of removing part of the encoded bits and can realize various coding rates to adopt to the channel condition. However, the puncturing deteriorates BER performance because the removed bits are generally unknown at the receiving side. Systematic polar coding can generate the codeword that has the same value of information bits. Using this characteristic, the transmitting side punctures known bits shared between transmitter and receiver in the codeword. The receiving side then decodes the received signal by setting punctured bits to the known value to assist the decoding capability. Computer simulation presents that the achievable throughput can be improved while maintaining BER performance.
