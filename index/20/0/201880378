In this paper, I investigate the media aspect of the self-help culture. The increasingly frequent presence of experts, especially from the called psi field, form what Bauman called 
“counseling outbreak”. That is, in addition to informing, weekly magazines (and other media) have been counseling and guiding readers in the most distinct aspects of their 
lives. Since the 1990s this phenomenon is mostly seen and we analyzed it here through articles from Veja magazine related to the new moral of health and fitness.
