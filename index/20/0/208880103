Polarization Division Multiplexing is a promising technique for effectively increasing the capacity of optical routes. Its basic advantage is the possibility of being deployed on existing optical routes without the need to replace existing fibres or cables. The use of two optical fibre polarization axes allows the use of two independent transmission channels in a single optical fibre. The deployment options of Polarization Division Multiplexing can be evaluated using a tolerance field that can be obtained by measuring at the end of the optical path. This article discusses special measurement techniques and a new way of illustrating the Poincar√© sphere's tolerance field., which allows evaluating the success of a Polarization Division Multiplexing technology at a glance. A detailed analysis of the tolerance field should simplify the idea of the activity of this type of multiplex and., for its clarity., it is also very suitable for study purposes. Unlike the transmission rate measurement., the measurement of the polarization multiplex tolerance field is a beneficial measurement showing the properties of the entire transmission system.
