The effect of the presence of iron-induced acceptor centers in the gallium nitride high electron mobility transistor is studied using device physics simulations at elevated temperatures (up to 600 K), as a lattice heat flow equation is solved self-consistently with the Poisson and the continuity equations to account for self-heating effects. It is shown that the acceptor centers intentionally introduced in the buffer layer of the device cause a shift of the input characteristics in the positive direction.
