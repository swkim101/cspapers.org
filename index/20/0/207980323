Most existing person re-identification(Re-ID) approaches achieve superior results based on the assumption that a large amount of pre-labelled data is usually available and can be put into training phrase all at once. However, this assumption is not applicable to most real-world deployment of the Re-ID task. In this work, we propose an alternative reinforcement learning based human-in-the-loop model which releases the restriction of pre-labelling and keeps model upgrading with progressively collected data. The goal is to minimize human annotation efforts while maximizing Re-ID performance. It works in an iteratively updating framework by refining the RL policy and CNN parameters alternately. In particular, we formulate a Deep Reinforcement Active Learning (DRAL) method to guide an agent (a model in a reinforcement learning process) in selecting training samples on-the-fly by a human user/annotator. The reinforcement learning reward is the uncertainty value of each human selected sample. A binary feedback (positive or negative) labelled by the human annotator is used to select the samples of which are used to fine-tune a pre-trained CNN Re-ID model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DRAL method for deep reinforcement learning based human-in-the-loop person Re-ID when compared to existing unsupervised and transfer learning models as well as active learning models.
