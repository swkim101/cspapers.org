Each vertex of an arbitrary simple graph on n vertices chooses k random incident edges. What is the expected number of edges in the original graph that connect different connected components of the sampled subgraph? We prove that the answer is O(n/k), when k ≥ c log n, for some large enough c. We conjecture that the same holds for smaller values of k, possibly for any k ≥ 2. Such a result is best possible for any k ≥ 2. As an application, we use this sampling result to obtain a one-way communication protocol with private randomness for finding a spanning forest of a graph in which each vertex sends only O (√n log n) bits to a referee.
