We present a robot system architecture for a mobile manipulator to perform grasping and manipulation tasks robustly. The system is distributed across multiple computers allowing for online update rates while maintaining a reasonable planning horizon. We test this system architecture using the MOVO mobile manipulation platform from Kinova Robotics. The completed system was demonstrated with a robust manipulation task for over 70 hours at SIMPAR 2018 and ICRA 2018, achieving a success rate â‰ˆ 98%.
