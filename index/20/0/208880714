In this paper, a novel structure of resonator in iris coupled cavity filter is proposed, in which a cone block is added to the top of resonator. A model-based sensitivity analysis is made to investigate the impact of physical properties of cone block to electrical field in the resonator. By optimizing the cone angle, electrical field strength can be reduced while power handling capacity can be improved significantly. Moreover, a procedure for designation of single cavity resonator used in high power RF filter is also sketched. This proposed structure is applied to design a cavity filter for eNodeB, which improves the power handling capacity from 148.9W up to 449.4W.
