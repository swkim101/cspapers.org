The SLATE (Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale) library is being developed to provide fundamental dense linear algebra capabilities for current and upcoming distributed high-performance systems, both accelerated CPU-GPU based and CPU based. SLATE will provide coverage of existing ScaLAPACK functionality, including the parallel BLAS; linear systems using LU and Cholesky; least squares problems using QR; and eigenvalue and singular value problems. In this respect, it will serve as a replacement for ScaLAPACK, which after two decades of operation, cannot adequately be retrofitted for modern accelerated architectures. SLATE uses modern techniques such as communication-avoiding algorithms, lookahead panels to overlap communication and computation, and task-based scheduling, along with a modern C++ framework. Here we present the design of SLATE and initial reports of several of its components.
