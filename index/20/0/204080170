Game theme based learning modules will revolutionize education because it increases motivation and engagement of students as they learn interactively. This study is aimed to assess the perceived motivation and engagement of undergraduate students for game theme based learning in introductory programming courses. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a game theme-based instructional (GTI) module to teach linked list and binary tree data structure. We have used FDF (fourdimensional framework) with a minor extension for the design and development of GTI modules. The design of the GTI module is modeled on the constructive approach of learning. The purpose of this paper is to overcome the intellectual crisis by providing a new way of thinking and learning. We have evaluated the GTI modules based on the five components of Science Motivation Questionnaire II (SMQII). The results of the evaluation of GTI modules show that the students feel self-determined and motivated towards their learning and career.
