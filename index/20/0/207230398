In this study, we propose active bone-conducted sound sens- ing for estimating a joint angle of a finger and simultaneous use as a haptic interface. For estimating the joint angle, an unnoticeable vibration is input to the finger, and a perceptible vibration is additionally input to the finger for providing hap- tic feedback. The joint angle is estimated by switching the estimation model depending on the haptic feedback and the average error of the estimation is within about seven degree.
