This paper presents a novel design of direct delta-sigma receiver, which is different from conventional design. This receiver is designed to cover Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) bands from 0.4 GHz to 3.6 GHz with a configurable bandwidth of 3.84 MHz (WCDMA), and 9.0/13.5/18/37 MHz (LTE-10M/15M/20M/37M). The receiver complies with 3GPP specification while performing Noise Figure (NF) of 2.5dB, Inband (IB) Third-order intercept point (IIP3) of -15dBm, Out-of-band (OOB) IIP3 of OdBm and peak Signal-to-Noise-and-Distortion ratio (SNDR) of 58dB. The circuit is designed in CMOS 65nm, and the power consumption is 70 mA at a voltage supply of 1.2 V.
