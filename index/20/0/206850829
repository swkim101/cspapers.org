In this paper, we propose a visual place recognition algorithm which uses only straight line features in challenging outdoor environments. Compared to point features used in most existing place recognition methods, line features are easily found in man-made environments and more robust to environmental changes such as illumination, viewing direction, or occlusion because they are more likely to be extracted from structures. Candidate matches are found using a vocabulary tree and their geometric consistency is verified by a motion estimation algorithm using line segments. The proposed algorithm operates in real-time, and it is tested with a challenging real-world dataset with more than 10,000 database images acquired in urban driving scenarios.
