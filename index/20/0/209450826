Several different control methods are used in practice or have been proposed to cost-effectively provision IT resources. Due to the dependency of many control methods on having accurate predictions of the future to make good provisioning decisions, there has been a great deal of literature on prediction workload demand. However, even with all of this literature on workload predictions and their utilization in control algorithms, the understanding of prediction error and how to handle it remains an important open issue and research challenge [1].
