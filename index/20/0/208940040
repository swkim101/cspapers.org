Making future autonomous robots capable of accomplishing human-scale manipulation tasks requires us to equip them with knowledge and reasoning mechanisms. We propose Open-EASE, a remote knowledge representation and processing service that aims at facilitating these capabilities. Open-EASE gives its users unprecedented access to the knowledge of leading-edge autonomous robotic agents. It also provides the representational infrastructure to make inhomogeneous experience data from robots and human manipulation episodes semantically accessible, and is complemented by a suite of software tools that enable researchers and robots to interpret, analyze, visualize, and learn from the experience data. Using Open-EASE users can retrieve the memorized experiences of manipulation episodes and ask queries regarding to what the robot saw, reasoned, and did as well as how the robot did it, why, and what effects it caused.
