This paper presents a Doppler frequency compensation model in High speed railway communications. In this proposed model, the Doppler frequency curve is calculated according to the actual train speed and dedicated scenario of high-speed railway, and then the Doppler frequency is used to compensate carrier frequency offset (CFO) at Access Point (AP) equipment on board. The determination of the Doppler curve in this way doesn't use any estimation algorithms so the proposal is not limited by signal processing time. We will also show the deterioration in Bit Error Rate (BER) as well as the loss in energy per bit to noise density (Eb/N0) due to the Doppler frequency for the proposed model.
