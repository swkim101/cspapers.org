In this paper, we propose a novel multiple description coding method based on the Wyner-Ziv scheme for robust video transmission. In the proposed method, the motion vector (MV) field is encoded into two descriptions, which are transmitted over different paths to the decoder. Unlike the conventional methods, the correlation between descriptions in the proposed method is generated without using any additional redundant data since it can be estimated based on the high spatial correlation of MVs themselves in the MV field. At the decoder, this correlation is then employed as the side information in the Wyner-Ziv scheme to effectively improve the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a wide range of tradeoffs between coding efficiency and error resilience, and provide much better objective and subjective performance than other conventional MDC methods.
