Density information has been used as a property of sound to restore objects in a quantitative manner in ultrasound tomography based on backscatter theory. In the traditional method, the authors only study the distorted Born iterative method (DBIM) to create density images using Tikhonov regularization. The downside is that the image quality is still low, the resolution is low, the convergence rate is not high. In this paper, we study the DBIM method to create density images using compressive sampling technique. With compressive sampling technique, the probes will be randomly distributed on the measurement system (unlike the traditional method, the probes are evenly distributed on the measurement system). This approach uses the l1 regularization to restore images. The proposed method will give superior results in image recovery quality, spatial resolution. The limitation of this method is that the imaging time is longer than the one in the traditional method, but the less number of iterations is used in this method.
