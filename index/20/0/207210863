There is a surge in the use of location activity in social media, in particular to broadcast the change of physical whereabouts. We are interested in analyzing the temporal characteristics of check-ins data from the user's perspective and also at the aggregate level for detecting patterns. In this paper we conduct a large study using check-in data from Facebook to analyze different temporal characteristics in four venue categories (restaurants, movies, shopping, and get-away). We present the results of such study and outline application areas where the conjunction of location and temporal-aware data can help in new search scenarios.
