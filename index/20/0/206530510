An F-15 bulkhead is to be inspected by a computer system employing television cameras for vision and robot arms with tactile sensors for precise measurements. The system requires a suitable model of the object to be inspected. The model must contain very precise, accurate information for low-level vision and measurement processes and at the same time be useful to high-level vision and planning processes. This requirement makes most existing three-dimensional models useless. In this paper we define a hierarchical, relational model that we have developed to be used by the robot inspection system.
