We present a method to learn a representation for adverbs from instructional videos using weak supervision from the accompanying narrations. Key to our method is the fact that the visual representation of the adverb is highly dependent on the action to which it applies, although the same adverb will modify multiple actions in a similar way. For instance, while ‘spread quickly’ and ‘mix quickly’ will look dissimilar, we can learn a common representation that allows us to recognize both, among other actions. We formulate this as an embedding problem, and use scaled dot product attention to learn from weakly-supervised video narrations. We jointly learn adverbs as invertible transformations which operate on the embedding space, so as to add or remove the effect of the adverb. As there is no prior work on weakly supervised learning from adverbs, we gather paired action-adverb annotations from a subset of the HowTo100M dataset, for 6 adverbs: quickly/slowly, finely/coarsely and partially/completely. Our method outperforms all baselines for video-to-adverb retrieval with a performance of 0.719 mAP. We also demonstrate our model’s ability to attend to the relevant video parts in order to determine the adverb for a given action.
