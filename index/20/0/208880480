In this paper, we analyze performance of the bidirectional Full Duplex (FD) Spatial Modulation (SM) systems using Transmit Antenna Selection (TAS), called FD-SM-TAS, in the presence of Residual Self-Interference (RSI) due to imperfect Self-Interference Cancellation (SIC). Based on mathematical calculation, the exact Outage Probability (OP) expression of the FD-SM-TAS system is derived. Besides, OP performance of the FD-SM system with and without TAS is compared to confirm the efficacy of TAS. The derived expression can be used for Half Duplex (HD) systems with and without TAS when setting the value of RSI to zero. Impacts of data transmission rate and RSI on the system performance are also investigated and compared with those of the HD-SM system. Finally, the analytical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulation.
