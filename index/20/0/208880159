A dual band rectangular dielectric resonator antenna is presented. The dielectric resonator is excited electrically by a quadrature-fed loop antenna having a capacitive gap to control its input impedance matching. The electromagnetic energy couples from the loop antenna to the rectangular dielectric placed on top of it. A phase inverter is inserted in one of the loop antenna arms that contributes to dual resonance behaviour of the dielectric resonator by introducing an approximate phase shift of 90 degree in operating bands. The proposed antenna operates at 3.34 GHz and 4.76 GHz. The antenna exhibits broadside radiation, with maximum radiation occurring at the top, with directivity of 7.37 dBi and 7.13 dBi in operating bands, respectively. The proposed antenna is suitable for using in wireless communication systems.
