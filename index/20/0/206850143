This video demonstrates the use of an underactuated robotic hand modified for the flip-and-pinch task to pick up thin objects from a table surface. Though well-suited for power-grasping, underactuated hands have difficulty with pinch-grasping and precision motions. We introduce a repeatable and robust method by which an underactuated hand flips thin objects off the table into a stable pinch grasp. We explain why this task is quasi-static and robust for a wide range of object dimensions.
