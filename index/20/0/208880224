Fiber Space Optic technology (FSO) is a technology that provides communication systems with low power consumption, large capacity, and providing safe transmission because the system uses point to point laser signals. In addition to the advantages that exist, the FSO moves some of the main challenges that require good LOS values and requires multipath fading needed by weather factors. The main problem is that the compilation system depends on rainy weather conditions to high attenuation. The propose methode is to integrating FSO communication systems with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology and frequency modulation. This contribution is one solution to overcome the multipath fading problem that arises in high-speed data transmission through atmospheric media. One of the challenges is to make the FSO system more resistant to rainy weather perhaps with as little power as possible. The results power received on 16 QAM at 10 Gbps each other are -2 dBm ~20. 512 dBm, 4 dBm ~20,802 dBm, and 6 ~20,901 dBm.
