Given the frequent changes in the Android framework and the continuous evolution of Android malware, it is challenging to detect malware over time in an effective and scalable manner. To address this challenge, we propose DroidEvolver, an Android malware detection system that can automatically and continually update itself during malware detection without any human involvement. While most existing malware detection systems can be updated by retraining on new applications with true labels, DroidEvolver requires neither retraining nor true labels to update itself, mainly due to the insight that DroidEvolver makes necessary and lightweight update using online learning techniques with evolving feature set and pseudo labels. The detection performance of DroidEvolver is evaluated on a dataset of 33,294 benign applications and 34,722 malicious applications developed over a period of six years. Using 6,286 applications dated in 2011 as the initial training set, DroidEvolver achieves high detection F-measure (95.27%), which only declines by 1.06% on average per year over the next five years for classifying 57,539 newly appeared applications. Note that such new applications could use new techniques and new APIs, which are not known to DroidEvolver when initialized with 2011 applications. Compared with the state-of-the-art overtime malware detection system MAMADROID, the F-measure of DroidEvolver is 2.19 times higher on average (10.21 times higher for the fifth year), and the efficiency of DroidEvolver is 28.58 times higher than MAMADROID during malware detection. DroidEvolver is also shown robust against typical code obfuscation techniques.
