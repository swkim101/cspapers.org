This paper discusses visual methods that can be used to understand and interpret the results of classification using support vector machines (SVM) on data with continuous real-valued variables. SVM induction algorithms build pattern classifiers by identifying a maximal margin separating hyperplane from training examples in high dimensional pattern spaces or spaces induced by suitable nonlinear kernel transformations over pattern spaces. SVM have been demonstrated to be quite effective in a number of practical pattern classification tasks. Since the separating hyperplane is defined in terms of more than two variables it is necessary to use visual techniques that can navigate the viewer through high-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate the use of projection-based tour methods to gain useful insights into SVM classifiers with linear kernels on 8-dimensional data.
