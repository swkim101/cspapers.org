There is increasing interest in supporting time-critical services in cloud computing environments. Those cloud services differ from traditional hard real-time systems in three aspects. First, cloud services usually involve latency requirements in terms of probabilistic tail latency instead of hard deadlines. Second, some cloud services need to handle aperiodic requests for stochastic arrival processes instead of traditional periodic or sporadic models. Finally, the computing platform must provide performance isolation between time-critical services and other workloads. It is therefore essential to provision resources to meet different tail latency requirements. As a step towards cloud services with stochastic latency guarantees, this paper presents a stochastic response time analysis for aperiodic services following a Poisson arrival process on computing platforms that schedue time-critical services as deferrable servers. The stochastic analysis enables a service operator to provision CPU resources for aperiodic services to achieve a desired tail latency. We evaluated the method in two case studies, one involving a synthetic service and another involving a Redis service, both on a testbed based on Xen 4.10. The results demonstrate the validity and efficacy of our method in a practical setting.
