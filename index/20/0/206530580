The design and use of a microprocessor-based air servo controlled robot hand which through the use of an automatic quick change fingertip device can accommodate a wide variety of workpieces and allows flexible assembly and other applications is presented. The changeable set of gripper fingers are equipped with sensors, e.g. a tactile force sensor, a cross-fire sensor, a proximity sensor and a slip sensor etc. These sensors can handle certain subranges of the workpiece spectrum. This is a considerable cost saving factor stemming from the elimination of the need for constant changing of the gripper itself. This microprocessor-based servo controlled system which includes a position and force feedback called for a specifically designed hardware and software system. A PUMA 600 is used in the research to test the success of this entire process.
