Most congestion control algorithms, like TCP, rely on a reactive control system that detects congestion, then marches carefully towards a desired operating point (e.g. by modifying the window size or adjusting a rate). In an effort to balance stability and convergence speed, they often take hundreds of RTTs to converge; an increasing problem as networks get faster, with less time to react. This paper is about an alternative class of congestion control algorithms based on proactive-scheduling: switches and NICs "proactively" exchange control messages to run a distributed algorithm to pick "explicit rates" for each flow.We call these Proactive Explicit Rate Control (PERC) algorithms. They take as input the routing matrix and link speeds, but not a congestion signal. By exploiting information such as the number of flows at a link, they can converge an order of magnitude faster than reactive algorithms.
