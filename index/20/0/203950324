Software becomes more and more integral to our lives thus software failures affect more people than ever. Failures are not only responsible for billions of dollars lost to industry but can cause lethal accidents. Although there has been much research into predicting such failures, those predictions usually concentrate either on the technical or the social level of software development. With the ever growing size of software teams we think that coordination among developers is becoming increasingly more important. Therefore, we propose to leverage the combination of both social and technical dimensions to create recommendation upon which developers can act to prevent software failures.
