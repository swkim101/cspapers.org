Estimating motion and surrounding geometry of a moving camera remains a challenging inference problem. From an information theoretic point of view, estimates should get better as more information is included, such as is done in dense SLAM, but this is strongly dependent on the validity of the underlying models. In the present paper, we use triangular meshes as both compact and dense geometry representation. To allow for simple and fast usage, we propose a view-based formulation for which we predict the in-plane vertex coordinates directly from images and then employ the remaining vertex depth components as free variables. Flexible and continuous integration of information is achieved through the use of a residual based inference technique. This so-called factor graph encodes all information as mapping from free variables to residuals, the squared sum of which is minimised during inference. We propose the use of different types of learnable residuals, which are trained end-to-end to increase their suitability as information bearing models and to enable accurate and reliable estimation. Detailed evaluation of all components is provided on both synthetic and real data which confirms the practicability of the presented approach.
