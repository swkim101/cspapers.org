Cloth modeling and recognition is an important and challenging problem in both vision and graphics tasks, such as dressed human recognition and tracking, human sketch and portrait. In this paper, we present a context sensitive grammar in an And-Or graph representation which will produce a large set of composite graphical templates to account for the wide variabilities of cloth configurations, such as T-shirts, jackets, etc. In a supervised learning phase, we ask an artist to draw sketches on a set of dressed people, and we decompose the sketches into categories of cloth and body components: collars, shoulders, cuff, hands, pants, shoes etc. Each component has a number of distinct subtemplates (sub-graphs). These sub-templates serve as leafnodes in a big And-Or graph where an And-node represents a decomposition of the graph into sub-configurations with Markov relations for context and constraints (soft or hard), and an Or-node is a switch for choosing one out of a set of alternative And-nodes (sub-configurations) - similar to a node in stochastic context free grammar (SCFG). This representation integrates the SCFG for structural variability and the Markov (graphical) model for context. An algorithm which integrates the bottom-up proposals and the topdown information is proposed to infer the composite cloth template from the image.
