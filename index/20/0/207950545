Android's 3X3 graphical pattern lock scheme is one of the widely used authentication method on smartphone devices. However, users choose 3X3 patterns from a small subspace of all possible 389,112 patterns. The two recently proposed interfaces, SysPal by Cho et al. and TinPal by the authors, demonstrate that it is possible to influence users 3X3 pattern choices by making small modifications in the existing interface. While SysPal forces users to include one, two or three system-assigned random dots in their pattern, TinPal employs highlighting mechanism to inform users about the set of reachable dots from the current selected dot. Both interfaces improved the security of 3X3 patterns without affecting usability, but no comparison between SysPal and TinPal was presented. To address this gap, we conduct a new user study with 147 participants and collect patterns on three SysPal interfaces, 1-dot, 2-dot and 3-dot. We compare SysPal and TinPal patterns using a range of security and usability metrics including pattern length, stroke length, guessability, recall time and login attempts. Overall, we found that patterns created on TinPal were significantly longer and offered more resistance to guessing attacks.
