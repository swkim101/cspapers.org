We present a telerobotics research platform that provides complete access to all levels of control via open-source electronics and software. The electronics employs an FPGA to enable a centralized computation and distributed I/O architecture in which all control computations are implemented in a familiar development environment (Linux PC) and low-latency I/O is performed over an IEEE-1394a (FireWire) bus at speeds up to 400 Mbits/sec. The mechanical components are obtained from retired first-generation da Vinci Â® Surgical Systems. This system is currently installed at 11 research institutions, with additional installations underway, thereby creating a research community around a common open-source hardware and software platform.
