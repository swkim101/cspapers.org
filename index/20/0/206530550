We describe a feasibility demonstration of an 'intelligent' robot system for inspection and testing of electronic properties of devices. The system consists of a Seiko RT-3000 robot, an Automatix Autovision II vision system, two CCD Panasonic cameras plus peripherals. The latter include two testing probe-stations, a passive-hand with magnetic pick-up fingertips, racks and pallets. The system is interconnected through serial RS-232 ports and I/O switches. The system is capable of relocating devices with a precision of 0.1 mm. The initial part-presentation requires only a â‰ˆ 10 cm precision. The system is presently set up to demonstrate the measurement of capacitance and dark- current of InGaAs PIN photodetectors.
