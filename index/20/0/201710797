3D hand pose estimation has made significant progress recently, where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) play a critical role. However, most of the existing CNN-based hand pose estimation methods depend much on the training set, while labeling 3D hand pose on training data is laborious and time-consuming. Inspired by the point cloud autoencoder presented in self-organizing network (SO-Net), our proposed SO-HandNet aims at making use of the unannotated data to obtain accurate 3D hand pose estimation in a semi-supervised manner. We exploit hand feature encoder (HFE) to extract multi-level features from hand point cloud and then fuse them to regress 3D hand pose by a hand pose estimator (HPE). We design a hand feature decoder (HFD) to recover the input point cloud from the encoded feature. Since the HFE and the HFD can be trained without 3D hand pose annotation, the proposed method is able to make the best of unannotated data during the training phase. Experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets validate that our proposed SO-HandNet can achieve superior performance for 3D hand pose estimation via semi-supervised learning.
