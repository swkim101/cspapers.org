Similar to previous mobile communication systems, random access (RA) procedure in fifth generation of mobile communication (5G) is used to achieve the uplink synchronization between user equipment (UE) and next generation Node B (gNB) based on the detection of preambles in Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). A method for detecting preamble in PRACH at 5G base station (gNB) is proposed in this paper. The proposed method uses an enhanced algorithm with multi-detection steps to reject effectively false alarm peaks due to noise and channel condition as multipath fading, Doppler shift, frequency offset and timing offset. Simulation results show that the proposed method with optimized detection thresholds satisfies the requirements of system about detection probability and false alarm probability under a certain SNR level and propagation condition.
