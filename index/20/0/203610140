This paper introduces a taxonomy of manipulations as seen especially in cooking for 1) grouping manipulations from the robotics point of view, 2) consolidating aliases and removing ambiguity for motion types, and 3) provide a path to transferring learned manipulations to new unlearned manipulations. Using instructional videos as a reference, we selected a list of common manipulation motions seen in cooking activities grouped into similar motions based on several trajectory and contact attributes. Manipulation codes are then developed based on the taxonomy attributes to represent the manipulation motions. The manipulation taxonomy is then used for comparing motion data in the Daily Interactive Manipulation (DIM) data set to reveal their motion similarities.
