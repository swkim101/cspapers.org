A new closed-form solver is proposed minimizing the algebraic error optimally, in the least squares sense, to estimate the relative planar motion of two calibrated cameras. The main objective is to solve the over-determined case, i.e., when a larger-than-minimal sample of point correspondences is given â€“ thus, estimating the motion from at least three correspondences. The algorithm requires the camera movement to be constrained to a plane, e.g. mounted to a vehicle, and the image plane to be orthogonal to the ground.1 The solver obtains the motion parameters as the roots of a 6th degree polynomial. It is validated both in synthetic experiments and on publicly available real-world datasets that using the proposed solver leads to results superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of geometric accuracy with no noticeable deterioration in the processing time.
