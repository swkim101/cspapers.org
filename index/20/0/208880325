In this paper, we present a method for calculating propagation characteristics of high - frequency radio waves reflecting one time and two times at ionospheric layer F2 under inhomogeneous conditions of the ionosphere. The proposed method provides accurate calculation of the maximum usable frequency(MUF). Results of calculating frequency dependence of radio field strength show that scattering of radio waves in the ionosphere leads to the possibility of receiving radio waves at frequencies exceeding the maximum usable frequencies.
