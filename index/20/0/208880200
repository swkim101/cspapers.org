The article proposes the new design structure for remote-continuous-automatic wastewater quality monitoring system via Internet using FTP protocol with static IP address, meeting Vietnamese government regulations. The outlet wastewater of the plant is supplied into the sample container. Here the sensors measure the pH, temperature, COD, TSS parameters displayed in the field, transmit to the local controller, then the data-logger device transmits the original measurement data to the server specified by static IP address. Website interface is also designed to control sampling, monitoring and reporting wastewater quality parameters. The system has been installed and put into operation at HPC factory since 2017. The system works stably, reliably, and good data transmission.
