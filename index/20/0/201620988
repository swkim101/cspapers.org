At leading technology nodes, the industry is facing a stiff challenge to make profitable ICs. One of the primary issues is the design rule checking (DRC) violation. In this research, we cohort with the DARPA IDEA program that aims for “no-human-in-the-loop” and 24-hour turnaround time to implement an IC from design specifications. In order to reduce human effort, we introduce the ensemble random forest algorithm to predict DRC violations before global routing, which is considered the most time-consuming step in an IC design flow. In addition, we identified features that critically impact the DRC violations. The algorithm has a 5.8% better F1-score compared to the existing SVM classifiers.
