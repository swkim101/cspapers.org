Affordable rapid 3D printing technologies have become key enablers of the Maker Movement by giving individuals the ability to create physical finished products. However, existing computer-aided design (CAD) tools that allow authoring and editing of 3D models are mostly visually reliant and limit access to people with blindness and visual impairment (BVI). In this paper I address three areas of research that I will conduct as part of my PhD dissertation towards bridging a gap between blind and sighted makers. My dissertation aims to create an accessible 3D design and printing workflow for BVI people through the use of 2.5D tactile displays, and to rigorously understand how BVI people use the workflow in the context of perception, interaction, and learning.
