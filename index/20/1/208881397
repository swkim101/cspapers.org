A new broadband high gain planar dielectric rod SIW antenna is proposed in this paper. SIW transmission line structure is applied to minimize transmission losses and Vivaldi structure is used to achieve a wide bandwidth. The proposed antenna has the high gain property (9â€“13 dBi) within the wide bandwidth of 73% from 24 GHz to 50 GHz.
