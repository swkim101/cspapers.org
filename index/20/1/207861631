Smartphones incorporate a plethora of diverse and powerful sensors that enhance user experience. Two such sensors are accelerometer and gyroscope, which measure acceleration in all three spatial dimensions and rotation along the three axes of the smartphone, respectively. These sensors are used primarily for screen rotations and advanced gaming applications. However, they can also be employed to gather information about the user's activity and phone positions. In this work, we investigate using accelerometer and gyroscope as a side-channel to learn highly sensitive information, such as the user's gender. We present an unobtrusive technique to determine the gender of a user by mining data from the smartphone sensors, which do not require explicit permissions from the user. A preliminary study conducted on 18 participants shows that we can detect the user's gender with an accuracy of 80%.
