We present GRANDPA, a finality gadget, that is a protocol that can be used to provide provable finality for a blockchain. It works in addition to a block production mechanism and a chain selection rule, that on their own would only provide eventual consensus. The design of GRANDPA aims at separating these two protocols as cleanly as possible and obtain formal guarantees for the finality gadget. GRANDPA attempts to finalise the prefix of the chain that $2/3$ of voters agree on, whether that is one or thousands blocks. It has been implemented by Parity Technologies and deployed on large testnets for the Polkadot protocol. We also present properties GRANDPA achieves and review GRANDPA's advantages in flexibility over comparable protocols.
