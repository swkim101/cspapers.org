For matching pedestrians across disjoint camera views in surveillance, person re-identification (Re-ID) has made great progress in supervised learning. However, it is infeasible to label data in a number of new scenes when extending a Re-ID system. Thus, studying unsupervised learning for Re-ID is important for saving labelling cost. Yet, cross-camera scene variation is a key challenge for unsupervised Re-ID, such as illumination, background and viewpoint variations, which cause domain shift in the feature space and result in inconsistent pairwise similarity distributions that degrade matching performance. To alleviate the effect of cross-camera scene variation, we propose a Camera-Aware Similarity Consistency Loss to learn consistent pairwise similarity distributions for intra-camera matching and cross-camera matching. To avoid learning ineffective knowledge in consistency learning, we preserve the prior common knowledge of intra-camera matching in the pretrained model as reliable guiding information, which does not suffer from cross-camera scene variation as cross-camera matching. To learn similarity consistency more effectively, we further develop a coarse-to-fine consistency learning scheme to learn consistency globally and locally in two steps. Experiments show that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art unsupervised Re-ID methods.
