A one-piece body suit of insulated construction with enlarged upper sleeve segments which permit retraction of the wearer's arm to a position alongside the upper torso preparatory to hand extension out openings located along the length of the sleeve. Hand covers are integral with lower sleeve segments and include an elastomeric coating over individual finger sheaths. Each sleeve includes Velcro closure pieces serving to retain the vacated lower sleeve segment in a folded back position alongside the upper sleeve segment.
