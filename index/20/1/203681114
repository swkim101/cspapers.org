By studying forms and growing behavior of bicarbonate crystal in circumfluent carbonizing tower, crystal forms of sodium bicarbonate in Solvay tower and outer-cooling tower are introduced. Cause of higher salt content in Hou's Process than in Ammonia Alkali Process is further explained and an idea of reducing salt content in Hou's Process is proposed through evaluating its washing performance.
