Three experiments were conducted to validate and replicate. in a different cultural setting. the results of a study by Kurosu and Kashimura [12] concerning the relationships between usersâ€™ perceptions of interface aesthetics and usability. The results support the basic tindings by Kurosu and Kashimura. Very high correlations were found between perceived aesthetics of the interface and a priori perceived ease of use of the system. Differences of magnitude between correlations obtained in Japan and in Israel suggest the existence of cross-cultural differences. but these were not in the hypothesized direction.
