In this paper, we propose XModal-ID, a novel WiFi-video cross-modal gait-based person identification system. Given the WiFi signal measured when an unknown person walks in an unknown area and a video footage of a walking person in another area, XModal-ID can determine whether it is the same person in both cases or not. XModal-ID only uses the Channel State Information (CSI) magnitude measurements of a pair of off-the-shelf WiFi transceivers. It does not need any prior wireless or video measurement of the person to be identified. Similarly, it does not need any knowledge of the operation area or person's track. Finally, it can identify people through walls. XModal-ID utilizes the video footage to simulate the WiFi signal that would be generated if the person in the video walked near a pair of WiFi transceivers. It then uses a new processing approach to robustly extract key gait features from both the real WiFi signal and the video-based simulated one, and compares them to determine if the person in the WiFi area is the same person in the video. We extensively evaluate XModal-ID by building a large test set with $8$ subjects, $2$ video areas, and $5$ WiFi areas, including 3 through-wall areas as well as complex walking paths, all of which are not seen during the training phase. Overall, we have a total of 2,256 WiFi-video test pairs. XModal-ID then achieves an $85%$ accuracy in predicting whether a pair of WiFi and video samples belong to the same person or not. Furthermore, in a ranking scenario where XModal-ID compares a WiFi sample to $8$ candidate video samples, it obtains top-1, top-2, and top-3 accuracies of $75%$, $90%$, and $97%$. These results show that XModal-ID can robustly identify new people walking in new environments, in various practical scenarios.
