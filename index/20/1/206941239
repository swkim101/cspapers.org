In this paper we describe a new system for the navigated viewing of medical image data and the different visualization concepts being realized within the system and discuss the usefulness of the different visualization modes. The system comprises a compact and mobile viewing device that can be tracked by an optical position sensor. It is capable of displaying reasonable parts of a medical image data set (i.e. CT) on its screen in relation to the spatial position regarding a patient. Requirements of simple integration in a clinical environment and various visualization modes, to be applied in maxillofacial surgery are described.
