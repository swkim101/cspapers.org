Nobel laureate, Herb Simon described design as changing existing situations into preferred situations. But Simon did not specify a medium by which we must design. As a technologist tackling challenges, I often over-rely on technology as my medium and limit my potential for impact. We can design technology, but we can also design services, processes, and organizations and much more. By more broadly understanding the media by which we can design, we can more systematically build the future in which we want to live.
