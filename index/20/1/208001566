Intrinsic image decomposition is a highly under-constrained problem that has been extensively studied by computer vision researchers. Previous methods impose additional constraints by exploiting either empirical or data-driven priors. In this paper, we revisit intrinsic image decomposition with the aid of near-infrared (NIR) imagery. We show that NIR band is considerably less sensitive to textures and can be exploited to reduce ambiguity caused by reflectance variation, promoting a simple yet powerful prior for shading smoothness. With this observation, we formulate intrinsic decomposition as an energy minimisation problem. Unlike existing methods, our energy formulation decouples reflectance and shading estimation, into a convex local shading component based on NIR-RGB image pair, and a reflectance component that encourages reflectance homogeneity both locally and globally. We further show the minimisation process can be approached by a series of multi-dimensional kernel convolutions, each within linear time complexity. To validate the proposed algorithm, a NIR-RGB dataset is captured over real-world objects, where our NIR-assisted approach demonstrates clear superiority over RGB methods.
