The I/O subsystem for the Summit supercomputer, No. 1 on the Top500 list, and its ecosystem of analysis platforms is composed of two distinct layers, namely the in-system layer and the center-wide parallel file system layer (PFS), Spider 3. The in-system layer uses node-local SSDs and provides 26.7 TB/s for reads, 9.7 TB/s for writes, and 4.6 billion IOPS to Summit. The Spider 3 PFS layer uses IBM's Spectrum Scaleâ„¢ and provides 2.5 TB/s and 2.6 million IOPS to Summit and other systems. While deploying them as two distinct layers was operationally efficient, it also presented usability challenges in terms of multiple mount points and lack of transparency in data movement. To address these challenges, we have developed novel end-to-end I/O solutions for the concerted use of the two storage layers. We present the I/O subsystem architecture, the end-to-end I/O solution space, their design considerations and our deployment experience.
