Including JavaScript code from many different hosts is a popular practice in developing web applications. For example, to include a social plugin like the Facebook Like button, a web developer needs to only include a script from facebook.net in her/his web page. However, in a web browser, all the identifiers (i.e., variable names and function names) in scripts loaded in the same frame share a single global namespace. Therefore, a script can overwrite any of the global variables and/or global functions defined in another script, causing unexpected behavior. In this work, we develop a browser-based dynamic analysis framework, that monitors and records any writes to JavaScript global variables and global functions. Our tool is able to cover all the code executed in the run time. We detected 778 conflicts across the Alexa top 1K websites. Our results show that global name conflicts can indeed expose web applications to security risks.
