In this paper, we propose a power assist device for lower back flexion and extension, when carrying a heavy load. To see the effect of the device, we model a human body and analyze a compression force in his lower back, as well as the evaluation of a supported force at a hand position. A prototype of the device is manufactured and a controller of the device is developed, which can follow a voluntary human motion assisting his strength.
