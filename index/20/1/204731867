The Wireless of the Students, by the Students, and for the Students (S3) Workshop provides a unique venue for graduate students around the world to present, discuss, and exchange ideas on cross-cutting research on mobile wireless networks. As its name suggests, the workshop is organized by students, and the technical sessions are given by student presenters. The workshop aims at fostering early-career development among students and exposing them to the workings of academic life. It provides a venue for students to learn about each other's' work and discover opportunities for collaboration. The workshop invites students to submit papers, posters, and demos. All submissions are peer-reviewed by the student program committee.
