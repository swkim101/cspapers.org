Customer care calls have served as a primary and direct channel for mobile users to communicate their needs with cellular service providers. These customer needs can be quite diverse and usually include provisioning/upgrade, account/billing, device and service performance related issues. The resolution process of these customer needs is largely manual and tedious. The resolution process not only affects the customer experience but could also entails cost on customer care and network operations of the mobile service providers. We present TREAT, which aims at automatically identifying opportunities for auto-resolving customer reported needs, and hence improving customer experiences and reducing cost for customer care and network operations.
