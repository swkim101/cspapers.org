Single shot detector simultaneously predicts object categories and regression offsets of the default boxes. Despite of high efficiency, this structure has some inappropriate designs: (1) The classification result of the default box is improperly assigned to that of the regressed box during inference, (2) Only regression once is not good enough for accurate object detection. To solve the first problem, a novel reg-offset-cls (ROC) module is proposed. It contains three hierarchical steps: box regression, the feature sampling location predication, and the regressed box classification with the features of offset locations. To further solve the second problem, a hierarchical shot detector (HSD) is proposed, which stacks two ROC modules and one feature enhanced module. The second ROC treats the regressed boxes and the feature sampling locations of features in the first ROC as the inputs. Meanwhile, the feature enhanced module injected between two ROCs aims to extract the local and non-local context. Experiments on the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the superiority of proposed HSD. Without the bells or whistles, HSD outperforms all one-stage methods at real-time speed.
