We present TEGCER, an automated feedback tool for novice programmers. TEGCER uses supervised classification to match compilation errors in new code submissions with relevant pre-existing errors, submitted by other students before. The dense neural network used to perform this classification task is trained on 15000+ error-repair code examples. The proposed model yields a test set classification Pred@3 accuracy of 97.7% across 212 error category labels. Using this model as its base, TEGCER presents students with the closest relevant examples of solutions for their specific error on demand. A large scale (N>230) usability study shows that students who use TEGCER are able to resolve errors more than 25% faster on average than students being assisted by human tutors.
