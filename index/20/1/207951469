Designing efficient cooling systems for integrated circuits (ICs) relies on a deep understanding of the electro-thermal properties of transistors. To shed light on this issue in currently fabricated Fin-FETs, a quantum mechanical solver capable of revealing atomically-resolved electron and phonon transport phenomena from first-principles is required. In this paper, we consider a global, data-centric view of a state-of-the-art quantum transport simulator to optimize its execution on supercomputers. The approach yields coarse-and fine-grained data-movement characteristics, which are used for performance and communication modeling, communication-avoidance, and data-layout transformations. The transformations are tuned for the Piz Daint and Summit supercomputers, where each platform requires different caching and fusion strategies to perform optimally. The presented results make ab initio device simulation enter a new era, where nanostructures composed of over 10,000 atoms can be investigated at an unprecedented level of accuracy, paving the way for better heat management in next-generation ICs.
