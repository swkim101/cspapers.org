Recognizing every person's action in a crowded and cluttered environment is a challenging task in computer vision. We propose to tackle this challenging problem using a holistic 4D ``scan'' of a cluttered scene to include every detail about the people and environment. This leads to a new problem, i.e., recognizing multiple people's actions in the cluttered 4D representation. At the first step, we propose a new method to track people in 4D, which can reliably detect and follow each person in real time. Then, we build a new deep neural network, the Action4DNet, to recognize the action of each tracked person. Such a model gives reliable and accurate results in the real-world settings. We also design an adaptive 3D convolution layer and a novel discriminative temporal feature learning objective to further improve the performance of our model. Our method is invariant to camera view angles, resistant to clutter and able to handle crowd. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast, reliable and accurate. Our method paves the way to action recognition in the real-world applications and is ready to be deployed to enable smart homes, smart factories and smart stores.
