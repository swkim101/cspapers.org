Pesticides are detrimental to the well-being of all living beings. Inappropriate pesticide usage has been identified as a major health hazard. Therefore, it is important to devise solutions that enable agricultural pest control without excessive use of pesticides. At present, drone technology is being increasingly applied in agriculture through soil and field analysis, planting, crop spraying, crop monitoring, irrigation and health assessment. The primary focus of this ongoing work is to leverage a swarm of drones solution that includes precision agriculture techniques, to efficiently spray pesticides in arable lands with optimal pesticides usage and minimum human intervention.
