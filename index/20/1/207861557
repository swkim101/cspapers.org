There has been a growing interest in measuring and optimizing the power efficiency of mobile apps. Traditional power evaluations rely either on inaccurate software-based solutions or on ad-hoc testbeds composed of a power meter and a mobile device. This demonstration presents BatteryLab, our solution to share existing battery testing setups to build a distributed platform for battery measurements. Our vision is to transform independent battery testing setups into vantage points of a planetary-scale measurement platform offering heterogeneous devices and testing conditions. We demonstrate BatteryLab functionalities by investigating the energy efficiency of popular websites when loaded via both Android and iOS browsers. Our demonstration is also live at https://batterylab.dev/.
