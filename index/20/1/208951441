I Due to the open nature of Android, there is a large number of third-party markets (Amazon, Yandex, F-Droid, etc.). I A certified vetting process of the Android apps is absent. I There is no centralised signing authority. I Users take all the responsibility for security decisions. I There is no possibility to prohibit installation of uncertified applications in BYOD scenarios. We would like to enable a system that maintains a list of trusted application markets and ensures that only apps from these markets can be installed on the device.
