Sentiment analysis is one of the hot demanding research areas since last few decades. Although a formidable amount of research has been done but still the existing reported solutions or available systems are far from perfect or to meet the satisfaction level of end user's. The main issue may be there are many conceptual rules that govern sentiment, and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being. Human psychology directly relates to the unrevealed clues; govern the sentiment realization of us. Human psychology relates many things like social psychology, culture, pragmatics and many more endless intelligent aspects of civilization. Proper incorporation of human psychology into computational sentiment knowledge representation may solve the problem. PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension over SentiWordNet that holds human psychological knowledge and sentiment knowledge simultaneously.
