This paper proposes preferential direction control for visual servoing based on orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems. In this paper, we present a generalized formulation of visual servoing based on curvilinear coordinate systems, which guarantees to converge an error between initial and desired positions of image feature points. Simulation results show that the formulation is effective to control the trajectories of feature points in preferred directions by applying to several curvilinear coordinate systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the preferential direction control goes well even if a different coordinate system can be adopted for each feature point. The mixed approaches with different coordinate systems can be applied to control a camera to keep image features within the field of view.
