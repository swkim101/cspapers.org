For both the traditional street-hailing taxi industry and the recently emerged on-line ride-hailing, it has been a major challenge to improve the ride-hailing marketplace efficiency due to spatio-temporal imbalance between the supply and demand, among other factors. Despite the numerous approaches to improve marketplace efficiency using pricing and dispatch strategies, they usually optimize pricing or dispatch separately. In this paper, we show that these two processes are in fact intrinsically interrelated. Motivated by this observation, we make an attempt to simultaneously optimize pricing and dispatch strategies. However, such a joint optimization is extremely challenging due to the inherent huge scale and lack of a uniform model of the problem. To handle the high complexity brought by the new problem, we propose InBEDE (Integrating contextual Bandit with tEmporal DiffErence learning), a learning framework where pricing strategies are learned via a contextual bandit algorithm, and the dispatch strategies are optimized with the help of temporal difference learning. The two learning components proceed in a mutual bootstrapping manner, in the sense that the policy evaluations of the two components are inter-dependent. Evaluated with real-world datasets of two Chinese cities from Didi Chuxing, an online ride-hailing platform, we show that the market efficiency of the ride-hailing platform can be significantly improved using InBEDE.
