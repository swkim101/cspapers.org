Internet of Things applications typically run on the cloud and away from the end devices, leading to potential privacy and security risks, lower latency, and reduced reliability. Such deployments commonly use gateways to aggregate and send device data to the cloud. We hypothesize that these gateways are underutilized and can perform more than just packet forwarding. This work is an attempt to build a distributed platform over such gateways, with an objective to push applications to the edge of the network to overcome the shortcomings of the cloud. Our solution enables heterogeneous gateways to discover each other, and provides programming interfaces for developers to run applications on the platform without having to deal with the underlying network and device complexities. We showcase two applications that use our APIs, and also demonstrate how end users can interact with the platform via their personal computers (smartphones, laptops, etc.).
