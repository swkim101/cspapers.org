This abstract presents a collection of cluster- ing and decomposition techniques enabling the construc- tion of sparse and locality preserving representations for arbitrary networks. These new clustering techniques have already found several powerful applications in the area of distributed network algorithms. Two of these applications are described in this abstract, namely, routing with poly- nomial communication-space tradeoff and online tracking of mobile users.
