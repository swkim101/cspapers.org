While eye tracking has been typically used for achieving intuitive user interfaces, it is not sufficient when it comes to dealing with multiple-display environments. In such environments, which have become popular recently, the point-of-gaze should be estimated on multiple screens. Therefore, we propose a cross-ratio based gaze estimation using a polarization camera for multiple screens. The point-of-gaze can be estimated on each monitor by identifying the screen reflected on the corneal surface at a polarization angle. Near-infrared light emitting diodes (NIR-LEDs) attached to the display are not required. This means that standard displays can be used with high general versatility as an advantage.
