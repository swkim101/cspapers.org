Biometric authentication, a key component for many secure protocols and applications, is a process of authenticating a user by matching her biometric data against a biometric database stored at a server managed by an entity. If there is a match, the user can log into her account or obtain the services provided by the entity. Privacy-preserving biometric authentication (PPBA) considers a situation where the biometric data are kept private during the authentication process. That is the user's biometric data record is never disclosed to the entity, and the data stored in the entity's biometric database are never disclosed to the user. Due to the reduction in operational costs and high computing power, it is beneficial for an entity to outsource not only its data but also computations such as biometric authentication process to a cloud. However, due to well-documented security risks faced by a cloud, sensitive data like biometrics should be encrypted first and then outsourced to the cloud. When the biometric data are encrypted and cannot be decrypted by the cloud, the existing PPBA protocols are not applicable. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a two-party PPBA protocol when the biometric data in consideration are fully encrypted and outsourced to a cloud. In the proposed protocol, the security of the biometric data is completely protected since the encrypted biometric data are never decrypted during the authentication process. In addition, we formally analyze the security of the proposed protocol and provide extensive empirical results to show its runtime complexity.
