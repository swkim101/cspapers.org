Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA) update technology is required to keep the software of the massively deployed Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) devices up to date. However, when there are many nodes in a WSN and the cellular network connects the server and the WSN, the traditional method of transferring data directly from the server to the end node can be costly. We propose a Two-Phase FOTA Dissemination Scheme to address the communication cost problem by reducing traffic between WSN and external networks. This demonstration shows that the two-phase update reduces traffic between the external network and the WSN.
