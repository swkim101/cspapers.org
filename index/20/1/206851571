In this paper, a wearable hand exoskeleton with force-controllable and compact actuator modules is proposed. In order to apply force feedback accurately while allowing natural finger motions, the exoskeleton linkage structure with three degrees of freedom (DOFs) was designed, which was inspired by the muscular skeletal structure of the finger. As an actuating system, a series elastic actuator (SEA) mechanism, which consisted of a small linear motor, a manually designed motor driver, a spring and potentiometers, was applied. The friction of the motor was identified and compensated for obtaining a linearized model of the actuating system. Using a LQ (linear quadratic) tuned PD (proportional and derivative) controller and a disturbance observer (DOB), the proposed actuator module could generate the desired force accurately with actual finger movements. By integrating together the proposed exoskeleton structure, actuator modules and control algorithms, a wearable hand exoskeleton with force-controllable and compact actuator modules was developed to deliver accurate force to the fingertips for flexion/extension motions.
