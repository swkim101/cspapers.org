Recognizing visual unseen classes, i.e. for which no training data is available, is known as Zero Shot Learning (ZSL). Some of the best performing methods apply the triplet loss to seen classes to learn a mapping between visual representations of images and attribute vectors that constitute class prototypes. They nevertheless make several implicit assumptions that limit their performance on real use cases, particularly with fine-grained datasets comprising a large number of classes. We identify three of these assumptions and put forward corresponding novel contributions to address them. Our approach consists in taking into account both inter-class and intra-class relations, respectively by being more permissive with confusions between similar classes, and by penalizing visual samples which are atypical to their class. The approach is tested on four datasets, including the large-scale ImageNet, and exhibits performances significantly above recent methods, even generative methods based on more restrictive hypotheses.
