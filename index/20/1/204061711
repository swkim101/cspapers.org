This paper, part of a research project focusing soap-opera, intends to raise and discuss preliminary information and remarks. The corpus for the present study consists on the soap-opera A Favorita (Brasil, 2008/2009, Joao Emanuel Carneiro, Rede Globo de Televisao), which deals with aspects and values attached to the problem of representation of places and roles considering the sphere of family and gender relations. Mixing up traditional melodramatic elements and comic devices, A Favorita places verossimility parameters in parentheses and introduces a new narrative feature into the evening schedule soap-opera: the exploration of ludicity and experimentalism.
