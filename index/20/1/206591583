We present a novel clustering algorithm for tagging a face dataset (e. g., a personal photo album). The core of the algorithm is a new dissimilarity, called Rank-Order distance, which measures the dissimilarity between two faces using their neighboring information in the dataset. The Rank-Order distance is motivated by an observation that faces of the same person usually share their top neighbors. Specifically, for each face, we generate a ranking order list by sorting all other faces in the dataset by absolute distance (e. g., L1 or L2 distance between extracted face recognition features). Then, the Rank-Order distance of two faces is calculated using their ranking orders. Using the new distance, a Rank-Order distance based clustering algorithm is designed to iteratively group all faces into a small number of clusters for effective tagging. The proposed algorithm outperforms competitive clustering algorithms in term of both precision/recall and efficiency.
