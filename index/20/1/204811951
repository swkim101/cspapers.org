Pneu-Multi-Tools is a novel passive haptic feedback (PHF) wearable device that let users grip different shapes of virtual props in virtual reality(VR) with sensing the shape changes of foldable airbags driven by pneumatics. The solution to the limitation of primitive shapes in haptic interfaces for VR in the past is proposed in this research. TPU films can be manufactured into 4 kinds of folding shapes(clip, rectangle, cylinder and cone shape) owing to the numbers and orientation of folding hinges on a single airbag. Therefore, Pneu-Multi-Tools, which is stacked with different folding shapes of airbags and capable of automatically folding, enables users to use multi-props intuitively in VR games. There are 3 interaction scenarios are provided by this interface: "Pick-Up", "Order" and "Hot Key" in multi-props games to make it possible for users to switch the props more efficiently.
