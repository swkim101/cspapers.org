We present a demonstration of SDC, a low-cost closed-loop microwave oven system that aims to heat the food in a software-defined thermal trajectory. SDC achieves this through a novel high-resolution heat sensing and actuation system that uses microwave-safe components to augment existing microwaves. In this demo, we demonstrate our experimental test-bed, a modified commercial off-the-shelf microwave oven, and show a SDC-enabled microwave can be enlisted to perform unexpected cooking tasks: cooking meat and fat in bacon discriminatively and heating rice uniformly.
