Recently, progress has been made in the application of neural networks to the numerical analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs). In the latter the variational formulation of the Poisson problem is used in order to obtain an objective function - a regularised Dirichlet energy - that was used for the optimisation of some neural networks. In this notes we use the notion of $\Gamma$-convergence to show that ReLU networks of growing architecture that are trained with respect to suitably regularised Dirichlet energies converge to the true solution of the Poisson problem. We discuss how this approach generalises to arbitrary variational problems under certain universality assumptions of neural networks and see that this covers some nonlinear stationary PDEs like the $p$-Laplace.
