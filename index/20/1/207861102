Collaboration of batteryless nodes is essential to their success in replacing traditional battery-based systems. This abstract describes a demonstration of the recently proposed Shepherd testbed that allows to record and reproduce spatio-temporal characteristics of real energy environments. It consists of a number of spatially distributed Shepherd nodes that are tightly time-synchronized with each other and record synchronized energy traces with a resolution of 3 μA and 50 μV at a rate of 100 kHz. Additionally, Shepherd can faithfully replay these traces to any number of nodes to study their behavior, both individually and as an ensemble. Shepherd works with various sources of energy harvesting, such as kinetic or solar, is based on a modular design and provides a generic interface for sensor nodes allowing users to experiment with new platforms.
