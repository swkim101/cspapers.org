Augmented reality requires precise and instant overlay of digital information onto everyday objects. We present our work on LightAnchors, a new method for displaying spatially-anchored data. We take advantage of pervasive point lights - such as LEDs and light bulbs - for both in-view anchoring and data transmission. These lights are blinked at high speed to encode data. We built a proof-of-concept ap-plication that runs on iOS without any hardware or software modifications. We also ran a study to characterize the performance of LightAnchors and built eleven example demos to highlight the potential of our approach.
