We propose an auditory card game system towards playing equally with others, regardless of whether they have a visual impairment or not. To develop an audible card game system, we convert a Japanese traditional card game: Karuta into tablet devices which emit identificated sound signals, respectively. The proposed method makes it possible to boost the sense of victory and rivalry even without visually information.
