Contactless wireless sensing without attaching a device to the target has achieved promising progress in recent years. However, one severe limitation in this field is the limited sensing range. This paper presents WideSee to realize wide-area sensing with only one transceiver pair. WideSee utilizes the LoRa signal to achieve a larger range of sensing and further incorporates drone's mobility to broaden the sensing area. We have developed a working prototype of WideSee for human target detection and localization that are especially useful in emergency scenarios like rescue and terrorist search. We also evaluated WideSee with field study in a high-rise building, which demonstrates the great potential of WideSee for supporting wide-area contactless sensing applications with a single LoRa transceiver pair hosted on a drone.
