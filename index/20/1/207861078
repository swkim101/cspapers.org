Hidden electronics possess the risk of both security threat and privacy intrusion. We present a wireless hidden electronic recognition system, through electronic components unique mmWave nonlinear responses to identify the threats. We then evaluate E-Eye's performance and robustness with a controlled experiment and a field study using iconic devices and score the system with metrics. Results prove that E-Eye is an accurate and robust hidden electronic recognition system.
