Real-time systems with hard timing constrains require known upper bounds on each task's worst-case execution time (WCET) to determine if all deadlines can be met. One challenge in predictable execution is that Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) cells must be refreshed periodically to maintain data validity, yet memory remains blocked during refresh, which results in overly pessimistic WCET bounds. This work contributes "Colored Refresh" to hide DRAM refresh overhead while preserving real-time schedulability for cyclic executives, which are widely used in highly critical systems. Colored Refresh partitions DRAM memory at rank granularity such that refreshes rotate round-robin from rank to rank. Real-time tasks are assigned different ranks via colored memory allocation. By cooperatively scheduling real-time tasks and refresh operations, memory requests no longer suffer from refresh interference. This reduces memory access latencies for tasks irrespective of DRAM density and size. Hence, Colored Refresh reduces a task's WCET and makes its execution more predictable.
