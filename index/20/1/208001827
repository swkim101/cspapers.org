Object detection models have been a source of inspiration for many tracking-by-detection algorithms over the past decade. Recent deep trackers borrow designs or modules from the latest object detection methods, such as bounding box regression, RPN and ROI pooling, and can deliver impressive performance. In this paper, instead of redesigning a new tracking-by-detection algorithm, we aim to explore a general framework for building trackers directly upon almost any advanced object detector. To achieve this, three key gaps must be bridged: (1) Object detectors are class-specific, while trackers are class-agnostic. (2) Object detectors do not differentiate intra-class instances, while this is a critical capability of a tracker. (3) Temporal cues are important for stable long-term tracking while they are not considered in still-image detectors. To address the above issues, we first present a simple target-guidance module for guiding the detector to locate target-relevant objects. Then a meta-learner is adopted for the detector to fast learn and adapt a target-distractor classifier online. We further introduce an anchored updating strategy to alleviate the problem of overfitting. The framework is instantiated on SSD and FasterRCNN, the typical one- and two-stage detectors, respectively. Experiments on OTB, UAV123 and NfS have verified our framework and show that our trackers can benefit from deeper backbone networks, as opposed to many recent trackers.
