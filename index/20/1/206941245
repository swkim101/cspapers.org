A new type of robot system supported by wire cable drive actuators is proposed in order to convey heavy load, or to lighten the mass and inertia of the system. This system has a serial-link robot and wire drive actuators. The robot and the wire drive actuators are connected by wire cables. In this paper, a two-links robot with a wire cable is investigated as the first report. In this system, both joint torque and wire tension must cooperate together, so a control scheme in the task oriented coordinates for the robot is also proposed. The motion stability is analyzed by using a Lyapunov function. Finally the usefulness of the proposed system is demonstrated through some simulation results.
