In Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), learners face a lot of distractions which will cause divided attention (DA). However, it is not easy for learners to realize that they are distracted and to find out which part of the course they have missed. In this paper, we present Reminder, a system for detecting divided attention and reminding learners what they just missed on both PC and mobile devices with a camera capturing their status. To get learners' attention level, we build a regression model to predict attention score from an integrated feature vector. Meanwhile, we design an interactively updating method to make the model adaptive to a specific user. We also propose a visualization method to help learners review missed content easily. User study shows that Reminder detects learners' divided attention and assists them to review missed course contents effectively.
