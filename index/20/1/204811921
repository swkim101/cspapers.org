Prior work on choreographic learning support systems lacks supports of group dancers. In particular, existing systems cannot quantify the degree of synchronization, which is a critical factor for successful group dancing. In this paper, we create a system to support multi-person choreographic learning. The system visualizes body parts of dancers which are out of synchronization. Our interface aims to enable dancers to quickly identify moments where they need additional practice. This paper presents our current prototype interface and demonstration.
