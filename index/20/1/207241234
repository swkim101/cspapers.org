Mobile edge clouds (MECs) are small cloud-like infrastructures deployed in close proximity to users, allowing users to have seamless and low-latency access to cloud services. When users move across different locations, their service applications often need to be migrated to follow the user so that the benefit of MEC is maintained. In this paper, we propose a layered framework for migrating running applications that are encapsulated either in virtual machines (VMs) or containers. We evaluate the migration performance of various real applications under the proposed framework.
