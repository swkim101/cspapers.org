Autonomous vehicles need an accurate, up-to-date, 3D map to localize themselves with respect to their surroundings. Today, map collection runs infrequently and uses a ﬂeet of specialized vehicles. In this paper, we explore a different approach: near-real time crowd-sourced 3D map collection from vehicles with advanced sensors (LiDAR, stereo cameras). Our main technical challenge is to ﬁnd a lean representation of a 3D map such that new map segments, or updates to existing maps, are compact enough to upload in near real-time over a cellular network. To this end, we develop CarMap, 12 which ﬁnds a parsimonious representation of a feature map, contains novel object ﬁltering and position-based feature matching techniques to improve localization robustness, and incorporates a novel stitching algorithm to combine map segments from multiple vehicles for unmapped road segments and an efﬁcient map-update operation for updating existing segments. Evaluations show that CarMap takes less than a second to update a map, reduces map sizes by 75 × relative to competing strategies, has higher localization accuracy, and is able to localize in corner cases when other approaches fail.
