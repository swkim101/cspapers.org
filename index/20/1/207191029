Motion sensing is of fundamental importance for user interfaces and input devices. In applications, where optical sensing is preferred, traditional camera-based approaches can be prohibitive due to limited resolution, low frame rates and the required computational power for image processing. We introduce a novel set of motion-sensing configurations based on laser speckle sensing that are particularly suitable for human-computer interaction. The underlying principles allow these configurations to be fast, precise, extremely compact and low cost. We provide an overview and design guidelines for laser speckle sensing for user interaction and introduce four general speckle projector/sensor configurations. We describe a set of prototypes and applications that demonstrate the versatility of our laser speckle sensing techniques.
