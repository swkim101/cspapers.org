This paper presents a new approach to the characterization of tactile array sensors that aims to reduce the computational time needed for convergence to obtain a useful estimator for normal and shear forces. This is achieved by breaking up the sensor characterization into two parts: a linear regression portion using multivariate least squares regression, and a nonlinear regression portion using a neural network as a multi-input, multi-output function approximator. This procedure has been termed Least Squares Artificial Neural Network (LSANN). By applying LSANN on the 2nd generation MIT Cheetah footpad, the convergence speed for the estimator of the normal and shear forces is improved by 59.2% compared to using only the neural network alone. The normalized root mean squared error between the two methods are nearly identical at 1.17% in the normal direction, and 8.30% and 10.14% in the shear directions. This approach could have broader implications in greatly reducing the amount of time needed to train a contact force estimator for a large number of tactile sensor arrays (i.e. in robotic hands and skin).
