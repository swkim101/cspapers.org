Identity and authentication solutions often lack usability and scalability, or do not provide high enough authentication assurance. The concept of Lucidman (Local User-Centric Identity Management) is an approach to providing scalable, secure and user friendly identity and authentication functionalities. In this context we demonstrate the use of an OffPAD (Offline Personal Authentication Device) as a trusted device to support different forms of authentication. The Lucidman/OffPAD approach consists of locating the identity management and authentication functionalities on the user side instead of on the server side or in the cloud. This demo aims to show how OffPAD strengthens authentication assurance, improves usability, minimizes trust requirements, and has the advantage that trusted online interaction can be achieved even on malware infected client platforms. The trusted device OffPAD has been designed as a phone cover, therefore not requiring the user to carry an extra gadget. We focus on six demonstrators, three useful in e-banking and three in the hospital domain where nurses, doctors, or patients are authenticated and access is granted in various situations base on the OffPAD.
