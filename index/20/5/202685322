This is a philosophical question, not a scientific one. There are man y ex mples of AI-systems whose products appear to be creati ve, and whose processing fits the criteria of combination, exploration, or transformation. (Arguably, thatâ€™s strictly true of transformation only if the system is linked to contingencies e xternal to the program.) But could an y of them, or any concei vable computer-based system, be "really" creati ve? That raises queries about whether "real" creati vity must involve autonomy, intentionality, valuation, emotion, and consciousness. The answer , in each case, is yes (sometimes, with qualifications). However, these concepts are hugely contro versial in themselves, quite apart from their relation to creativity--and/or to AI. It follows that no clear answer can be gi v n to the title-question. It remains open, until we ha ve clear--and credible--accounts of all these matters.
