Predictive maintenance has evolved from a vision to reality for several industries. Notwithstanding, there is not yet a clear view on the behavior of the algorithmic tools proposed. The aim of this work is to fill this gap and perform an insightful comparison and sensitivity analysis of the main representatives for event-based predictive maintenance, which typically rely on pattern mining and machine learning. We provide a publicly available environment to compare techniques and we perform extensive experiments. The results of our work show that fine tuning is required and judicious feature generation and selection are two important aspects in efficiently predicting faults.
