Impedance and Admittance Control are two distinct implementations of the same control goal. It is well known that their stability and performance properties are complementary. In this paper, we present a hybrid system approach, which incorporates Impedance and Admittance Control as two extreme cases of one family of controllers. This approach allows to continuously switch and interpolate between Impedance and Admittance Control. We compare the basic stability and performance properties of the resulting controllers by means of an extensive case study of a one-dimensional system and present an experimental evaluation using the KUKA-DLR-lightweight arm.
