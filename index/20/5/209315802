We present a deterministic , truly subquadratic algorithm for oﬄine (1 + ε )-approximate nearest or farthest neighbor search (in particular, the closest pair or diameter problem) in Hamming space in any dimension d ≤ n δ , for a suf- ﬁciently small constant δ > 0. The running time of the algorithm is roughly n 2 − ε 1 / 2+ O ( δ ) for nearest neighbors, or n 2 − Ω( √ ε/ log(1 /ε )) for farthest. The algorithm follows from a simple combination of expander walks, Chebyshev polyno- mials, and rectangular matrix multiplication. We also show how to eliminate errors in the previous Monte Carlo randomized algorithm of Alman, Chan, and Williams [FOCS’16] for oﬄine approximate nearest or far- thest neighbors, and obtain a Las Vegas randomized algorithm with expected running time n 2 − Ω( ε 1 / 3 / log(1 /ε )) . Finally, we note a simpliﬁcation of Alman, Chan, and Williams’ method and obtain a slightly improved Monte Carlo randomized algorithm with running time n 2 − Ω( ε 1 / 3 / log 2 / 3 (1 /ε )) . As one application, we obtain improved deterministic and randomized (1+ ε )-approximation algorithms for MAX-SAT.
