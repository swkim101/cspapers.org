We first describe a surface realizer forUniversal Dependencies (UD) structures. The system uses a symbolic approach to transform the dependency tree into a tree of constituents that is transformed into an English sentence by an existing realizer. This approach was then adapted for the two shared tasks of SRâ€™19. The system is quite fast and showed competitive results for English sentences using automatic and manual evaluation measures.
