This paper describes an important first step in the development of a custom wearable health platform that allows the end-to-end secure monitoring of six vital parameters. We explore the impact of wireless network protocols and security schemes on the energy consumption of the wearable device. The results show that the energy efficiency is comparable to existing systems that support far less sensor data and that compromise on end-to-end security.
