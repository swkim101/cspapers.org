Single-image super-resolution restores the lost structures and textures from low-resolved images, which has achieved extensive attention from the research community. The top performers in this field include deep or wide convolutional neural networks, or recurrent neural networks. However, the methods enforce a single model to process all kinds of textures and structures. A typical operation is that a certain layer restores the textures based on the ones recovered by the preceding layers, ignoring the characteristics of image textures. In this paper, we believe that the lower-frequency and higher-frequency information in images have different levels of complexity and should be restored by models of different representational capacity. Inspired by this, we propose a novel embedded block residual network (EBRN) which is an incremental recovering progress for texture super-resolution. Specifically, different modules in the model restores information of different frequencies. For lower-frequency information, we use shallower modules of the network to recover; for higher-frequency information, we use deeper modules to restore. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed EBRN model achieves superior performance and visual improvements against the state-of-the-arts.
