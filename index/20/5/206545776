For the constantly growing service robotic market there is a demand for new energy-efficient and economically priced actuation-concepts. This paper describes the QuadHelix-Drive, a novel rope actuator of high power density with a simple working principle. It highlights the technical challenges, which evolved while examining the DoHelix-Muscle-Concept. A strategy to overcome these challenges and a prototypic mechanical realization of this new actuator concept are illustrated. The integration of the QuadHelix-Drive into the Fraunhofer IPA testing facility is described and at the end possible robotic application scenarios are outlined.
