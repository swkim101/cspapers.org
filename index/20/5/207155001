FAÇADE (Fast and Automatic Clustering Approach to Data Engineering) is a spatial clustering tool that can discover clusters of different sizes, shapes, and densities in noisy spatial data. Compared with the existing clustering methods, FAÇADE has several advantages: first, it separates true data and noise more effectively. Second, most steps of FAÇADE are automatic. Third, it requires only O(nlogn) time. 2D and 3D visualizations are used in FAÇADE to assist parameter selection and result evaluation.
