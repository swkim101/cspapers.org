We describe input devices and two-handed interaction techniques to support map navigation tasks. We discuss several design variations and user testing of two-handed navigation techniques, including puck and stylus input on a Wacom tablet, as well as a novel design incorporating a touchpad (for the nonpreferred hand) and a mouse (for the preferred hand). To support the latter technique, we introduce a new input device, the TouchMouse, which is a standard mouse augmented with a pair of one-bit touch sensors, one for the palm and one for the index finger. Finally, we propose several enhancements to Buxtonâ€™s three-state model of graphical input and extend this model to encompass two-handed input transactions as well.
