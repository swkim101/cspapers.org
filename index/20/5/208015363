Research in data warehousing and OLAP has produced important technologies for the design, management and use of information systems for decision support. Much of the interest and success in this area can be attributed to the need for software and tools to improve data management and analysis given the large amount of information that are being accumulated in corporate as well as scientific databases. However, even though the high maturity of these technologies, new data needs or applications currently run at companies not only demand more capacity, but also new methods, models, techniques and architectures to satisfy these needs. 
 
The ACM International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP -- DOLAP is an annual event that provides an international forum where both researchers and practitioners can share their findings in theoretical foundations, current methodologies, practical experiences, and new research directions in the areas of data warehousing and online analytical processing. 
 
This year the call for papers attracted 33 submissions from all the five continents. After a careful review the program committee accepted 10 full papers and 8 short ones, making an overall acceptance rate of 54% (30% for full papers). The paper topics reflect the hot issues in the data warehouse area: warehousing and OLAP on complex data, performance optimization and benchmarking, ontology-based OLAP, approximate query answering, data warehouse design in complex or distributed architectures. The presentations have been organized in four sessions: Data Warehouse Design and Maintainability, OLAP Query Processing and Trends, Performance Optimization and Benchmarking, and Warehousing of Complex Data.
