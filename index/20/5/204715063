Achievable capacity in multi-hop wireless networks is seriously lower than single-hop communication. Two full-duplex nodes potentially have 2× capacity in wireless communications, compared to two half-duplex nodes. Organize the two nodes as one unit and reorganize nodes to be the units in multi-hop paths, the capacity can achieve 1× to 2× under space division simultaneous transmission mode, which is verified by analysis and simulation results.
