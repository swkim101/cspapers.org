Following three successful workshops of NSDR at SIGCOMM 2007, SIGCOMM 2008 and SOSP 2009, the 4th ACM Workshop on Networked Systems for Developing Regions (NSDR'10) will provide a venue for researchers to propose and discuss ideas concerning the design, implementation and evaluation of new computing and communications technologies to support the sustainable development of developing regions. The 4th NSDR workshop is also merging efforts with the ACM Wireless Networks and Systems for Developing Regions workshop (WiNS-DR) which was colocated with MobiCom 2008.
