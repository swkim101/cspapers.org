As computational thinking becomes a fundamental skill for the 21st century, K-12 teachers should be exposed to computing principles. This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a computational thinking module in a required course for elementary and secondary education majors. We summarize the results from open-ended and multiple-choice questionnaires given both before and after the module to assess the students' attitudes toward and understanding of computational thinking. The results suggest that given relevant information about computational thinking, education students' attitudes toward computer science becomes more favorable and they will be more likely to integrate computing principles in their future teaching.
