Electric Vehicle (EV) optimization involves stringent constraints on driving range and battery lifetime. Sophisticated embedded systems and huge number of computing resources have enabled researchers to implement advanced Battery Management Systems (BMS) for optimizing the driving range and battery lifetime. However, the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control and BMS have not been considered together in this optimization. This paper presents a novel automotive climate control methodology that manages the HVAC power consumption to improve the battery lifetime and driving range. Our experiments demonstrate that the HVAC consumption is considerable and flexible in an EV which significantly influences the driving range and battery lifetime. Hence, this influence on the above-mentioned constraints has been modeled and analyzed precisely, then it has been considered thoroughly in the EV optimization process. Our methodology provides significant improvement in battery lifetime (on average 14%) and average power consumption (on average 39% reduction) compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.
