Hardware-software co-simulation refers to verifying that hardware and software function correctly together. This has traditionally been a task performed after the prototype hardware is available using in-circuit emulators and other techniques. With hardware-software co-design and embedded processors within large single ICs, it is more necessary to verify correct functionality before the hardware is built. This paper surveys the techniques available for co-simulation with an eye toward the strengths and weaknesses of each.
