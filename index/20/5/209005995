This paper presents Transys, a tool for translating security critical properties written for one hardware design to analogous properties suitable for a second design. Transys works in three passes adjusting the variable names, arithmetic expressions, logical preconditions, and timing constraints of the original property to retain the intended semantics of the property while making it valid for the second design. We evaluate Transys by translating 27 assertions written in a temporal logic and 9 properties written for use with gate level information flow tracking across 38 AES designs, 3 RSA designs, and 5 RISC processor designs. Transys successfully translates 96% of the properties. Among these, the translation of 23 (64%) of the properties achieved a semantic equivalence rate of above 60%. The average translation time per property is about 70 seconds.
