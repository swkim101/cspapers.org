Graph-based semi-supervised learning has been shown to be one of the most effective classification approaches, as it can exploit connectivity patterns between labeled and unlabeled samples to improve learning performance. However, we show that existing techniques perform poorly when labeled data are severely limited. To address the problem of semi-supervised learning in the presence of severely limited labeled samples, we propose a new framework, called {\em Shoestring}, that incorporates metric learning into the paradigm of graph-based semi-supervised learning. In particular, our base model consists of a graph embedding network, followed by a metric learning network that learns a semantic metric space to represent the semantic similarity between the sparsely labeled and large numbers of unlabeled samples. Then the classification can be performed by clustering the unlabeled samples according to the learned semantic space. We empirically demonstrate Shoestring's superiority over many baselines, including graph convolutional networks, label propagation and their recent label-efficient variations (IGCN and GLP). We show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for node classification in the low-data regime. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on image classification tasks in the few-shot learning regime, with significant gains on miniImageNet ($2.57\%\sim3.59\%$) and tieredImageNet ($1.05\%\sim2.70\%$).
