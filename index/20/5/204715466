The growing trend of multi-device ownerships creates a need and an opportunity to use applications across multiple devices. However, in general, the current app development and usage still remain within the single-device paradigm, falling far short of user expectations. For example, it is currently not possible for a user to dynamically partition an existing live streaming app with chatting capabilities across different devices, such that she watches her favorite broadcast on her smart TV while real-time chatting on her smartphone. In this paper, we present FLUID, a new Android-based multi-device platform that enables innovative ways of using multiple devices. FLUID aims to i) allow users to migrate or replicate individual user interfaces (UIs) of a single app on multiple devices (high flexibility), ii) require no additional development effort to support unmodified, legacy applications (ease of development), and iii) support a wide range of apps that follow the trend of using custom-made UIs (wide applicability). Previous approaches, such as screen mirroring, app migration, and customized apps utilizing multiple devices, do not satisfy those goals altogether. FLUID, on the other hand, meets the goals by carefully analyzing which UI states are necessary to correctly render UI objects, deploying only those states on different devices, supporting cross-device function calls transparently, and synchronizing the UI states of replicated UI objects across multiple devices. Our evaluation with 20 unmodified, real-world Android apps shows that FLUID can transparently support a wide range of apps and is fast enough for interactive use.
