The US Bureau of Mines is developing ways of detecting changes in rock strata and using this information to control equipment and optimize support selection. One system being developed is discussed that monitors the drilling operation and uses pattern recognition and analytical formulas to evaluate geologic information so that an expert system can make decisions on support selection. Eventually this information will be used for equipment control, support selection, and input to long-term mine designs.
