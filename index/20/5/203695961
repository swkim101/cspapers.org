Welcome to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). This year ICSE takes place in Buenos Aires, Argentina. For the first time in its 42 years of history, ICSE visits Latin America. From the rich set of events and activities that we have scheduled for this week, there is no doubt that ICSE 2017 will be as lively and as interesting as its host city. 
 
As the ACM/IEEE flagship conference in the field, ICSE was met with its usual dose of enthusiasm by researchers, educators, and practitioners. Overall, we received over 1700 submissions for the different tracks, workshops, and co-located events. All tracks and events followed a rigorous evaluation procedure designed to ensure a high quality program for researchers and practitioners alike.
