With microprocessing power greatly increasing, hardware is no longer a hurdle in the development of controllers for wearable robotic systems, specifically lower limb robots. The challenge remains in developing smart algorithms that are able to detect which task a person is about to perform and then determine the correct desired movements for the robotic system. This paper reflects on four existing control algorithms for the task of level ground walking, and then presents theory and test results of a novel control algorithm based on phase plane invariants. The goal of this paper is to produce the correct motor reference command in a continuous fashion rather than based on determining distinct states for a given task.
