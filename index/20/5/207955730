Image dehazing is a well-known ill-posed problem, which usually requires some image priors to make the problem well-posed. We propose an effective iteration algorithm with deep CNNs to learn haze-relevant priors for image dehazing. We formulate the image dehazing problem as the minimization of a variational model with favorable data fidelity terms and prior terms to regularize the model. We solve the variational model based on the classical gradient descent method with built-in deep CNNs so that iteration-wise image priors for the atmospheric light, transmission map and clear image can be well estimated. Our method combines the properties of both the physical formation of image dehazing as well as deep learning approaches. We show that it is able to generate clear images as well as accurate atmospheric light and transmission maps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods in both benchmark datasets and real-world images.
