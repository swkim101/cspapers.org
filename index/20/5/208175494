The TextGraphs-13 Shared Task on Explanation Regeneration (Jansen and Ustalov, 2019) asked participants to develop methods to reconstruct gold explanations for elementary science questions.

Our leaderboard submission placed us 3rd in the competition, but we present here three methods of increasing sophistication, each of which scored successively higher on the test set after the competition close.
