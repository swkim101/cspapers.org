Trajectory prediction for objects is challenging and critical for various applications (e.g., autonomous driving, and anomaly detection). Most of the existing methods focus on homogeneous pedestrian trajectories prediction, where pedestrians are treated as particles without size. However, they fall short of handling crowded vehicle-pedestrian-mixed scenes directly since vehicles, limited with kinematics in reality, should be treated as rigid, non-particle objects ideally. In this paper, we tackle this problem using separate LSTMs for heterogeneous vehicles and pedestrians. Specifically, we use an oriented bounding box to represent each vehicle, calculated based on its position and orientation, to denote its kinematic trajectories. We then propose a framework called VP-LSTM to predict the kinematic trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians simultaneously. In order to evaluate our model, a large dataset containing the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in vehicle-pedestrian-mixed scenes is specially built. Through comparisons between our method with state-of-the-art approaches, we show the effectiveness and advantages of our method on kinematic trajectories prediction in vehicle-pedestrian-mixed scenes.
