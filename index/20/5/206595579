Due to its low storage cost and fast query speed, cross-modal hashing (CMH) has been widely used for similarity search in multimedia retrieval applications. However, most existing CMH methods are based on hand-crafted features which might not be optimally compatible with the hash-code learning procedure. As a result, existing CMH methods with hand-crafted features may not achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a novel CMH method, called deep cross-modal hashing (DCMH), by integrating feature learning and hash-code learning intothe same framework. DCMH is an end-to-end learning framework with deep neural networks, one for each modality, to perform feature learning from scratch. Experiments on three real datasets with image-text modalities show that DCMH can outperform other baselines to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval applications.
