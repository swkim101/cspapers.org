In this paper, we investigate the audio-visual event localization problem. This task is to localize a visible and audible event in a video. Previous methods first divide a video into short segments, and then fuse visual and acoustic features at the segment level. The duration of these segments is usually short, making the visual and acoustic feature of each segment possibly not well aligned. Direct concatenation of the two features at the segment level can be vulnerable to a minor temporal misalignment of the two signals. We propose a Dual Attention Matching (DAM) module to cover a longer video duration for better high-level event information modeling, while the local temporal information is attained by the global cross-check mechanism. Our premise is that one should watch the whole video to understand the high-level event, while shorter segments should be checked in detail for localization. Specifically, the global feature of one modality queries the local feature in the other modality in a bi-directional way. With temporal co-occurrence encoded between auditory and visual signals, DAM can be readily applied in various audio-visual event localization tasks, e.g., cross-modality localization, supervised event localization. Experiments on the AVE dataset show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.
