Template matching methods can benefit from multi-cores architecture in order to parallelise and accelerate the matching of multiple templates. We present WLCSSCuda: a GPU accelerated implementation of the Warping Longest Common Subsequence (WLCSS) pattern recognition algorithm. We evaluate our method on 4 NVIDIA GPUs and 4 multi-cores CPUs. We observe a 67-times speedup for the GPU implementation in the best case against the multithreaded CPU implementation.
