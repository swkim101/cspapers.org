A total of 116 papers and two panel proposals were submitted this year, a small increase over the number submitted last year. The symposium has continued to attract international interest. We received papers from authors in 18 different countries on four continents. Of these, we accepted papers from five different countries on the same four continents. The Program Committee had members from four different countries. (Originally, the committee represented six countries, but two of the members moved, thus reducing the country count.)
