Real-time generic object detection on mobile platforms is a crucial but challenging computer vision task. Prior lightweight CNN-based detectors are inclined to use one-stage pipeline. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two-stage detectors in real-time generic detection and propose a lightweight two-stage detector named ThunderNet. In the backbone part, we analyze the drawbacks in previous lightweight backbones and present a lightweight backbone designed for object detection. In the detection part, we exploit an extremely efficient RPN and detection head design. To generate more discriminative feature representation, we design two efficient architecture blocks, Context Enhancement Module and Spatial Attention Module. At last, we investigate the balance between the input resolution, the backbone, and the detection head. Benefit from the highly efficient backbone and detection part design, ThunderNet surpasses previous lightweight one-stage detectors with only 40% of the computational cost on PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Without bells and whistles, ThunderNet runs at 24.1 fps on an ARM-based device with 19.2 AP on COCO. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time detector reported on ARM platforms. Code will be released for paper reproduction.
