This paper proposes a novel noisy label detection approach, named O2U-net, for deep neural networks without human annotations. Different from prior work which requires specifically designed noise-robust loss functions or networks, O2U-net is easy to implement but effective. It only requires adjusting the hyper-parameters of the deep network to make its status transfer from overfitting to underfitting (O2U) cyclically. The losses of each sample are recorded during iterations. The higher the normalized average loss of a sample, the higher the probability of being noisy labels. O2U-net is naturally compatible with active learning and other human annotation approaches. This introduces extra flexibility for learning with noisy labels. We conduct sufficient experiments on multiple datasets in various settings. The experimental results prove the state-of-the-art of O2S-net.
