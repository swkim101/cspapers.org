In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we propose to estimate the importance of a feature vector at a spatial location in the feature maps by the network's uncertainty on its class prediction, which can be quantified using the information entropy. Based on this idea, we propose the entropy-based feature weighting method for semantics-aware feature pooling which can be readily integrated into various CNN architectures for both training and inference. We demonstrate that such a location-adaptive feature weighting mechanism helps the network to concentrate on semantically important image regions, leading to improvements in the large-scale classification and weakly-supervised semantic segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the generated feature weights can be utilized in visual tasks such as weakly-supervised object localization. We conduct extensive experiments on different datasets and CNN architectures, outperforming recently proposed pooling methods and attention mechanisms in ImageNet classification as well as achieving state-of-the-arts in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.
