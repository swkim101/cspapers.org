This paper deal with design, fabrication receiver with digitalizing I/Q channel at intermediate frequency. Intermediate frequency module was standardized by applying this design. This module will be applied for first Vietnamese satellite, such as: MicroDragon satellite and NanoDragon satellite. They operate at S band and X band. But authors foucuse on S band. Obtain result: digitalizing I/Q channel at intermediate frequency with low cost, small size, easy manufacture, flexible integrate, and satisfy Nanosatellite's requirement. Vietnam have satellite. Standardizing technology for designing and manufacturing ground station is necessary. This standardizing help to manufacture the series of ground station for communicating with Vietnamese satellite.
