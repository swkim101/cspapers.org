To proactively assist humans robots require the ability to recognise a humanâ€™s goal. Unfortunately, as plans can often start with the same actions, i.e. are initially non-distinctive, it is often impossible to determine which goal a human is aiming to achieve until they have neared their goal. By modifying the environment we aim to force humans into revealing their goal sooner without increasing the cost of the optimal plan to any of the possible goals. Previously proposed approaches, that apply classical planning techniques to this problem, are very computationally expensive. This paper presents an early version of our work, in which we propose transforming goal recognition design problems into Action Graphs. Experiments show that our approach is able to force humans into revealing their goal sooner in environments with various numbers of goals and of differing sizes in an average time of 1.42 seconds, whereas a current state-of-the-art approach often breaches a 10 minute timeout.
