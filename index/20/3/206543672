We present a methodology that simultaneously provides estimates of the self-motion of a skid-steered mobile robot and detects a moving obstacle estimating its velocity, exclusively based on laser scanner measurements. We assume an environment of linear segments and since the vehicle is skid-steered we make no use of its encoder readings. The constraints/assumptions are discussed and extensive experimental results are presented.
