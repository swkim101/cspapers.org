Most video object segmentation approaches process objects separately. This incurs high computational cost when multiple objects exist. In this paper, we propose AGSS-VOS to segment multiple objects in one feed-forward path via instance-agnostic and instance-specific modules. Information from the two modules is fused via an attention-guided decoder to simultaneously segment all object instances in one path. The whole framework is end-to-end trainable with instance IoU loss. Experimental results on Youtube- VOS and DAVIS-2017 dataset demonstrate that AGSS-VOS achieves competitive results in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
