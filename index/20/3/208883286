The current paper proposes the exact analysis on the secrecy outage probability of energy scavenging cognitive radio networks over Nakagami-m fading channels and under both (interference and maximum transmit) power constraints and primary interference. The suggested analysis is verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. Multiple results demonstrate that primary interference, required security degree, and fading severity drastically impact the security performance. Moreover, this performance can be minimized by cleverly selecting time fraction.
