In this paper, we demonstrate that a collaborative relationship between the operating system and applications can be used to meet user-specified goals for battery duration. We first show how applications can dynamically modify their behavior to conserve energy. We then show how the Linux operating system can guide such adaptation to yield a battery-life of desired duration. By monitoring energy supply and demand, it is able to select the correct tradeoff between energy conservation and application quality. Our evaluation shows that this approach can meet goals that extend battery life by as much as 30%.
