Computer Science education has to change - the students are demanding a new paradigm in this Just Google It era. This paper discusses what Just in Time Learning is, how it is more effective than the traditional educational process, and how to change education to embrace the Internet through incorporating the Just-In-Time Learning model. There are five parts to incorporating the Just-In-Time Learning model: one - recognizing that the textbook is dead, as students Just Google It, two - help students learn how to vet the information they find online, three - incorporate real-world problems and support creative student ideas, four - modify the classroom to include an active-learning environment to fully support Just-In-Time Learning, and five - the role of the teacher is now as a tutor, helping students learn and learn how to learn. By incorporating these five parts of the Just-In-Time Learning model, there is no longer the concept of cheating, and students are learning the core necessary skills: problem-solving, critical thinking, good decision making, self-learning, and effective communication.
