Beamforming and the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for the massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) play a significant role in the fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks. Several existing DOA and beamforming algorithms are validated for the MIMO antenna system in 5G gNodeB. The proposed non-blind adaptive beamforming algorithm using Recursive least squares Dolph Chebyshev (RLS-DC) with Uniformly spaced Linear Array (ULA) of 32 elements is presented in this paper. The sidelobe level is suppressed from -14 dB to -30 dB while steering area from -60ยบ to +60ยบ is obtained.
