Here we present a suite of theoretical, computational, and experimental studies culminating in the first aerial and aquatic capable insect-scale robot. We develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to model fluid-wing interaction in air and water. From CFD and a system dynamics analysis we predict that a multi-modal flapping strategy will enable locomotion in both air and water for a single device. We validate the CFD predictions by running at-scale, robotic wing-flapping experiments. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time a flying and swimming capable flapping-wing insect-like robot.
