Robotic Hopping is challenging from the perspective of both modeling the dynamics as well as the mechanical design due to the short period of ground contact in which to actuate on the world. Previous work has demonstrated stable hopping on a moving-mass robot, wherein a single spring was utilized below the body of the robot. This paper finds that the addition of a spring in parallel to the actuator greatly improves the performance of moving mass hopping robots. This is demonstrated through the design of a novel one-dimensional hopping robot. For this robot, a rigorous trajectory optimization method is developed using hybrid systems models with experimentally tuned parameters. Simulation results are used to study the effects of a parallel spring on energetic efficiency, stability, and hopping effort. We find that the double-spring model had 2.5x better energy efficiency than the single-spring model, and was able to hop using 40% less peak force from the actuator. Furthermore, the double-spring model produces stable hopping without the need for stabilizing controllers. These concepts are demonstrated experimentally on a novel hopping robot, wherein hop heights up to 40cm were achieved with comparable efficiency and stability.
