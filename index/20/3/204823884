We consider the simplest non-linear discrete dynamical systems, given by the logistic maps f a (x)=ax(1−x) of the interval [0,1]. We show that there exist real parameters a∈ (0,4) for which almost every orbit of f a has the same statistical distribution in [0,1], but this limiting distribution is not Turing computable. In particular, the Monte Carlo method cannot be applied to study these dynamical systems.
