Lightweight Remote Procedure Call (LRPC) is a communication facility designed and optimized for communication between protection domains on the same machine.
In contemporary small-kernel operating systems, existing RPC systems incur an unnecessarily high cost when used for the type of communication that predominates â€” between protection domains on the same machine. This cost leads system designers to coalesce weakly-related subsystems into the same protection domain, trading safety for performance. By reducing the overhead of same-machine communication, LRPC encourages both safety and performance.
LRPC combines the control transfer and communication model of capability systems with the programming semantics and large-grained protection model of RPC. LRPC achieves a factor of three performance improvement over more traditional approaches based on independent threads exchanging messages, reducing the cost of same-machine communication to nearly the lower bound imposed by conventional hardware.
LRPC has been integrated into the Taos operating system of the DEC SRC Firefly multiprocessor workstation.
