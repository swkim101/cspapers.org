we present a new approach to segmentation of 3Dimensional shapes that initializes and then optimizes a 3-0 surface model given only the data and a very small number of 3-0 seed points and corresponding svrface normals. This is a valuable capability for medical, robotic and cartographic applications ,where szich seed points can be naturally supplied. In effect, the surface model is clamped onto the object bo,undary in manner reminiscent of a Velcro being closed. We develop the methodâ€™s math,ematic framework and show preliminary results vsing ,volumetric medical data.
