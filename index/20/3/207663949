There are times when it is not practical to hand-script automated tests for an existing system before one starts to modify it (whether to refactor it to permit automated testing or to add new functionality). In these circumstances, the use of "record & playback" testing may be a viable alternative to handwriting all the tests.This paper describes experiences using this approach and summarizes key learnings applicable to other projects.
