We describe the Informediatm News-on-Demand system. News-on-Demand is an innovative example of indexing and searching broadcast video and audio material by text content. The fully-automatic system monitors TV news and allows selective retrieval of news items based on spoken queries. The user then plays the appropriate video "paragraph". The system runs on a Pentium PC using MPEG-I video compression and the Sphinx-II continuous speech recognition system [6].
