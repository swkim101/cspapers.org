Decision-making is central to software development. Most problems do not have straightforward solutions but instead require assessing and evaluating multiple candidate solutions depending on the requirements (functional and non-functional) for the specific project. Real problems may have more than one valid solution and software engineering students need to be able to synthesize design alternatives and reason about them to make the best decision for the specific problem under consideration. The work described here uses a web-based system to administer rationale-based assignments where the students are required to explicitly present their rationale for a series of decisions and use the capabilities of the tool to justify their choices. Students using the tool report that it helped them consider more alternatives and put more thought into their decision-making process.
