In this paper we first discuss how the commitment in human-robot natural language conversation is important and the lack of the commitment leads to breakdowns in conversation. Then, we propose human-robot conversation model, which takes the breakdown into consideration. We have implemented natural language interface system of mobile robot, based on the proposed conversation model. Then, we have conducted experiments with subjects and confirmed that the proposed interface system provides more natural conversation between human and robot with fewer breakdowns.
