We present a communication protocol called Choco, which efficiently supports various traffic demands with end-to-end reliability in multi-hop Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). To achieve this, Choco uses fine-grained scheduling based on the insight that acknowledgements (ACKs) between ends can be delivered with little overhead using concurrent transmission. Specifically, the slot assignment is dynamically scheduled up to several times a second according to traffic loads and packet losses. We show that Choco achieves higher efficiency and reliability than ORPL+BF, which is a state-of-the-art collection protocol, for periodic traffic environments. Also, we show that in a networked imaging application, which generates burst traffic, Choco can successfully collect 5 VGA images with high efficiency from 5 nodes in approximately 168 s in an average 4.0 hop network. 1. OVERVIEW A multi-hop WSN protocol which can efficiently support various traffic demands makes developing applications easier. This is because developers do not need to choose a suitable protocol out of many existing protocols. However, existing communication protocols support specific traffic demands. Therefore, depending on the generated traffic, different protocols and parameters must be chosen appropriately. To tackle this issue, we are developing Choco. We focus on efficiently achieving end-to-end reliability in two major traffic demands, periodic and burst. Many applications such as environmental monitoring, structural health monitoring and networked imaging generate either or both of the traffic. Choco is designed based on the insight that ACKs between ends can be delivered with little overhead using concurrent transmission. Choco uses synchronized slots like LWB [1], which is a collection protocol using concurrent transmission, as shown in Fig. 1. All nodes communicate according to the scheduling packets which a sink node computes and transmits. In a slot, at most one packet is transmitted by an Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
