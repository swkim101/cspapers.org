Writing software to control networks is important and difficult. It must be efficient, reliable, and flexible. Conduits+ is a framework for network software that has been used to implement the signalling system of a mullti-protocol ATM access switch. An earlier version was used to implement TCP/IP. It reduces the complexity of network software, makes it easier to extend or modify network protocols, and is sufficiently efficient. Conduits+ shows the power of a componentized object-oriented framework and of common object-oriented design patterns.
