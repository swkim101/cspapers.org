We propose an efficient inference method for switching nonlinear dynamical systems. The key idea is to learn an inference network which can be used as a proposal distribution for the continuous latent variables, while performing exact marginalization of the discrete latent variables. This allows us to use the reparameterization trick, and apply end-to-end training with stochastic gradient descent. We show that the proposed method can successfully segment time series data, including videos and 3D human pose, into meaningful ``regimes'' by using the piece-wise nonlinear dynamics.
