We have already proposed the "rings gymnastic robot" aiming at an application to the gymnastic coaching. We have been also focusing on performance skill acquisition and obtained a skill of a backward giant circle using various models step by step. To apply the skill obtained by the robot to the coaching, many skills collected by a three-dimensional model and experiments are required. However, a handstand has been only realized by a two-link model. Therefore, in this study, we further acquire the performance skill of a handstand from backward giant circle using a three-link model, as a preliminary step toward analyses in three-dimension and experiments.
