In this paper, we propose SOR-HDFS, a SEDA (Staged Event-Driven Architecture)-based approach to improve the performance of HDFS Write operation. This design not only incorporates RDMA-based communication over InfiniBand but also maximizes overlapping among different stages of data transfer and I/O. Performance evaluations show that, the new design improves the aggregated write throughput of Enhanced DFSIO benchmark in Intel HiBench by up to 64% and reduces the job execution time by 37% compared to IPoIB (IP over InfiniBand). Compared to the previous best RDMA-enhanced design [4], the improvements in throughput and execution time are 30% and 20%, respectively. Our design can also improve the performance of HBase Put operation by up to 53% over IPoIB and 29% compared to the previous best RDMA-enhanced HDFS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first design of SEDA-based HDFS in the literature.
