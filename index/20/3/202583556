System noise can negatively impact the performance of HPC systems, and the interconnection network is one of the main factors contributing to this problem. To mitigate this effect, adaptive routing sends packets on non-minimal paths if they are less congested. However, while this may mitigate interference caused by congestion, it also generates more traffic since packets traverse additional hops, causing in turn congestion on other applications and on the application itself. In this paper, we first describe how to estimate network noise. By following these guidelines, we show how noise can be reduced by using routing algorithms which select minimal paths with a higher probability. We exploit this knowledge to design an algorithm which changes the probability of selecting minimal paths according to the application characteristics. We validate our solution on microbenchmarks and real-world applications on two systems relying on a Dragonfly interconnection network, showing noise reduction and performance improvement.
