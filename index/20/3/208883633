In this research work, we would like to present the distributed mobility management for mobile network. The solution provides two mobility approaches. The first one is a distributed mobility solution based on NEMO for heterogeneous mobile IP networks. This solution deploys multiple Home Agents (HAs), and the mobility anchors are closer to the edge of the network in order to provide optimal routing and lower delays. The performance evaluations are provided in terms of handover latency, signaling and packet delivery costs, and end to end delay. Another solution is based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) that provides network operators to easily and quickly introduce new services and flexibly adapt to their requirements. This solution offers some of advantages including no need to deploy any mobility-related component at the access router, independence of the underlying technologies, and per-flow mobility support.
