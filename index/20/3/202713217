Processors radiate electromagnetic interference (EMI), which affects wireless communication technologies. However, despite the fact that the EMI generated by a processor is deterministic, architecturally modeling the EMI has proven to be a complex challenge. Moreover, EMI depends on the physical layout of the processor and on the binary being executed (both the application and its compilation options). This paper proposes Model for EMI on a SoC (MESC), the first architectural framework for modeling electromagnetic emissions from a core. MESC takes into account the layout and the switching activity of a process to model the expected EMI. We validate MESC on a real system to verify its accuracy. We then use MESC to demonstrate that two different core layouts can be leveraged to reduce EMI and propose EMI Core Hopper (EMI CHopper). EMI CHopper uses a multi-core system -- where each core has the same RTL but minimally different layouts -- and proposes hopping the application between cores to reduce in-band EMI when it interferes with wireless communication. Our evaluation shows that MESC is able to predict EMI within 95% accuracy across time and across the frequency spectrum, even when using statistical sampling to obtain activity rates. Leveraging MESC, our proposed EMI CHopper reduces in-band EMI by up to 50%, with low impact on performance. MESC will enable a new stream of micro-architectural research the same way architectural level power models have enabled exploration of performance and power simulation.
