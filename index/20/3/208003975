The extremely-high display density of modern smartphones imposes a significant burden on power consumption, yet does not always provide an improved user experience and may even lead to a compromised user experience. As human visually-perceivable ability highly depends on the user-screen distance, a reduced display resolution may still achieve the same user experience when the user-screen distance is large. This provides new power-saving opportunities. We present a flexible dynamic resolution scaling system for smartphones. The system adopts an ultrasonic-based approach to detect the user-screen distance at low-power cost and makes scaling decisions automatically for maximum user experience and power saving. App developers or users can also adjust the resolution manually and dynamically as their needs. Our system is able to work on the existing commercial smartphones and support the legacy apps, without requiring re-building the ROM or any changes from apps.
