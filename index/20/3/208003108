Inpainting methods aim to restore missing parts of corrupted images and play a critical role in many computer vision applications, such as object removal and image restoration. Although existing methods perform well on images with small holes, restoring large holes remains elusive. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Progressive Reconstruction of Visual Structure (PRVS) network that progressively reconstructs the structures and the associated visual feature. Specifically, we design a novel Visual Structure Reconstruction (VSR) layer to entangle reconstructions of the visual structure and visual feature, which benefits each other by sharing parameters. We repeatedly stack four VSR layers in both encoding and decoding stages of a U-Net like architecture to form the generator of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for restoring images with either small or large holes. We prove the generalization error upper bound of the PRVS network is O(1\sqrt(N)), which theoretically guarantees its performance. Extensive empirical evaluations and comparisons on Places2, Paris Street View and CelebA datasets validate the strengths of the proposed approach and demonstrate that the model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.
