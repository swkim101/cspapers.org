Deep generative models have led to significant advances in cross-modal generation such as text-to-image synthesis. Training these models typically requires paired data with direct correspondence between modalities. We introduce the novel problem of translating instances from one modality to another without paired data by leveraging an intermediate modality shared by the two other modalities. To demonstrate this, we take the problem of translating images to speech. In this case, one could leverage disjoint datasets with one shared modality, e.g., image-text pairs and text-speech pairs, with text as the shared modality. We call this problem ``skip-modal generation'' because the shared modality is skipped during the generation process. We propose a multimodal information bottleneck approach that learns the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data (image and speech) by leveraging the shared modality (text). We address fundamental challenges of skip-modal generation: 1) learning multimodal representations using a single model, 2) bridging the domain gap between two unrelated datasets, and 3) learning the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data. We show qualitative results on image-to-speech synthesis; this is the first time such results have been reported in the literature. We also show that our approach improves performance on traditional cross-modal generation, suggesting that it improves data efficiency in solving individual tasks.
