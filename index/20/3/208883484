Autopilot system consists of two main determining processes, namely the desired trajectory and the actual trajectory of the automobile. The desired trajectory of the automobile is determined by the Global Positioning System (GPS), laser scanner, radar sensor, position sensor, cameraâ€¦ The actual trajectory of the automobile is determined by the throttle by wire, brake by wire and steer by wire methods. This paper introduces a method to determine the actual trajectory of the automobile using the automatic steering system. The performance of the system is confirmed from simulation and experimental results.
