Recently, a space-collaborative constellation (CC) and channel-adaptive CC (CASCC) were proposed to design transmitter constellations with the ability of channel adaptation to improve the bit error rate (BER) and simultaneously enhance the mobility of the receiver. However, the previous CASCC constellation has some disadvantages of a four points basic constellation such as poor performance in high correlation channel. In this research, we introduce a scheme to obtain a channel-adaptation CC called the multilayer CC (MCC) for visible light communication (VLC) systems. More specifically, our proposed MCC can alleviate the disadvantages of CASCC. Moreover, the results in simulation section show that in comparison with previous design schemes, the MCC is better in term of BER for various simulation scenarios.
