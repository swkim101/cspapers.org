Websites and mobile applications today increasingly utilize OAuth for authorization and authentication. Major companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter all provide OAuth services. The usage of OAuth for authorization is well documented and has been studied by many researchers. However, little work has been done to specify or analyze the usage of OAuth for authentication. Given that many developers have employed OAuth for authentication on multiple platforms, we believe it is imperative to conduct a study to understand how developers customize OAuth for authentication on different platforms. In this paper, we analyze how popular applications on the Web, Android and iOS platform authenticate users with OAuth. Our approach is to dissect the traffic from an attacker's perspective to recover the authentication mechanisms employed by the apps and identify exploitable vulnerabilities. The results show that OAuth-based authentication mechanisms employed by these applications lack sufficient verification and suffer from many vulnerabilities. Closer examination reveals that developers have different tendencies to authenticate users with OAuth on different platforms, and 32.9%, 47.1% and 41.6% of the analyzed mechanisms on the three platforms are vulnerable. We then categorize the root causes of these vulnerabilities and make practical recommendations for developers to help design and implement robust authentication mechanisms with OAuth.
