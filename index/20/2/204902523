This paper presents a method of detecting and tracking people from a moving panoramic camera, such as one mounted on a mobile robot. Peopleâ€™s appearances in panoramic images are trained using the Adaboost algorithm working on an extended set of Haar-like features. A multiple target tracker is presented that is able to track people over time based on the Haar detections, weed out the false alarms and maintain tracks despite missed detections. The tracker is able to maintain track IDs through crossing tracks without the requirement of depth information.
