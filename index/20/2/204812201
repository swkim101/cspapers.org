Recently, a number of systems have been deployed that gather sensitive statistics from user devices while giving differential privacy guarantees. One prominent example is the component in Apple's macOS and iOS devices that collects information about emoji usage and new words. However, these systems have been criticized for making unrealistic assumptions, e.g., by creating a very high "privacy budget" for answering queries, and by replenishing this budget every day, which results in a high worst-case privacy loss. However, it is not obvious whether such assumptions can be avoided if one requires a strong threat model and wishes to collect data periodically, instead of just once. In this paper, we show that, essentially, it is possible to have one's cake and eat it too. We describe a system called Honeycrisp whose privacy cost depends on how often the data changes, and not on how often a query is asked. Thus, if the data is relatively stable (as is likely the case, e.g., with emoji and word usage), Honeycrisp can answer periodic queries for many years, as long as the underlying data does not change too often. Honeycrisp accomplishes this by using a) the sparse-vector technique, and b) a combination of cryptographic techniques to enable global differential privacy without a trusted party. Using a prototype implementation, we show that Honeycrisp is efficient and can scale to large deployments.
