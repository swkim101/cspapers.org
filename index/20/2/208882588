This paper proposes load reactances for achieving resonance in two-receiver inductive power transfer systems with two co-planar transmitters. In the proposed system, the load reactances are adjusted depending on the impedances of the coupling network, the load resistances, and the source voltages. Additionally, control method for obtaining the collinear input currents is presented to validate the calculation of the proposed load reactances. Electromagnetic simulation results illustrate that proposed system outperforms conventional one of individually canceling out the self-inductance of the coils. Moreover, this work also shows that the transmission efficiency of the proposed system is still higher than that of the conventional one even when the receivers are misaligned up to 50 percent of their size.
