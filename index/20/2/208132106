Testing the PCM (Protection and Control IED Manager) application manually which internally configures IEDs (Intelligent Electronic Devices) is a time consuming process. In addition, manual testing is error-prone in few circumstances and hence automation is more useful. Robot Framework is an extensible tool and easy to understand as it includes keyword driven testing method. Robot Framework is easy to use with tabular syntax that enables creating test cases in uniform way. From the existing keywords in robot framework the high level keywords can be created that ensures the reusability and extensibility. Using basic library Application Programming Interface (API) for creating test cases in python is possible and output files are generated in XML format that provides integration for existing system. All this attributes ensures that Robot Framework is convenient for test automation of PCM application. Jenkins retrieves and updates the builds and run many test cases simultaneously for different IEDs. Therefore, continuous integration can be achieved easily.
