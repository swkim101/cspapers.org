This paper describes a novel device called the "Stick User Interface", comprised of a robotic projector-camera system, an onboard digital computer connected to the Internet, sensors, and a hardware interface capable of sticking to any surface such as walls, ceilings, etc. The computer further consists of other subsystems, devices, and sensors such as an accelerometer, compass, gyroscope, flashlight, etc. The device unfolds (expands) on activation, detects a surface, and attaches itself to it. After a successful attachment, the device then projects or augments images, information, and user interfaces on nearby surfaces and walls. The user interface may contain applications, information about the object being augmented, and information from the Internet. Users can interact with the user-interface using commands and gestures such as hand, body, feet, voice, etc.
