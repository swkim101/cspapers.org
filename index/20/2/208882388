In this research, we propose a protocol for many bits transfer which is improved from quantum three pass protocol by using quantum phase estimation algorithm. In which, each party encrypt and decrypt the message by their own key. In addition, instead of attached in the carrier qubits, the key distribution is attached into the phase. Therefore, in the proposed protocol, the phase estimation is used to estimate the key distribution. Finally, the comparison between proposed protocol and original one is given to show the better performance.
