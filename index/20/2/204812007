Recent advances in computer vision and natural language processing using deep neural networks (DNNs) have enabled rich and intuitive multimodal interfaces. However, research on intelligent assistance systems for persons with visual impairment has not been well explored. In this work, we present an interactive object recognition and guidance interface based on multimodal interaction for blind and partially sighted people using an embedded mobile device. We demonstrate that the proposed solution using DNNs can effectively assist visually impaired people. We believe that this work will provide new and helpful insights for designing intelligent assistance systems in the future.
