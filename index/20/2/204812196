In this paper, I introduce collective shape-changing interfaces, a class of shape-changing interfaces that consist of a set of discrete collective elements. Through massively parallel transformation, locomotion, and connection of individual building blocks, the overall physical structure can be dynamically changed. Given this parallel change of individual elements, I propose three approaches for user interaction: dynamic, improvised, and actuated collective shape transformation. I exemplify each approach through my own work and possible future work.
