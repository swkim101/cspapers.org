Medallion-like articles for jewelry, decorative ornamentation and product identification, instrument panel light lenses and methods and apparatus for manufacturing same are disclosed. A medallion-like article for decorative or identification is formed by applying an uncured radiation curable polymer to an indicia bearing surface in a quantity sufficient to form a convex upper surface by means of its surface tension and then irradiating the polymer to effect its cure. Use of a flexible substrate, such as a vinyl or polyester film, upon which embossed indicia was formed, provides a flexible medallion which may be adhesively bonded to a contoured, non-planar surface. Upward curling of the medallion during cure is prevented by supporting the medallion on a water cooled platen during irradiation. A flexible, transparent lamp lense having a convex frontal surface is also formed by the ultraviolet cured photopolymer which is adhesively bonded adjacent to the lamp to form its lense.
