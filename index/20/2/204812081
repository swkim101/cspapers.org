In this paper, we propose the novel concept of manifesting the Choice Blindness paradigm in real-life scenarios through immersive Virtual Reality (VR). We designed a VR application wherein the participants encountered two-alternative choices regarding implicit racial bias. Our observations show that 92% of subjects failed to notice a mismatch in their choices, while 75% exhibited choice blindness, hence indicating a healthy scope for exploring choice blindness through virtual reality.
