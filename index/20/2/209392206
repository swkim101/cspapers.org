In recent years, ultra-wideband radio technology has become increasingly popular as a space-and cost-effective solution to the problem of indoor localization. This paper demonstrates how measurements of the channel impulse response can be used to estimate a signalâ€™s angle of arrival at a receiving antenna. This novel method requires no additional hardware, uses only a single antenna, and works with unsynchronized clocks and one-way communication. We evaluate our method on a real-dataset, and experimentally demonstrate how a mobile robot can localize itself by measuring angles to multiple ultra-wideband anchors.
