The traditional storytelling experiences are often one dimensional, wherein they only contain a single channel of communication with the audience through narration. With the advancements in technology, storytelling experiences have been augmented with the help of digital media to be more engaging and immersive. Authoring these scenarios, however, is complicated as it requires technical knowledge to interface the means of engagement. In this work, we talk about Aesop, a system which assists the narrator to author engaging storytelling experiences. Aesop provides a block-based interface like Scratch and manifests words of a story, Cues, and Visualization (Outputs) as blocks that enable the user to create captivating stories. Our system also leverages physical actions performed by the user as Cues. These cues can trigger visualizations like robot actions, animations, environments simulation using sound and lighting effects.
