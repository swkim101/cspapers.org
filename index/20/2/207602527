This tutorial addresses performance problems in Local Area Networks (LAN). User level performance measures are affected both by the software as well as communication bottlenecks. Techniques for modeling the key components of the performance of a LAN will be presented. Models will be presented to discuss the throughput and response time characteristics of LANs. We also present some measurement data obtained from a LAN performance experiment.
