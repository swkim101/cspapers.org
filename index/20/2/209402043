We show that tree pattern matching has significant advantages in the specification and implementation of efficient code generators. We present a top-down tree-matching algorithm that is particularly well suited to code generation applications. Finally, we present a new back-end language that incorporates tree pattern matching with dynamic programming into a uniform framework for the specification and implementation of efficient code generators.
