We are demonstrating a novel design of a live lightfield camera capturing a scene and showing the captured lightfield in realtime in a lightfield display. The simple, distributed design of the camera allows for low-cost construction of an array of 2D cameras that captures high quality, artifact-free imagery of the most challenging of subjects. This camera takes advantage of the natural duality of outside-in lightfield cameras with inside-out lightfield displays, letting us render complex lightfield imagery with a minimum of processing power.
