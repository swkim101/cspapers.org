Advances in digital fabrication have created new capabilities and simultaneously reinforced outdated workflows. In my thesis work, I primarily explore alternative workflows for digital fabrication that introduce new capabilities and interactions. Methodologically, I build fabrication systems spanning mechanical design, electronics, and software in order to examine these ideas in specific detail. In this paper, I introduce related work and frame it within the historical context of digital fabrication, and discuss my previous and ongoing work.
