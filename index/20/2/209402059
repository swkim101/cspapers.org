On the basis of papers at conferences, the trade press, and vendor presentations, software reuse and object-oriented technology are linked hand in hand. What is it about objects that excites discussion about reuse? Operating systems are heavily reused but are not typically written in object-oriented languages. Subroutine libraries (such as the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) have been in use for years to construct programs; again most are not written in an object-oriented language. So reuse has been around for a long time: Do objects provide better reuse? Why or why not?
