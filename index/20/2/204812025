User calibration is a significant problem in eye-based interaction. To overcome this, several solutions, such as the calibration-free method and implicit user calibration, have been proposed. Pursuits-based interaction is another such solution that has been studied for public screens and virtual reality. It has been applied to select graphical user interfaces (GUIs) because the movements in a GUI can be designed in advance. Smooth pursuit eye movements (smooth pursuits) occur when a user looks at objects in the physical space as well and thus, we propose a method to identify the focused object by using smooth pursuits in the real world. We attempted to determine the focused objects without prior information under several conditions by using the pursuits-based approach and confirmed the feasibility and limitations of the proposed method through experimental evaluations.
