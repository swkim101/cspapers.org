In recent years, it clearly emerged an increasing importance of experimental validation of innovative wireless solutions and applications, due to the increasing complexity of the wireless ecosystem. The WiNTECH workshop explicitly deals with methodological and technical issues that have to be faced for defining, running, controlling and benchmarking experiments on wireless solutions. The workshop, that this year reach the 13th edition, has a consolidated tradition for bringing together an important number of researchers and industry players working in different aspects of experimental wireless communications. The workshop will serve as a forum for sharing experiences and results with real testbeds, experimental evaluation, prototyping and empirical characterization of wireless technologies.
