The Unified Development Process (USDP) and especially its implementation by Rational Software Corporation, the Rational Unified Process (RUP), is a comprehensive process covering almost all aspects of software development projects. However, due to the great level of detail provided by RUP, many professionals do not consider RUP practical for small, fast paced projects. This paper reports the experiences with RUP on two small projects with teams of 3 to 5 developers. RUP proved to be adaptable to the needs of small projects and was very effective in both projects. One key to the successful application of RUP in small projects is the careful selection of a proper subset of artifacts and keeping these artifacts very concise and free from unnecessary formalism. This paper goes into the details of what it takes to make RUP agile, how it was applied in the two projects, and how it was configured. Also covered is what elements of RUP contributed to the success of one project, and why RUP could not prevent that the outcome of the other project was less than optimal.
