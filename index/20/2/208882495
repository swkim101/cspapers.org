This paper evaluates trade-off between reliable and secure communication for multi-hop low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) networks under impact of hardware imperfection. In the proposed scheme, a source communicates with a destination via a multi-hop transmission, where the source, destination and intermediate relay nodes are cluster heads (CHs). To protect the data at each hop, harvest-to-jam and randomize-and-forward methods are employed by CHs and cooperative jammers, respectively. Each jammer which is randomly selected at each cluster harvests energy from the previous CHs to transmit noises to an eavesdropper. We derive closed-form expressions of the end-to-end outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) for the proposed scheme over Rayleigh fading channels. Then, the theoretical derivations are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations.
