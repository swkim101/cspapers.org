The use of the minimalistic design in the document editing UI based on novel handwriting recognition technologies for mobile devices with a touch screen is very limited in real-world applications, mainly due to the propagation of errors made by recognition engines for different types of input. It is caused by the iterative nature of recognition for diverse input. Currently, one of the common ways is to pre-configure the input type manually for different types of documents' content that leads to an increase in UI complexity. Bearing this in mind, we revisit UI design issues regarding the unification of recognition flow by introducing the document layout analyzer, to avoid switching between modes during input of handwritten documents. The system for the iterative input of diverse document by using handwritten strokes recognition techniques was presented. Using an evaluation study, we have shown that the proposed approach provides a more interactive experience for the user and increases the input speed by 1.5--2 times compared to the classical approaches.
