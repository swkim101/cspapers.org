In the near future, indoor localization will become one of the essential parts of the IoT ecosystem. Accuracy in indoor positioning is always a big challenge that requires the endeavor of researchers. Without any extra cost, Trilateration is considered a feasible method to be able to build an indoor positioning system. In this paper, we introduce an iBeacon-based smartphone indoor positioning system using Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) and Trilateration method. We propose a Reliable region-based position correction method to reduce the cumulative error caused by PDR. The proposed system is implemented on an iPhone as an application. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we perform some real experiments in two cases: 1. only use PDR, 2. use our proposed method. The results showed that the accuracy improved markedly
