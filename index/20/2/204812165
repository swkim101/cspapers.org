Many accounts and devices require only infrequent authentication by an individual, and thus authentication secrets should be both secure and memorable without much reinforcement. Inspired by people's strong visual-spatial memory, we introduce a novel system to help address this problem: the Memory Palace. The Memory Palace encodes authentication secrets as paths through a 3D virtual labyrinth navigated in the first-person perspective. We ran two experiments to iteratively design and evaluate the Memory Palace. In the first, we found that visual-spatial secrets are most memorable if navigated in a 3D first-person perspective. In the second, we comparatively evaluated the Memory Palace against Android's 9-dot pattern lock along three dimensions: memorability after one week, resilience to shoulder surfing, and speed. We found that relative to 9-dot, complexity-controlled secrets in the Memory Palace were significantly more memorable after one week, were much harder to break through shoulder surfing, and were not significantly slower to enter.
