We proposed a lens forming method that does not require post-output processing using an ultraviolet (UV) printer. The transparent ink is first laminated to form a shape. A UV printer then smooths its surface by filling the layer roughness with a gloss. We implemented a tool to design the lens shape by inputting the lens diameter, focal length, etc.; with this tool, multiple lenses can be arranged and output as data to be printed by a UV printer.
