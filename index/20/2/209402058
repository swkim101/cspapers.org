Fluorinated allylisocyanurates are extremely efficient gelling agents for fluoroelastomers. Blends of fluorinated allylisocyanurate gelled fluoroelastomers with non-gelled fluoroelastomers have improved processability as compared with non-gelled fluoroelastomers and blends of other gelled fluoroelastomers with non-gelled fluoroelastomers.
