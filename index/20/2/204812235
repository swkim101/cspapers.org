We demonstrate a system to deliver dynamic guidance in drawing, sketching and handwriting tasks via an electromagnet moving underneath a high refresh rate pressure sensitive tablet presented in \citelangerak2019dynamic. The system allows the user to move the pen at their own pace and style and does not take away control. Using a closed-loop time-free approach allows for error-correcting behavior. The user will experience to be smoothly and natural pulled back to the desired trajectory rather than pushing or pulling the pen to a continuously advancing setpoint. The optimization of the setpoint with regard to the user is unique in our approach.
