Embedding conductive material into 3D printed objects enables non-interactive objects to become tangible without the need to attach additional components. We present a novel use for such touch-sensitive objects in an augmented reality (AR) setting and explore the use of gestures for enabling different types of interaction with digital and physical content. In our demonstration, the setting is an urban planning scenario. The multi-material 3D printed buildings consist of thin layers of white plastic filament and a conductive wireframe to enable touch gestures. Attendees can either interact with the physical model or with the mobile AR interface for selecting, adding or deleting buildings.
