Computational energy-efficiency is a critical aspect of many modern embedded devices as it impacts the level of autonomy for numerous scenarios. We present a component-based energy modeling approach to abstract per-component energy in a dataflow computational network executed according to a given scheduling policy. The approach is based on a modeling tool and ultimately relies on battery state to support a wider range of energy-optimization strategies for power-critical devices.
