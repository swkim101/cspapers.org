High main memory latency continues to limit performance of modern high-performance out-of-order cores. While DRAM latency has remained nearly the same over many generations, DRAM bandwidth has grown significantly due to higher frequencies, newer architectures (DDR4, LPDDR4, GDDR5) and 3D-stacked memory packaging (HBM). Current state-of-the-art prefetchers do not do well in extracting higher performance when higher DRAM bandwidth is available. Prefetchers need the ability to dynamically adapt to available bandwidth, boosting prefetch count and prefetch coverage when headroom exists and throttling down to achieve high accuracy when the bandwidth utilization is close to peak. To this end, we present the Dual Spatial Pattern Prefetcher (DSPatch) that can be used as a standalone prefetcher or as a lightweight adjunct spatial prefetcher to the state-of-the-art delta-based Signature Pattern Prefetcher (SPP). DSPatch builds on a novel and intuitive use of modulated spatial bit-patterns. The key idea is to: (1) represent program accesses on a physical page as a bit-pattern anchored to the first "trigger" access, (2) learn two spatial access bit-patterns: one biased towards coverage and another biased towards accuracy, and (3) select one bit-pattern at run-time based on the DRAM bandwidth utilization to generate prefetches. Across a diverse set of workloads, using only 3.6KB of storage, DSPatch improves performance over an aggressive baseline with a PC-based stride prefetcher at the L1 cache and the SPP prefetcher at the L2 cache by 6% (9% in memory-intensive workloads and up to 26%). Moreover, the performance of DSPatch+SPP scales with increasing DRAM bandwidth, growing from 6% over SPP to 10% when DRAM bandwidth is doubled.
