Deep learning-based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods face various challenges when applied to 3D medical volumetric data (i.e., CT and MR images) due to the high memory cost and anisotropic resolution, which adversely affect their performance. Furthermore, mainstream SISR methods are designed to work over specific upsampling factors, which makes them ineffective in clinical practice. In this paper, we introduce a Spatially Aware Interpolation NeTwork (SAINT) for medical slice synthesis to alleviate the memory constraint that volumetric data poses. Compared to other super-resolution methods, SAINT utilizes voxel spacing information to provide desirable levels of details, and allows for the upsampling factor to be determined on the fly. Our evaluations based on 853 CT scans from four datasets that contain liver, colon, hepatic vessels, and kidneys show that SAINT consistently outperforms other SISR methods in terms of medical slice synthesis quality, while using only a single model to deal with different upsampling factors
