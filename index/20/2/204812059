A person with hearing impairments is difficult to notice greets and calling attention from their back due to low ability of listening, and it leads the decline of the ability of sensing danger and the wrong guess at beginning communication. Therefore, we propose the system conveying the information of sound from backwards through haptic feedback. Through the experiment verifying recognition rate of DoA estimation, it is confirmed that the system can substitute the ability of rear sound image localization. Through the experiment verifying recognition rate of type of sounds, it is also confirmed that the system can aware the sound from backwards.
