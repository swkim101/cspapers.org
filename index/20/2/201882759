Video object detection is more challenging than image object detection because of the deteriorated frame quality. To enhance the feature representation, state-of-the-art methods propagate temporal information into the deteriorated frame by aligning and aggregating entire feature maps from multiple nearby frames. However, restricted by feature map's low storage-efficiency and vulnerable content-address allocation, long-term temporal information is not fully stressed by these methods. In this work, we propose the first object guided external memory network for online video object detection. Storage-efficiency is handled by object guided hard-attention to selectively store valuable features, and long-term information is protected when stored in an addressable external data matrix. A set of read/write operations are designed to accurately propagate/allocate and delete multi-level memory feature under object guidance. We evaluate our method on the ImageNet VID dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance as well as good speed-accuracy tradeoff. Furthermore, by visualizing the external memory, we show the detailed object-level reasoning process across frames.
