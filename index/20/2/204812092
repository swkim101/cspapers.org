User interfaces in self-order terminals aim to satisfy the need for information of a broad audience and thus get easily clut-tered. Online shops present personalized product recommen-dations based on previously gathered user data to channel the user's attention. In contrast, stateless point-of-sales machines generally have no access to the user's personal information nor previous purchase behavior. User preferences must therefore be determined during the interaction. We thus propose using gaze data to determine preferences in real-time. In this paper we present a system for dynamic gaze-based fltering.
