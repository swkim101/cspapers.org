Video surveillance systems have wide range of utilities, yet easily suffer from great quality degeneration under dim light circumstances. Industrial solutions mainly use extra near-infrared illuminations, even though it doesn't preserve color and texture information. A variety of researches enhanced low-light videos shot by visible light cameras, while they either relied on task specific preconditions or trained with synthetic datasets. We propose a novel optical system to capture bright and dark videos of the exact same scenes, generating training and groud truth pairs for authentic low-light video dataset. A fully convolutional network with 3D and 2D miscellaneous operations is utilized to learn an enhancement mapping with proper spatial-temporal transformation from raw camera sensor data to bright RGB videos. Experiments show promising results by our method, and it outperforms state-of-the-art low-light image/video enhancement algorithms.
