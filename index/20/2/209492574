The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has significantly contributed to the solutions for entity and relation recognition from a natural language text, and possibly linking them to proper matches in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Considering Wikidata as the background KG, there are still limited tools to link knowledge within the text to Wikidata. In this paper, we present Falcon 2.0, the first joint entity and relation linking tool over Wikidata. It receives a short natural language text in the English language and outputs a ranked list of entities and relations annotated with the proper candidates in Wikidata. The candidates are represented by their Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) in Wikidata. Falcon 2.0 resorts to the English language model for the recognition task (e.g., N-Gram tiling and N-Gram splitting), and then an optimization approach for the linking task. We have empirically studied the performance of Falcon 2.0 on Wikidata and concluded that it outperforms all the existing baselines. Falcon 2.0 is open source and can be reused by the community; all the required instructions of Falcon 2.0 are well-documented at our GitHub repository (https://github.com/SDM-TIB/falcon2.0). We also demonstrate an online API, which can be run without any technical expertise. Falcon 2.0 and its background knowledge bases are available as resources at https://labs.tib.eu/falcon/falcon2/.
