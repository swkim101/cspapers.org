Instructors of hardware computing face many challenges including maintaining awareness of student progress, allocating their time adequately between lecturing and helping individual students, and keeping students engaged even while debugging problems. Based on formative interviews with 5 electronics instructors, we found that many circuit style behaviors could help novice users prevent or efficiently debug common problems. Drawing inspiration from the software engineering practice of coding style, these circuit style behaviors consist of best-practices and guidelines for implementing circuit prototypes that do not interfere with the functionality of the circuit, but help a circuit be more readable, less error-prone, and easier to debug. To examine if these circuit style behaviors could be peripherally enforced, aid an in-person instructor's ability to facilitate a workshop, and not monopolize instructor's attention, we developed CircuitStyle, a teaching aid for in-person hardware computing workshops. To evaluate the effectiveness of our tool, we deployed our system in an in-person maker-space workshop. The instructor appreciated CircuitStyle's ability to provide a broad understanding of the workshop's progress and the potential for our system to help instructors of various backgrounds better engage and understand the needs of their classroom.
