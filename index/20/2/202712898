Neural architecture search (NAS) generates architectures automatically for given tasks, e.g., image classification and language modeling. Recently, various NAS algorithms have been proposed to improve search efficiency and effectiveness. However, little attention is paid to understand the generated architectures, including whether they share any commonality. In this paper, we analyze the generated architectures and give our explanations of their superior performance. We firstly uncover that the architectures generated by NAS algorithms share a common connection pattern, which contributes to their fast convergence. Consequently, these architectures are selected during architecture search. We further empirically and theoretically show that the fast convergence is the consequence of smooth loss landscape and accurate gradient information conducted by the common connection pattern. Contracting to universal recognition, we finally observe that popular NAS architectures do not always generalize better than the candidate architectures, encouraging us to re-think about the state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.
