This paper introduces a method of determining quickly the direction of incoming signal from a radio radiation source in multi-path environment. In this environment, the signals arriving at the antenna array may come from one or many independent radio sources. Therefore, these signals may be uncorrelated or at high correlation level. To circumvent the signal correlation, the proposed method reconstructs the data vector received by the ULA antenna array into the Hermitian Toeplitz matrix form to expand the size of the noise space. Therefore, the signal space and noise can be evaluated more accurately. MUSIC algorithm is employed to determine the signal power spectrum. Since no forward-backward spatial smoothing technique is used, the computational complexity has been reduced. This proposed method can be applied in real-time applications because there needs to use only one signal pattern. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method results in better quality than those using ESPRIT and Matrix Pencil algorithms.
