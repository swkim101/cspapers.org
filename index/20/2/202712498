Consider a set of latent factors whose observable effect of activation is caught on a measure space that appears as a grid of bits tacking value in $\{0, 1 \}$. This paper intend to deliver a theoretical and practical answer to the question: Given that we have access to a perfect indicator of the activation of latent factors that label a finite dataset of grid's activity, can we imagine a procedure to build a generic identificator of factor's activations ?
