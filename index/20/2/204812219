The rapid advancement of augmented reality technology brings museum visitors enhanced interaction and immersion experience. However, most existing augmented reality museums adopt individual-based user interfaces that hinder joint interaction across multiple users. We present the distance-driven user interface (DUI) to enable collaborative exhibit viewing in augmented reality museum. We classify the users in four groups according to the user-exhibit distance and assign each group specific interaction privileges - put simply, the DUI elicits the users standing far from an exhibit to explore more of the desired exhibit by approaching closer to the exhibit. We describe the DUI architecture and preliminarily evaluate users' acceptance and effectiveness of the DUI and find that, the DUI is interpretable, improves users' awareness of collaboration, and increases user interests to the exhibit with considerably improved willingness of approaching the exhibit.
