We propose a new penalty function which, when used as regularization for empirical risk minimization procedures, leads to sparse estimators. The support of the sparse vector is typically a union of potentially overlapping groups of co-variates defined a priori, or a set of covariates which tend to be connected to each other when a graph of covariates is given. We study theoretical properties of the estimator, and illustrate its behavior on simulated and breast cancer gene expression data.
