Video editing is a difficult task for both professionals and amateur editors. One of the biggest reasons is that screening useful clips from raw material in the early stage of editing is too much time-consuming and laborious. To better understand current difficulties faced by users in editing task, we first conduct a pilot study involving a survey and an interview among 20 participants. Based on the results, we then design Pre-screen, a novel tool to provide users with both global-view and detailed-view video analysis as well as material screening features based on intelligent video processing, analysis and visualization methods. User study shows that Pre-screen can not only effectively help users screen and arrange raw video material to save much more time than a widely used video editing tool in video editing tasks, but also inspire and satisfy users.
