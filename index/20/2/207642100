We introduce a problem class which we term activity monitoring. Such problems involve monitoring the behavior of a large population of entities for interesting events requiring action. We present a framework within which each of the individual problems has a natural expression, as well as a methodology for evaluating performance of activity monitoring techniques. We show that two superficially different tasks, news story monitoring and intrusion detection, can be expressed naturally within the framework, and show that key differences in solution methods can be compared.
