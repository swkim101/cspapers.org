6-DoF object pose estimation from a single RGB image is a fundamental and long-standing problem in computer vision. Current leading approaches solve it by training deep networks to either regress both rotation and translation from image directly or to construct 2D-3D correspondences and further solve them via PnP indirectly. We argue that rotation and translation should be treated differently for their significant difference. In this work, we propose a novel 6-DoF pose estimation approach: Coordinates-based Disentangled Pose Network (CDPN), which disentangles the pose to predict rotation and translation separately to achieve highly accurate and robust pose estimation. Our method is flexible, efficient, highly accurate and can deal with texture-less and occluded objects. Extensive experiments on LINEMOD and Occlusion datasets are conducted and demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Concretely, our approach significantly exceeds the state-of-the- art RGB-based methods on commonly used metrics.
