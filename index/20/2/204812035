This paper introduces Perennial, a framework for verifying concurrent, crash-safe systems. Perennial extends the Iris concurrency framework with three techniques to enable crash-safety reasoning: recovery leases, recovery helping, and versioned memory. To ease development and deployment of applications, Perennial provides Goose, a subset of Go and a translator from that subset to a model in Perennial with support for reasoning about Go threads, data structures, and file-system primitives. We implemented and verified a crash-safe, concurrent mail server using Perennial and Goose that achieves speedup on multiple cores. Both Perennial and Iris use the Coq proof assistant, and the mail server and the framework's proofs are machine checked.
