This paper describes the current form and organization of Humboldt State University's CIS 492: Systems Design and Implementation, the capstone course for the Computer Information Systems (CIS) major. Since Spring 1998, this course has combined a team programming experience on a large-scale database project with discussions of a software engineering classic, Frederick Brooks Jr.'s “The Mythical Man Month”[1]. Students seem to find this combination valuable, and it is hoped that this paper can impart some useful ideas to others in designing a CIS/MIS capstone course.
