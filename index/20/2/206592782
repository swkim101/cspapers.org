Predicting the depth (or surface normal) of a scene from single monocular color images is a challenging task. This paper tackles this challenging and essentially underdetermined problem by regression on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) features, combined with a post-processing refining step using conditional random fields (CRF). Our framework works at two levels, super-pixel level and pixel level. First, we design a DCNN model to learn the mapping from multi-scale image patches to depth or surface normal values at the super-pixel level. Second, the estimated super-pixel depth or surface normal is refined to the pixel level by exploiting various potentials on the depth or surface normal map, which includes a data term, a smoothness term among super-pixels and an auto-regression term characterizing the local structure of the estimation map. The inference problem can be efficiently solved because it admits a closed-form solution. Experiments on the Make3D and NYU Depth V2 datasets show competitive results compared with recent state-of-the-art methods.
