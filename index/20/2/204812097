Making modern electric circuits involves a lot of processes, skills, and effort. One challenge in fabricating prototypes is the difficulty of making electric circuits. We propose a fabrication technique that allows users to easily build electric circuits. It is based on a hot stamping technique but uses a single extruder 3D printer instead of dies. The circuits are made of metal foil and can be deposited on various surfaces including paper and acrylic board. Tests confirm that the technique can fabricate circuits on which electronic devices can be implemented by soldering.
