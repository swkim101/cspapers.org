Stance detection aims at inferring an authorâ€™s attitude towards a specific target in a text. Prior methods mainly consider target-related background information for a better understanding of targets while neglecting the accompanying input texts. In this study, we propose to prompt Large Language Models (LLMs) to explicitly extract the relationship between paired text and target as contextual knowledge. We then inject such LLM-driven knowledge into a generation model BART to exploit the rich contexts and semantics. Moreover, to further enhance the decoding capability of BART, a novel prototypical contrastive scheme is designed to align input contents with stance labels. Our experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance across several publicly available datasets, showcasing effectiveness in both zero-shot and cross-target stance detection scenarios. We publicly release our code to facilitate future research.
