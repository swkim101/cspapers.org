The inclusion property is essential in reducing the cache coherence complexity for multiprocessors with multilevel cache hierarchies. We give some necessary and sufficient conditions for imposing the inclusion property for fully- and set-associative caches which allow different block sizes at different levels of the hierarchy. Three multiprocessor structures with a two-level cache hierarchy (single cache extension, multiport second-level cache, bus-based) are examined. The feasibility of imposing the inclusion property in these structures is discussed. This leads us to propose a new inclusion-coherence mechanism for two-level bus-based architectures.
