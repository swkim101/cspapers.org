Binary type inference is a core research challenge in binary program analysis and reverse engineering. It concerns identifying the data types of registers and memory values in a stripped executable (or object file), whose type information is discarded during compilation. Current methods rely on either manually crafted inference rules, which are brittle and demand significant effort to update, or machine learning-based approaches that suffer from low accuracy. In this paper we propose T Y G R , a graph neural network based solution that encodes data-flow information for inferring both basic and struct variable types in stripped binary programs. To support different architectures and compiler optimizations, T Y G R was implemented on top of the ANGR binary analysis platform and uses an architecture-agnostic data-flow analysis to extract a graph-based intra-procedural representation of data-flow information. We noticed a severe lack of diversity in existing binary executables datasets and created T Y D A , a large dataset of diverse binary executables. The sole publicly available dataset, provided by S TATE F ORMER , contains only 1% of the total number of functions in T Y D A . T Y G R is trained and evaluated on a subset of T Y D A and generalizes to the rest of the dataset. T Y G R demonstrates an overall accuracy of 76.6% and a struct
