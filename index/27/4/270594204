The microgrid (MG) is becoming an extensive area of research for different applications integrating Photo-Voltaic (PV) solar system, a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and an Energy Management System (EMS). To understand the behavior of such systems, a physical model and a simulation were developed. This helps better understand their behavior and their output power degradation which affects the system performance. The simulation results emphasis the effectiveness of the aging model and demonstrate that the BESS capacity 5 kWh dropped 0.775 kW and 3.85 kW due to the degraded State of Health (SOH) of 15.1% and 77% at the end of 1st and 5th year respectively for 5 years simulation interval. In addition, the impact of increasing the BESS nominal capacity by (x2) and (x3) contributes to the BESS SOH improvement to around (57%) and (66%) during the 5th year respectively over a 5 yearsâ€™ time interval.
