 This paper presents the design, testing and user feedback of a new prototype of a tractor platform intended for use on small, resource-constrained farms. This development builds on past work by implementing several upgrades which promote market competitiveness and maximize functionality, ergonomics, and aesthetics. Stakeholder discussions, review of prior art and recommendations from past authors were used to draft new functional requirements for a better vehicle. Hydraulic power systems were implemented that significantly improve user comfort by automating repetitive or unwieldy tasks. Newly designed crop-spraying solutions based on feedback from farmers allowed the tractor to perform crop maintenance functions that larger vehicles cannot while also reducing worker exposure to harmful chemicals. A rear-oriented PTO was installed to allow the vehicle to power external implements. A redesign of a stabilizing solution increased the vehicleâ€™s versatility in managing various crops and transit between properties. The upgraded vehicle was tested in Massachusetts. Farmers from Massachusetts and from The Philippines who tested the vehicle responded positively. They indicated the tractor would be a valuable addition to their small farms and would substantially reduce drudgery. Testers believed the format of the vehicle was familiar, easy to learn, and comfortable to ride. This paper demonstrates that two-wheeled tractors are not only viable, but can produce the same utility as conventional tractor layouts at a significantly lower cost.
