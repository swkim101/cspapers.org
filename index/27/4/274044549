 In recent years, academic researchers, industrial designers, and remanufacturers have widely recognized the imperative to integrate remanufacturing considerations into the initial phases of product design to advance sustainability objectives, acknowledging the importance of Design for Remanufacturing (DfRem). However, existing DfRem guidelines and tools largely rely upon experiential insights and qualitative assessments, leaving a gap in the ability to assess the economic and environmental impacts of design choices quantitatively. To bridge this gap, we present a framework for DfRem that facilitates informed design decisions while accounting for potential remanufacturing options. We rigorously assess our framework through a meticulous examination of the design and remanufacturing processes associated with a hydraulic manifold in heavy-duty tractorsâ€™ transmissions. Through this industry-relevant case study, we showcase the practical utility of our framework. Conducting analyses guided by our proposed framework, we identify and validate design modifications that could reduce life cycle costs, energy consumption, and emissions. These modifications are tested with plans for integration into future iterations of the hydraulic manifold design, ensuring sustained improvements in sustainability metrics while maintaining performance and reliability standards.
