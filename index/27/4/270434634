The FLASH multiprocessor efficiently integrates support for cacheaherent shared memory and high-performance message passing. while minimizing both hardware and software overhead. Each node in FLASH contains a microprocessor. a portion of the machine’s global memory. a port to the interconnection etwork an I/O interface. and a custom node controller called MAGIC. ‘lb MAGIC chip handles all communication both within the node and among nodes. using hardwired data paths for efficient data movement and a programmable processor optimized for exewting protocol operations. The use of the protocol processor m&es FLASH very flexible it can support a variety of different communication mechanisms and simplifies the design and implementation. ‘l&a paper presents the architecture of FLASH and MAGIC, and discusses the base cache-coherence and message-passing protocols. L.atency and occupancy numbers, which are derived from our system-level simulator and our Verilog code, are given for several common protocol operations. The paper also describes our sofhvare strategy and FLASH’s cturent status.
