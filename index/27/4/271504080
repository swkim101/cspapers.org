In critical care settings, where precise and timely interventions are crucial for health outcomes, evaluating disparities in patient outcomes is important. Current approaches often fall short in comprehensively understanding and evaluating the impact of respiratory support interventions on individuals affected by social determinants of health. Attributes such as gender, race, and age are commonly assessed and essential, but provide only a partial view of the complexities faced by diverse populations. In this study, we focus on two clinically motivated tasks: prolonged mechanical ventilation and successful weaning. We also perform fairness audits on the models' predictions across demographic groups and social determinants of health to better understand the health inequities in respiratory interventions in the intensive care unit. We also release a temporal benchmark dataset, verified by clinical experts, to enable benchmarking of clinical respiratory intervention tasks.
