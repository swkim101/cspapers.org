Integrating data-driven and rule-based approaches is crucial for therapy recommendations since they can collaborate to achieve better performance. Medical rules, which are chains of reasoning that can infer therapies, widely exist. However, their symbolic and logical forms make integrating them with data-driven modeling technologies hard. Although rare attempts have indirectly modeled rules using data that supports them, the poor generalization of medical rules leads to inadequate supporting data and thus impairs the benefit of medical rules. To this end, we propose R2V-MIF, which fills the gap by rule-to-vector contrastive learning (R2V) and multi-channel information fusion (MIF). R2V is a data-free module and utilizes a hypergraph, including condition and result nodes, to instantiate the logic of medical rules. Each rule is reflected in the relations between nodes, and their representations are determined through contrastive learning. By taking rule representations as a bridge, MIF integrates the knowledge from medical rules, similar neighbors, and patient contents, and then recommends therapies. Extensive experiments show that R2V-MIF outperforms the baselines in several metrics using real-world medical data. Our code is available at https://github.com/vgeek-z/r2vmif.
