Modern mobile systems are featured by their increasing interactivity with users, which however is accompanied by a severe side effect---users constantly suffer from slow UI responsiveness (SUR). To date, the community have limited understandings of this issue for the challenges of comprehensively measuring SUR events on massive mobile devices. As a major Android phone vendor, in this paper we close the knowledge gap by conducting the first large-scale, long-term measurement study on SUR with 47M devices. Our study identifies the critical factors that lead to SUR from the perspectives of device, system, application, and app market. Most importantly, we note that the largest root cause lies in the wide existence of "hogging" apps, which persistently occupy an unreasonable amount of system resources by leveraging the optimistic design of Android process management. We have built on the insights to remodel Android process states by fully considering their time-sensitive transitions and the actual behaviors of processes, with remarkable real-world impact---the occurrences of SUR are reduced by 60%, together with 10.7% saving of battery consumption.
