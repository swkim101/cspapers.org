This manuscript centers on the design of a shell-type solid-state transformer with Litz wire winding using convex optimization techniques. The primary goal is to minimize the mass, core, and copper losses associated with the transformer within specific predefined constraints. By framing the medium frequency transformer design challenge as a geometric programming problem, convex optimization facilitates the determination of global optimal design parameters for constructing the solid-state transformer.
