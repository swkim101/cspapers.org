Over 65% of web traffic originates from mobile devices. However, much of this traffic is not from mobile web browsers but rather from mobile apps displaying web content. Android’s WebView has been a common way for apps to display web content, but it entails security and privacy concerns, especially for third-party content. Custom Tabs (CTs) are a more recent and recommended alternative. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to examine if the top ∼ 146.5K Android apps use WebViews and CTs in a manner that aligns with user security and privacy considerations. Our measurements reveal that most apps still use WebViews, particularly to display ads, with only ∼ 20% using CTs. We also find that while some popular SDKs have migrated to CTs, others (e.g., financial services) benefiting from CT’s properties have not yet done so. Through semi-manual analysis of the top 1K apps, we uncover a handful of apps that use WebViews to show arbitrary web content within their app while modifying the web content behavior. Ultimately, our work seeks to improve our understanding of how mobile apps interact with third-party web content and shed light on real-world security and privacy implications.
