The laws of model size, data volume, computation and model performance have been extensively studied in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the scaling laws in Scene Text Recognition (STR) have not yet been investigated. To address this, we conducted comprehensive studies that involved examining the correlations between performance and the scale of models, data volume and computation in the field of text recognition. Conclusively, the study demonstrates smooth power laws between performance and model size, as well as training data volume, when other influencing factors are held constant. Additionally, we have constructed a large-scale dataset called REBU-Syn, which comprises 6 M real samples and 18 M synthetic samples. Based on the disclosed scaling law and new dataset, we successfully trained a scene text recognition model, achieving a new state-of-the-art on 6 common test benchmarks with top-1 average accuracy of 97.42%. The models and dataset are publicly available at large-ocr-model.github.io.
