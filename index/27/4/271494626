This research introduces XGA-Osteo, an innovative approach that leverages Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of knee osteoarthritis diagnosis. Recent studies have utilized AI approaches to automate the diagnosis using knee joint X-ray images. However, these studies have primarily focused on predicting the severity of osteoarthritis without providing additional information to assist doctors in their diagnoses. In addition to accurately diagnosing the severity of the condition, XGA-Osteo generates an anomaly map, produced from a reconstructed image of a healthy knee using adversarial learning. Thus, the abnormal regions in X-ray images can be highlighted, offering valuable supplementary information to medical experts during the diagnosis process.
