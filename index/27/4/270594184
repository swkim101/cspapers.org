Home health care services, which allow patients to receive medical care in the comfort of their own homes, have experienced an increase in popularity. We present a multi-objective optimization model that considers the needs of three primary stakeholders: company managers, caregivers, and patients. The model tackles the weekly routing and scheduling problems through a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming approach. Continuity of care is emphasized given its distinguishing factor from daily care. Both salaried caregivers and self-employed caregivers are considered. Due to the model’s computational complexity, we develop an ϵ-greedy large neighborhood search within an improved multi-directional local search framework. The effectiveness of the model and method is validated using real-world data, demonstrating that our algorithm surpasses the performance of the enhanced ε-constraint method.
