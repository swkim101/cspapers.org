Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to generate a model for segmenting novel classes using a limited number of annotated samples. Previous FSS methods have shown sensitivity to background noise due to inherent bias, attention bias, and spatial-aware bias. In this study, we propose a Transformer-Based Adaptive Prototype Matching Network to establish robust matching relationships by improving the semantic and spatial perception of query features. The model includes three modules: target enhancement module (TEM), dual constraint aggregation module (DCAM), and dual classification module (DCM). In particular, TEM mitigates inherent bias by exploring the relevance of multi-scale local context to enhance foreground features. Then, DCAM addresses attention bias through the dual semantic-aware attention mechanism to strengthen constraints. Finally, the DCM module decouples the segmentation task into semantic alignment and spatial alignment to alleviate spatial-aware bias. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i confirm the effectiveness of our approach.
