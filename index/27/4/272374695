The rapid increase in cases of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in recent years has raised significant public concern. Accurately identifying tissue alteration regions is crucial for the diagnosis of NAFLD, but this task presents challenges in pathology image analysis, particularly with small-scale datasets. Recently, the paradigm shift from full fine-tuning to prompting in adapting vision foundation models has offered a new perspective for small-scale data analysis. However, existing prompting methods based on task-agnostic prompts are mainly developed for generic image recognition, which fall short in providing instructive cues for complex pathology images. In this paper, we propose Quantitative Attribute-based Prompting (QAP), a novel prompting method specifically for liver pathology image analysis. QAP is based on two quantitative attributes, namely K-function-based spatial attributes and histogram-based morphological attributes, which are aimed for quantitative assessment of tissue states. Moreover, a conditional prompt generator is designed to turn these instance-specific attributes into visual prompts. Extensive experiments on three diverse tasks demonstrate that our task-specific prompting method achieves better diagnostic performance as well as better interpretability.
