Previous work has demonstrated the potential to combine document rankings from dense and sparse retrievers for higher relevance effectiveness. This paper proposes a cluster-based partial dense retrieval scheme guided by sparse retrieval results to optimize fusion between dense and sparse retrieval at a low space and CPU-time cost while retaining a competitive relevance. This scheme exploits the overlap of sparse retrieval results and document embedding clusters, and judiciously selects a limited number of clusters to probabilistically guarantee the inclusion of top sparse results. This paper provides an evaluation of this scheme on its in-domain and zero-shot retrieval performance for the MS MARCO and BEIR datasets.
