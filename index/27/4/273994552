As manycore architectures enable a large number of cores on the die, a key challenge that emerges is the availability of memory bandwidth with conventional DRAM solutions. To address this challenge, integration of large DRAM caches that provide as much as 5Ã— higher bandwidth and as low as 1/3rd of the latency (as compared to conventional DRAM) is very promising. However, organizing and implementing a large DRAM cache is challenging because of two primary tradeoffs: (a) DRAM caches at cache line granularity require too large an on-chip tag area that makes it undesirable and (b) DRAM caches with larger page granularity require too much bandwidth because the miss rate does not reduce enough to overcome the bandwidth increase. In this paper, we propose CHOP (Caching HOt Pages) in DRAM caches to address these challenges. We study several filter-based DRAM caching techniques: (a) a filter cache (CHOP-FC) that profiles pages and determines the hot subset of pages to allocate into the DRAM cache, (b) a memory-based filter cache (CHOP-MFC) that spills and fills filter state to improve the accuracy and reduce the size of the filter cache and (c) an adaptive DRAM caching technique (CHOP-AFC) to determine when the filter cache should be enabled and disabled for DRAM caching. We conduct detailed simulations with server workloads to show that our filter-based DRAM caching techniques achieve the following: (a) on average over 30% performance improvement over previous solutions, (b) several magnitudes lower area overhead in tag space required for cache-line based DRAM caches, (c) significantly lower memory bandwidth consumption as compared to page-granular DRAM caches.
