The complexity and volatility of real-world radio environments often hamper wireless networks from achieving optimal performance. Recently, intelligent metasurfaces have been explored to dynamically reshape the radio propagation environment. However, existing systems are limited to standalone metasurfaces, only enabling one-time signal redirection/reshaping effects within their direct line-of-sight. They cannot effectively scale to cover larger areas. In this paper, we propose RFMagus, which employs a network of metasurfaces to overcome the limitation. We carefully optimize the configurations of the networked metasurfaces so that they can cooperatively and coherently propagate the analog signals towards the target regions. We have implemented the networked metasurfaces and deployed them in a variety of real-world environments. Experimental results demonstrate that RFMagus can effectively expand the coverage, improve the throughput, and operate transparently to different wireless standards.
