In this PhD, we investigate the processes through which common ground shapes the pragmatic use of referring expressions in Human-Robot Interaction. A central point in our investigation is the interplay between a growing common ground and changes in the surrounding context, which can create ambiguity, variation and the need for pragmatic interpretations. We outline three objectives that define the scope of our work: 1) obtaining data with common ground interactions, 2) examining reference-making, and 3) evaluating the robot interlocutor. We use datasets as well as a novel interactive experimental framework to investigate the linguistic processes involved in shaping referring expressions. We also design an interactive robot model, which models these linguistic processes and can use pragmatic inference to resolve referring expressions. With this work, we contribute to existing work in HRI, reference resolution and the study of common ground.
