Existing tiled manycore architectures propose to convert abundant silicon resources into general-purpose parallel processors with unmatched computational density and programmability. However, as we approach 100 K cores in one chip, conventional manycore architectures struggle to navigate three key axes: scalability, programmability, and density. Many manycores sacrifice programmability for density; or scalability for programmability. In this paper, we explore HammerBlade, which simultaneously achieves scalability, programmability and density. HammerBlade is a fully open-source RISC-V manycore architecture, which has been silicon-validated with a 2048-core ASIC implementation using a 14/16nm process. We evaluate the system using a suite of parallel benchmarks that captures a broad spectrum of computation and communication patterns.
