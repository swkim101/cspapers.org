Photometric stereo faces challenges from non-Lambertian reflectance in real-world scenarios. Systematically measuring the reliability of photometric stereo methods in handling such complex reflectance necessitates a real-world dataset with quantitatively controlled reflectances. This paper introduces DiLiGenRT, the first real-world dataset for evaluating photometric stereo methods under quantified reflectances by manufacturing 54 hemispheres with varying degrees of two reflectance properties: Roughness and Transluency, Unlike qualitative and semantic labels, such as “diffuse” and “specular,” that have been used in previous datasets, our quantified dataset allows comprehensive and systematic benchmark evaluations. In addition, it facilitates selecting best-fit photometric stereo methods based on the quantitative reflectance properties. Our dataset and benchmark results are available at https://photometricstereo.github.io/diligentrt.html.
