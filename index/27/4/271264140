Legal case retrieval plays an important role in 001 promoting judicial justice and fairness. One 002 of its greatest challenges is that the defini-003 tion of relevance goes far beyond the com-004 mon semantic relevance as in ad-hoc retrieval. 005 In this paper, we reveal that the legal ele-006 ments, which typically comprise key facts in 007 a specialized legal context, can largely im-008 prove the relevance matching of legal case re-009 trieval. To facilitate the use of legal elements, 010 we construct a Chinese legal element dataset 011 called LeCaRD-Elem based on the widely-used 012 LeCaRD dataset (Ma et al., 2021), through a 013 two-stage semi-automatic method with a mini-014 mized reliance on human labor. 015 Meanwhile, we introduce two new models to 016 enhance legal search using legal elements. The 017 first, Elem4LCR-E , is a two-stage model that 018 explicitly predicts legal elements from texts 019 and then leverages them for improved rank-020 ing. Recognizing the potential benefits of more 021 seamless integration, we further propose an 022 end-to-end model called Elem4LCR-I , which 023 internalizes the legal element knowledge into 024 its model parameters using a tailored teacher-025 student training framework. Extensive experi-026 ments underscore the significant value of legal 027 elements and demonstrate the superiority of our 028 two proposed models in enhancing legal search 029 over existing methods. The anonymous code 030 and the sampled dataset are accessible here. 031
