Large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced recommender systems, spurring interest across academia and industry in leveraging LLMs for recommendation tasks. This includes using LLMs for generative item retrieval and ranking, and developing versatile LLMs for various recommendation tasks, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in the field of recommender systems. This tutorial aims to demystify the Large Language Model for Recommendation (LLM4Rec) by reviewing its evolution and delving into cutting-edge research. We will explore how LLMs enhance recommender systems in terms of architecture, learning paradigms, and functionalities such as conversational abilities, generalization, planning, and content generation. The tutorial will shed light on the challenges and open problems in this burgeoning field, including trustworthiness, efficiency, online training, and evaluation of LLM4Rec. We will conclude by summarizing key learnings from existing studies and outlining potential avenues for future research, with the goal of equipping the audience with a comprehensive understanding of LLM4Rec and inspiring further exploration in this transformative domain.
