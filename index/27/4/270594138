The article introduces an adaptive threshold detection mechanism aimed at enhancing a decentralized radar inertial odometry (RIO) framework, enabling resilient localization in challenging hostile environments. Considering that frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars possess characteristics enabling measurements in challenging indoor and outdoor environments, the fusion of multiple radars in an ensemble configuration, along with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), holds promise in surpassing individual sensor limitations. This approach thereby enhances robust perception. The proposed adaptive autonomous residual threshold mechanism employs a real-time residual analysis to dynamically adjust the sensor fusion process by comparing the variance between two extended Kalman filters. This adaptive approach addresses irregularities in data samples from multiple sensors, thereby enhancing the decentralized smoothing estimatorâ€™s precision in providing localization while navigating through hostile environments marked by limited visibility, extreme weather, or high interference. Consequently, it contributes to the resilience and adaptability of autonomous systems in real-world scenarios. The proposed framework effectively showcases precise localization through decentralized radar inertial odometry(RIO).
