We introduce Mind Artist (MindArt), a novel and efficient neural decoding architecture to snap artistic photographs from our mind in a controllable manner. Recently, progress has been made in image reconstruction with non-invasive brain recordings, but it's still difficult to generate realistic images with high semantic fidelity due to the scarcity of data annotations. Unlike previous methods, this work casts the neural decoding into optimal transport (OT) and representation decoupling problems. Specifically, under discrete OT theory, we design a graph matching-guided neural representation learning framework to seek the underlying correspondences between conceptual semantics and neural signals, which yields a natural and meaningful self-supervisory task. Moreover, the proposed MindArt, structured with multiple stand-alone modal branches, enables the seamless incorporation of semantic representation into any visual style information, thus leaving it to have multi-modal reconstruction and training-free semantic editing capabilities. By doing so, the reconstructed images of MindArt have phenomenal realism both in terms of semantics and appearance. We compare our MindArt with leading alternatives, and achieve SOTA performance in different decoding tasks. Importantly, our approach can directly generate a series of stylized “mind snapshots” w/o extra optimizations, which may open up more potential applications.
