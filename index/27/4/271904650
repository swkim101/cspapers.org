Wavelength-routed optical networks-on-chip (WRONoCs) are well-known for providing high-speed and collision-free communication in multi-core processors. Previous work was unable to simultaneously reduce the design complexity and total optical power consumption of WRONoC. Besides, in current designs, each microring resonator (MRR), which is the key component of WRONoC, is configured to demultiplex to one specific wavelength. This significantly increases the MRR usage and the insertion loss. In this work, we adapt different types of ONoC routers into the mesh-based template. To reduce MRR usage, we take advantage of an important feature of MRR, multi-resonance, so that a single MRR can demultiplex signals on multiple wavelengths. To this end, we propose an efficient design method that synthesizes mesh-based WRONoCs using multi-resonance MRRs and existing optical routers to reduce total power consumption. The experimental results show that our method out-performs state-of-the-art design methods in significantly reducing MRR usage and optical power.
