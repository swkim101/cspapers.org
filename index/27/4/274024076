In most previous studies, the aspect-related text is considered an important clue for the Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task, and thus various attention mechanisms have been proposed to leverage the interactions between aspects and context. However, it is observed that some sentiment expressions carry the same polarity regardless of the aspects they are associated with. In such cases, it is not necessary to incorporate aspect information for ABSA. More observations on the experimental results show that blindly leveraging interactions between aspects and context as features may introduce noises when analyzing those aspect-invariant sentiment expressions, especially when the aspect-related annotated data is insufficient. Hence, in this paper, we propose an Adversarial Multi-task Learning framework to identify the aspect-invariant/dependent sentiment expressions without extra annotations. In addition, we adopt a gating mechanism to control the contribution of representations derived from aspect-invariant and aspect-dependent hidden states when generating the final contextual sentiment representations for the given aspect. This essentially allows the exploitation of aspect-invariant sentiment features for better ABSA results. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that extending existing neural models using our proposed framework achieves superior performance. In addition, the aspect-invariant data extracted by the proposed framework can be considered as pivot features for better transfer learning of the ABSA models on unseen aspects.
