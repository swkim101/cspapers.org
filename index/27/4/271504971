The paper introduces a comprehensive human-agent negotiation framework designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of research studies on human-agent negotiation without building each component from scratch. Leveraging the interoperability and reusability of its components, this framework offers various functionalities, including speech-to-text conversion, emotion recognition, a repository of negotiation strategies, and an interaction manager capable of managing gestures designed for Nao, Pepper, and QT, and coordinating message exchanges in a turn-taking fashion. This framework aims to lower the entry barrier for researchers in human-agent negotiation by providing a versatile platform that supports a wide range of research directions, including affective computing, natural language processing, decision-making, and non-verbal communication.
