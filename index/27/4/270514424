We propose Label Creative Generation (LCG), a new paradigm in multi-label data augmentation. Beyond repeating data points with fixed labels, LCG creates new data by exploring innovative label combinations. Within LCG, we introduce Tail-Driven Conditional Augmentation (TDCA), combining tail-driven label sampling and label-conditioned text generation for balanced, consistent data augmentation. Our approach has demonstrated a **100.21%** increase in PSP@1 across three datasets, successfully mitigating the long-tail effect in MLTC and markedly enhancing model performance.
