We would like to propose a full day workshop on the topic of Personalization and Recommendations in Search ( PaRiS ) to be held in conjunction with SIGIR 2024. This will be the third instance of this workshop. We held two very successful instances of this workshop at the WebConf 2023 and WSDM 2022. This year we plan to especially focus on applications of LLMs and Generative AI to enable personalization and recommendations in the context of search, for example, conversational assistants, while continuing to use this workshop for discussing other advances and applications in the context of personalized search and recommendations in the context of search. Note that all members of the organizing committee plan to attend the conference in person
