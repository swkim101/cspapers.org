In this study, our focus is on exploring the implications of incorporating release date constraints into both mathematical models and heuristic methods designed to tackle the hybrid flow shop problem with dedicated machines. Our primary aim remains centered on minimizing the makespan, a fundamental objective in production scheduling. Through meticulous investigation, we aim to assess how the introduction of release date constraints influences the performance and efficacy of these models and heuristics. By analyzing the resultant impact on solution quality and computational efficiency, we endeavor to gain deeper insights into the complex dynamics of this optimization problem.
