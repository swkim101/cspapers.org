This paper introduces an innovative model-driven approach for seamlessly integrating control logic into the building planning phase, ensuring consistency throughout deployment. Leveraging an open building information model (BIM), the approach enables model engineers to embed control logic directly into the BIM using an open language. The integrated model facilitates automatic extraction of control logic information, supporting efficient modifications. A proof-of-concept implementation using SIMULTAN, IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, and IDA ICE demonstrates successful deployment in a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) use case.
