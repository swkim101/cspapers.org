Symbolic meaning representations of natural language text have been studied since at least the 1960s. With the availability of large annotated corpora, and more powerful machine learning tools, the field has recently seen several new developments. In this survey, we study todayâ€™s most prominent Meaning Representation Frameworks. We shed light on their theoretical properties, as well as on their practical research environment, i.e., on datasets, parsers, applications, and future challenges.
