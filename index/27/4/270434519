Extracting entities and their relations from text is an important task for understanding massive text corpora. Open information extraction (IE) systems mine relation tuples (i.e., entity arguments and a predicate string to describe their relation) from sentences. However, current open IE systems ignore the fact that global statistics in a large corpus can be collectively leveraged to identify high-quality sentence-level extractions. In this paper, we propose a novel open IE system, called ReMine, which integrates local context signal and global structural signal in a unified framework with distant supervision. The new system can be efficiently applied to different domains as it uses facts from external knowledge bases as supervision; and can effectively score sentence-level tuple extractions based on corpus-level statistics. Specifically, we design a joint optimization problem to unify (1) segmenting entity/relation phrases in individual sentences based on local context; and (2) measuring the quality of sentence-level extractions with a translating-based objective. Experiments on real-world corpora from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ReMine when compared to other open IE systems.
