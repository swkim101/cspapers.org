In this work, we discuss our vision for neuromorphic accelerators based on integrated photonics within the framework of the Horizon Europe NEUROPULS project. Augmented integrated photonic architectures that leverage phase-change and III-V materials for optical computing will be presented. A CMOS-compatible platform will be discussed that integrates these materials to fabricate photonic neuromorphic architectures, along with a gem5-based simulation platform to model accelerator operation once it is interfaced with a RISC-V processor. This simulation platform enables accurate system-level accelerator modeling and benchmarking in terms of key metrics such as speed, energy consumption, and footprint.
