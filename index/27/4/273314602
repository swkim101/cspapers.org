This paper introduces the MindCube, an interactive device designed for studying emotions. Resembling a fidget cube toy commonly used for stress and anxiety relief, the MindCube features a compact cubic shape (3.3 cm × 3.3 cm × 3.3 cm), making it small, easy to hold, and ideal for playful interaction. Like a fidget cube toy, each side of the MindCube is equipped with various interactive inputs, including tactile buttons, a small rolling disk, and a joystick. Additionally, the device is fitted with a 9-DoF IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to measure real-time orientation when held by the user. Furthermore, the MindCube includes a linear vibration motor to provide haptic feedback to enhance the interactive experience.
