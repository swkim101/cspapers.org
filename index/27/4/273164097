Currently, most deep learning based disparity estimation methods have the problem of over-smoothing at boundaries, which is unfavorable for some applications such as point cloud segmentation, mapping, etc. To address this problem, we first analyze the potential causes and observe that the estimated disparity at edge boundary pixels usually follows multimodal distributions, causing over-smoothing estimation. Based on this observation, we propose a single-modal weighted average operation on the probability distribution during inference, which can alleviate the problem effectively. To integrate the constraint of this inference method into training stage, we further analyze the characteristics of different loss functions and found that using cross entropy with gaussian distribution consistently further improves the performance. For quantitative evaluation, we propose a novel metric that measures the disparity error in the local structure of edge boundaries. Experiments on various datasets using various networks show our method's effectiveness and general applicability. Code will be available at https://github.com/chenchr/otosp.
