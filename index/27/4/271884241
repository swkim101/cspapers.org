Deep semantic representations are useful for many NLU tasks (Droganova and Zeman, 2019; Schuster and Manning, 2016). Manual annotation to build these representations is time-consuming, and so automatic approaches are preferred (Droganova and Zeman, 2019; Bender et al., 2015). This paper demonstrates how rich semantic representations can be automatically derived for Thai Serial Verb Con-structions (SVCs), where the semantic relationship between component verbs is not immediately clear from the surface forms. I present the first fully-implemented, unified analysis for Thai SVCs, deriving appropriate semantic representations (MRS; Copestake et al., 2005) from syntactic features, implemented within a DELPH - IN computational grammar (Slayden, 2009). This analysis increases verified coverage of SVCs by 73% and decreases ambiguity by 46%. The final grammar can be found at: https://github.com/VipashaB94
