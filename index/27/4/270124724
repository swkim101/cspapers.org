Increasing bandwidth demands of mobile video streaming pose a challenge in optimizing the Quality of Experience (QoE) for better user engagement. Multipath transmission promises to extend network capacity by utilizing multiple wireless links simultaneously. Previous studies mainly tune the packet scheduler in multipath transmission, expecting higher QoE by accelerating transmission. However, since Adaptive BitRate (ABR) algorithms overlook the impact of multipath scheduling on throughput prediction, multipath adaptive streaming can even experience lower QoE than single-path. This paper proposes Chorus, a cross-layer framework that coordinates multipath scheduling with adaptive streaming to optimize QoE jointly. Chorus establishes two-way feedback control loops between the server and the client. Furthermore, Chorus introduces Coarse-grained Decisions, which assist appropriate bitrate selection by considering the scheduling decision in throughput prediction, and Finegrained Corrections, which meet the predicted throughput by QoE-oriented multipath scheduling. Extensive emulation and real-world mobile Internet evaluations show that Chorus outperforms the state-of-the-art MPQUIC scheduler, improving average QoE by 23.5% and 65.7%, respectively.
