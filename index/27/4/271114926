A complementary item is an item that pairs well with another item when consumed together. In the context of e-commerce, providing recommendations for complementary items is essential for both customers and stores. Current models for suggesting complementary items often rely heavily on user behavior data, such as co-purchase relationships. However, just because two items are frequently bought together does not necessarily mean they are truly complementary. Relying solely on co-purchase data may not align perfectly with the goal of making meaningful complementary recommendations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "coherent complement recommendation", where "coherent" implies that recommended item pairs are compatible and relevant. Our approach builds upon complementary item pairs, with a focus on ensuring that recommended items are well used together and contextually relevant. To enhance the explainability and coherence of our complement recommendations, we fine-tune the Large Language Model (LLM) with coherent complement recommendation and explanation generation tasks since LLM has strong natural language explanation generation ability and multi-task fine-tuning enhances task understanding. We have also devised an LLM-compatible method for compressing and quantizing user behavior information into language model tokens. Experimental results indicate that our model can provide more coherent complementary recommendations than existing state-of-the-art methods, and human evaluation validates
