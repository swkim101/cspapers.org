Recently, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the capabilities of AI systems. These models possess the ability to comprehend and generate human-like text, enabling them to engage in sophisticated conversations, generate content, and even perform tasks that once seemed beyond the reach of machines. As a result, the way we interact with technology and each other — an established field called “Human-AI Interaction” and have been studied for over a decade — is undergoing a profound transformation. This tutorial will provide an overview of the interaction between humans and LLMs, exploring the challenges, opportunities, and ethical considerations that arise in this dynamic landscape. It will start with a review of the types of AI models we interact with, and a walkthrough of the core concepts in Human-AI Interaction. We will then emphasize the emerging topics shared between HCI and NLP communities in light of LLMs.
