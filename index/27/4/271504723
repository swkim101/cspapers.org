Influence diffusion models are used for simulating information propagation in social networks. While most existing influence diffusion models are probabilistic, the emergence of Large Language Model (LLM) sheds light on the language-level inferences and interactions of user agents. This paper presents an LLM-enhanced Agent-based Influence Diffusion model (LAID), and a web-based visualization tool, LAIDSim, for simulating the information propagation in social networks.
