A drawing robot avatar is a robotic system that allows for telepresence-based drawing, enabling users to remotely control a robotic arm and create drawings in real-time from a remote location. The proposed control framework aims to improve bimanual robot telepresence quality by reducing the user workload and required prior knowledge through the automation of secondary or auxiliary tasks. The introduced novel method calculates the near-optimal Cartesian end-effector pose in terms of visual feedback quality for the attached eye-to-hand camera with motion constraints in consideration. The effectiveness is demonstrated by conducting user studies of drawing reference shapes using the implemented robot avatar compared to stationary and teleoperated camera pose conditions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed control framework offers improved visual feedback quality and drawing performance.
