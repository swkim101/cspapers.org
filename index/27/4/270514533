This paper critically examines the arithmetic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), uncovering significant limitations in their performance. Our research reveals a notable decline in accuracy for complex calculations involving large numbers, with addition and subtraction tasks showing varying degrees of proficiency. Additionally, we challenge the notion that arithmetic is language-independent, finding up to a 10% difference in performance across twenty languages. The study also compares self-verification methods with cross-agent collaborations, showing that a single model often outperforms collaborative approaches in basic arithmetic tasks. These findings suggest a need to reassess the effectiveness of LLMs in tasks requiring numerical accuracy and precision.
