Representing signals using coordinate networks domi-nates the area of inverse problems recently, and is widely applied in various scientific computing tasks. Still, there exists an issue of spectral bias in coordinate networks, lim-iting the capacity to learn high-frequency components. This problem is caused by the pathological distribution of the neural tangent kernel's (NTK's) eigenvalues of coordinate networks. We find that, this pathological distribution could be improved using the classical batch normalization (BN), which is a common deep learning technique but rarely used in coordinate networks. BN greatly reduces the maximum and variance of NTK's eigenvalues while slightly modifies the mean value, considering the max eigenvalue is much larger than the most, this variance change results in a shift of eigenvalues' distribution from a lower one to a higher one, therefore the spectral bias could be alleviated (see Fig. 1). This observation is substantiated by the significant improvements of applying BN-based coordinate networks to various tasks, including the image compression, computed tomography reconstruction, shape representation, magnetic resonance imaging and novel view synthesis.
