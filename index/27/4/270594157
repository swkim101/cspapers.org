This paper explores methodologies for localization of RFID tags on logistical handling units to create a Digital Twin of an industrial order-picking and stock replenishment process. The research is focused on the utilization of passive Ultra-high frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. These tags are embedded in handling units placed in standardized order-picking flow-racks to enable real-time localization. Multiple localization methods are characterized and compared. The primary research objective of this paper is to define an evaluation environment for these methods. Consequently, evaluation criteria for an in-depth comparison are defined and respective metrics are presented. Preliminary results based on experiments show a preview on the suitability of selected methods for the presented scenario.
