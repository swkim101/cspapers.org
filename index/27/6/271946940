Navigating multi-level menus with complex hierarchies remains a big challenge for blind and low-vision users, who predominantly use screen readers to interact with computers. To that end, we demonstrate Wheeler, a three-wheeled input device with two side buttons that can speed up complex multi-level hierarchy navigation in common applications. When in operation, the three wheels of Wheeler are each mapped to a different level in the application hierarchy. Each level can be independently traversed using its designated wheel, allowing users to navigate through multiple levels efficiently. Wheeler's three wheels can also be repurposed for other tasks such as 2D cursor manipulation. In this demonstration, we describe the different operation modes and usage of Wheeler.
