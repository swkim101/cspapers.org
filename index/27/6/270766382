Smart speakers such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, have significantly enhanced the convenience and efficiency of our daily lives, leading to widespread adoption globally. Subsequently, the voice commands directed at these devices contain a wealth of private information, encompassing users' daily routines, details about clinic visits, and even shopping habits. Security researchers have already identified vulnerabilities in encrypted network traffic, particularly in the context of traffic analysis, enabling the network-level adversaries to infer the websites visited by users. This security threat, common in traditional web communication, extends to voice query communication between the smart speaker and the server, giving rise to the concept of Voice Command Traffic Fingerprinting (VCF). In this paper, building upon recent literature on VCF, we strive to conduct a more comprehensive study. Our contributions include proposing a variant of WF features that empowers adversaries to outperform state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we consider variations in voice command traffic influenced by factors such as device locations and user characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a command category fingerprinting approach capable of inferring the voice command category even for unknown commands, presenting a more practical and scalable model. Through these contributions, we aim to advance the understanding of VCF by considering various practical factors influencing voice command traffic, and provide insights for the development of more robust defenses.
