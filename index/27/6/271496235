We present a new problem called rhythm inference. It consists in inferring the duration of each note and each rest from a partial specification. We then formulate rhythm inference as a constraint satisfaction problem and we use mixed linear programming to solve it. The solution is implemented for a language representing music scores, called abcd. Interestingly, the rhythm is inferred in real-time from partial musical indications.
