Early predicting the onset of a disease is critical to timely and accurate clinical decision-making, where a model determines whether a patient will develop the disease n hours later. While deep learning algorithms have demonstrated great success using multivariate irregular time-series data such as electronic health records (EHRs), they often lack temporal robustness due to data scarcity problems becoming more prominent at multilevel as n increases. At event-level, the decreasing number of available events per trajectory increases uncertainty in anticipating future disease behavior. At trajectory-level, the scarcity of patient trajectories limits diversity in the training population, hindering the model's generalization. This work introduces Multi-TA, a multilevel temporal augmentation framework that leverages BERT-based temporal EHRs representation learning and a unified data augmentation approach, effectively addressing data scarcity issues at both event and trajectory levels. Validated on two real-world EHRs for septic shock, Multi-TA outperforms mixup and GAN-based state-of-the-art models across eight prediction windows, demonstrating improved temporal robustness. Further, we provide in-depth analyses on data augmentation.
