Multiparty computation (MPC) over rings such as Z264 has received a great deal of attention recently due to its ease of implementation and attractive performance. We assume there are n parties and the adversary corrupts t of them, where 2t < n. In this work, we leverage RMFEs (Reverse Multiplication Friendly Embeddings) to build an MPC protocol over Zpk with constant online communication. An (l, d)-RMFE packs l elements from Zpk into an element in GR(pk, d) = Zpk [X]/h(X), where deg h = d. The existence of asymptotically good RMFE ensures that d/l is bounded by a constant independent of n. We show that the method from Turbopack applies to honest majority secure multiparty computation over Zpk in the preprocessing model, achieving perfect security and the best online communication complexity. In the semi-honest setting, we build a secure multiparty computation protocol over Zpk based on the packed Shamir secret-sharing over an extension ring and RMFEs. The online communication requires 12d/l elements per multiplication gate. The communication cost per multiplication gate in the preprocessing phase is Î˜(n log n). This is the first protocol over Zpk such that an arithmetic circuit can be evaluated with overall communication complexity O(1) elements per multiplication gate.
