C ontinuing the rich tradition of the previous SRDSs, the technical program of SRDSâ€™98 presents a collection of excellent paper sessions on various aspects of computer systems reliability. This year we broadened the scope to include important topics such as computer networks and computer security. More than 30 technical papers from experts from industry, academia, and research labs worldwide are organized into 11 sessions and present the state-of-the-art in reliable computer and communications industry. In addition, the technical program includes a keynote talk. We are very fortunate to have three workshops on key areas held in conjunction with the Symposium. I am hoping that the technical program and workshops will stimulate future research in this area.
