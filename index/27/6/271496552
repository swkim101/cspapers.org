We present an approach to solving 2D human pose estimation in videos. The problem of human pose estimation in videos differs from estimating human poses in static images since videos contain a lot of motion related information. Thus, we investigate how to utilize by the information of the human body movements across in a sequence of video frames for estimating human poses in videos. To do this, we introduce a novel heatmap regression method what we call motion-aware heatmap regression. Our approach computes motion vectors in joint keypoints from adjacent frames. We then design a new style of heatmap that we call Motion-Aware Heatmaps to reflect the motion uncertainty of each joint point. Unlike traditional heatmaps, our motion-aware heatmaps not only consider the current joint locations but also account how joints move over time. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective framework designed to incorporate motion information into heatmap regression. We evaluate our motion-aware heatmap regression on PoseTrack(2018, 21) and Sub-JHMDB datasets. Our results validate that the proposed motion-aware heatmaps significantly improve the precision of human pose estimation in videos, particularly in challenging scenarios such as videos like sports game footage with substantial human motions.
