Pervasive Edge Computing (PEC), a recent addition to the edge computing paradigm, leverages the computing resources of end-user devices to execute computation tasks in close proximity to users. One of the primary challenges in the PEC environment is determining the appropriate servers for offloading computation tasks based on factors, such as computation latency, response quality, device reliability, and cost of service. Computation outsourcing in the PEC ecosystem requires additional security and privacy considerations. Finally, mechanisms need to be in place to guarantee fair payment for the executed service(s). We present PEPPER, a novel, privacy-preserving, and decentralized framework that addresses aforementioned challenges by utilizing blockchain technology and trusted execution environments (TEE). PEPPER improves the performance of PEC by allocating resources among end-users efficiently and securely. It also provides the underpinnings for building a financial ecosystem at the pervasive edge. To evaluate the effectiveness of PEPPER, we developed and deployed a proof of concept implementation on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing Intel SGX as the TEE technology. We propose a simple but highly effective remote attestation method that is particularly beneficial to PEC compared to the standard remote attestation method used today. Our extensive comparison experiment shows that PEPPER is 1.23× to 2.15× faster than the current standard remote attestation procedure. In addition, we formally prove the security of our system using the universal composability (UC) framework.
