Ethereum smart contracts offer innovative ways to automate transactions and execute agreements within blockchain systems. However, its inherent complexity can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. With the advent of large language models, many studies put a special focus on identifying vulnerabilities using these models. Nonetheless, language models are ineffective with the lengthy input sequences. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a novel multi-label vulnerability detection mechanism using pre-trained language model CodeT5+ combined with a unique multi-block fusion. The results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can achieve up to 0.998 F1-score and require only 0.39 ms of processing time on a collected dataset comprising 421,266 contracts from Ethereum.
