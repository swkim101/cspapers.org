We introduce a task and dataset for referring expression generation and comprehension in multi-agent embodied environments.In this task, two agents in a shared scene must take into account one anotherâ€™s visual perspective, which may be different from their own, to both produce and understand references to objects in a scene and the spatial relations between them.We collect a dataset of 2,970 human-written referring expressions, each paired with human comprehension judgments, and evaluate the performance of automated models as speakers and listeners paired with human partners, finding that model performance in both reference generation and comprehension lags behind that of pairs of human agents.Finally, we experiment training an open-weight speaker model with evidence of communicative success when paired with a listener, resulting in an improvement from 58.9 to 69.3% in communicative success and even outperforming the strongest proprietary model.
