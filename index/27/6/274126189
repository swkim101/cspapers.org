A NSF ILI grant funded development of parallel and distributed laboratories for an undergraduate course in parallel algorithms. The laboratory assignments explored various parallel and distributed architectures, and paradigms. These assignments were implemented using the Joyce/Linda[McDonald92] language. The Joyce/Linda software was also utilized to develop parallel and distributed laboratory assignments for courses in data structures, operating systems and computer networks. The parallel and distributed algorithms course examined both theoretical and practical areas of study.
