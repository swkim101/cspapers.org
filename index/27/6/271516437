In multi-robot informative path planning the problem is to find a route for each robot in a team to visit a set of locations that can provide the most useful data to reconstruct an unknown scalar field. In the budgeted version, each robot is subject to a travel budget limiting the distance it can travel. Our interest in this problem is motivated by applications in precision agriculture, where robots are used to collect measurements to estimate domain-relevant scalar parameters such as soil moisture or nitrates concentrations. In this paper, we propose an online, distributed multi-robot sampling algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) where each robot iteratively selects the next sampling location through communication with other robots and considering its remaining budget.We evaluate our proposed method for varying team sizes and in different environments, and we compare our solution with four different baseline methods. Our experiments show that our solution outperforms the baselines when the budget is tight by collecting measurements leading to smaller reconstruction errors.
