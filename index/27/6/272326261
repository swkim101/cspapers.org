In contrast to the prevailing interpretation of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a means of simulating weight changes in model adaptation, this paper introduces an alternative perspective by framing it as a control process. Specifically, we conceptualize lightweight matrices in LoRA as con-trol modules tasked with perturbing the original, complex, yet frozen blocks on downstream tasks. Building upon this new understanding, we conduct a thorough analysis on the controllability of these modules, where we identify and establish sufficient conditions that facilitate their effective integration into downstream controls. Moreover, the control modules are redesigned by incorporating nonlinearities through a parameter-free attention mechanism. This modification allows for the intermingling of tokens within the controllers, enhancing the adaptability and performance of the system. Empirical findings substantiate that, without introducing any additional parameters, this approach surpasses the LoRA algorithms across all assessed datasets and rank configurations.
