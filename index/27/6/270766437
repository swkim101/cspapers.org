Recent advances in cross-technology communication can support direct communication among heterogeneous IoT devices (i.e., WiFi, ZigBee, and BLE) without requiring any modifications to the hardware, which has significantly improved the communication efficiency and shown great advantages for supporting smart applications. However, until now a key establishment protocol to support secure and reliable asymmetric cross- technology communication (CTC) is missing, which introduces severe privacy and security issues. Existing solutions are not designed for CTC, since they mainly focus on the symmetric communication among homogeneous IoT devices. In this work, we present a Key Establishment Protocol (KEP), which explores and lever- ages the unique feature of CTC - Possibility PN Sequence Reception (PSR) to not only perform key establishment between heterogeneous IoT devices with different physical layers (i.e., WiFi and ZigBee) but also improve the communication reliability at the same time. Our extensive real-world experiments show that KEP can finish the key establishment in seconds and effectively defend against multiple types of attacks. Furthermore, KEP doubles the packet reception ratio compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.
