WWW2002 is the eleventh in the proud series of International WWW Conferences that began in May 1994, in Geneva at CERN, the birthplace of the web.If you are reading the paper version of the proceedings published for us by ACM or navigating the a copy of the CD-ROM distributed you are mostly likely one of the people who were fortunate enough to join us in Hawaii for WWW2002. But for everyone else, these proceedings are most likely to be indexed, searched, browsed, read and archived on the web itself. This is just one of the many remarkable ways in which the web has already transformed or promises to transform nearly every aspect of our world.Under the superb leadership of our Program Co-Chairs, Arun Iyengar and Dave De Roure, our international program committee has thoroughly reviewed and carefully selected this set of papers that truly capture the state of our art with the web today. I am proud and honored to be able to share in presenting the results of their work and the scholarship of our exemplary authors in these Proceedings.
