This volume contains the papers presented at the 10th Euromicro Workshop on Real-Time Systems, held in Berlin, Germany, June 17-19, 1998. The interest in real-time systems has grown quickly along with the deployment of increasingly more powerful microprocessors and communication networks in a widening variety of applications since the first Euromicro RTS workshop in 1989. One subject, Scheduling Theory, in particular has matured during the decade and is now being used in significant applications.
