Equipped with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, video content generation has gained significant research interest recently. However, diffusion pipelines call for intensive computation and model storage, which poses challenges for their wide and efficient deployment. In this work, we address this issue by integrating LCM-LoRA to reduce the denoising steps and escalating the video generation process by frame skipping and interpolation. Our framework achieves an approximately 10Ã— inference acceleration for high-quality realistic video generation on commonly available GPUs.
