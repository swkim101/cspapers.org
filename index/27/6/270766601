Data breaches in the cloud are on the rise and are becoming more costly to organizations each year. Client-side encryption refers to the practice of encrypting data on end users' devices before uploading it to the cloud. This approach ensures that data is encrypted during transit and storage, making data inaccessible to anyone without the decryption keys, including service providers and other potential attackers. In this talk, we will first look at the challenges of client-side encryption and provide an overview of the key advancements as well as setbacks in addressing these challenges in the past two decades, including scalable access of encrypted data and search over encrypted data. There are numerous academic publications in this area and the choice of which techniques to use could have significant impact on the system's security, efficiency, and usability. Finally, we will present our design and implementation of a client-side encryption system for enterprise users.
