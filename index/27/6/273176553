This paper presents a software architecture that can dynamically and transparently establish direct communication paths between DPDK-based virtual network functions executed in virtual machines, by recognizing new point-to-point connections in traffic steering rules. We demonstrate the huge advantages of this architecture in terms of performance and the possibility to implement it with localized modifications in Open vSwitch and DPDK, without touching the VNFs.
