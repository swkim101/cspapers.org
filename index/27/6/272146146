In this work, we tackle the task of point cloud denoising through a novel framework that adapts Diffusion Schr\"odinger bridges to points clouds. Unlike previous approaches that predict point-wise displacements from point features or learned noise distributions, our method learns an optimal transport plan between paired point clouds. Experiments on object datasets like PU-Net and real-world datasets such as ScanNet++ and ARKitScenes show that P2P-Bridge achieves significant improvements over existing methods. While our approach demonstrates strong results using only point coordinates, we also show that incorporating additional features, such as color information or point-wise DINOv2 features, further enhances the performance.
