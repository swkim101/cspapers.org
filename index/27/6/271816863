We propose a shared semantic map architecture to construct and configure Model Predictive Controllers (MPC) dynamically, that solve navigation problems for multiple robotic agents sharing parts of the same environment. The navigation task is represented as a sequence of semantically labeled areas in the map, that must be traversed sequentially, i.e. a route. Each semantic label represents one or more constraints on the robotsâ€™ motion behaviour in that area. The advantages of this approach are: (i) an MPC-based motion controller in each individual robot can be (re-)configured, at runtime, with the locally and temporally relevant parameters; (ii) the application can influence, also at runtime, the navigation behaviour of the robots, just by adapting the semantic labels; and (iii) the robots can reason about their need for coordination, through analyzing over which horizon in time and space their routes overlap. The paper provides simulations of various representative situations, showing that the approach of runtime configuration of the MPC drastically decreases computation time, while retaining task execution performance similar to an approach in which each robot always includes all other robots in its MPC computations.
