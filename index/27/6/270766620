How can we identify live Command & Control (C2) servers for a given IoT malware binary? An effective solution to this problem constitutes a significant capability towards detecting and containing botnets. This task is not trivial because C2 servers are short-lived, and they use sophisticated and proprietary communication protocols. We propose C2Miner, a novel approach to trick IoT malware binaries into revealing their currently live C2 servers. Our approach weaponizes old disposable IoT malware binaries and uses them to probe active servers. We provide novel solutions to overcome the following challenges: (a) disambiguating the C2-bound traffic generated by the malware and (b) determining if a target IP:port is indeed a C2 server as opposed to a benign server. In our evaluation, based on 3M distinct exploration attempts over 150K distinct IP addresses, we show that we can identify C2 servers within a given IP:port space with an F1 score of 86%. In addition, we show how our approach can be used in practice and at scale. Conducting a large-scale probing campaign has scalability issues given that the number of probes is proportional to the IP addresses, the number of ports, and the number of binaries from distinct families which we want to explore. To address this challenge, we propose a grammar-based method to fingerprint and cluster C2 communications which, among other applications, allows us to select malware binaries for weaponization efficiently. Additionally, we use spatio-temporal features of C2 servers to narrow down our search in the entire IP space. An optimistic observation from our study is that using only 2 (more than 6 months) old IoT malware binaries, we scan 18K IP:port pairs daily for 6 days and find 6 new live C2 servers.
