Existing research of video understanding still struggles to achieve in-depth comprehension and reasoning in complex videos, primarily due to the under-exploration of two key bottlenecks: fine-grained spatial-temporal perceptive understanding and cognitive-level video scene comprehension . This paper bridges the gap by presenting a novel solution. We first introduce a novel video Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), MotionEpic , which achieves fine-grained pixel-level spatial-temporal video grounding by integrating video spatial-temporal scene graph (STSG) representation. Building upon MotionEpic, we then develop a Video-of-Thought ( VoT ) reasoning framework. VoT inher-its the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) core, breaking down a complex task into simpler and manageable sub-problems, and addressing them step-by-step from a low-level pixel perception to high-level cognitive interpretation. Extensive experiments across various complex video QA benchmarks demonstrate that our overall framework strikingly boosts existing state-of-the-art. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at successfully implementing the CoT technique for achieving human-level video reasoning, where we show great potential in extending it to a wider range of video understanding scenarios.
