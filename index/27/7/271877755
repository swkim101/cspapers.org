Text simplification is the process of rewriting a piece of text using simpler vocabulary and grammatical structure in order to make the text more accessible and understandable for a larger audience. In this paper, we introduce a new text simplification model based on the notion of adaptive teaching using a teacher network and a text generation network. We name this new model Simplification via Adaptive Teaching (SAT). Our proposed model sets a new state-of-the-art performance in terms of standard simplification metrics such as SARI and D-SARI with a significant improvement over the previous state of the art on the D-Wikipedia dataset and the Wiki-Doc benchmark dataset. Moreover, we conduct a human evaluation in terms of text simplicity, correctness, and fluency to substantiate SATâ€™s performance.
