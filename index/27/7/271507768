Exploring the realms of counterfactuals, this paper introduces a versatile approach in text generation using structural causal models (SCM), broadening the scope beyond traditional singular causal studies to encompass complex, multi-layered relationships. To comprehensively explore these intricate, multi-layered causal relationships in text generation, we introduce a generalized approach based on the structural causal model (SCM), adept at handling complex causal interactions in a spectrum ranging from everyday stories to financial reports.Specifically, our method begins by disentangling each component of the text into pairs of latent variables, representing elements that remain unchanged and those subject to variation. Subsequently, counterfactual interventions are applied to these latent variables, facilitating the generation of outcomes that are influenced by complex causal dynamics. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both a public story generation dataset and a specially constructed dataset in the financial domain. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of automatic and human evaluation criteria, underscoring its effectiveness and versatility in diverse text generation contexts.
