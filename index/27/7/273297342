We present an initial step towards building a system for programmers to edit code using free-form sketch annotations drawn directly onto editor and output windows. Using a working prototype system as a technical probe, an exploratory study ( ùëÅ = 6) examines how programmers sketch to annotate Python code to communicate edits for an AI model to perform. The results reveal personalized work-flow strategies and how similar annotations vary in abstractness and intention across different scenarios and users.
