Gecko-inspired adhesives have the advantage of being able to grasp and release flat surfaces in a vacuum using their microwedge structures. This makes them an especially attractive solution for perching on and grasping flat objects in space for free-flying robots. To grasp and anchor onto these flat surfaces, the gripper must ensure contact between the gecko adhesives and the surface before applying the appropriate forces to activate their adhesion. However, in the case of a free-flying robot in microgravity, physical contact with the surface induces reaction forces, causing the robot to quickly bounce away from the surface. To solve this issue, we propose a simple passive mechanism and a control method of a robotic arm on a free-flying robot with a gecko adhesive gripper. The gripper utilizes a single-motor controlled tendon-driven mechanism mounted at the end of a robotic arm equipped with controllable stiffness joints and a linear spring-damper system. A free-flying robot on an air-bearing platform can successfully perch on a flat surface with a velocity of up to 72.5mm/s and with an approach angle misalignment of up to 33.0 degrees.
