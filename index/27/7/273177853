This paper delves into a Game Jam, a workshop-based investigation widespread in the game design community, to explore the potential and applications of CARDinality, a card-shaped robotic device, giving insights into the material implications and prototyping potential of this novel platform. During the Game Jam, 9 participants were informed of basic game design principles and techniques from a game design researcher. They then interacted with our hardware devices to brainstorm future card games supported by CARDinality, revealing a breadth of unique applications anchored in ‘play.’
