Deep learning based object detection has many important real-life applications. Like other deep learning models, object detection models are susceptible to backdoor attacks. The unique characteristics of object detection, such as returning a set of object bounding boxes with labels, pose new challenges to backdoor scanning. Trigger inversion techniques that aim to reverse engineer a trigger to determine if a model is trojaned have to consider which bounding boxes may be attacked, if the attack causes bounding box relocation, and if the attack may even lead to appearance of ‘ghost’ objects invisible to humans. This much larger attack vector makes trigger inversion very challenging. We propose a new trigger inversion technique that leverages a number of critical observations to reduce the search space to an affordable level. Our experiments on 334 benign models and 360 trojaned models with 4 structures and 6 attacks show that our technique can consistently achieve over 0.9 ROC-AUC. In the latest TrojAI competition on object detection, our solution achieved 0.926 ROC-AUC, out-performing the second-best solution by 21.4% (with 0.763 ROC-AUC).
