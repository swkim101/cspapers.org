Occupational skill demand (OSD) forecasting seeks to predict dynamic skill demand specific to occupations, beneficial for employees and employers to grasp occupational nature and maintain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving labor market. Although recent research has proposed data-driven techniques for forecasting skill demand, the focus has remained predominantly on overall trends rather than occupational granularity. In this paper, we propose a novel Pre-training Enhanced Dynamic Graph Autoencoder (Pre-DyGAE), forecasting skill demand from an occupational perspective. Specifically, we aggregate job descriptions (JDs) by occupation and segment them into several timestamps. Subsequently, in the initial timestamps, we pre-train a graph autoencoder (GAE), consisting of a semantically-aware cross-attention enhanced uncertainty-aware encoder and decoders for link prediction and edge regression to achieve graph reconstruction. In particular, we utilize contrastive learning on skill cooccurrence clusters to solve the data sparsity and a unified Tweedie and ranking loss for predicting the imbalanced distribution. Afterward, we incorporate an adaptive temporal encoding unit and a temporal shift module into GAE to achieve a dynamic GAE (DyGAE). Furthermore, we fine-tune the DyGAE with a two-stage optimization strategy and infer future representations. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of Pre-DyGAE compared with state-of-the-art baselines.
