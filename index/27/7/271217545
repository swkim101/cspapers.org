For over forty years, researchers have demonstrated that operating system memory managers often fall short in supporting memory-hungry applications. The problem is even more critical today, with disaggregated memory and new memory technologies and in the presence of tera-scale machine learning models, large-scale graph processing, and other memory-intensive applications. Past attempts to provide application-specific memory management either required significant in-kernel changes or suffered from high overhead. We present E XT M EM , a flexible framework for providing application-specific memory management. It differs from prior solutions in three ways: (1) It is compatible with todayâ€™s Linux de-ployments, (2) it is a general-purpose substrate for addressing various memory and storage backends, and (3) it is performant in multithreaded environments. E XT M EM allows for easy and rapid prototyping of new memory management algorithms, easy collection of memory patterns and statistics, and immediate deployment of isolated custom memory management.
