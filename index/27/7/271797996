In nature, fish are excellent swimmers due to their flexible and precise control of tail, which allows them to freely transform between the smooth flapping and the motion of rapid response so that they can move with dexterity. Here, inspired by the versatile motion abilities of fish, a novel robotic fish has been developed, featuring the capability of adaptable bistability. Through tuning the bistability, the robot can acquire two locomotion modes, namely monostable and bistable modes, and it can also swim at different energy barrier that needs to be overcome to realize the bistable motion. The theoretical models are derived to facilitate the control of the robot and the understanding of its nonlinear behavior. The impact of the tunable bistability on the swimming and turning performance is investigated through extensive experiments. The study effectively demonstrates the robotic fishâ€™s capability to swiftly and efficiently navigate through mode switches, enabled by its tunable bistability. This feature is essential for underwater robots to perform tasks in intricate environments.
