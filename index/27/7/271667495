Inverse lithography technology (ILT) plays a crucial role in optical proximity correction, tending to generate curvilinear masks for optimal process windows. Traditional curvilinear mask manufacturing involves fracturing into rectangles, requiring expensive mask write times. A novel E-beam mask writer that writes variable radius circles per shot significantly reduces the shot count for curvilinear masks. To exploit this mask writer’s benefits, we present two meth-ods to generate circular fracturing-aware masks. The first one converts pixel-based masks from existing ILT methods into circle-based masks using predefined rules. The second one integrates circular constraints into the ILT process, generating circle-based masks directly via optimization. Extensive experimental results validate both approaches’ effectiveness.
