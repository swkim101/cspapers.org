Value iteration networks (VINs) enable end-to-end learning for planning tasks by employing a differentiable"planning module"that approximates the value iteration algorithm. However, long-term planning remains a challenge because training very deep VINs is difficult. To address this problem, we embed highway value iteration -- a recent algorithm designed to facilitate long-term credit assignment -- into the structure of VINs. This improvement augments the"planning module"of the VIN with three additional components: 1) an"aggregate gate,"which constructs skip connections to improve information flow across many layers; 2) an"exploration module,"crafted to increase the diversity of information and gradient flow in spatial dimensions; 3) a"filter gate"designed to ensure safe exploration. The resulting novel highway VIN can be trained effectively with hundreds of layers using standard backpropagation. In long-term planning tasks requiring hundreds of planning steps, deep highway VINs outperform both traditional VINs and several advanced, very deep NNs.
