In this paper, we present LiDAR-Net, a new real-scanned indoor point cloud dataset, containing nearly 3.6 billion precisely point-level annotated points, covering an expansive area of 30,000m2. It encompasses three prevalent daily environments, including learning scenes, working scenes, and living scenes. LiDAR-Net is characterized by its non-uniform point distribution, e.g., scanning holes and scanning lines. Additionally, it meticulously records and an-notates scanning anomalies, including reflection noise and ghost. These anomalies stem from specular reflections on glass or metal, as well as distortions due to moving persons. LiDAR-Net's realistic representation of non-uniform distribution and anomalies significantly enhances the training of deep learning models, leading to improved generalization in practical applications. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on LiDAR-Net and provide a detailed analysis of the results. Crucially, our research identifies several fundamental challenges in understanding indoor point clouds, contributing essential insights to future explorations in this field.
