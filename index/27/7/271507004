Anchor based pair-wised multi-view clustering often assumes multi-view data are paired, and has demonstrated significant advancements in recent years. However, this presumption is easily violated, and data is commonly unpaired fully in practical applications due to the influence of data collection and storage processes. Addressing unpaired large-scale multi-view data through anchor learning remains a research gap. The absence of pairing in multi-view data disrupts the consistency and complementarity of multiple views, posing significant challenges in learning powerful and meaningful anchors and bipartite graphs from unpaired multi-view data. To tackle this challenge, this study proposes a novel Fast Unpaired Multi-view Clustering (FUMC) framework for fully unpaired large-scale multi-view data. Specifically, FUMC first designs an inverse local manifold learning paradigm to guide the learned anchors for effective pairing and balancing, ensuring alignment, fairness, and power in unpaired multi-view data. Meanwhile, a novel bipartite graph matching framework is developed to align unpaired bipartite graphs, creating a consistent bipartite graph from unpaired multi-view data. The efficacy, efficiency, and superiority of our FUMC are corroborated through extensive evaluations on numerous benchmark datasets with shallow and deep SOTA methods.
