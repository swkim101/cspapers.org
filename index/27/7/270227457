Among existing schemes for soft error resilience, acoustic-sensor-based detection stands out owing to its ability to prevent silent data corruption at low hardware cost. However, the state-of-the-art work not only incurs a considerable run-time overhead but also complicates the processor pipeline with intrusive microarchitectural modifications, hindering its practical deployment in real silicon. To this end, this paper presents VeriPipe, a near-zero-cost compiler/architecture codesign scheme for soft error resilience. VeriPipe compiler partitions input program to a series of regions (epochs) statically, while VeriPipe hardware verifies if they are error-free dynamically. In particular, VeriPipe achieves a simple yet efficient region-level verification where each region goes through a three-stage (Execute, Verify, and Commit) verification pipeline to ensure the absence of soft errors before proceeding to the next region. In particular, VeriPipe hardware overlaps the Verify stage of each region with the Execute stage of the next region, thereby effectively hiding the Verify delay. Experiments with 43 applications from SPEC2006/2017/NPB-CPP/SPLASH3/DoE Mini-Apps highlight the negligible overheads of VeriPipe, i.e., an average of 1% run-time overhead and a storage overhead of only 3 registers and 1 countdown timer.
