Efficient image processing is increasingly crucial in constrained embedded and real-time platforms, especially in emerging applications such as Autonomous Driving (AD) or Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR). A commonality among most image processing operations is their reliance on primitives like convolutions and stencil operations, which typically utilize a sliding window dataflow. Many existing implementations are domain-specific, lacking generality, or are programmable at the cost of sacrificing performance and energy efficiency. Among the latter, the CPU-based platforms that typically rely on Vector Processing Units (VPUs) often miss critical optimization opportunities, particularly those arising from the overlapping nature of the mentioned windowed image processing operations. In response, we propose SLIDEX, a novel high-performance and energy-efficient vector ISA extension to exploit Sliding Window Processing (SWP) in conventional CPUs. SWP extends the conventional vector SIMD execution model, treating vector registers like variable-sized groups of overlapping pixel windows. SLIDEX-enabled VPU processes multiple windows simultaneously, maximizing the Data Level Parallelism (DLP) achievable per instruction while maintaining the same vector length. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the need for data access, movement, and alignment, decreasing memory and register file accesses compared to traditional SIMD designs. To support SLIDEX, we introduce a cost-effective microarchitecture designed for easy integration into existing VPUs with minimal modifications. We demonstrate the efficacy of SLIDEX by testing it on a state-of-the-art visual localization task critical in AD and AR/VR. The results are compelling: SLIDEX achieves significant speedups in vital tasks such as 2D convolutions for image filtering and stencil operations for feature extraction, leading to an overall speedup of ∼ 1.2 × and up to 19% energy reduction compared to traditional vector extensions.
