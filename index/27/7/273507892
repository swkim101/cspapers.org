Non-intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NALM) aims to recognize individual appliance usage from the main meter without indoor sensors. However, existing systems struggle to balance dataset construction efficiency and event/state recognition accuracy, especially for low-power appliance recognition. This paper introduces Hawk, an efficient and accurate NALM system that operates in two stages: dataset construction and event recognition. In the data construction stage, we efficiently collect a balanced and diverse dataset, HawkDATA, based on balanced Gray code and enable automatic data annotations via a sampling synchronization strategy called shared perceptible time. During the event recognition stage, our algorithm integrates steady-state differential pre-processing and voting-based post-processing for accurate event recognition from the aggregate current. Experimental results show that HawkDATA takes only 1/71.5 of the collection time to collect 6.34x more appliance state combinations than the baseline. In HawkDATA and a widely used dataset, Hawk achieves an average F1 score of 93.94% for state recognition and 97.07% for event recognition, which is a 47. 98% and 11. 57% increase over SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, selected appliance subsets and the model trained from HawkDATA are deployed in two real-world scenarios with many unknown background appliances. The average F1 scores of event recognition are 96.02% and 94.76%. Hawk's source code and HawkDATA are accessible at https://github.com/WZiJ/SenSys24-Hawk.
