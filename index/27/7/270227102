In the realm of neural network computation, optical neural network accelerators (ONNs) have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging the inherent speed and parallelism of optical systems. Despite their potential, current ONN designs often fall short due to inefficient data movement and reliance on traditional electronics-based dataflows. Herein, we introduce a pioneering approach to ONN implementation that incorporates the Number Theoretical Transform (NTT), known for its effective divide-and-conquer strategy, non-floating-point operations, and multi-level parallelism. This integration significantly reduces data mapping costs for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), making it particularly well-suited for optical convolution neural networks (OCNNs) with considerable performance and efficiency escalation. For the first time, our proposed methodology realizes the benefits of NTT in ONN. We employ an innovatively designed optical butterfly structure that facilitates real-time NTT computation while occupying a minimal footprint. The resulting system, termed NEOCNN, showcases a remarkable throughput capability of up to 61 Tera Operations per Second (TOPs) and demonstrates a power efficiency of 9.6 TOPs/Watt, all while maintaining reliable inference accuracy. This work not only represents a stride toward more efficient ONNs but also sets a precedent for future research in combining Number Theoretical Transforms with optical computing paradigms.
