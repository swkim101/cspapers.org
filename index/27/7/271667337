The manufacturing and characterization of nanographite films on substrates form the foundation for advances in materials science. Conductive graphite films are challenging products, as isolating graphite oxide is often necessary. In this study, nanographite suspensions containing non-oxidized graphite flakes were used to fabricate novel thin and ultrathin films via blade coating on industry-standard substrates. Films as thin as 346 nm were successfully fabricated. Moreover, it was possible to induce the orientation of the graphite nanoflakes via blade coating. This orientation led to electrical anisotropy; thus, the electrical behavior of the films in each orthogonal direction differed. After adjusting the coating parameters and the concentration of the nanographite flakes, the electrical conductivity ranged from 0.04 S/cm to 0.33 S/cm. In addition, with such adjustments, the transparency of the films in the visible range varied from 20% to 75%. By establishing a methodology for the tuning of both electrical and optical properties via adjustments in the nanographite suspension and coating parameters, we can fabricate resistant, conductive, and transparent films satisfying certain requirements. The results presented here can be extrapolated to enhance applications, especially for photonics and solar cells, in fields that require electrical conductive materials with high levels of transparency.
