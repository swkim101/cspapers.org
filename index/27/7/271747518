Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reason-001 ing, aiming to predict future unknown facts 002 based on historical information, has attracted 003 considerable attention due to its great practi-004 cal value. Insight into history is the key to 005 predict the future. However, most existing 006 TKG reasoning models singly capture repet-007 itive history, ignoring the entityâ€™s multi-hop 008 neighbour history which can provide valuable 009 background knowledge for TKG reasoning. In 010 this paper, we propose M ulti-G ranularity His-011 tory and E ntity S imilarity L earning (MGESL) 012 model for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reason-013 ing, which models historical information from 014 both coarse-grained and fine-grained history. 015 Since similar entities tend to exhibit similar 016 behavioural patterns, we also design a hyper-017 graph convolution aggregator to capture the 018 similarity between entities. Furthermore, we 019 introduce a more realistic setting for the TKG 020 reasoning, where candidate entities are already 021 known at the timestamp to be predicted. Exten-022 sive experiments on three benchmark datasets 023 demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 024 model. 025
