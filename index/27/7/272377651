Recent advancements in 3D-bioprinting technology have sparked a growing interest in its application for brain repair, encompassing tissue regeneration, drug delivery, and disease modeling. This literature review examines studies conducted over the past five years to assess the current state of research in this field. Common bioprinting methods and key parameters influencing their selection are explored, alongside an analysis of the diverse types of bioink utilized and their associated parameters. The extrusion-based 3D-bioprinting method emerged as the most widely studied and popular topic, followed by inkjet-based and laser-based bioprinting and stereolithography. Regarding bioinks, fibrin-based and collagen-based bioinks are predominantly utilized. Furthermore, this review elucidates how 3D bioprinting holds promise for neural tissue repair, regeneration, and drug screening, detailing the steps involved and various approaches employed. Neurovascular 3D printing and bioscaffold 3D printing stand out as the top two preferred methods for brain repair. The recent studiesâ€™ shortcomings and potential solutions to address them are also examined and discussed. Overall, by synthesizing recent findings, this review provides valuable insights into the potential of 3D bioprinting for advancing brain repairment strategies.
