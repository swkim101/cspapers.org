Dynamic regret minimization offers a principled way for non-stationary online learning, where the algorithmâ€™s performance is evaluated against changing comparators. Prevailing methods often employ a two-layer online ensemble, consisting of a group of base learners with different configurations and a meta learner that combines their outputs. Given the evident computational overhead associated with two-layer algorithms, this paper investigates how to attain optimal dynamic regret without deploying a model ensemble. To this end, we introduce the notion of underlying dynamic regret , a specific form of the general dynamic regret that can encompass many applications of interest. We show that almost optimal dynamic regret can be obtained using a single-layer model alone. This is achieved by an adaptive restart equipped with wavelet detection, wherein a novel streaming wavelet operator is introduced to online update the wavelet coefficients via a carefully designed binary indexed tree. We apply our method to the online label shift adaptation problem, leading to new algorithms with optimal dynamic regret and significantly improved computation/storage efficiency compared to prior arts. Extensive experiments validate our proposal.
