Web applications have been shifting their storage systems from sql to nosql systems. nosql systems scale well but drop many convenient sql features, such as joins, secondary indexes, and/or transactions. We design, develop, and evaluate Yesquel, a system that provides performance and scalability comparable to nosql with all the features of a sql relational system. Yesquel has a new architecture and a new distributed data structure, called YDBT, which Yesquel uses for storage, and which performs well under contention by many concurrent clients. We evaluate Yesquel and find that Yesquel performs almost as well as Redis---a popular nosql system---and much better than mysql Cluster, while handling sql queries at scale.
