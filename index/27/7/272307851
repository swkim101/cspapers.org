As users engage more frequently with AI conversational agents, conversations may exceed their “memory” capacity, leading to failures in correctly leveraging certain memories for tailored responses. However, in finding past memories that can be reused or referenced, users need to retrieve relevant information in various conversations and articulate to the AI their intention to reuse these memories. To support this process, we introduce Memolet , an interactive object that reifies memory reuse. Users can directly manipulate Memolet to specify which memories to reuse and how to use them. We developed a system demonstrating Memolet ’s interaction across various memory reuse stages, including memory extraction, organization, prompt articulation, and generation refinement. We examine the system’s usefulness with an N=12 within-subject study and provide design implications for future systems that support user-AI conversational memory reusing
