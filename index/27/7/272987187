Zero-shot inference, where pre-trained models perform tasks without specific training data, is an exciting emergent ability of large models like CLIP. Although there has been considerable exploration into enhancing zero-shot abilities in image captioning (IC) for popular datasets such as MSCOCO and Flickr8k, these approaches fall short with fine-grained datasets like CUB, FLO, UCM-Captions, and Sydney-Captions. These datasets require captions to discern between visually and semantically similar classes, focusing on detailed object parts and their attributes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRaining-Free Object-Part Enhancement (TROPE). TROPE enriches a base caption with additional object-part details using object detector proposals and Natural Language Processing techniques. It complements rather than alters the base caption, allowing seamless integration with other captioning methods and offering users enhanced flexibility. Our evaluations show that TROPE consistently boosts performance across all tested zero-shot IC approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained IC datasets.
