Loop tiling and loop interchange (or permutation) are techniques that can expose task and data-level parallelisms and can exploit data locality available in multi-dimensional loop nests. Choosing the appropriate tile size and loop order is important to achieve significant performance improvement. However, the effect of these transformations on the performance of the loop nest is not straightforward due to the complex interplay of several architectural features in multi-/many-core architectures. In this work, we propose using a supervised learning technique and develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based hierarchical classifier to identify the best-performing tile size and loop order for a given loop nest. Our approach results in identifying tile sizes and loop orders whose performance, on average, is within 18% and 9% of the optimal performance for two sets of loop nests on Intel Xeon Cascadelake architecture. Further, our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, Pluto and Polly, with a geometric mean speedup of 1.35x to 1.58x.
