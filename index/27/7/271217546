With traffic surveillance increasingly used, thousands of cameras on roads send video feeds to cloud servers to run computer vision algorithms, requiring high bandwidth. State-of-the-art techniques reduce the bandwidth requirement by either sending a limited number of frames/pixels/regions or relying on re-encoding the important parts of the video. This imposes significant overhead on both the camera side and server side compute as re-encoding is expensive. In this work, we propose T ILE C LIPPER , a system that utilizes tile sampling, where a limited number of rectangular areas within the frames, known as tiles, are sent to the server. T ILE C LIPPER selects the tiles adaptively by utilizing its correlation with the tile bitrates. We evaluate T ILE C LIPPER on different datasets having 55 videos in total to show that, on average, our technique reduces â‰ˆ 22% of data sent to the cloud while providing a detection accuracy of 92% with minimal calibration and compute compared to prior works. We show real-time tile filtering of T ILE C LIP - PER even on cheap edge devices like Raspberry Pi 4 and nVidia Jetson Nano. We further create a live deployment of T ILE C LIPPER to show that it provides over 87% detection accuracy and over 55% bandwidth savings.
