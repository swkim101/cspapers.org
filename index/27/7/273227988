Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs)have led to claims of AI surpassing humansin natural language processing NLP tasks such as textual understanding and reasoning.%This work investigates these assertions by introducingCAIMIRA, a novel framework rooted in item response theory IRTthat enables quantitative assessment and comparison of problem-solving abilities inquestion-answering QA agents.%Through analysis of over 300,000 responses from ~ 70 AI systemsand 155 humans across thousands of quiz questions, CAIMIRA uncovers distinctproficiency patterns in knowledge domains and reasoning skills. %Humans outperform AI systems in knowledge-grounded abductive and conceptual reasoning,while state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 Turbo and Llama-3-70B demonstrate superior performance ontargeted information retrieval and fact-based reasoning, particularly when information gapsare well-defined and addressable through pattern matching or data retrieval.%These findings identify key areas for future QA tasks and model development,highlighting the critical need for questions that not only challengehigher-order reasoning and scientific thinking, but also demand nuanced linguisticand cross-contextual application.
