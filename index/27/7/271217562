Federated singular value decomposition (SVD) is a foundation for many real-world distributed applications. Existing federated SVD studies either require external servers which downgrade privacy protection or leverage homomorphic encryption (HE) to get rid of external servers ( i.e ., being decentralized) but suffer from significant inefficiencies caused by extensive computational and communication overhead. This paper presents Excalibur 1 , an efficient decentralized federated SVD system. At its core, Excalibur proposes a lightweight matrix protection method to reduce the computational degradation caused by cryptographic operations, improving computation performance. Furthermore, it designs a communication-efficient decentralized SVD workflow based on the quantitative analysis of the design space, optimizing communication performance. To validate the efficiency of Excalibur, we implement a fully functional Excalibur sys-tem and evaluate it with real-world applications. Our results show that Excalibur not only removes the external servers but also achieves 3 . 1 × ∼ 6 . 0 × faster performance than state-of-the-art (SOTA) server-aided method on different shapes of billion-scale data. In addition, Excalibur exhibits > 23000 × larger throughput than the SOTA HE-based system.
