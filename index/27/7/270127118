IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) only has two modes of trust---complete trust or complete untrust. The lack of nuance leaves no room for sensors that a user does not fully trust but wants to connect to their network, such as a WiFi sensor. Solutions exist, but they require advanced knowledge of network administration. We solve this problem by introducing a new way of modulating data in the latency of the network, called Latency Shift Keying. We use specific characteristics of the WiFi protocol to carefully control the latency of just one device on the network. We build a transmitter, receiver, and modulation scheme that is designed to encode data in the latency of a network. We develop an application, Wicket, that solves the WiFi trust issue using Latency Shift Keying to create a new security association between an untrusted WiFi sensor and a wired device on the trusted network. We evaluate its performance and show that it works in many network conditions and environments.
