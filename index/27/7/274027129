 Digital twin (DT) refers to any model that reflects a physical system and remains updated with the real-time data from the physical system. Recently, DT constructed with a reduced-order model (DT-ROM) has been applied to aerodynamics and structure health monitoring tasks, whose partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to design the online update formula for reduced bases and coefficients in DT-ROM. Although such online update methods improve the performance of DT-ROM, they are not applicable when the PDEs of a system are unknown. This paper focuses on the online update task where a system is modeled with a DT-ROM, but the systemâ€™s PDEs are unknown. To tackle the task, an online sequential update method is proposed. During the update process, the projection residual of online data on the reduced bases is applied to determine whether to update the reduced bases in ROM, and the prediction residual of online data obtained by the offline DT-ROM is adopted to infer whether to update the coefficient models. By checking both criteria sequentially, the online update method selects the necessary online data for the DT update. Three numerical problems and one engineering problem are designed to test the proposed online update method. Testing results demonstrate that (a) the proposed online update method reduces both the projection and prediction residuals gradually, and (b) the performance of the offline DT-ROM model on the testing data is improved gradually during the online update process. Both indicate that the proposed method could be applied to online DT update tasks where the PDEs of the system are unknown.
