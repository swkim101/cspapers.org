 This study addresses the critical issue of emitter clogging in drip irrigation systems, a prevalent challenge affecting their efficiency and lifespan. The emitter inlet functions as the gateway between the drip line and the inner hydraulics of the emitter, making it an ideal location to filter out particles from the water flow-path. We developed a novel emitter inlet design focused on enhancing clog resistance, inspired by natural hydraulic and filtration processes such as those found in aquatic gills, wake formation, and nozzle principles. The design was analyzed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in ANSYS Dynamics Simulation Software, enabling detailed modeling of fluid-surface interactions. Experimental clog testing was conducted to assess the inlet’s clog resistance. Our findings demonstrate a substantial improvement in clog resistance with our design, maintaining 85 ± 28% of initial flow rates after exposure to 150 micron diameter aluminum oxide grit, significantly better than a comparable industry-standard design. After exposure to 425 micron diameter grit and a system restart, our design maintained 91 ± 53% of the initial flow rate, showcasing enhanced recovery performance. This research offers a promising solution to the challenge of irrigation system clogging, with implications for better water conservation and more sustainable agricultural practices.
