In the area of symbolic AI, researchers strive to develop techniques to teach machines (commonsense) reasoning. Human reasoning is often argumentative in its nature, and consequently, computational models of argumentation constitute a vibrant research area in symbolic AI. In this paper I describe my most significant contributions to the field spanning from general non-monotonic logics to formal argumentation.
