Various euphemisms are emerging in social net-001 works, attracting widespread attention from 002 the natural language processing community. 003 However, existing euphemism datasets are only 004 domain-specific or language-specific. In ad-005 dition, existing approaches to the study of eu-006 phemisms are one-sided. Either only the eu-007 phemism detection task or only the euphemism 008 identification task is accomplished, lacking a 009 unified framework. To this end, we construct 010 a large-scale B ilingual M ulti-category dataset 011 of E uphemisms named BME , which covers a 012 total of 12 categories for two languages, En-013 glish and Chinese. Then, we first propose a 014 unified generative model to Joint ly conduct 015 the tasks of bilingual E uphemism D etection 016 and I dentification named JointEDI . By com-017 paring with LLMs and human evaluation, we 018 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 019 JointEDI and the feasibility of unifying eu-020 phemism detection and euphemism identifica-021 tion tasks. Moreover, the BME dataset also pro-022 vides a new reference standard for euphemism 023 detection and euphemism identification. 024 Disclaimer: This paper contains discrimina-025 tory content that may be disturbing to some 026 readers. 027
