Human annotator simulation (HAS) serves as a 001 cost-effective substitute for human evaluation 002 tasks such as data annotation and system assess-003 ment. It is important to incorporate the variabil-004 ity present in human evaluation into HAS, since 005 it helps capture diverse subjective interpreta-006 tions and mitigate potential biases and over-007 representation. This work introduces a novel 008 framework for modelling variability in HAS. 009 Conditional softmax flow (S-CNF) is proposed 010 to model the distribution of subjective human 011 annotations, which leverages diverse human an-012 notations via meta-learning. This enables the 013 efficient generation of annotations that exhibit 014 human variability for unlabelled input. In ad-015 dition, a wide range of evaluation metrics are 016 adopted to assess the capability and efficiency 017 of HAS systems in predicting the aggregated 018 behaviours of human annotators, matching the 019 distribution of human annotations, and simulat-020 ing the inter-annotator disagreements. Results 021 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 022 state-of-the-art performance on two real-world 023 human evaluation tasks: emotion recognition 024 and toxic speech detection 1 . 025
