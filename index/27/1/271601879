Ensuring service availability in large-scale datacenters hinges on network monitoring. For monitoring quality, it is essential to attain sufficient coverage of all physical components. However, given the ever-evolving complexity of industrial environments, even measuring coverage metrics becomes challenging, let alone attaining sufficient coverage . In fact, insufficient coverage widely existed in our production datacenters and caused many missed failures. To address this, we design RD-Probe, an industrial monitoring system with coverage and scalability guarantees. Specifically, it first constructs a network topology encoding the industrial complexity. Then, it combines Randomized and Deterministic methods to efficiently generate probe tasks that meet the coverage requirement. We have deployed RD-Probe in three large production regions in Huawei Cloud. Within the first month, RD-Probe improved coverage from 80 . 9% to 99 . 5% and unearthed several previously unnoticed issues while tolerating numerous faults. Large-scale simulation of four industry solutions shows that RD-Probe is the only one achieving both sufficient coverage and scalability in complex datacenter networks. We plan to expand RD-Probe to other regions soon.
