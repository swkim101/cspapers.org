In intelligent assistants that perform both chatting and tasks through dialogue, like Siri and Alexa, users often make ambiguous utterances such as “I’m hungry” or “I have a headache,” which can be interpreted as either chat or task intents. Naively determining these intents can lead to mismatched responses, spoiling the user experience. Therefore, it is desirable to determine the ambiguity of user utterances. We created a dataset from an actual intelligent assistant via crowdsourcing and analyzed tendencies of ambiguous utterances. Using this labeled data of chat, task, and ambiguous intents, we developed a supervised intent classification model. To detect ambiguous utterances robustly, we propose feeding sentence embeddings developed from microblogs and search logs with a self-attention mechanism. Experiments showed that our model outperformed two baselines, including a strong LLM-based one. We will release the dataset.
