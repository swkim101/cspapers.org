Although language model performance across 001 diverse tasks continues to improve, these mod-002 els still struggle to understand and explain the 003 beliefs of other people. This skill requires 004 perspective-taking, the process of conceptu-005 alizing the point of view of another person. 006 Perspective taking becomes challenging when 007 the text reflects more personal and potentially 008 more controversial beliefs. We explore this 009 task through natural language generation of 010 responses to conflict situations. We evaluate 011 novel modifications to recent architectures for 012 conditioning generation on an individualâ€™s com-013 ments and self-disclosure statements. Our work 014 extends the Social-Chem-101 corpus, using 95k 015 judgements written by 6k authors from English 016 Reddit data, for each of whom we obtained 017 20-500 self-disclosure statements. Our eval-018 uation methodology borrows ideas from both 019 personalized generation and theory of mind lit-020 erature. Our proposed perspective-taking mod-021 els outperform recent work, especially the twin 022 encoder model conditioned on self-disclosures 023 with high similarity to the conflict situation. 024
