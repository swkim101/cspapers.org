Previous studies have examined the syntactic capabilities of large pre-trained language models, such as BERT, by using stimuli from psycholinguistic studies. Studying well-known processing errors, such as NPI illusive effects can reveal whether a model prioritizes linear or hierarchical information when processing language. Recent experiments have found that BERT is mildly susceptible to Negative Polarity Item (NPI) illusion effects (Shin et al., 2023; Vu and Lee, 2022). We expand on these results by examining the effect of distance on the illusive effect, using and modifying stimuli from Parker and Phillips (2016). We also further tease apart whether the model is more affected by hierarchical distance or linear distance. We find that BERT is highly sensitive to syntactic hierarchical information: added hierarchical layers affected its processing capabilities compared to added linear distance.
