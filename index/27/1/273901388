Fully end-to-end task-oriented dialogue (EToD) systems have shown excellent performance, which requires the ability to retrieve entities accurately for generation. Existing methods improve the accuracy of entity retrieval and construct data flows between retrieval results and response generator, achieving promising results. However, most of them suffer from the following issues: (1) The entity is retrieved by directly interacting with the context at a coarse-grained level, so the similarity score may be disturbed by irrelevant attributes; (2) The generator pays equal attention to retrieved entities and the context and does not learn the generation preferences for the current turn. In this paper, we propose a framework called Regulating Preferences of Generator (RPG) based on retrieval results, which includes a generator preference extractor, an entity retriever, and a generator with the gate-controlled preference regulator. The generator preference extractor not only improves the entity retriever by filtering the interference of irrelevant attributes but also provides more focused guidance to the generator by performing inter-turn attribute prediction. Experiments and analyses on three standard benchmarks show that our framework outperforms existing methods and improves the quality of the dialogue.
