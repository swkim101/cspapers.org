With the rise of heterogeneous congestion control algorithms and increasingly complex application control loops (e.g. adaptive bitrate algorithms), the Internet community has expressed growing concern that network bandwidth allocations are unfairly skewed, and that some Internet services are ‘winners’ at the expense of ‘losing’ services when competing over shared bottlenecks. In this paper, we provide the first study of fairness between live, end-to-end services with distinct workloads. Rather than focusing on individual components of an application stack (e.g., studying the fairness of an individual congestion control algorithm), we want to provide a direct study over real-world deployed applications. Among our findings, we observe that services typically achieve less-than-fair outcomes: on average, the ‘losing’ service achieves only 72% of its max-min fair share of link bandwidth. We also find that, some services are significantly more contentious than others: for example, one popular file distribution service causes competing applications to obtain as low as 16% of their max-min fair share of bandwidth when competing in a moderately-constrained setting.
