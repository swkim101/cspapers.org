ISPs routinely rate-limit user traffic. In addition to correctly enforcing the desired rates, rate-limiting mechanisms must be able to support rich rate-sharing policies within each traffic aggregate (e.g. per-flow fairness, weighted fairness, and prioritization). This must be done at scale to support the vast magnitude of users efficiently. There are two primary rate-limiting mechanisms – traffic shaping (that buffers packets in queues to enforce the desired rates and policies) and traffic policing (that filters packets as per the desired rates without buffering them). Policers are lightweight and scalable but don’t support rich policy enforcement and often provide poor rate enforcement (being notoriously hard to configure). Shapers, on the other hand, achieve desired rates and policies, but at the cost of high system resource (memory and CPU) utilizationimpacting scalability. This paper explores whether we can get the best of both worlds. We present our system BC-PQP, which augments a policer with (i) multiple phantom queues that simulate buffer occupancy using counters and enable rich policy enforcement, and (ii) a novel burst-control mechanismthatenablesauto-configurationofthequeuesforcorrect rateenforcement.Oursystemachievestherateandpolicyenforce-mentpropertiesclosetothatofashaperwith7 × higher efficiency.
