Visual question answering (VQA) tasks, often performed by visual language model (VLM), face challenges with long-tail knowledge. Recent retrieval-augmented VQA (RA-VQA) systems address this by retrieving and integrating external knowledge sources. However, these systems still suffer from redundant visual information irrelevant to the question during retrieval. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose LLM-RA, a novel method leveraging the reasoning capability of a large language model (LLM) to identify key visual entities, thus minimizing the impact of irrelevant information in the query of retriever. Furthermore, key visual entities are independently encoded for multimodal joint retrieval, preventing cross-entity interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other strong RA-VQA systems. In two knowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, our method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance among those with similar scale of parameters and even performs comparably to models with 1-2 orders larger parameters.
