This paper presents three Mahjong AI competitions we held at IJCAI. We briefly introduce the rule of Mahjong and its challenges to AI algorithms. By showing the results and the application of various algorithms in the competitions, we claim that existing algorithms show promising results in Mahjong, while open problems remain and more efforts are needed towards solving this complex game.
