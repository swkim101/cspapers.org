Medical decision rules play a key role in many clinical decision support systems (CDSS). However, these rules are conventionally constructed by medical experts, which is expensive and hard to scale up. In this study, we explore the automatic extraction of medical decision rules from text, leading to a solution to construct large-scale medical decision rules. We adopt a formulation of medical decision rules as binary trees consisting of condition/decision nodes. Such trees are referred to as medical decision trees and we introduce several generative models to extract them from text. The proposed models inherit the merit of two categories of successful natural language generation frameworks, i.e., sequence-to-sequence generation and autoregressive generation. To unleash the potential of pretrained language models, we design three styles of linearization (natural language, augmented natural language and JSON code), acting as the target sequence for our models. Our final system achieves 67% tree accuracy on a comprehensive Chinese benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline by 12%. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of generative models on explicitly modeling structural decision-making roadmaps, and shows great potential to boost the development of CDSS and explainable AI. Our code will be open-source upon acceptance.
