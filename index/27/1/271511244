Sequential decision-making under uncertainty in multi-agent environments is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. Games serve as a base model for these problems. Finding optimal plans in games that model real-world scenarios necessitates scalable algorithms. In games with perfect information, algorithms that use a combination of search and deep reinforcement learning can scale to arbitrary-sized games and achieve superhuman performance. In games with imperfect information, the situation is more challenging due to the nature of the search. This work aims to develop algorithms that use search but can scale into larger games than currently possible.
