This paper introduces SfmCAD, a novel unsupervised network that reconstructs 3D shapes by learning the Sketchbased Feature Modeling operations commonly used in modern CAD workflows. Given a 3D shape represented as voxels, SfmCAD learns a neural-typed sketch+path parameterized representation, including 2D sketches of feature primitives and their 3D sweeping paths without supervision, for inferring feature-based CAD programs. SfmCAD employs 2D sketches for local detail representation and 3D paths to capture the overall structure, achieving a clear separation between shape details and structure. This conversion into parametric forms enables users to seamlessly adjust the shape's geometric and structural features, thus enhancing interpretability and user control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying SfmCAD to many different types of objects, such as CAD parts, ShapeNet objects, and tree shapes. Extensive comparisons show that SfmCAD produces compact and faithful 3D reconstructions with superior quality compared to alternatives. The code is released at https://github.com/BunnySoCrazy/SfmCAD.
