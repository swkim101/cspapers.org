Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a field of study that focuses on the understanding, design, and evaluation of interactions between humans and robots. This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in exploring the intersection of UIST and HRI. Our goal is to provide attendees with a deeper understanding of the synergies between the two research communities and to inspire better alignment between technical advancements in UIST and their application to social HRI contexts. The workshop will feature interactive demos, prototyping sessions, and discussions to explore key HRI concepts and considerations for designing robot interfaces that facilitate social interactions with humans.
