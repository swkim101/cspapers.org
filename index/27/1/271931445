The Clinical Terminology Normalization aims 001 at finding standard terms from a given termbase 002 for mentions extracted from clinical texts. How-003 ever, we found that extracted mentions suffer 004 from the multi-implication problem, especially 005 disease diagnoses. The reason for this is that 006 physicians often use abbreviations, conjunc-007 tions, and juxtapositions when writing diag-008 noses, and it is difficult to manually decom-009 pose. To address this problem, we propose 010 a Terminology Component Recognition and 011 Reconstruction strategy that leverages the rea-012 soning capability of large language models 013 (LLMs) to recognize the components of terms, 014 enabling automated decomposition and trans-015 forming original mentions into multiple atomic 016 mentions. Furthermore, we adopt the main-017 stream “Recall and Rank” framework to apply 018 the benefits of the above strategy to the task 019 flow. By leveraging the LLM incorporating 020 the advanced sampling strategies, we design a 021 sampling algorithm for atomic mentions and 022 train the recall model using contrastive learn-023 ing. Besides the information about the compo-024 nents is also used as knowledge to guide the 025 final term ranking and selection. The experi-026 mental results show that our proposed strategy 027 effectively improves the performance of the ter-028 minology normalization task and our proposed 029 approach achieves state-of-the-art on the exper-030 imental dataset. 031
