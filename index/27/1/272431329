Mix networks are a well-known technique to hide communication metadata, but incur a high overhead especially in group communication settings. This hinders their adoption in real-world usage, as group communication makes up a big part of modern communication patterns. In this paper, we introduce "PolySphinx", a mix format that is a step towards efficient anonymous multicasting and allows a mix node to replicate the message payload to multiple recipients. We prove that PolySphinx does not compromise on the anonymity offered to users, while considerably reducing the latency of group messages: In a group with 25 members, the average latency drops from 6.1s using the state-of-the-art Rollercoaster approach to 4.1s using PolySphinx.
