Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great dialogue generation capability in different scenarios. However, the huge VRAM consumption when fine-tuning them is one of their drawbacks. PEFT approaches can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, which enables us to fine-tune larger dialogue generation models. However, the reduction in parameter quantity can diminish a PLM’s expressive capacity and affect the PLM’s learning from certain specific examples like knowledge-related conversations. Previous works have demonstrated that injecting exter-nal knowledge into dialogue generation models can improve the model’s performance in knowledge-related conversations. Nonetheless, these methods are designed for the scenario where most parameters of the entire framework are trainable. In this paper, we propose PEK, a parameter-efficient framework for knowledge-enhanced dialogue generation. It enables PLMs to leverage external knowledge documents and knowledge graphs to enhance its generation capabilities with an acceptable number of train-able parameters. Evaluation results on the Wizard of Wikipedia and CMU_DoG datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline meth-ods on multiple evaluation metrics, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.
