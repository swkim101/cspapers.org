Hard real-time systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Since real-time systems represent a significant proportion of safety-critical systems not only established safety standards but also security standards have to be considered. In particular, standard cryptographic libraries are required to reach an adequate level of protection. In this study, we investigate whether it is possible to en-sure security and hard real-time without compromising either side. Thus, we examine relevant state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives provided by one of the de-facto standard libraries Mbed TLS, which is widely-used in embedded systems. We investigate the possibility to derive a Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) for these primitives and review the code base with regard to compliance on safety-related coding guidelines. In addition, we assess the relevant aspects when security concerns must be considered in the safety-related context. Our research reveals several obstacles to fully apply Mbed TLS in hard real- time systems.
