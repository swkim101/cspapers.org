Although the document imaging industry has taken off in the last few years, document image filing for the individual information worker is still not widespread or effective. In this paper, we focus on building an electronic tiling system for paper documents that supports the ad hoc, multifarious work of information workers. Motivated by interviews with researchers and a survey of descriptive studies of paper document filing, we have focussed on minimizing or delaying costs of document filing and supporting a rich variety of methods for accessing and using stored documents. We have implemented a prototype system called Protofoil for storing, retrieving, and manipulating paper documents as electronic images that integrates many user interface-paper and workstation—and information retrieval technologies. Protofoil has been tested through use in our laboratory. and has been deployed in a field study at a lawyer’s office.
