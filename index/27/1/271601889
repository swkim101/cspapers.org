Almost all geographic routing protocols have been designed for 2D. We present a novel geographic routing protocol, named MDT, for 2D, 3D, and higher dimensions with these properties: (i) guaranteed delivery for any connected graph of nodes and physical links, and (ii) low routing stretch from efficient forwarding of packets out of local minima. The guaranteed delivery property holds for node locations specified by accurate, inaccurate, or arbitrary coordinates. The MDT protocol suite includes a packet forwarding protocol together with protocols for nodes to construct and maintain a distributed MDT graph for routing. We present the performance of MDT protocols in 3D and 4D as well as performance comparisons of MDT routing versus representative geographic routing protocols for nodes in 2D and 3D. Experimental results show that MDT provides the lowest routing stretch in the comparisons. Furthermore, MDT protocols are specially designed to handle churn, i.e., dynamic topology changes due to addition and deletion of nodes and links. Experimental results show that MDT's routing success rate is close to 100% during churn and node states converge quickly to a correct MDT graph after churn.
