Multi-view clustering is an effective method to process massive unlabeled multi-view data. Since data of different views may be collected and held by different parties, it becomes impractical to train a multi-view clustering model in a centralized way, for the sake of privacy. However, federated multi-view clustering is challenging because multi-view learning has to consider the complementary and consistent information between each view distributed across different clients. For another, efficiency is highly expected in federated scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel federated multi-view clustering method with tensor factorization (TensorFMVC), which is built based on K-means and hence is more efficient. Besides, TensorFMVC avoids initializing centroids to address the performance degradation of K-means due to its sensitivity to centroid initialization. A three-order tensor stacked by cluster assignment matrices is introduced to exploit the complementary information and spatial structure of different views. Furthermore, we divide the optimization into several subproblems and develop a federated optimization approach to support cooperative model training. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits superior performance in federated multi-view clustering.
