Adversarial robustness and interpretability are longstanding challenges of computer vision. Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that are incomprehensible and imperceptible to humans. However, the opaqueness of networks prevents one from theoretically addressing adversarial robustness. As a human-comprehensible approach, the frequency perspective has been adopted in recent works to investigate the properties of neural networks and adversarial examples.

In this paper, we investigate the frequency properties of feature extraction and analyze the stability of different frequency features when attacking different frequencies. Therefore, we propose an attack method, F-PGD, based on the projected gradient descent to attack the specified frequency bands. Utilizing this method, we find many intriguing properties of neural networks and adversarial perturbations. We experimentally show that contrary to the low-frequency bias of neural networks, the effective features of the same class are distributed across all frequency bands. Meanwhile, the high-frequency features often dominate when the neural networks make conflicting decisions on different frequency features.

Furthermore, the attack experiments show that the low-frequency features are more robust to the attacks on different frequencies, but the interference to the high frequencies makes the network unable to make the right decision. These properties indicate that the decision-making process of neural networks tends to use as few low-frequency features as possible and cannot integrate features of different frequencies.
