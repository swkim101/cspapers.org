This paper tackles the challenges presented by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) errors in voice-based dialog systems, specifically, their adverse impact on Entity Resolution (ER) as a downstream task. Navigating the equilibrium between accuracy and online retrievalâ€™s speed requirement proves challenging, particularly when limited data links the failed mentions to resolved entities. In this paper, we propose a entity reference expansion system, injecting pairs of failed mentions and resolved entity names into the knowledge graph, enhancing its awareness of unresolved mentions. To address data scarcity, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach aligned with noise patterns. This, combined with an ASR-Error-Aware Loss function, facilitates the training of a RoBERTa model, which filters failed mentions and extracts entity pairs for knowledge graph expansion. These designs confront obstacles related to ASR noise, data limitations, and online entity retrieval.
