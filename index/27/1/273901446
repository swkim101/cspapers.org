Post-OCR technology is used to correct errors in the text produced by OCR systems. This study introduces a method for constructing post-OCR synthetic data with different noise levels using weak supervision. We define Character Error Rate (CER) thresholds for “effective” and “ineffective” synthetic data, allowing us to create more useful multi-noise level synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we propose Self-Correct-Noise Test-Time Adaptation (SCN-TTA), which combines self-correction and noise generation mechanisms. SCN-TTA allows a model to dynamically adjust to test data without relying on labels, effectively handling proper nouns in long texts and further reducing CER. In our experiments we evaluate a range of models, including multiple PLMs and LLMs. Results indicate that our method yields models that are effective across diverse text types. Notably, the ByT5 model achieves a CER reduction of 68.67% without relying on manually annotated data
