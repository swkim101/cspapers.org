With the widespread popularity of massive open online courses, personalized course recommendation has become increasingly important due to enhancing users' learning efficiency. While achieving promising performances, current works suffering from the vary across the users and other MOOC entities. To address this problem, we propose hierarchical reinforcement learning with a multi-channel hypergraphs neural network for course recommendation(called HHCoR). Specifically, we first construct an online course hypergraph as the environment to capture the complex relationships and historical information by considering all entities. Then, we design a multi-channel propagation mechanism to aggregate embeddings in the online course hypergraph and extract user interest through an attention layer. 

Besides, we employ two-level decision-making: the low-level focuses on the rating courses, while the high-level integrates these considerations to finalize the decision. Furthermore, in co-optimization, we design a joint reward function to improve the policy of two-layer agents. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and the quantitative results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.
