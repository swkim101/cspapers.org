This study introduces a Multidisciplinary chILDhood cancer survivor question-answering (MILD) bot designed to support childhood cancer survivors facing diverse challenges in their survivorship journey. In South Korea, a shortage of experts equipped to address these unique concerns comprehensively leaves survivors with limited access to reliable information. To bridge this gap, our MILD bot employs a dual-component model featuring an intent classifier and a semantic textual similarity model. The intent classifier first analyzes the user’s query to identify the underlying intent and match it with the most suitable expert who can provide advice. Then, the semantic textual similarity model identifies questions in a predefined dataset that closely align with the user’s query, ensuring the delivery of relevant responses. This proposed framework shows significant promise in offering timely, accurate, and high-quality information, effectively addressing a critical need for support among childhood cancer survivors.
