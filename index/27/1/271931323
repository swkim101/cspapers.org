In this work, we present InfiMM, an advanced Multimodal Large Language Model that adapts to intricate vision-language tasks. InfiMM, inspired by the Flamingo architecture, distinguishes itself through the utilization of large-scale training data, three-stage training strategies, and diverse large language models. This approach ensures the preservation of Flamingo’s foundational strengths while simultaneously introducing augmented capabilities. Empirical evaluations across a variety of benchmarks underscore InfiMM’s remarkable capability in multimodal understanding. The code and model can be found at: https://huggingface.co/Infi-MM.
