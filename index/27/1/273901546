Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across diverse domains. However, recent studies reveal that LLMs are plagued by the “reversal curse”. Most existing methods rely on aggressive sample permutation and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reasons for this issue, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this paper, inspired by human knowledge reversal, we investigate and quantify the individual influence of three potential reasons on the reversal curse: 1) knowledge clarity, 2) entity correlation modeling, and 3) pairwise relationship reasoning capability. Motivated by the analysis of these reasons, we propose a novel **P**airwise entity **O**rder- and **R**elationship-**E**nhanced (**PORE**) data strategy, which facilitates bidirectional entity correlation modeling and pairwise relationship reasoning to overcome the reversal curse. Specifically, PORE augments the samples with entity order-reversal and semantically preserved question-answer pairs, enhancing the encoding of entity correlations in both directions. PORE also employs entity-interleaved pairwise relationship data, which elevates the model’s capability for relationship reasoning. Additionally, to improve the recall of reverse relationships, we leverage knowledge clarity to construct high-clarity data for PORE. Extensive experimental results on available and two newly assembled datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method in both data-sufficient and -constrained situations.
