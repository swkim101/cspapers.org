Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has attracted significant attention in recent years. However, previous studies have primarily focused on cases involving only a single defendant, skip-ping multi-defendant cases due to complexity and difficulty. To advance research, we introduce CMDL, a large-scale real-world C hinese M ulti-D efendant L JP dataset, which consists of over 393,945 cases with nearly 1.2 million defendants in total. For performance evaluation, we propose case-level evaluation metrics dedicated for the multi-defendant scenario. Experimental results on CMDL show existing SOTA approaches demonstrate weakness when applied to cases involving multiple defendants. We highlight several challenges that require attention and resolution. The dataset is available at https://github.com/littlebowlnju/CMDL.
