Continual relation extraction (CRE) aims to continuously learn relations in new tasks without forgetting old relations in previous tasks. Current CRE methods are all rehearsal-based, which need to store samples and thus may encounter privacy and security issues. This paper targets rehearsal-free continual relation extraction for the first time and decomposes it into task identification and within-task prediction sub-problems. Existing rehearsal-free methods focus on training a model (expert) for within-task prediction yet neglect to enhance the models’ capability of task identification. In this paper, we propose an E nsemble-o f-E xperts (EoE) framework for rehearsal-free continual relation extraction. Specifically, we first discriminatively train each expert by augmenting analogous relations across tasks to enhance the expert’s task identification ability. We then propose a cascade voting mechanism to form an ensemble of experts for effectively aggregating their abilities. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms current rehearsal-free methods and is even better than rehearsal-based CRE methods. 1
