Previous VR sound accessibility work have substituted sounds with visual or haptic output to increase VR accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people. However, deafness occurs on a spectrum, and many DHH people (e.g., those with partial hearing) can also benefit from manipulating audio (e.g., increasing volume at specific frequencies) instead of substituting it with another modality. In this demo paper, we present a toolkit that allows modifying sounds in VR to support DHH people. We designed and implemented 18 VR sound modification tools spanning four categories, including prioritizing sounds, modifying sound parameters, providing spatial assistance, and adding additional sounds. Evaluation of our tools with 10 DHH users across five diverse VR scenarios reveal that our toolkit can improve DHH usersâ€™ VR experience but could be further improved by providing more customization options and decreasing cognitive load. We then compiled a Unity toolkit and conducted a preliminary evaluation with six Unity VR developers. Preliminary insights show that our toolkit is easy to use but could be enhanced through modularization.
