We present ClaimLens, an automated fact-checking system focused on voting-related factual claims. Existing fact-checking solutions often lack transparency, making it difficult for users to trust and understand the reasoning behind the outcomes. In this work, we address the critical need for transparent and explainable automated fact-checking solutions. We propose a novel approach that leverages frame-semantic parsing to provide structured and interpretable fact verification. By focusing on voting-related claims, we can utilize publicly available voting records from official United States congressional sources and the established Vote semantic frame to extract relevant information from claims. Furthermore, we propose novel data augmentation techniques for frame-semantic parsing, a task known to lack robust annotated data, which leads to a +9.5% macro F1 score on frame element identification over our baseline.
