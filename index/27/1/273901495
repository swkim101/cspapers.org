GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that allows clients to fetch precise data efficiently and flexibly, querying multiple resources with a single request. However, crafting complex GraphQL query operations can be challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer an alternative by generating GraphQL queries from natural language, but they struggle due to limited exposure to publicly available GraphQL schemas, often resulting in invalid or suboptimal queries. Furthermore, no benchmark test data suite is available to reliably evaluate the performance of contemporary LLMs.To address this, we present a large-scale, cross-domain Text-to-GraphQL query operation dataset. The dataset includes 10,940 training triples spanning 185 cross-source data stores and 957 test triples over 14 data stores. Each triple consists of a GraphQL schema, GraphQL query operation, and corresponding natural language query. The dataset has been predominantly manually created, with natural language paraphrasing, and carefully validated, requiring approximately 1200 person-hours. In our evaluation, we tested 10 state-of-the-art LLMs using our test dataset. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of only around 50% with one in-context few-shot example, underscoring the necessity for custom fine-tuning. To support further research and benchmarking, we are releasing the training and test datasets under the MIT License. The dataset is available at https://github.com/stepzen-dev/NL2GQL.
