As long-context large language models (LLMs) are attracting increasing attention for their ability to handle context windows exceeding 128k tokens, the need for effective evaluation methods for these models becomes critical.Existing evaluation methods, however, fall short: needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) and its variants are overly simplistic, while creating realistic benchmarks is prohibitively expensive due to extensive human annotation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose TAIL, an automatic toolkit for creating realistic evaluation benchmarks and assessing the performance of long-context LLMs.With TAIL, users can customize the building of a long-context, document-grounded QA benchmark and obtain visualized performance metrics of evaluated models.TAIL has the advantage of requiring minimal human annotation and generating natural questions based on user-provided long-context documents. We apply TAIL to construct a benchmark encompassing multiple expert domains, such as finance, law, patent, and scientific literature. We then evaluate four state-of-the-art long-context LLMs using this benchmark. Results show that all LLMs experience varyingdegrees of performance degradation as contextlengths increase.
