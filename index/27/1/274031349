 Aquaculture is a steadily growing segment of food production worldwide, but farmers in both established and emerging markets are facing ever-greater challenges of sustainable intensification. These challenges include, but are not limited to, the implementation of ethical farming practices, minimization of recurring costs, and minimization of environmental impacts. Implementation of precision aquaculture, which often includes automation and monitoring, is one method for achieving sustainable intensification. However, the cost of precision aquaculture is prohibitively high for many farmers; a significant barrier to adoption. This cost barrier is a critical issue in developing markets where the aquaculture industry is expanding rapidly.
 This article proposes a scheme for the automation of one aspect of fish food distribution, the selection and routing of fish food to each of the fish pens. Using principles of mechanical multiplexing, a full-scale prototype of an automated pen selector manifold was designed and constructed. The manifold selector system featured a modular design to make adding feed pens easier for developing markets, by making expansion costs more accessible. Functional tests demonstrated equivalent or better performance and a cost reduction of 78% compared to existing market solutions. Additional steps are outlined to fully productize and implement the proposed solution in emerging markets and, through reverse innovation, in existing world markets.
