Composite Current Source (CCS) timing model plays an important role in modern static timing analysis (STA) because it precisely captures the timing behavior of a design at advanced nodes. However, CCS is extremely time-consuming due to its accurate but complicated timing models. To overcome this challenge, we introduce GCS-Timer, a GPU-accelerated CCS-based timing analysis algo-rithm. Unlike existing methods that perform model order reduction to trade accuracy for speed, GCS-Timer achieves high accuracy through a fast simulation-based analysis using GPU computing. Experimental results show that GCS-Timer can complete CCS analysis with better accuracy and achieve 3.2 Ã— faster runtime compared with a 16-threaded industrial standard timer.
