Do large multilingual language models learn language universals? We consider a candidate universal much-discussed in the linguistics literature, the Final-over-Final Condition (Sheehan et al., 2017b). This Condition is syntactic in the sense that it can only be stated by reference to abstract sentence properties such as nested phrases and head direction. A study of typologically diverse “mixed head direction” languages confirms that the Condition holds in corpora. But in a targeted syntactic evaluation, Gemini Pro only seems to respect the Condition in German, Russian, Hungarian and Serbian. These relatively high-resource languages contrast with Basque, where Gemini Pro does not seem to have learned the Condition at all. This result suggests that modern language models may need additional sources of bias in order to become truly human-like, within a developmentally-realistic budget of training data.
