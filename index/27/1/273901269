We present DeepPavlov 1.0, an open-source framework for using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models by leveraging transfer learning techniques. DeepPavlov 1.0 is created for modular and configuration-driven development of state-of-the-art NLP models and supports a wide range of NLP model applications. DeepPavlov 1.0 is designed for practitioners with limited knowledge of NLP/ML. DeepPavlov is based on PyTorch and supports HuggingFace transformers. DeepPavlov is publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license and provides access to an online demo.
