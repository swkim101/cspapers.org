Dialogue Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple analysis (DiaASQ) extends ABSA to more complex real-world scenarios (i.e., dialogues), which makes existing generation methods encounter heightened noise and order bias challenges, leading to decreased robustness and accuracy.To address these, we propose the Segmentation-Aided multi-grained Denoising and Debiasing (SADD) method. For noise, we propose the Multi-Granularity Denoising Generation model (MGDG), achieving word-level denoising via sequence labeling and utterance-level denoising via topic-aware dialogue segmentation. Denoised Attention in MGDG integrates multi-grained denoising information to help generate denoised output.For order bias, we first theoretically analyze its direct cause as the gap between ideal and actual training objectives and propose a distribution-based solution. Since this solution introduces a one-to-many learning challenge, our proposed Segmentation-aided Order Bias Mitigation (SOBM) method utilizes dialogue segmentation to supplement order diversity, concurrently mitigating this challenge and order bias.Experiments demonstrate SADDâ€™s effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art results with a 6.52% F1 improvement.
