Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a key task in natural language processing and lexical semantics. Pre-trained language models with contextualized word embeddings have significantly improved performance in regular WSD tasks. However, these models still struggle with recognizing semantic boundaries and often misclassify homonyms in adversarial context. Therefore, we propose FOOL: FOur-fold Obscure Lexical, a new coarse-grained WSD dataset, which includes four different test sets designed to assess the robustness of language models in WSD tasks. Two sets feature typical WSD scenarios, while the other two include sentences with opposing contexts to challenge the models further.We tested two types of models on the proposed dataset: models with encoders, such as the BERT and T5 series of varying sizes by probing their embeddings, and state-of-the-art large decoder models like GPT-4o and the LlaMA3 family, using zero shot prompting. Across different state-of-the-art language models, we observed a decrease in performance in the latter two sets compared to the first two, with some models being affected more than others. We show interesting findings where small models like T5-large and BERT-large performed better than GPT-4o on Set 3 of the dataset. This indicates that, despite excelling in regular WSD tasks, these models still struggle to correctly disambiguate homonyms in artificial (Set 3) or realistic adversarial contexts (Set 4).
