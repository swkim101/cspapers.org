Privacy concerns over the security of personal information have grown in tandem with the spread of smartwatches. However, effective methods for protecting private data on smartwatches are very limited. Personal identity number (PIN) input is the only privacy protection method on off-the-shelf smartwatches, which requires tedious user effort. This is ineffective at securing information such as notifications and attention-grabbing alerts, which may leak personal data to passersby and adversaries, causing embarrassment or revealing sensitive communications. In this work, we propose a novel privacy protection system, TouchTone, that verifies users and secure personal data in a convenient and low-effort manner. Our system employs a challenge-response process to passively capture finger biometrics from an unobtrusive touch gesture using only microphones, speakers, and accelerometer sensors already built in smartwatches. To address smartwatch incompatibility with traditional high-frequency sensing techniques, we develop non-intrusive low-frequency challenge signals and cross-domain sensing techniques (i.e., measuring acoustic signals in the vibration domain) to capture robust and effective features specific to user fingers. A low-cost profile matching-based classifier is designed to enable stand-alone privacy protection on smartwatches. We conduct extensive experiments with 54 participants using varied hardware, environments, noise levels, user motions, and other impact factors, achieving around 97% true positive rate and 2% false positive rate in recognizing participants' identities for privacy protection.
