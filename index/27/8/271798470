Massage therapy is helpful for the rehabilitation of various diseases, such as headaches caused by migraines and stress. Existing robotic systems have focused on massage therapy on the torso and limbs, but performing massage motions through suitable actuation on a person’s head has been a challenge. In this paper, we present MiBOT, a head-worn massage robot that actuates two soft tactors to produce touch motions mimicking human massage. A key design principle behind MiBOT is its silent actuation, which we achieve through pneumatic artificial muscles in conjunction with a controller loop to respond to contact pressure. We evaluated the effectiveness of MiBOT in a controlled study and assessed subjects’ blood pressure and heart rate levels while applying MiBOT. We found that our mechanical system generated positive and conclusive quantitative outcomes that are similar to the human-administered massage, decreasing participants’ mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2.8 mmHg and 1.7 mmHg, respectively, as well as calming their heart rate by 8–10% on average.
