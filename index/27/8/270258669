Acoustic imaging is attractive due to its ability to work under occlusion, different lighting conditions, and privacy-sensitive environments. Existing acoustic imaging methods require large transceiver arrays or device movement, which makes it challenging to use in many scenarios. In this paper, we develop a novel acoustic imaging system for low-cost devices with few speakers and microphones without any device movement. To achieve this goal, we leverage a 3D-printed passive acoustic metasurface to significantly enhance the diversity of the measurement data, thereby improving the imaging quality. Specifically, we jointly design the transmission signal, transceivers' beamforming weights, metasurface, and imaging algorithm to minimize the imaging reconstruction error in an end-to-end manner. We further develop a scheme to dynamically adapt the imaging resolution based on the distance to the target. We implement a system prototype. Using extensive experiments, we show that our system yields high-quality images across a wide range of scenarios.
