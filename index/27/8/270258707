Virtual try-on (VTO) superimposes clothing over user image or video, enhancing online shopping experience. On-device VTO can preserve user privacy but most VTO techniques cannot be run on resource-constrained devices due to excessive computation overhead. In this demo, we demonstrate a novel Android application for on-device video VTO referring to MIRROR, the state-of-the-art mobile VTO system. The application minimizes video generation time by splitting the process into two phases, achieving 0.76 minutes to convert 10-second-long video on Galaxy S24 Ultra. Our application was evaluated as 78.5 score (above average) in SUS usability test. A companion video is provided at: https://youtu.be/YTExc8W5BzM
