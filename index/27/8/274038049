 This paper presents a comprehensive framework for micro-grid design and operation, achieving a balance between economic efficiency and reliability. Employing Monte Carlo simulations, it examines various operational scenarios to elucidate the balance between cost-effectiveness and outage resilience. The study considers key factors such as renewable energy integration (solar), battery storage sizing, grid interconnection, and fluctuating building loads. The findings underscore the substantial advantages of integrating solar photovoltaic systems and deliberately oversized battery storage, which collectively enhance microgrid dependability and reduce lifetime operational expenses. The research also emphasizes the pivotal role of grid stability in dictating optimal microgrid investments â€” unstable grids necessitate greater reliance on renewables and storage for enhanced resilience, while stable grids permit cost-effective strategies through more conservative investments. The paper quantifies the trade-offs between constraints and performance indicators, including battery safety limits, depth-of-discharge, reliability, cost, and energy deficits. Moreover, the framework captures the effects of demand variability on microgrid performance. This comprehensive, multi-faceted framework offers critical insights for making informed microgrid investment decisions, promoting a harmonious approach that aligns with sustainability objectives by integrating environmental considerations, economic feasibility, and energy security mandates.
