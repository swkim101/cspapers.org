In this paper, we proposed F2Key, the first earable physical security system based on commercial off-the-shelf headphones. F2Key enables impactful applications, such as enhancing voiceprint-based authentication systems, reliable voice assistants, audio deepfake defense, and the legal validity of artifacts. The key idea of F2Key is to establish a stable acoustic sensing field across the user's face and embed the user's facial structures and articulatory habits into a user-specific generative model that serves as a private key. The private key can decrypt the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) profiles provided by the acoustic sensing field into an inferred spectrogram that can match the real one calculated from the corresponding speech, provided that the user's CIR-spectrogram mapping relationship is consistent with the one embedded in the generative model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F2Key resists 99.9%, 96.4%, and 95.3% of speech replay attacks, mimicry attacks, and hybrid attacks, respectively. We discussed and evaluated F2Key from different perspectives, such as the health consideration and identical twins study, to show the practicality and reliability.
