The rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) can avoid the high cost and environmental burden of replacing trillions of batteries by us-ing sustainable battery-free devices that operate maintenance-free for decades. To develop battery-free IoT systems, researchers and makers require a common platform that is versatile, affordable, and easy to use. However, limited availability and lack of support have prevented widespread adoption of previous battery-free platforms. We introduce Riotee, an open-source and commercially available battery-free platform that includes multiple boards, extensive software, and comprehensive documentation. We demonstrate Rioteeâ€™s capabilities through a machine-learning application and present results from a user study involving students and customers, who rated its usefulness and usability highly.
