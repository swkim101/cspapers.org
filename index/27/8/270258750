Minimizing bandwidth consumption while maintaining satisfactory visual quality becomes the holy grail of volumetric content delivery. However, due to the huge amount of 3D data to stream, the stringent latency requirement, and the high computational workload, achieving this ambitious goal could be challenging for mobile mixed reality headsets, which can naturally enable viewers' motion with six degrees of freedom but have limited computing power. Motivated by our critical observations from a user study of eye movements with 50+ participants, in this paper, we present Theia, a first-of-its-kind gaze-driven and perception-aware volumetric content delivery system that effectively incorporates the following innovations into a holistic system: (1) real-time creation of foveated volumetric content to reduce network data usage; (2) efficient augmentation of foveal content to boost user experience; and (3) adaptive omission of peripheral content for further bandwidth savings based on eye movements. We implement a prototype of Theia using Microsoft HoloLens 2 headsets and extensively evaluate its performance. Our results reveal that compared to the state-of-the-art, Theia can drastically reduce bandwidth consumption by up to 67.0% and enhance visual quality by up to 92.5%.
