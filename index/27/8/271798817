Integrated aerial Platforms (IAPs), comprising multiple aircrafts, are typically fully actuated and hold significant potential for aerial manipulation tasks. Differing from a multiple aerial swarm, the aircrafts within the IAP are interconnected, presenting promising opportunities for enhancing localization. Incorporating the physical constraints of these multiple aircrafts to improve the accuracy and reliability of integrated aircraft positioning and navigation systems is a challenging yet highly significant problem. In this paper, we introduce a distributed multi-aircraft visual-inertial-range odometry system that analyzes the position, velocity, and attitude constraints within the IAP. Leveraging constraint relationships in the IAP, we propose corresponding methods that tightly fuse visual-inertial-range odometry and kinematic constraints to optimize odometry accuracy. Our systemâ€™s performance is validated using a collected dataset, resulting in a notable 28.7% reduction in drift compared to the baseline.
