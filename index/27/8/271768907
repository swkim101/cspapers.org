Mixed Reality enables hybrid workspaces where physical and virtual monitors are adaptively created and moved to suit the current environment and needs. However, in shared settings, individual users' workspaces are rarely aligned and can vary significantly in the number of monitors, available physical space, and workspace layout, creating inconsistencies between workspaces which may cause confusion and reduce collaboration. We present Desk2Desk, an optimization-based approach for remote collaboration in which the hybrid workspaces of two collaborators are fully integrated to enable immersive side-by-side collaboration. The optimization adjusts each user's workspace in layout and number of shared monitors and creates a mapping between workspaces to handle inconsistencies between workspaces due to physical constraints (e.g. physical monitors). We show in a user study how our system adaptively merges dissimilar physical workspaces to enable immersive side-by-side collaboration, and demonstrate how an optimization-based approach can effectively address dissimilar physical layouts.
