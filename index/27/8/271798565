The cable-driven redundant manipulator (CDRM) has significant potential for applications in narrow and hazardous spaces. However, traditional CDRMs have limited stiffness and load capacity due to their cable routing method. To address these limitations, several scholars have proposed new mechanisms and control strategies. Nevertheless, the cable routing method has not changed, and CDRMs continue to suffer from their limitations. Recently, a nematode-inspired cable routing method was proposed; however, stiffness calculations, derivation of inverse kinematics, and validation of stiffness and load capacity were incomplete. In this paper, we calculate the analytic equivalent stiffness of the nematode-inspired cable routing method and compare it with other cable routing methods. Additionally, we derived and simulate the kinematics and an effective inverse kinematics algorithm. Finally, we validate the stiffness and load capacity using a developed prototype.
