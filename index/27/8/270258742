Real-time healthcare applications demand stringent communication resources to meet the QoS requirements. To meet the application resource demands, this poster proposes a Load and Bandwidth aware Forwarding strategy (LBF-ICN) in Information-Centric Networks (ICN). The LBF-ICN considers router interfaces' pending entries and available bandwidth resources in order to select the next hop for interest forwarding. The LBF-ICN strategy aims to distribute the network load along with bandwidth allocation in interest forwarding.
