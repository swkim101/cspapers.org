In this study, we propose an object shape alignment method through a robust optimization scheme for 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) object pose compensation. Although the pose estimation of the 3D object by the camera has been rapidly improved in recent years with the development of deep learning, the estimate still contains errors due to several factors. To compensate for this, we perform a shape alignment between the 2D segmentation of the object and the projection of the 3D object in the image plane. To avoid convergence to a local minimum in nonlinear optimization, we separate the pose into translation and rotation. This approach derives the optimization of a linear form in terms of a translation with reduced computational cost. For the rotation, the parallel optimization is performed with multiple initial values, reflecting to the uncertainty of an initial value. We formulate an invariant extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based object-visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with a camera-object relative pose as the measurement model. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, we present the improved results of camera-object relative pose accuracy and localization and mapping accuracy in the several sequences of YCB-video dataset.
