Robotic manipulation is a key enabler for automation in the fulfillment logistics sector. Such robotic systems require perception and manipulation capabilities to handle a wide variety of objects. Existing systems either operate on a closed set of objects or perform object-agnostic manipulation which lacks the capability for deliberate and reliable manipulation at scale. Object identification (ID) unlocks the ability for large-scale, object-centric manipulation by mapping object segments to one of the previously seen objects from a database. Nevertheless, it is often limited by the availability of reference data or coverage for objects in a database. In this work, we propose to perform object identification with multiple reference databases, including images and text references, each with a different coverage and matching challenge. We propose a training strategy that tackles the challenges of learning domain-invariant image embeddings, image-text matching and fusing predictions from different sources. We perform experiments over a recent benchmark with over 190K+ unique objects, extend the dataset with the additional reference sources and propose an evaluation strategy that simulates coverage for different reference sources. Model trained with the proposed learning pipeline shows robust performance over a range of simulation experiments.
