Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) poses as a recent research direction in robot learning, by allowing humans to teach robots through preferences on pairs of desired behaviours. Nonetheless, to obtain realistic robot policies, an arbitrarily large number of queries is required to be answered by humans. In this work, we approach the sample-efficiency challenge by presenting a technique which synthesizes queries, in a semi-supervised learning perspective. To achieve this, we leverage latent variational autoencoder (VAE) representations of trajectory segments (sequences of state-action pairs). Our approach manages to produce queries which are closely aligned with those labeled by humans, while avoiding excessive uncertainty according to the human preference predictions as determined by reward estimations. Additionally, by introducing variation without deviating from the original humanâ€™s intents, more robust reward function representations are achieved. We compare our approach to recent state-of-the-art preference-based RL semi-supervised learning techniques. Our experimental findings reveal that we can enhance the generalization of the estimated reward function without requiring additional human intervention. Lastly, to confirm the practical applicability of our approach, we conduct experiments involving actual human users in a simulated social navigation setting.
