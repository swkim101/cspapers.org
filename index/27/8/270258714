In this paper, we propose a MiRRoR(Mixed-Reality of Robust Rendering) that enables user localization in the mobility scenario. Mixed Reality (MR) is an emerging technology for interacting with spatial digital content. It merges virtual content and the actual world through the camera. Nowadays, many kinds of Head-Mount Display (HMD) devices for MR have been released, and they can be more popular in the future. However, MR is not available in mobility situations because of localization problems. This research aims to solve this problem using a sensor fusion approach. We developed an MR bus tour with visual-based localization and GPS, then conducted a preliminary experiment to evaluate localization accuracy and MR experience.
