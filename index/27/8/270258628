The shift from traditional PCs and TVs to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has significantly transformed the video streaming landscape. Traditional Quality of Experience (QoE) models, predominantly designed for larger screens, fall short in addressing the nuances of mobile consumption, often misguiding bandwidth usage and quality delivery. This paper introduces a novel user-oriented QoE model tailored for the mobile environment, which accounts for heterogeneous viewing environments. Unlike conventional models that estimate QoE based solely on bitrate and resolution, our approach encompasses the entire video streaming pipeline, from server transmission to the user's perception. In addition, we design lightweight but effective QoE models for mobile devices. This work bridges the gap between user experience and QoE modeling, offering a path toward more adaptive and efficient video streaming services for the increasingly mobile-centric world.
