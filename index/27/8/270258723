With the benefit of virtualization technology and an ascending trend towards more cloud applications, virtual cluster (VC) allocation concerning different requirements of application deployment is vital to cloud datacenters and edge networks. Most of the state-of-the-art approaches for VC allocation problems are probability-based heuristics, and none of them absolutely outperforms any other approach in any case. Thus, it is necessary to collect and select effective and efficient approaches to jointly solve diverse and customizable VC allocation problems. This paper presents VCA-Solver, a VC allocation solver that can draw on collectively feasible schemes from multiple effective approaches. We describe the architecture of VCA-Solver and present a preliminary evaluation with a prototype implementation.
