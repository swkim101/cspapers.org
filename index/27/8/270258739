We present an assisting system for creating a ceiling plan. Conventional methods of creating a ceiling plan are time-consuming and high-cost. Our system requires only two inputs from a user and outputs the panoramic ceiling image that shows the whole ceiling surface. The system detects the ceiling fixtures and depicts them seamlessly for a reliable resulting image. We confirmed the possibility of assisting in creating a ceiling plan with our system through the experiment.
