Panoptic segmentation is a challenging perception task, which can help robots to comprehensively perceive the surrounding environment. In the task, we notice that semantic, instance, and panoptic have rich relations, however, which are rarely explored. In this work, we propose a novel panoptic, instance, and semantic bridged network to delve into the reciprocal relation. To make semantic and instance benefit from each other, we design a novel Gated Encoding (GE) module, incorporating complementary cues between semantic and instance heads through the gated mechanism. In addition, a novel edge-aware consistency constraint among edges of each task is presented, which exhaustedly exploits geometric constraints, to boost the segmentation quality of challenging edges. Experimental results on the Cityscapes and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in an efficient CNN-based paradigm, attaining a balance between accuracy and efficiency.
