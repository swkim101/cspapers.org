This paper presents a method to reduce computations for stochastic dynamic games with game-theoretic belief space planning through partially propagating beliefs. Complex interactions in scenarios such as surveillance, herding, and racing can be modeled using game-theoretic frameworks in the belief space. Stochastic dynamic games can be solved to a local Nash Equilibrium using a game-theoretic belief space variant of an iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG). However, the scalability of this method suffers due to the large dimensionality of beliefs which the iLQG must propagate. We examine the utility of partial belief space propagation, which allows polynomial runtime to decrease. We validate our findings through simulations and hardware implementation.
