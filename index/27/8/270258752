Vehicle recognition approaches have recently gained remarkable interest in improving intelligent transportation systems, especially in harsh weather or insufficient illumination conditions. Vehicle recognition using seismic waves is a novel technique that records the vibrations of vehicles using geophones. Hence, SeismicSense is introduced, a deep learning-based system that is trained using vehicle vibrations. Moreover, the proposed system includes different modules that ensure its robustness against noise. A real data set is collected and leveraged to implement our proposed SeismicSense. Evaluation Results ensure its remarkable accuracy in precise vehicle recognition.
