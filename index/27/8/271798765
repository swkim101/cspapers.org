Efficient task allocation is a challenge for multirobot search. The multi-robot search problem is reformulated as submodular maximization subject to intersection system constraints. The objective function is submodular and consists of a coverage function to cover environments and a balancing function to efficiently dispatch robots. The intersection system is composed of routing and clustering constraints. The experiment results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-ofthe-art methods in multi-robot search.
