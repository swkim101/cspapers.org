Accurate pose estimation over SE(3) is fundamentally crucial for numerous perception tasks, including camera re-localization. While existing learning-based methods estimated from a series of RGB images have significantly improved the accuracy of pose, the majority of models still face one or two limitations. First, few representations on SE(3) are smooth and differential, making them difficult to apply in deep learning frameworks. Second, they often require high computational resources due to complex deep network designs. We in this paper propose the DL-PoseNet to address these issues. Specifically, we present a novel representation for SE(3) which follows the property of smoothness of the pose. We then design a lightweight neural network to regress the pose by developing a differential pose layer. Finally, we introduce a novel loss function and gradient descent method to better supervise the proposed lightweight pose network. Extensive experiments on the camera re-localization task on the Cambridge Landmarks and 7-Scenes datasets demonstrate the superior predictive accuracy and benefits of our method in comparison with the state-of-the-art.
