 In this study, the simplification of complex AI generated geometry for increasing compatibility with legacy analysis tools is explored. Beginning with a general discussion on the problems facing engineers in the production of non-uniform parts as well as problems with testing complex geometries with conventional FEA tools, it is established that analysis sectors can benefit from part geometry that not only simplifies and unifies its shape, but also reduces it into its primary load paths. The workflow used to convert entities from complex into primitives is explored, as well as the result of FEA testing on both a baseline and a modified structure. The importance of 3D sketches and their use in both testing scenarios and fabrication efforts is discussed, and the generation of these 3D sketches is shown as a part of the workflow. The adaptation of part geometry from organic generative design to simple load path to easily manufacturable node and tube structures is shown. The workflow for developing a 3D load path sketch is shown, and an example of an application of the process is explored, from generation of the evolved structure to its transformation to a carbon fiber tube and node configuration.
