Flexible manufacturing lines are required to meet the demand for customized and small batch-size products. Even though state-of-the-art tactile robots may provide the versatility for increased adaptability and flexibility, their potential is yet to be fully exploited. To support robotics deployment in manufacturing, we propose a task-based tactile robot programming paradigm that uses an object-centric tactile skill definition that directly links identified object constraints of the task to the definition of constraint-based unified force-impedance control. In this study, we first explain the basic concept of abstracting the task constraints experienced by the object and transferring them to the robotâ€™s operational space frame. Second, using the object-centric tactile skill definition, we synthesize unified force-impedance control and formalized holonomic constraints to enable flexible task execution. Later, we propose the quantified analysis metrics for the process by analyzing them as a typical example of flexible manipulation disassembly skills, e.g., levering and unscrew-driving regarding their object requirements. Supported by realistic experimental evaluation using a Franka Emika robot, our tactile robot programming approach for the direct translation between task-level constraints and robot control parameter design is shown to be a viable solution for increased robotic deployment in flexible manufacturing lines.
