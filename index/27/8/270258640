This extended abstract outlines our research on quantum and emerging computing systems for next-generation wireless networks. The research aims to leverage quantum and quantum-inspired computation to expedite baseband processing at base stations. We introduce our system design directions and prototype systems that are implemented on analog quantum processors. The prototypes are designed for quantum-accelerated near-optimal multi-user detection processing in MIMO systems that could drastically increase wireless performance for tomorrow's NextG cellular networking standards, as well as in NextG wireless local area networks (LAN).
