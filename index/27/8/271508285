Hub Labeling and A* are two well-established algorithms for shortest path computation in large graphs. Hub Labeling offers excellent query times for distance computation, but at the cost of a high space consumption for label storage. Landmark-based A* search requires less space but answers queries much slower. Recently, Landmark Hub Labeling (LHL) has been proposed, which combines both concepts and achieves a smaller space consumption than Hub Labeling and also much better query times than A*. However, the known algorithms for computing a LHL do not scale to large graphs, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we devise novel algorithms for LHL construction that work on graphs with millions of edges. We also further improve the LHL query answering algorithm and investigate how to reduce the space consumption of labeling techniques by performing bounded suboptimal pathfinding. In an extensive experimental study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and illuminate that sensible trade-offs between space consumption, query time, and path quality can be achieved with LHL.
