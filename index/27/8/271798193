This paper presents a novel Bionic Soft Finger (BSF) that aims to overcome the limitations of conventional rigid manipulators in terms of adaptability and safety, as well as the challenges faced by soft hands regarding carrying capacity and stability. The BSF design uses a hybrid variable stiffness mechanism combining memory alloy actuators with particle jamming to achieve the desired bending angle and actuator stiffness. Our innovative approach utilizes a bionic finger design that incorporates a memory alloy skeleton and a water-cooled recirculation system, leading to a substantial reduction in the time required for each operation. Through the integration of particle jamming, we have enhanced the overall stiffness and performance of the manipulator, enabling load capacities of up to 3N per finger and more than twice the stiffness of a normal condition. Additionally, our design enables multimode grasping and incorporates a liquid metal strain sensor (METT) for real-time monitoring of finger bending angles. Comparative analyses demonstrate that our design exhibits superior stiffness and enables five-mode grasping in comparison to pneumatic actuators. We believe that bionic soft fingers present a promising solution for enhancing adaptability, safety, and performance in human-robot interaction applications.
