 Battery lifetime and reliability depend on accurate state-of-health (SOH) estimation, while complex degradation mechanisms and varying operating conditions strengthen this challenge. This study presents two physics-informed neural network (PINN) configurations, PINN-Parallel, and PINN-Series, designed to improve SOH prediction by combining an equivalent circuit model (ECM) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. PINN-Parallel process input data through parallel ECM and LSTM modules and combine their outputs for SOH estimation. On the other hand, the PINN-Series uses a sequential approach that feeds ECM-derived parameters into the LSTM network to supplement temporal data analysis with physics information. Both models utilize easily accessible voltage, current, and temperature data that match realistic battery monitoring constraints. Experimental evaluations show that PINN-Series outperforms the PINN-Parallel and the baseline LSTM model in accuracy and robustness. It also adapts well to different input conditions. This demonstrates that the simulated battery dynamic states from ECM increase the LSTM’s ability to capture degradation patterns and improve the model’s ability to explain complex battery behavior. However, the trade-off between the robustness and training efficiency of PINNs is also discussed. The research findings show the potential of PINN models (particularly the PINN-Series) in advancing battery management systems, but the required computational resources need to be considered.
