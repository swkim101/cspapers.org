 This study investigates a novel adaptive duct control strategy for maximizing power output in a ducted horizontal-axis hydrokinetic turbine (HAHkT) system. The strategy focuses on varying contraction ratios (CR) and rotor blade pitch angles to optimize energy production under specific inflow conditions. Experimental static data for three different CR and thirteen pitch angles are utilized to design and perform experiments aimed at creating a dynamic model tailored to the systemâ€™s behavior.
 Parametric analyses are conducted using QBlade software to assess rotor blade performance across various geometry configurations and flow conditions, with water as the medium. An open-channel water flume experiment is established to evaluate the performance of the small-scale ducted HAHkT with the selected range of CR and pitch configurations. The experimental data collected is utilized to construct a dynamic surrogate model (SM) capable of predicting system behavior. Optimizations tests controlling CR and blade pitch angle for maximal power extraction are performed with a variety of velocity profiles.
 The proposed adaptive duct control strategy presents promising potential for developing highly efficient ducted HAHkT systems. By dynamically adjusting CR and pitch based on inflow conditions, this approach aims to achieve optimal energy production, ultimately contributing to the realization of cost-effective renewable energy solutions.
