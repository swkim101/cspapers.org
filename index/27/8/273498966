Tabular data synthesis has become crucial for more accurate financial fraud detection, especially where there are data privacy regulations such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) restrictaccess to originaldata. Despite itsimportance, currentgener-ative models inadequately address key challenges in financial fraud detection (FFD) data, namely extreme class imbalance, high data sparsity, and non-normal attribute distributions. My research introduces novel graph-theoretical generative models, SeparateGGM and SignedGGM , designed to tackle these challenges. By integrating graph neural network-based feature augmentation, graph topology and connectivity analysis, and novel graph centrality indicators, my models achieves optimal graph settings for enhanced fraud detection accuracy. This approach is pioneering in its application of diverse graph-theoretical methods to improve FFD performance. Experimental results demonstrate my modelsâ€™ superiority over competing methods on three FFD benchmark datasets. The goal of this research is to significantly enhance the accuracy of real-world financial fraud detection models that are deployed within the financial industry by leveraging various graph-theoretical methodologies to generate high-quality tabular synthetic data 1 .
