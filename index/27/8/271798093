Optoelectronic tweezers (OET) has shown great promise in various applications, especially in the precise manipulation of microparticles and microorganisms on a micron and nanometer scale. This technology significantly enhances the efficiency of single-cell sorting and the development of antibody-based drugs. However, conventional OET platforms are limited by issues such as low autofocusing accuracy, restricted imaging field of view, and uneven illumination. To overcome these limitations, we have innovatively developed a dynamic adaptive imaging system. By incorporating peak-finding and in situ Gaussian blur compensation algorithms, we achieved rapid automatic focusing and illumination shadow compensation across an expanded field of view. At the same time, the system can also dynamically adjust compensation parameters under different lighting conditions. Our system has successfully completed comprehensive scanning of the optoelectronic tweezers chip, achieving a 60% reduction in autofocus time and a 15.8% improvement in lighting uniformity. Moreover, this imaging system demonstrates robust versatility and can serve as a reference for other optical systems.
