Micro-assembly is an emerging method to fabricate microrobots with multiple modules or particles. However, there is always a lack of a flexible and efficient method to freely create the desired magnetic soft microrobots. In this paper, an automated assembly system based on a two-fingered microhand is presented for fabricating magnetic soft microrobots. Our proposed system can automatically pick and place components to assemble microrobots with a two-fingered micromanipulator, and orient these components through an external magnetic field. The automated assembly has the advantages of high accuracy, high speed, and high success rate. It can endow magnetic microrobots with flexible material selection, arbitrary geometry design, and programable magnetization profile. We can make full use of this system to fabricate multiple magnetic soft microrobots. The experiment results demonstrate that this system can efficiently fabricate microrobots with excellent mechanical properties, which have application potential in robotics, biomedical engineering, and environmental governance.
