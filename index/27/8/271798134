The utilization of shared control in the realm of surgical robotics augments precision and safety by amalgamating human expertise with autonomous assistance. This paper proposes a user-centered shared control framework enabling a robot to learn from expert demonstration, predict operators’ intent and modulate control authority to provide natural assistance when needed. We employ deep inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to enable the robot to learn path planning from expert demonstrations with fast convergence, subsequently enhancing the policy with a potential field method. The control authority is allocated seamlessly between the human operator and the autonomous agent based on the prediction of operators’ movement from an adaptive filter and fuzzy logic inference. The proposed method is executed using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) robot in a simulation environment, and its effectiveness is assessed through user performance evaluation in a trajectory tracking task. Compared to direct control and simple shared control, the proposed shared control scheme exhibits superior tracking accuracy and trajectory smoothness under external disturbances. Subjective responses underscore users’ perception of the method’s efficacy in enhancing their performance.
