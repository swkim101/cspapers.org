Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be viable surrogates for the widely used, albeit overly rigid, lexical matching metrics in evaluating question answering (QA) models. However, these LLM-based evaluation methods are invariably based on proprietary LLMs. Despite their remarkable capabilities, proprietary LLMs are costly and subject to internal changes that can affect their output, which inhibits the reproducibility of their results and limits the widespread adoption of LLM-based evaluation. In this demo, we aim to use publicly available LLMs for standardizing LLM-based QA evaluation. However, open-source LLMs lag behind their proprietary counterparts. We overcome this gap by adopting chain-of-thought prompting with self-consistency to build a reliable evaluation framework. We demonstrate that our evaluation framework, based on 750M and 7B open LLMs, correlates competitively with human judgment, compared to most recent GPT-3 and GPT-4 models.
