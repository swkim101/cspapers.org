Deep neural networks have played a crucial part in many critical domains, such as autonomous driving, face recognition, and medical diagnosis. However, deep neural networks are facing security threats from backdoor attacks and can be manipulated into attacker-decided behaviors by the backdoor attacker. To defend the backdoor, prior research has focused on using clean data to remove backdoor attacks before model deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of defending against backdoor attacks by utilizing test-time partially poisoned data to remove the backdoor from the model. To address the problem, a two-stage method TTBD is proposed. In the first stage, we propose a backdoor sample detection method DDP to identify poisoned samples from a batch of mixed, partially poisoned samples. Once the poisoned samples are detected, we employ Shapley estimation to calculate the contribution of each neuron's significance in the network, locate the poisoned neurons, and prune them to remove backdoor in the models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTBD removes the backdoor successfully with only a batch of partially poisoned data across different model architectures and datasets against different types of backdoor attacks.
