Eavesdropping on human sound is one of the most common but harmful ways to threaten personal privacy. As one of the most essential accessories, headsets have been widely used in common online conversations, such as online calls, video meetings, etc. The metal coil vibration patterns of headset speakers/microphones have been proven to be highly correlated with the speaker-produced/microphone-received sound content. This paper presents an online conversation eavesdropping system, RFSpy, which uses only one RFID tag attached on a headset to alternately sense the metal coil vibrations of headset speaker and microphone for eavesdropping on speaker-produced and microphone-received sound. In some accessible scenarios, such as meeting rooms, offices, etc., assuming attackers secretly attach a small, battery-free RFID tag under one ear cushion of an eavesdropped user's headset without being noticed. Meanwhile, RFID readers are camouflaged as decorations placed in/out of rooms to transmit and receive RF signals. When the eavesdropped user talks with other users online by using the headset, RFSpy first activates the RFID tag attached on the headset to capture the metal coil vibration patterns of headset speaker and microphone upon RF signals. Then, RFSpy reconstructs sound spectrograms from the RF signal-based vibration patterns for not only trained words but also untrained (i.e., out-of-vocabulary) words by utilizing a designed Sound Spectrogram Reconstruction (SSR) network. Finally, RFSpy converts the sound spectrograms to conversation content through a sound recognition API. Extensive experiments in real environments demonstrate that RFSpy can eavesdrop on online conversations with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words effectively.
