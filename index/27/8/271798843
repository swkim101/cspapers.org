Nowadays, robotic arms are ubiquitously employed for object manipulation across a spectrum of applications, spanning from production lines to warehouses, and encompassing both stationary and mobile robotic systems. Among the most prevalent end-effectors, used for the majority of these applications, are suction cups. The rudimentary act of grasping an object and relocating it, devoid of a cognizant awareness of the forces stemming from the object’s motion and grip, can result in suboptimal and inefficient robot movements. In more dire circumstances, such negligent handling may precipitate detachment of the object from the end-effector, potentially incurring damage to either the object or the arm.In this paper, we build upon the advanced sensing and attaching capabilities of our suction cup MIGHTY, and introduce GEM-C, a novel Gravity, External forces and Motion Compensation controller, that constantly adapts the orientation of the suction cup so as to enhance the quality of attachment. Throughout all examined scenarios and experiments, our approach remarkably improved the robot’s performance by providing the optimal end-effector pose while also reducing the stress on the motors and the overall power consumption. The derived results, clearly demonstrate the MIGHTY and GEM-C schema’s potential for a wide range of demanding robotic manipulation tasks.
