While sketch-based network telemetry is attractive, realizing its potential benefits has been elusive in practice. Existing sketch solutions offer low-level interfaces and impose high effort on operators to satisfy telemetry intents with required accuracies. Extending these approaches to reduce effort results in inefficient deployments with poor accuracy-resource tradeoffs. We present SketchPlan, an abstraction layer for sketch-based telemetry to reduce effort and achieve high efficiency. SketchPlan takes an ensemble view across telemetry intents and sketches , instead of existing approaches that consider each intent-sketch pair in isolation. We show that SketchPlan improves accuracy-resource trade-offs by up-to 12x and up-to 60x vs. baselines, in single-node and network-wide settings.
