In this work, we present a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme for tracking a ground target using a multirotor with a cable-suspended load. The NMPC framework relies on the dynamic model of the UAV with the suspended load and, hence, an estimate of the load state is obtained by fusing the measurements of a downward-facing camera and a load cell with an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Additionally, since the NMPC relies on the future behavior of the system, the trajectory of the ground target throughout the predicted time horizon of the NMPC, is required. Towards this direction, BÃ©zier curves are employed in order to predict the future trajectory of the target, which moves in an arbitrary way. The ultimate goal of the proposed framework is to release the suspended load to the ground target and, consequently, a condition is checked at each time instant that triggers the opening of a gripper, located at the lower edge of the cable. The performance of the proposed control scheme is experimentally validated using an octorotor.
