This paper presents a novel method to control an underactuated hand by using only a monocular camera, not using any internal sensors. In food factories, robots are required to handle a wide variety of foods without damaging them. To accomplish this, the use of underactuated hands is effective because they can adapt to various food shapes. However, if internal sensors such as tactile sensors and force sensors are used in the underactuated hands, it may cause a problem with hygiene and require complicated calibration. Moreover, if external sensors such as cameras are used, it is necessary to grasp foods without damaging them by using external information such as images. In our method, to tackle these problems, a camera is used as an external sensor. First, contact between the hand and the object is detected by using the contours of both, obtained from a camera image. Then, to avoid damaging the object, the following information is extracted from camera images and observed: the centroid of both the hand and object, the deformation of the object, and the occlusion rate of the hand. Furthermore, to prevent the object from dropping while the robotic arm is in motion, the distance between the centroid of the hand and the object is calculated. The experiments were conducted using twelve different food items.
