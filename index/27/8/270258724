Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has become instrumental in diverse consumer applications. Yet current radar architectures face major limitations. While full-MIMO structures are feature-rich, their cost and complexity rise rapidly with more antennas. Phased-MIMO radars promise enhanced scalability by combining large phased arrays with a small number of RF chains. Nevertheless, the phased-MIMO research thus far primarily relies on simulation or theoretical analysis. In this paper, we introduce HybRadar, a novel programmable phased-MIMO radar platform to address this experimental gap. HybRadar repurposes the phased arrays on a low-cost 802.11ad radio to create a scalable low-cost array of phased subarrays. It further incorporates transmit/receive front-end, control channel, and hardware synchronization mechanisms to enable a modular phased-MIMO system. By extending recent MIMO array synthesis models, we optimize the placement of phased subarrays to maximize the spatial resolution. Our prototype validation and case studies confirm the capability and versatility of HybRadar.
