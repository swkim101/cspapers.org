This paper introduces VIDEX, an advanced tool designed to streamline the analysis of surveillance video through a user-friendly interface. VIDEX achieves high development efficiency and maintainability utilizing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern. The core feature of VIDEX is a footage summary using object detection and anomaly detection. Its architecture ensures efficient data management by organizing detected objects and anomalies within an indexed database, thus facilitating a more rapid review process. Additionally, multi-threading was used to shorten the processing time. VIDEX provides a video summarization that can be used primarily in the criminal investigation stage using the information stored in a database.
