In this paper, the impact of Lorentz forces and temperature on the natural frequencies of a piezoresistive sensor composed of two microcantilevers with integrated U-shaped thin-film aluminum heaters are investigated. Two types of experiments were performed. In the first, the sensor was placed in a magnetic field so that the current flowing in the heater, in addition to raising the temperature, produced Lorentz forces, inducing normal stresses in the plane of one of the microcantilevers. In the second, which were conducted without magnetic fields, only the temperature variation of the natural frequency was left. In processing of the results, the thermal variations were subtracted from the variations due to both Lorentz forces and temperature in the natural frequency, resulting in the influence of the Lorentz forces only. Theoretical relations for the Lorentz frequency offsets were derived. An indirect method of estimating the natural frequency of one of the cantilevers, through a particular cusp point in the amplitude–frequency response of the sensor, was used in the investigations. The findings show that for thin microcantilevers with silicon masses on the order of 4 × 10−7 g and currents of 25 µA, thermal eigenfrequency variations are dominant. The results may have applications in the design of similar microsensors with vibrational action.
