Quadrotors may crash and cause severe accidents under instantaneously drastic disturbances. To mitigate the effect of such disturbances, these critical issues should be considered: efficient disturbance observation and compensation, full attitude controllability, and instant output power generation of the quadrotor. In this paper, to keep the quadrotor stable even under suddenly drastic disturbances, a novel control framework is presented to by integrating the advantages of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) as well as geometric control for a quadrotor with bidirectional thrust capabilities. Moreover, to strengthen the adaptability under significant disturbances, a novel switching strategy is introduced into the control framework by virtue of the quadrotor’s bidirectional thrust capabilities. The ADRC scheme is performed when the disturbances are within a range; alternatively, if the disturbances surpass the preset range and the desired control is beyond the ultimate output of the quadrotor, the quadrotor compliantly responds by executing a 180° flip reverse flight to handle such drastic disturbances. Numerical and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust control strategy has superior performance adapts to instantaneously drastic disturbances.
