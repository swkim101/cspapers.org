Table tennis stroke training is a critical aspect of player development. We designed a new augmented reality (AR) system, avaTTAR, for table tennis stroke training. The system provides both"on-body"(first-person view) and"detached"(third-person view) visual cues, enabling users to visualize target strokes and correct their attempts effectively with this dual perspectives setup. By employing a combination of pose estimation algorithms and IMU sensors, avaTTAR captures and reconstructs the 3D body pose and paddle orientation of users during practice, allowing real-time comparison with expert strokes. Through a user study, we affirm avaTTAR's capacity to amplify player experience and training results.
