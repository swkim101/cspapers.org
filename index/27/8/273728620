Bio-pigments are the colored primary and secondary metabolites released by microbes under stress conditions and are crucial for adaptation. Bio-pigments are being widely accepted for industrial utilization due to their natural form, organic source, and biodegradability. Also, the ease of cultivation, scalability and cost-effectiveness in terms of pigment extraction is bringing bio-pigments into the limelight. Chemical dyes are carcinogenic and pose a serious threat to human lives, which is another issue that environmentalists must address. However, bacterial pigments are safe to employ; therefore, the food, pharmaceutical, textile, and cosmetics sectors may all benefit from their applications. The therapeutic nature of bacterial pigments is revealed because of their antimicrobial, anticancer, cytotoxic, and remarkable antioxidant properties. Bio-pigments also have multifaceted properties and thus can be an attractive source for the next generation to live a sustainable life. The present review discusses the importance of bacterial pigments over synthetic dyes and their therapeutic and industrial potential. Extensive literature has been reviewed on the biomedical application of bacterial pigments, and further opportunities and future challenges have been discussed.
