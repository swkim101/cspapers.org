This paper investigates the problem of effective tool manipulation for motion planning in complex human-like scenarios. Vector-field-based real-time strategies, although widely used, usually do not account for unwieldy tools or incorporate systematic methods to handle these extra maneuvers needed. Instead, we formalize the problem and propose a novel field-based reactive planner that explicitly accounts for rotational forces for seamless maneuvers based on the tool’s geometry and featured points. Furthermore, we capture and encode robot performance through capability metrics and improve the same using an additional quality distribution method. This enables seamless integration of the robot’s embodiment with the reactive force-torque (wrench) field giving rise to flexible tool usage in non-stationary environments. Extensive simulation analysis on a 7 DoF collaborative robot manipulating a common tool in an unorganized table-top layout reinforces our claim of robustness in stationary and non-stationary scenarios.
