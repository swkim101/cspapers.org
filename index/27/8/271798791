In this paper, we strongly advocate square-root covariance (instead of information) filtering for Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems (VINS), in particular on resource-constrained edge devices, because of its superior efficiency and numerical stability. Although VINS have made tremendous progress in recent years, they still face resource stringency and numerical instability on embedded systems when imposing limited word length. To overcome these challenges, we develop an ultrafast and numerically-stable square-root filter (SRF)-based VINS algorithm (i.e., SR-VINS). The numerical stability of the proposed SR-VINS is inherited from the adoption of square-root covariance while the remarkable efficiency is largely enabled by the novel SRF update method that is based on our new permuted-QR (P-QR), which fully utilizes and properly maintains the upper triangular structure of the square-root covariance matrix. Furthermore, we choose a special ordering of the state variables which is amenable for (P-)QR operations in the SRF propagation and update and prevents unnecessary computation. The proposed SR-VINS is validated extensively through numerical studies, demonstrating that when the state-of-the-art (SOTA) filters have numerical difficulties, our SR-VINS has superior numerical stability, and remarkably, achieves efficient and robust performance on 32-bit single-precision float at a speed nearly twice as fast as the SOTA methods. We also conduct comprehensive real-world experiments to validate the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed SR-VINS.
