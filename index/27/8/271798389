Rehabilitative robotics, particularly lower-limb exoskeletons (LLEs), have gained increasing importance in aiding patients regain ambulatory functions. One of the challenges in making these systems effective is the implementation of an assist-as-needed (AAN) control strategy that intervenes only when the patient deviates from the correct movement pattern. Equally crucial is the need for the LLE to exhibit "transparency" — minimising its interaction forces with the wearer to feel as natural as possible. This paper introduces a novel approach to transparency control based on a human-in-the-loop velocity optimisation framework. The proposed method employs torque data captured from past steps through a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) to approximate the wearer’s intended future movements and computes a corresponding transparent velocity trajectory. The velocity commands are complemented by an Adaptive Frequency Oscillator (AFO) based position controller that leverages the periodic nature of human gait and is modified with a force sensor for increased reactiveness to human gait variations. This approach is experimentally evaluated against a standard zero-torque controller with a stationary single-degree-of-freedom knee exoskeleton test platform in a proof-of-concept study. Preliminary results indicate that combining adaptive oscillators with interaction force sensing can improve transparency compared to the conventional zero-torque controller, using force readings for position control and torque measurements for velocity optimisation and control.
