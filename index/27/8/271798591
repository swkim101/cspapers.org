Reactive planning enables the robots to deal with dynamic events in uncertain environments. However, existing methods heavily rely on the predefined hard-coded robot behaviors, e.g, a pre-coded temporal logic formula that specifies how robot should react. Little attention has been paid for autonomous generation of reactive tasks specifications during the runtime. As a first attempt towards this goal, this work develops a real-time decision-making and motion planning framework. It allows the robot to follow a global task planned offline while taking proactive decisions and generating temporal logic specifications for local reactive tasks when encountering dynamic events. Specifically, inspired by the causal knowledge graph, a proposition graph is developed, based on which the decision module encode the environment and the task as the Boolean logic and linear temporal logic (LTL), respectively. Based on the established proposition graph and perceived environment, the agent can autonomously generate an LTL formula to realize the local temporary task. A joint sampling algorithm is then developed, in which the automaton states of local and global task are jointly considered to generate a feasible planning that satisfies both global and local tasks. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making and motion planning.
