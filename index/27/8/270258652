Smartphones have seamlessly integrated into our lives, serving as versatile tools for myriad tasks. Leveraging their ubiquitous presence and advanced sensors, recent research aims to replace costly dedicated hardware with smartphone-based solutions. In this poster, we introduce SmartScale, a novel system that estimates objects' weight using smartphone sensors. Our approach combines the smartphone's accelerometer and vibration motor to form the foundation of our methodology. By orchestrating the interplay between controlled oscillations and motion sensitivity, we detect dynamic responses to varying loads with precision. SmartScale leverages Recurrent Neural Networks to accurately compute mass, eliminating the need for specialized equipment and making weight detection accessible and cost-effective. To validate our approach, we created a dataset of a diverse range of weights across various phone models, achieving a 92% accuracy. This finding not only demonstrates the efficacy of our approach but also emphasizes smartphones' evolution from communication devices to intelligent assistants, reshaping our interaction with the world.
