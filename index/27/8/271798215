The emergence of intelligent prostheses has facilitated the life and work of disabled patients. The interaction aspect of prostheses has become a highlight research topic in the field of rehabilitation robotics. However, most of the existing prosthetic interaction methods focus on the use of myoelectricity to classify finite gestures, rather than continuous (infinite) force detection, which greatly limits the use of prosthetic scenarios. In this study, a novel optical waveguide sensor was used to collect muscle deformation information from the human arm for continuous control of the prosthetic grip force. The optical waveguide sensor was embedded with carbon fiber to limit the stretching of the waveguide, which led to the optical waveguide sensor being sensitive to bending deformation. Compared with EMGs, the accuracy of continuous grip force control based on the optical waveguide sensor is higher. The R-Square for prosthetic grip force and hand grip force were 0.867 and 0.9724 in the periodic and sustaining grip force experiments, respectively. The results suggested that the proposed method could provide a new approach to the interaction of prostheses.
