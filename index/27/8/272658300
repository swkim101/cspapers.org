There is an increasing need for compact low-cost NMR apparatus that can be used on the laboratory bench and in the field. There are four main usage variants of usage: (a) time-domain apparatus, particularly for physical measurements; (b) frequency-domain apparatus, particularly for chemical analysis, (c) NMR Cryoporometry apparatus for measuring pore-size distributions; and (d) MRI apparatus for imaging. For all of these, variable temperature capability may be vital. We have developed compact low-cost apparatus targeted at these applications. We discuss a hand-held NMR Spectrometer, and three different holdable NMR magnets, with sufficiently large internal bores for the Lab-Tools compact Peltier thermo-electric cooled variable-temperature probes. Currently, the NMR Spectrometer is very suitable for (a) NMR time-domain relaxation and (c) NMR Cryoporometry. With a suitable high-homogeneity magnet, it is also appropriate for simple use (b), spectral analysis, or, with a suitable gradient set, (d) MRI. Together, the NMR Spectrometer, one of the NMR variable-temperature probes, and any of these NMR magnets make excellent NMR Cryoporometers, as demonstrated by this paper and previously published research. Equally, they make versatile general-purpose variable-temperature NMR systems for materials science.
