With the increasing use of application-based video calls, the security and privacy of video and audio data have become a major concern. Despite the use of encryption, applications that implement the encryption can still access the content of video calls for eavesdropping, censorship, and data mining. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight system service solution, StreamGuard, to provide End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) at mobile system level, effectively blocking applications from accessing unencrypted data. StreamGuard uses the Signal Protocol for key exchange, and AES for encryption. Additionally, StreamGuard's novel architecture supports video preview and editing while maintaining the confidentiality of data. Our preliminary results show that StreamGuard is feasible with minimal performance overhead.
