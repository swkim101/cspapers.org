SolarSense is a self-powered sensing system for gesture recognition using solar cell arrays, thereby offering a sustainable approach to human-computer interaction (HCI) within industrial settings. The system effectively employed the sensing and energy harvesting capabilities of solar cells, achieving over 97.0% accuracy in recognizing diverse gestures. The design incorporates a low-power wireless data acquisition chip, a signal processing framework, and a user interface to realize robotic control and text input applications. SolarSense enhances HCI with its eco-friendly and user-centric approach, which is suitable for Internet of things (IoT) scenarios. Demo: https://youtu.be/RmPolChw_c4.
