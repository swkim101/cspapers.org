—This paper presents a pioneering pilot within the FORTIS EU project, aimed at enhancing the integration of autonomous heavy-duty robots in construction environments. The pilot has been established to assess the potential of these robots to revolutionise industry standards, specifically in tasks involving transportation and assembly. The paper offers insights into the challenges that will be addressed within FORTIS associated with human-robot interaction (HRI) in dynamic construction settings, where safety, efficiency, and adaptability are paramount. By contemplating the application of autonomous loaders and telehandlers, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development in construction robotics. We highlight the study’s contributions to the field through the development of specific use cases and the application of an existing HRI taxonomy to categorise interactions between humans and robots. This position paper aims to inform the audience about the significant pilot underway, rather than presenting conclusive results, setting a foundation for ongoing scientific exploration and practical application in the industry.
