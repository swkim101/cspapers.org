Low back pain is a widespread issue that affects people worldwide and can lead to serious conditions such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, or lumbar radiculopathy. Improper posture while lifting heavy weights is a common cause of back pain, especially among laborers. However, current back exoskeletons are often bulky and require electric motors, making them challenging to use and consuming significant power. Some passive exoskeletons don’t require power, but their fixed stiffness constrains normal motion. This paper presents a novel solution: a pneumatic back exoskeleton made of structured fabrics that can adjust stiffness under various air pressures. Additionally, it includes IMU sensors to detect lifting posture and correct it in real time. The exoskeleton’s effectiveness was tested through lifting experiments, demonstrating that it significantly corrects lifting posture, reduces stress on the lumbar spine, and mitigates back muscle stress. This pneumatic back exoskeleton offers a promising solution to prevent low back pain during weight-lifting tasks and provides guidance for future back exoskeleton designs.
