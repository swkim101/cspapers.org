This paper presents a 6-DOF hybrid robot for percutaneous needle intervention procedures. The new robot combines the advantages of both serial robots and parallel robots, featuring compactness, high accuracy, and small footprint while overcoming the problems of the high cost of serial robots and the small workspace and singularity issue of parallel robots. Besides, by analyzing the workspace of the robot, the equation is derived between the structure parameter and workspace to adjust the parameters of the robot to satisfy different working scenes. According to the experiment, the accuracy of the robot is related to the position, distance, and insertion angle. The result shows that the performance is better when working near the center workspace and away from the servos and the average error of the robot is 1.39mm. The phantom experiment of lumbar puncture validates its feasibility.
