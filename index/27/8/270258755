Public awareness of automated external defibrillator (AED) locations is crucial for prompt retrieval in cardiac emergencies. We propose a simulation-based approach as a preliminary step towards developing gamified mobile apps to enhance this awareness. By simulating AED retrieval in real-world pedestrian networks under various scenarios, we identify key elements that can improve retrieval efficiency. Our findings confirm the viability of the framework and highlight crucial aspects for improvement towards efficient future applications.
