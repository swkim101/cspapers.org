We propose a decentralised multi-robot coordination algorithm that features a rich representation for encoding and communicating each robot’s intent. This representation for “intent messages” enables improved coordination behaviour and communication efficiency in difficult scenarios, such as those where there are unknown points of contention that require negotiation between robots. Each intent message is an adaptive policy that conditions on identified points of contention that conflict with the intentions of other robots. These policies are concisely expressed as behaviour trees via algebraic logic simplification, and are interpretable by robot teammates and human operators. We propose this intent representation in the context of the Dec-MCTS online planning algorithm for decentralised coordination. We present results for a generalised multi-robot orienteering domain that show improved plan convergence and coordination performance over standard Dec-MCTS enabled by the intent representation’s ability to encode and facilitate negotiation over points of contention.
