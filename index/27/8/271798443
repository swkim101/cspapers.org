Several robotic frameworks have been recently developed to assist ophthalmic surgeons in performing complex vitreoretinal procedures such as subretinal injection. However, in order to intuitively integrate robots into the surgical workflow, it is crucial to emphasize that an accessibility analysis framework for vitreoretinal surgery must be considered as an essential component. Such a framework, ideally, considers the comprehensive factors of the eye anatomy and its positioning, the insertion point, and the initial pose and position of the robot. By combining the mobilization of the eyeball and adjusting the pose and position of the robot, the accessibility of such systems is significantly optimized. At the same time, the accessible-visible area is better and faster matched to the working volume of the robot. This paper presents an analysis of an expansion strategy for the robot’s accessibility and visibility area. The outcomes of this method demonstrate the promising potential to enhance the robot’s accessibility, as evidenced in our analytical and experimental findings from 22.4% to 99.0% of the required working area on an adjustable phantom model.
