Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), involving chest-to-chest skin contact between an infant and caregiver, is proven to be an effective intervention for preterm and full-term infants. Accurate monitoring of KMC duration and infant's vital signs during KMC is clinically important. Existing monitoring methods, however, rely on manual efforts and require rigid sensors or wires/electrodes on the infant's body. We propose Joey, a fabric-based approach to continuously monitor KMC duration and two vital signs essential to an infant's well-being: heart rate and respiration rate. Joey is a soft fabric necklace worn by the caregiver. It leverages the transmission of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals across individuals during skin-to-skin contact. With a minimalist fabric sensor structure, Joey measures KMC duration via the presence of mixed ECG signals. It then isolates the infant's ECG from this mixture with a proposed signal extraction algorithm and employs a diffusion-based denoising model to mitigate motion artifacts, enabling reliable inference of the infant's vital signs. We demonstrate Joey's sensing capability with hand-shaking experiments, showing the real-time mixed ECGs.
