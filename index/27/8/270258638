Stress management is paramount to maintaining optimal health and well-being; stress builds up in spikes, causing problems like hypertension and anxiety, necessitating personalized interventions delivered in real-time through wearable technology. This work underscores the pivotal role of unobtrusive stress detection and presents the development of auto-generated compact models tailored for on-device inference through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). These models aim to facilitate efficient stress monitoring directly on low-power devices, representing a promising avenue for advancing personalized healthcare with continuous monitoring and effective digital interventions.
