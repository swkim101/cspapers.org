Data binding in front-end user interface web development allows for the UI to update automatically in sync with data, removing complexity from development and simplifying programming. However, data binding often causes website performance to degrade due to its increased complexity. In this paper, we propose "Visible Anchors" to solve the performance degradation caused by data binding. We present a novel web front-end compiler called FaST that builds upon this idea. We also compare the rendering speed of websites built by existing methods and the FaST compiler. The evaluation result revealed that the websites built by the FaST compiler are rendered at a minimum 17.1 times faster than the ones built by the existing methods. Most notably, FaST achieves all of this without any additional cost to the developer.
