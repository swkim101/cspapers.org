With the aggressive growth in AI model complexity to achieve higher performance, operating them on mobile platforms becomes more and more challenging. This issue is even more prominent for time-series data, commonly dealt with in mobile/IoT computing scenarios, given their inherent issues such as label imbalance, user and sensor diversity, and out-of-distribution inference data. In this work, we investigate into the efficacy of a k-nearest neighbor classifier enhanced with a lossless compressor gzip, introducing novel sequence tokenization algorithms that show superior performance compared to traditional machine/deep learning classifiers. Our evaluation across three diverse real-world applications with distinct datasets emphasizes the generalization potential of our approach in real-world scenarios, especially in situations with few training samples.
