The global rise in diabetes has highlighted the urgent need for continuous, non-invasive health monitoring solutions. Traditional glucose monitoring methods, which are invasive and often inconvenient, have created a demand for alternative technologies that can offer comfort, accuracy, and real-time data. In this study, the development of a textile-based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is presented, designed for non-invasive glucose sensing, aiming to integrate this technology seamlessly into everyday clothing. The document details the design, optimization, and testing of a one-component textile-based OECT, featuring a porous PEDOT:PSS structure and a glucose oxidase-modified electrolyte for effective glucose detection in sweat. The research demonstrates the feasibility of using this textile-based OECT for non-invasive glucose monitoring, with enhanced sensitivity and specificity achieved through the integration of glucose oxidase within the electrolyte and the innovative porous PEDOT:PSS design. These findings suggest a significant advancement in wearable health monitoring technologies, providing a promising pathway for the development of smart textiles capable of non-invasively tracking glucose levels. Future work should focus on refining this technology for clinical use, including individual calibration for accurate blood glucose correlation and its integration into commercially available smart textiles.
