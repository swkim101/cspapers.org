Mobile edge networks enhance cloud applications by offering reduced delay for mobile terminals. However, due to the cumulative increase of mobile terminals and applications, edge networks fail to accommodate all applications and are difficult to guarantee the end-to-end delay demand, which is an important metric of QoS. One potential solution to address this challenge is to place virtual clusters (VCs) in mobile micro-clouds (MMCs) to enhance the capabilities of edge networks and the cloud. Therefore, in this paper, we build the optimization model of VC placement in edges for maximizing the benefit function, with constraints of 1). the satisfaction for end-to-end delay demand of each application; 2). the resource capacity of each MMC no more than the whole demands of those VCs placed in. We use Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) to build the delay model more accurately, considering stochastic arrivals of flows and stochastic services of service nodes. Moreover, we use Martingale Theory to enhance the solvability of the SNC-based delay model, achieving tighter delay bound reliability.
