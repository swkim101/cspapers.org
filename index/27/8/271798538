Lack of information and perceptual ambiguity are key problems in sonar-based mapping applications. We propose a technique for mapping of underwater environments, building on the finite, positive, sonar beamwidth. Our approach models the free-space covered by each emitted acoustic pulse, employing volumetric techniques to create grid-based submaps of the unoccupied water volumes through images collected from imaging sonars. A representation of the occupied space is obtained by exploration of the free-space frontier. Special attention is given to acoustic image preparation and segmentation. Experimental results are provided based on real data collected from a dam shaft scenario.
