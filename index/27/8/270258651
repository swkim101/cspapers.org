In this paper, we propose a MeowSorter that identifies stray and pet cats using deep learning technology, to address the problem that lost cats with owners are mistakenly identified as stray cats and wrongfully euthanized. We made a dataset of 800 facial images and compared the accuracy of six image recognition algorithms. The optimal algorithm for classifying stray and pet cats is ResNet-50, achieving an accuracy of 85.44%. Our findings confirm that cat eyes and ears are key differentiators, rivaling cat expert judgments.
