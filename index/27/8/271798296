In this paper, we introduce PADUAV, a novel 5-DOF aerial platform designed to overcome the limitations of traditional tiltrotor vehicles. PADUAV features a unique mechanical design that incorporates two off-the-shelf quadrotors passively articulated to a rigid frame. This innovation enables free pitch rotation without mechanical constraints like cable winding, significantly enhancing its capabilities for various tasks. To control PADUAVâ€™s 5 degrees of freedom, we propose a versatile and straightforward 5-DOF geometric tracking control strategy that generates 2D force and 3D torque. A decomposition approach is designed to distribute the output to the torque and thrust commands for each subplane, with no need for complex optimization. We validate our approach through three simulation experiments conducted in the Gazebo environment, leveraging the utilities provided by the RotorS simulator. These experiments not only demonstrate the feasibility of our platform but also provide new perspectives for future aerial platform development, particularly in terms of simulation-based approaches.
