In mini-invasive surgery, the laparoscopic ultra-sound probe is visible in the laparoscopic image. We address the problem of estimating the probe pose with respect to the laparoscope without using markers and additional sensors. We propose the first method using a single standard laparoscopic monocular RGB image. It is robust, initialization-free and runs at 10 fps, thus forming a promising tool to improve robotic and augmented reality-based surgery.
