Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) is a relatively new imaging modality in biomedicine. However, point-by-point raster scanning in PAM suffers from low imaging speed. Sparse sampling has been studied in recent years and with the development of deep learning algorithms, extensive efforts have been devoted to sparse image reconstruction while little attention has been paid to sparse sampling trajectory design required for actual implementation. The use of real-time adaptive robotically controlled sampling with micro-scale accuracy with due consideration of physical constraints can pave the way for using PAM for robot-assisted microsurgery. This work proposes a fast PAM scheme with robot-controlled microtrajectory optimization. The proposed method is adaptive to imaging details of different regions of interest (ROI) and detailed experiments have been conducted on both simulation and in-vivo settings. Results show that our proposed method can achieve faster scanning speed than traditional raster scanning and improved image quality in ROI than the standard spiral trajectory, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method and its potential to be deployed in other point-by-point scanning systems.
