We present a novel training system designed to combat phone fraud, a significant social issue causing losses of $8.8 billion in the U.S. in 2022. The system consists of dialogue, sensing, and analysis technologies to simulate fraudulent calls, monitor users' vital responses, and provide personalized feedback. The results of an experiment conducted with 28 elderly participants indicated that 81% of the participants showed an intention to adopt some form of fraud prevention measures after use of our training system, suggesting the system's potential to heighten security awareness and improve fraud prevention behaviors.
