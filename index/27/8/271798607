Ground testing is of paramount importance to verify and validate space operations and the associated control algorithms before on-orbit deployment. Although state-of-the-art facilities are capable of reproducing zero-G environment with high degree of fidelity, these infrastructures can be complemented with multi-rotors emulating free flying or free floating conditions, exploiting the similarities and analogies between both domains in terms of floating nature, attitude dynamics, and thrust-wrench relation through the mixer matrix. Furthermore, the effective workspace of the testbed can be extended to the dimensions of the flight area and the coverage of the positioning system. Therefore, this papers introduces a new way to recreate orbital motion within an indoor facility, considering the case study of trajectories derived from the Clohessyâ€“Wiltshire equations. This advancement opens up avenues for replicating close-proximity operations between chaser and target satellites employing fully-actuated multi-rotors that allow decoupling translational and attitude dynamics.
