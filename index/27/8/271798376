Multiple preferences between robots and tasks have been largely overlooked in previous research on Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problems. In this paper, we propose a preference-driven approach based on hedonic game to address the task allocation problem of muti-robot systems in emergency rescue scenarios. We present a distributed framework considering various preferences between robots and tasks to determine the division of coalitions in such problems and evaluate the scalability and adaptability of our algorithm through relevant experiments. Furthermore, considering the strict communication limitations in emergency rescue scenarios, we have verified that our algorithm can efficiently converge to a Nash-stable coalition partition even in conditions of insufficient communication distance.
