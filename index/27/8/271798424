This paper addresses human-robot collaborative (HRC) precision assembly that complements natural human ability and the strength of an autonomous robot system. Our approach enables both flexibility and efficiency of tight-clearance assembly of various complex-shaped parts in the presence of uncertainty without requiring assembly skills and knowledge of robotics from the human operator. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of experiments and comparisons with other HRC assembly approaches.
