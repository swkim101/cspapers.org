Temporal knowledge graph reasoning has emerged as a crucial task for answering time-dependent questions within a knowledge graph (KG). Despite tremendous progress, the present research is impeded by the sparsity of a temporal KG and an over-reliance on simple single-relational reasoning patterns. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Mul 2 Questions, a new temporal KG reasoning benchmark featuring over 200k entities and 960k questions designed to facilitate complex, multi-relational and multi-hop reasoning. Additionally, we pro-pose a new model adept at conducting pattern-aware and time-sensitive reasoning across temporal KGs. The modelâ€™s efficacy is confirmed through rigorous evaluations, show-casing its effectiveness in sparse data conditions and adeptness at handling questions with long reasoning chains. We have made our benchmark and model publicly accessible at
