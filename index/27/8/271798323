Natural and robotic swarms often exhibit nonreciprocal interactions; agents do not exhibit equal and opposite forces on each other. By studying the effects of reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions we are better able to design emergent behaviors in robot collectives composed of agents that exert attractive and repulsive forces on each other. Moreover, by controlling agent-specific coupling forces on-demand, we can enable a collective to exhibit desired behaviors previously not possible. We use a general form of the swarming oscillator, swarmalator, model to study reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions among agents that affect each otherâ€™s motions over long and short distances, we use non-reciprocal coupling to elicit collective locomotion toward or away from target sites, and we use the control barrier function method to optimize the non-reciprocal interactions for a desired spatial formation. This work addresses the interests of the active matter, swarm robotics, and control barrier functions communities and demonstrates various collective behaviors with strong potential to be realized in macro- and micro- length scale robot swarms.
