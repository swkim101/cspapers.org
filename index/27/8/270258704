Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, known for its precise distance measurement capabilities, is widely utilized in indoor localization and ranging applications. However, recent UWB systems that operate within dense and dynamic networks face challenges in real-time performance evaluation and experimental data collection, especially in infrastructure-less scenarios. To address this, we present a mobile UWB testbed, which consists of a scalable ranging system, a data collection pipeline, and a mesh-based control network. This testbed facilitates UWB-related research such as ranging protocol design, as well as implementing and evaluating applications such as social interaction analysis and contact tracing.
