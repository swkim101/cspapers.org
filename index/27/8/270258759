Despite the potential for throughput enhancement with multiple tags, existing WiFi backscatter systems have been limited by inband interference among various tags. In response, we propose MultiRider, the first WiFi backscatter system that can tame in-band interference and support multi-tag parallel communication on commercial OFDM protocol. The principle behind MultiRider lies in its ability to demodulate and reconstruct tag data using just one uncorrupted subcarrier in the spectrum domain. To address the inherent challenges of preamble corruption and data collision due to in-band interference, we design three modules: 1) preamble recovery based on a concurrency-driven backscatter packet structure; 2) subcarrier-level demodulation using uncorrupted subcarriers; and 3) iterative interference cancellation for multiple tags. We prototype and evaluate MultiRider under 802.11g OFDM WiFi signals with commercial adapters and software-defined radios. Comprehensive evaluations illustrate that MultiRider can efficiently solve in-band interference. Notably, it can expand the network capacity of WiFi backscatter by 4× and use 8 channels in the 2.4GHz WiFi band for concurrent communication. Further results reveal that MultiRider can gain 10× network capacity in 35MHz bandwidth and reach 2.29 Mbps system throughput.
