Soft robotic gloves can not only provide timely, effective, safe and cheap rehabilitation training for patients with impaired movement function of hand, but also assist in completing daily grasping activities. However, most soft robotic gloves are completely composed of flexible structures. Although they have high flexibility and safety, there are problems such as poor fit and low output force. In order to solve these problems, this paper refers to the structure of the human hand and designs an articulated rigid-soft hybrid robotic glove, which combines the advantages of rigid robotic gloves and soft robotic gloves, and has high flexibility, high output force and good fit. In addition, soft robotic gloves generally lack the ability to sense the force between the human hand and the glove. Therefore, this paper designed an array flexible force sensor, and studied the structure, signal acquisition and preparation process of the sensor. Finally, a complete test platform was built to test the performance of the rigid-soft hybrid robotic glove with force sensing function. The test results show that the robotic glove has good fit and high output force, can effectively assist training and assist grasping, and can perceive the contact force.
