This demo presents SCOPE, an electric scooter equipped with RF sensing and License Plate Recognition (LPR) capabilities to achieve accurate and efficient parking enforcement. SCOPE leverages Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology and incorporates the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based RFID localization algorithm for precise parking spot recognition. Our demo presents an end-to-end system that combines License Plate Recognition (LPR) and RF-based positioning, achieving 88% accuracy in matching vehicles to their lots and enabling automated parking enforcement in practical environments.
