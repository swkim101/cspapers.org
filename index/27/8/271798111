Efficiently performing intervention tasks underwater is crucial in various commercial and scientific sectors; however, propeller-driven vehicles face limitations due to their floating nature. In Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) operations, this can be compensated by the ability of the operator, but they come with high operational costs. Instead, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have shown promise, but demonstrated intervention tasks are limited to controlled environments or docked. To address these limitations, we focused on the use of Underwater Legged Robots (ULRs), which offer greater stability and agile seabed mobility thanks to their legged propulsion system. This paper presents the field demonstration of teleoperated pick-and-place tasks using the ULR SILVER2 for which a novel stance control, Graphic User Interface (GUI), and tendon-driven gripper have been developed based on the lessons learned through several hours of field use. The methodology is validated through four field trials, including missions in both shallow water and open sea environments. The trials involve picking and placing various objects, such as plastic bottles, bags, and cans. The results demonstrate successful teleoperated object grasping and manipulation in real-world conditions, with collection times ranging from a few minutes to around ten minutes. Overall, this research contributes to advancing the capabilities of ULRs and lays the foundation for future underwater intervention missions in various scientific and industrial applications, aligning with the goals of the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.
