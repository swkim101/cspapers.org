High-frequency, low-latency, 6-DoF object tracking is useful for grasping objects in motion, taking robots beyond pick-and-place tasks. We propose using an event-camera for tracking the objects to leverage the low-latency and continuous (i.e. not fixed-rate) data capture for high-frequency tracking. We propose the EDOPT algorithm, which maintains real-time operation with a variable event-rate (which occurs due to variation in camera velocity and scene texture) and avoids frame-jumps and motion-blur which are problematic in traditional computer vision solutions. EDOPT uses a strong object prior, leading to a novel solution possible only with the event-camera. To our knowledge, this is the first method for 6-DoF object pose estimation with only the event-camera. The proposed method achieves comparable results to a state-of-the-art DNN technique that fuses frames, depth, and events. We demonstrate smooth, online object pose tracking with a live camera feed at > 300 Hz.
