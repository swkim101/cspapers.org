Existing methods for place recognition in 3D point clouds either ignore partial structure information by converting 3D scans to 2D images or construct constrained bag-of-words (BoW) representations reliant on specific feature extraction algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on incremental and general bag of words. Incorporating an adaptable keypoint and 3D local feature extraction method, we employ an incremental BoW model that is updated regularly. This enables a coarse-to-fine candidate selection from the database. And a revisit can be identified following geometric verification. In addition, we propose a new supplementary metric that addresses the leaving-out issue of the conventional metric, enhancing the identification of true loops. Employing a state-of-the-art (SOTA) keypoint and feature extraction algorithm, we evaluate our method as well as SOTA place recognition methods using diverse datasets with varying qualities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines across all three datasets, showcasing robust performance and notable generalization capabilities.
