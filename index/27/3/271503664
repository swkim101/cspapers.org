Parameter sharing is a common strategy in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to make the training more efficient and scalable. However, applying parameter sharing among agents indiscriminately hinders the emergence of agents diversity and degrades the final cooperative performance. To better balance parameter sharing and agents diversity, we propose a novel Agent-Driven Modular Network (ADMN), where agents share a base network consisting of multiple specialized modules, and each agent has its own routing to connect these modules. In ADMN, modules are shared among agents to improve the training efficiency, while the combination of different modules brings rich diversity. The agent routing at different time steps is learned end-to-end to achieve a dynamic and adaptive balance. Specifically, we also propose an information-theoretical regularization between the routing of agents and their behavior to further guarantee the identifiability of different routing. We evaluated ADMN in challenging StarCraft micromanagement games and Google Research Football games, and results demonstrate the superior performance of ADMN, particularly in larger or heterogeneous cooperative tasks.
