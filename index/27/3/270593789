This research article investigates stability problems for the type of linear neutral systems involving multiple time delay parameters in state variables and multiple neutral delay parameters in time derivative of state variables. By employing newly defined proper Lyapunov functional sets, some applicable and alternative less restrictive sufficient global stability criteria are determined for the class of neutral systems possessing multiple delay terms. The proposed results prove global asymptotic stability of such neutral systems by imposing some easily verifiable algebraic conditions on constant system parameters independently of the delay parameters. We will give a numerical example to address some basic advantages of our obtained conditions over some corresponding results derived in the past literature. Since, the determination of desired stability criteria for the model of a linear neutral system including multiple delay parameters in the system equations is a difficult problem to deal with, because of complexity of mathematical models of this class of systems, the stability conditions proposed in this research article can be interpreted as valuable and useful contributions to the issues of stability analyzes of neutral systems.
