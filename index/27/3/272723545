Human action anticipation aims at predicting what people will do in the future based on past observations. In this paper, we introduce Uncertainty-aware Action Decoupling Transformer (UADT) for action anticipation. Unlike existing methods that directly predict action in a verb-noun pair format, we decouple the action anticipation task into verb and noun anticipations separately. The objective is to make the two decoupled tasks assist each other and eventually im-prove the action anticipation task. Specifically, we propose a two-stream Transformer-based architecture which is composed of a verb-to-noun model and a noun-to-verb model. The verb-to-noun model leverages the verb information to improve the noun prediction and the other way around. We extend the model in a probabilistic manner and quantify the predictive uncertainty of each decoupled task to select features. In this way, the noun prediction leverages the most in-formative and redundancy-free verb features and verb pre-diction works similarly. Finally, the two streams are combined dynamically based on their uncertainties to make the joint action anticipation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by achieving state-of-the-art performance on action anticipation benchmarks including EPIC-KITCHENS, EGTEA Gaze+, and 50-Salads.
