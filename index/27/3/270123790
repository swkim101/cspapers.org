Style transfer aims to render an image with the artistic features of a style image, while maintaining the origi-nal structure. Various methods have been put forward for this task, but some challenges still exist. For instance, it is difficult for CNN-based methods to handle global information and long-range dependencies between input images, for which transformer-based methods have been proposed. Although transformers can better model the relationship between content and style images, they require high-cost hard-ware and time-consuming inference. To address these is-sues, we design a novel transformer model that includes only the encoder, thus significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, we also find that existing style transfer methods may lead to images under-stylied or missing content. In order to achieve better stylization, we de-sign a content feature extractor and a style feature extrac-tor, based on which pure content and style images can be fed to the transformer. Finally, we propose a novel network termed Puff-Net, i.e., pure content and style feature fusion network. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to state-of-the-art ones in the literature.
