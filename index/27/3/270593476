In this paper, we implement the adaptive distributed observer (ADO) based control law for solving the linear cooperative output regulation problem (CORP) by a fully event-triggered mechanism. In comparison with the existing approaches, the overall control law in this paper offers a few features. First, it is not only fully distributed but also directly implementable in a digital platform. Second, it applies to jointly connected switching networks (JCSNs), which can be disconnected at every time instant. Third, the control law only relies on the output instead of the state of the leader. Further, our approach strictly excludes the Zeno phenomenon. Our design is illustrated by a numerical example.
