This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of MagWear, a novel biomagnetism-based system that can accurately and inclusively monitor the heart rate and respiration rate of mobile users with diverse skin tones. MagWear's contributions are twofold. Firstly, we build a mathematical model that characterizes the magnetic coupling effect of blood flow under the influence of an external magnetic field. This model uncovers the variations in accuracy when monitoring vital signs among individuals. Secondly, leveraging insights derived from this mathematical model, we present a softwarehardware co-design that effectively handles the impact of human diversity on the performance of vital sign monitoring, pushing this generic solution one big step closer to real adoptions. We have implemented a prototype of MagWear on a two-layer PCB board and followed IRB protocols to conduct system evaluations. Our extensive experiments involving 30 volunteers demonstrate that MagWear achieves high monitoring accuracy with a mean percentage error (MPE) of 1.55% for heart rate and 1.79% for respiration rate. The head-to-head comparison with Apple Watch 8 further demonstrates MagWear's consistently high performance in different user conditions.
