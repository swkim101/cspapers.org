Masked face recognition is important for social good but challenged by diverse occlusions that cause insufficient or inaccurate representations. In this work, we propose a unified deep network to learn generative-to-discriminative representations for facilitating masked face recognition. To this end, we split the network into three modules and learn them on synthetic masked faces in a greedy module-wise pretraining manner. First, we leverage a generative encoder pretrained for face inpainting and finetune it to represent masked faces into category-aware descriptors. Attribute to the generative encoder's ability in recovering context information, the resulting descriptors can provide occlusion-robust representations for masked faces, mitigating the effect of diverse masks. Then, we incorporate a multi-layer convolutional network as a discriminative reformer and learn it to convert the category-aware descriptors into identity-aware vectors, where the learning is effectively supervised by distilling relation knowledge from off-the-shelf face recognition model. In this way, the discriminative reformer together with the generative encoder serves as the pretrained backbone, providing general and discriminative representations towards masked faces. Finally, we cascade one fully-connected layer following by one softmax layer into a feature classifier and finetune it to identify the reformed identity-aware vectors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing masked faces.
