Counterfactual reasoning in narratives requires 001 predicting how alternative conditions, contrary 002 to what actually happened, might have resulted 003 in different outcomes. One major challenge 004 is to maintain the causality between the coun-005 terfactual condition and the generated counter-006 factual outcome. In this paper, we propose a 007 basic VAE module for counterfactual reason-008 ing in narratives. We further introduce a pre-009 trained classifier and external event common-010 sense to mitigate the model collapse problem in 011 the VAE approach, and improve the causality 012 between the counterfactual condition and the 013 generated counterfactual outcome. We evaluate 014 our method on two public benchmarks. Experi-015 ments show that our method is effective. 016
