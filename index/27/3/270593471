With the digitalization of the rail transport operations control and management systems are also subject of transformation. The introduction of the Artificial Intelligence in the railway operations implies the appropriate control system architecture and management functionality. The paper presents an operation, administration, and maintenance (OAM) architecture that provides management services for both virtualized and physical railway functions. Some OAM use cases are discussed to derive the OAM architecture requirements. The management functionality is designed as Restful microservices. The state models of the management elements are used to represent and verify the management functionality.
