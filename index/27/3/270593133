This paper conducts a comparative study on optimizing power loss minimization in electrical power systems by strategically implementing Static VAR Compensator (SVC). The primary focus is on leveraging SVCs to dynamically regulate reactive power, aiming to optimize the overall system operation with the specific goal of minimizing power losses. Through the application of mathematical optimization methodologies, the research aims to identify highly effective deployment strategies for SVCs, ultimately achieving significant reductions in power losses within the network. Second-order cone programming (SOCP) based AC Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) has been used to solve the optimization problem. Static Var Compensator (SVC) is connected to the IEEE 14 bus test power system at different buses to improve voltage profile and minimizing power loss. The findings, obtained through rigorous simulation and analysis, contribute valuable insights into the enhancement of efficiency and performance in power systems. The sensible utilization of SVCs for optimal power loss minimization emerges as a key focal point, encapsulating the primary objectives and outcomes of the study and shedding light on the pursuit of heightened energy efficiency in power systems.
