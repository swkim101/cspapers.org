This paper presents a solution of the selective harmonic elimination problem in multilevel converters based on an analytical formula. Three phase l-level cascaded H-bridges (CHB) inverters with l = 2s + 1, s = 2n number of both dc sources and switching angles are considered to delete n harmonics, arbitrarily chosen, and their multiple from output voltage waveform, imposing the amplitude of the fundamental harmonic. The procedure calculates the unknown switching angles depending on modulation index.
