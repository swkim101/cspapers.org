This paper presents a study on the control of a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) using a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller based on a second-order Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) model in its regression form. The objective is to achieve an optimal control of the CSTR system by leveraging the capabilities of the NARX model and the PI controller. The proposed approach is validated through simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness in regulating the CSTR reactor.
