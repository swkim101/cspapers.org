Data analytics applications today often require processing heterogeneous data from different data models, including relational, graph, and text data, for more holistic analytics. While query optimization for single data models, especially relational data, has been studied for decades, there is surprisingly little work on query optimization for cross-model data analytics. Cross-model query optimization can benefit from the long line of prior work in query optimization in the relational realm, wherein cost-based and/or machine learning-based (ML-based) optimizers are common. Both approaches require a large and diverse set of query workloads to measure, tune, and evaluate a query optimizer. To the best of our knowledge, there are still no large public cross-model benchmark workloads, a significant obstacle for systems researchers in this space. In this paper, we take a step toward filling this research gap by generating new query work-loads spanning relational and graph data, which are ubiquitous in analytics applications. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) via different prompting strategies to generate queries and proposes new rule-based post-processing methods to ensure query correctness. We evaluate the pros and cons of each strategy and perform an in-depth analysis by categorizing the syntactic and semantic errors of the generated queries. So far, we have produced over 4000 correct cross-model queries, the largest set ever. Our code, prompts, data, and query workloads will all be released publicly.
