Over time, the road freight transportation sector has become increasingly recognized as a primary contributor to carbon dioxide equivalent emissions due to its significant fuel utilization. Within the context of sustainable development, the Green Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP) has been subject to extensive investigation, focusing on strategic route optimization aimed at minimizing emissions within the view of third-party logistics. This inquiry delves into the Emission Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP), an extension of the GVRP, conceived to concurrently minimize both the distance traversed and the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions generated by a fleet of vehicles. To address emissions in transportation route planning, it is imperative to have a thorough understanding of vehicle emission models and to formulate a comprehensive mathematical model tailored to this environmental optimization challenge. Our analysis concludes that variables such as speed, load, and distance significantly influence emission fluctuations.
