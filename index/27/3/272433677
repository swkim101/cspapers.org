Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized numerous application domains with their unparalleled performance. As the models become larger and more complex, hardware DNN accelerators are increasingly popular. Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based DNN accelerators offer near-Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) efficiency and exceptional flexibility, establishing them as one of the primary hardware platforms for rapidly evolving deep learning implementations, particularly on edge devices. This prominence renders them lucrative targets for attackers. Existing attacks aimed at compromising the confidentiality of DNN models deployed on FPGA DNN accelerators often assume complete knowledge of the accelerators. However, this assumption does not hold for real-world, proprietary, high-performance FPGA DNN accelerators. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive and effective reverse-engineering methodology for demystifying FPGA DNN accelerator soft Intellectual Property (IP) cores. We demonstrate its application on the cutting-edge AMD-Xilinx Deep Learning Processing Unit (DPU). Our method relies on schematic analysis and, innovatively, electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis to reveal the data flow and scheduling of the DNN accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first successful endeavor to reverse-engineer a commercial encrypted DNN accelerator IP. Moreover, we investigate attack surfaces exposed by the reverse-engineering findings, including the successful recovery of DNN model architectures and extraction of model parameters. These outcomes pose a significant threat to real-world commercial FPGA-DNN acceleration systems. We discuss potential countermeasures and offer recommendations for FPGA-based IP protection.
