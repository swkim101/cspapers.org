The swift detection of multimedia fake news 001 has emerged as a crucial task in combating ma-002 licious propaganda and safeguarding the secu-003 rity of the online environment. While existing 004 methods have achieved commendable results 005 in modeling entity-level inconsistency, address-006 ing event-level inconsistency following the in-007 herent subject-predicate logic of news and ro-008 bustly learning news representations from poor-009 quality news samples remain two challenges. In 010 this paper, we propose an Event -d R iven f A ke 011 news D etection fr A mewo R k (Event-Radar) 012 based on multi-view learning, which integrates 013 visual manipulation, textual emotion and mul-014 timodal inconsistency at event-level for fake 015 news detection. Specifically, leveraging the 016 capability of graph structures to capture inter-017 actions between events and parameters, Event-018 Radar captures event-level multimodal incon-019 sistency by constructing an event graph that 020 includes multimodal entity subject-predicate 021 logic. Additionally, to mitigate the interference 022 of poor-quality news, Event-Radar introduces 023 a multi-view fusion mechanism, learning com-024 prehensive and robust representations by com-025 puting the credibility of each view as a clue, 026 thereby detecting fake news. Extensive experi-027 ments demonstrate that Event-Radar achieves 028 outstanding performance on three large-scale 029 fake news detection benchmarks. Our studies 030 also confirm that Event-Radar exhibits strong 031 robustness, providing a paradigm for detecting 032 fake news from noisy news samples. 033
