Cross-prompt automated essay scoring (AES), an under-investigated but challenging task that has gained increasing popularity in the AES community, aims to train an AES system that can generalize well to prompts that are un-seen during model training. While recently-developed cross-prompt AES models have combined essay representations that are learned via sophisticated neural architectures with so-called prompt-independent features, an intriguing question is: are complex neural models needed to achieve state-of-the-art results? We answer this question by abandoning sophisticated neural architectures and developing a purely feature-based approach to cross-prompt AES that adopts a simple neural architecture. Experiments on the ASAP dataset demonstrate that our simple approach to cross-prompt AES can achieve state-of-the-art results.
