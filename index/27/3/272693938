Fact-checking data claims requires data evidence retrieval and analysis, which can become tedious and intractable when done manually. This work presents Aletheia, an automated fact-checking prototype designed to facilitate data claims verification and enhance data evidence communication. For verification, we utilize a pre-trained LLM to parse the semantics for evidence retrieval. To effectively communicate the data evidence, we design representations in two forms: data tables and visualizations, tailored to various data fact types. Additionally, we design interactions that showcase a real-world application of these techniques. We evaluate the performance of two core NLP tasks with a curated dataset comprising 400 data claims and compare the two representation forms regarding viewers' assessment time, confidence, and preference via a user study with 20 participants. The evaluation offers insights into the feasibility and bottlenecks of using LLMs for data fact-checking tasks, potential advantages and disadvantages of using visualizations over data tables, and design recommendations for presenting data evidence.
