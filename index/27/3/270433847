The present work describes the ADEQUATe platform: a framework to monitor the quality of (Governmental) Open Data catalogs, to re-publish improved and linked versions of the datasets and their respective metadata descriptions, and to include the community in the quality improvement process. The information acquired by the linking and (meta)data improvement steps is then integrated in a semantic search engine. In the paper, we first describe the requirements of the platform, which are based on focus group interviews and a web-based survey. Second, we use these requirements to formulate the goals and show the architecture of the overall platform, and third, we showcase the potential and relevance of the platform to resolve the requirements by describing exemplary user journeys exploring the system. The platform is available at: https://www.adequate.at/
