This paper proposes an innovative Dynamic Principal Component Analysis (DPCA) scheme to perform fault detection and identification (FDI) for systems affected by process faults. In this scheme, a new modeling method is proposed to fix the data lag and the number of principal components to retain. A new structuration method is introduced to identify the process fault. It is based on the computation of common angles between residual subspaces of different modes. This structuration yields a concise set of detection indices, specifically sensitive to certain process faults while remaining unsensitive to others. The proposed FDI scheme is successfully applied to a three tank affected by several process faults.
