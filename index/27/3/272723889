Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection plays a crucial role in visual scene comprehension. In recent advancements, two-stage detectors have taken a prominent position. However, they are encumbered by two primary challenges. First, the misalignment between feature representation and relation reasoning gives rise to a deficiency in discrimi-native features crucial for interaction detection. Second, due to sparse annotation, the second-stage interaction head generates numerous candidate pairs, with only a small fraction receiving supervision. Towards these issues, we propose a hybrid learning method based on pose-aware HOI feature refinement. Specifically, we de-vise pose-aware feature refinement that encodes spatial fea-tures by considering human body pose characteristics. It can direct attention towards key regions, ultimately offering a wealth of fine-grained features imperative for HOI de-tection. Further, we introduce a hybrid learning method that combines HOI triplets with probabilistic soft labels supervision, which is regenerated from decoupled verb-object pairs. This method explores the implicit connections between the interactions, enhancing model generalization without requiring additional data. Our method establishes state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET benchmark and excels notably in detecting rare HOIs.
