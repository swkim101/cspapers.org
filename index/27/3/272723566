Previous advances in vehicle re-identification (ReID) are mostly reported under favorable lighting conditions, while cross-day-and-night performance is neglected, which greatly hinders the development of related traffic intelli-gence applications. This work instead develops a novel Day-Night Dual-domain Modulation (DNDM) vehicle re-identification framework for day-night cross-domain traf-fic scenarios. Specifically, a unique night-domain glare suppression module is provided to attenuate the headlight glare from raw nighttime vehicle images. To enhance ve-hicle features under low-light environments, we propose a dual-domain structure enhancement module in the feature extractor, which enhances geometric structures between ap-pearance features. To alleviate day-night domain discrep-ancies, we develop a cross-domain class awareness mod-ule that facilitates the interaction between appearance and structure features in both domains. In this work, we ad-dress the Day-Night cross-domain ReID (DN-ReID) prob-lem and provide a new cross-domain dataset named DN-Wild, including day and night images of 2,286 identities, giving in total 85,945 daytime images and 54,952 nighttime images. Furthermore, we also take into account the mat-ter of balance between day and night samples, and provide a dataset called DN-348. Exhaustive experiments demon-strate the robustness of the proposed framework in the DN-ReID problem. The code and benchmark are released at https://github.com/chenjingong/DN-ReID.
