Many organizations need to deal with distributed, preexisting, heterogeneous, and autonomous databases. They need ways to have evolutionary database expansion to promote data sharing among users and applications, and easier application development. This requires a technology that provides selective and controlled integration of such databases. Federated database systems can provide different levels of integration, with different implications on the degree of control and the preservation of autonomy of the individual database systems.
