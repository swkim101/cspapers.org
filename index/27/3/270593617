This paper investigates the attitude control problem for spacecraft attitude maneuvers under constrains and also subject to actuator faults and saturation. Firstly, based on the 3-dimensional Special Orthogonal Group, a second-order fully-actuated system described by exponential coordinates is constructed. Then, a barrier Lyapunov function is proposed to satisfy the condition of attitude constrains. Finally, a terminal sliding-mode control method is applied to design the final control law while the Nussbaum-type function is used to address the unknown time-varying gains aroused by actuator faults and saturation. By using Lyapunov stability approach, the convergence of state errors and the stability of the closed-loop system are analysed accordingly. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented control scheme is validated through a numerical simulation.
