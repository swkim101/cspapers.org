In this study, a new AI-based model has been proposed for electric vehicle battery state of health estimation. Our approach relies on the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes into account not only voltage, current, and state of charge (SoC), but also other characteristics such as ampere-hours and their derivatives, as well as SoC and its derivative. We perform a comparison study between two models that use different datasets for training. This comparative analysis aims to assess the effect of different input variables on the learning modelâ€™s accuracy in predicting battery health.
