This Radio Frequency (RF) source location estimation scheme utilizes angles of arrival of a signal source acquired from the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. In reliance on that as a Maximum Likelihood estimation, the obtained angles are augmented to an adaptive probability distribution function (PDF), which is then employed to estimate the location of the RF emitter by feeding the PDF to an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Numerous use cases and theoretical works have been presented in the literature. Some of these papers mention applications regarding implementing DoA algorithms in dynamic platforms like in [9], [10], [11], [12], and [13] mostly all of them use Uniform Linear Array (ULA), four of them working with Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT), and one with MUSIC Direction of Arrival (DoA) method. In [14], MUSIC was used with a Uniform Circular Array (UCA). However, less coupling has been incorporated with the covariance of measurement error. In this paper, the dynamic 2D DoA MUSIC algorithm used in a platform, applied together with an EKF estimation and coupled with measurement covariance in a simulation environment to precisely locate an RF emitter and provide high-resolution Line-of-Sight (LOS).
