This study presents the design and simulation of an RF MEMS variable capacitor with a high tuning ratio and high linearity factor of capacitanceâ€“voltage response. An electrostatic torsion actuator with planar and non-planar structures is presented to obtain the high tuning ratio by avoiding the occurrence of pull-in point. In the proposed design, the capacitor plate is connected to the electrostatic actuators by using the s-shaped beam. The proposed design shows a 138% tuning ratio with the planar structure of the actuator and 167% tuning ratio by implementing the non-planar structure. A linearity factor of 99% is attained by adjusting the rates at which the capacitor plate rises as the actuation voltage increases and the rate at which the capacitance decreases as the plate rises. Parametric optimization of the design is performed by utilizing the finite element method (FEM) analysis and high-frequency structural simulator (HFSS) analysis to obtain an optimized high-tuning ratio RF MEMS varactor at low actuation voltage. S-parameters of the design are presented on HFSS, with a 50 ohm coplanar waveguide (CPW) serving as the transmission line. The proposed RF MEMS varactor can be utilized in tunable RF devices.
