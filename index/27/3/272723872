Various applications require high-fidelity and artifact free 3D human reconstructions. However, current implicit function-based methods inevitably produce artifacts while existing deformation methods are difficult to reconstruct high-fidelity humans wearing loose clothing. In this paper, we propose a two-stage deformation method named Vertex Shift (VS) for reconstructing clothed 3D humans from single images. Specifically, VS first stretches the estimated SMPL-X mesh into a coarse 3D human model using shift fields inferred from normal maps, then refines the coarse 3D human model into a detailed 3D human model via a graph convolutional network embedded with implicit-function-learned features. This “stretch-refine” strategy addresses large deformations required for reconstructing loose clothing and delicate deformations for recovering intricate and detailed surfaces, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions that faithfully convey the pose, clothing, and surface details from the input images. The graph convolutional network's ability to exploit neighborhood vertices coupled with the advantages inherited from the deformation methods ensure VS rarely produces artifacts like distortions and non-human shapes and never produces artifacts like holes, broken parts, and dismembered limbs. As a result, VS can reconstruct highfidelity and artifact-less clothed 3D humans from single images, even under scenarios of challenging poses and loose clothing. Experimental results on three benchmarks and two in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that VS significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.
