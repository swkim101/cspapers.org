Nanoscale oxides grown in c-silicon, implanted with low-energy (2 keV) H+ ions and fluences ranging from 1013 cm−2 to 1015 cm−2 by RF plasma immersion implantation (PII), have been investigated. The oxidation of the implanted Si layers proceeded in dry O2 at temperatures of 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C. The optical characterization of the formed Si/SiOx structures was conducted by electroreflectance (ER) and spectroscopic ellipsometric (SE) measurements. From the ER and SE spectra analysis, the characteristic energy bands of direct electron transitions in Si are elaborated. The stress in dependence on hydrogenation conditions is considered and related to the energy shifts of the Si interband transitions around 3.4 eV. Silicon oxides, grown on PII Si at a low H+ fluence, have a non-stoichiometric nature, as revealed by IR-SE spectra analysis, while with an increasing H+ fluence in the PII Si substrates and/or the subsequent oxidation temperature the stoichiometric Si-O4 units in the oxides become predominant. The development of surface morphology is studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Oxidation of the H+-implanted Si surface region flattens out the surface pits created on the Si surface by H+ implants. Based on the evaluation of the texture index and mean fractal dimension, the isotropic and self-similar character of the studied surfaces is emphasized.
