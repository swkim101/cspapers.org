Generally aircraft cabin receives translational accelerations in 3 axes and rotational accelerations around 3 axes during flight. Those translational and rotational accelerations generate uncomfortable movements and vibrations of aircraft. The purpose of the present study is to realize a sway-free cabin inside the aircraft. In order to realize sway-free cabin, fundamental data of the commercial jet transport have been measured and analyzed. The results show that pitch angle of jet transport varies from â€“4 degrees to 30 degrees against to local horizon, maximum angular velocity is 0.25 rad/s in pitching motion, and maximum acceleration is 4.65 m/s2 in z axis. To realize sway-free cabin, motions of aircraft are divided into two motions of angular motions and translational motions. Angular motions can be solved by using gimbal mechanism. For translational motions horizontal and lateral motions can be dumped by just like air caster. However, vertical motion needs special treatment. In the present study to compensate vertical motion of sway-free cabin special equipment has been newly proposed. The equipment moves in order to compensate vertical motion of sway-free cabin.Also Mat lab analysis has been conducted to make sure the block diagram of the mechanism of compensation of vertical motion of sway-free cabin. The results show proposed special equipment and the mechanism of compensation of vertical motion of sway-free cabin can work well to realize sway-free cabin.
