this paper presents a new PID control method for MIMO coupled systems based on the MIMO-ARX Laguerre model. This latter is obtained by expanding each polynomial function of the classical ARX MIMO model associated to the inputs and the outputs on independent Laguerre bases. The characteristic pole of which is estimated by minimizing the mean square error, where the gradient algorithm is applied. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control technique.
