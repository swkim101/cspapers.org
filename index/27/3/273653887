Sonar radar captures visual representations of underwater objects and structures using sound wave reflections, making it essential for exploration, mapping, and continuous surveillance in wild ecosystems. Real-time analysis of sonar data is crucial for time-sensitive applications, including environmental anomaly detection and in-season fishery management, where rapid decision-making is needed. However, the lack of both relevant datasets and pre-trained DNN models, coupled with resource limitations in wild environments, hinders the effective deployment and continuous operation of live sonar analytics. We present SALINA, a sustainable live sonar analytics system designed to address these challenges. SALINA enables real-time processing of acoustic sonar data with spatial and temporal adaptations, and features energy-efficient operation through a robust energy management module. Deployed for six months at two inland rivers in British Columbia, Canada, SALINA provided continuous 24/7 underwater monitoring, supporting fishery stewardship and wildlife restoration efforts. Through extensive real-world testing, SALINA demonstrated an up to 9.5% improvement in average precision and a 10.1% increase in tracking metrics. The energy management module successfully handled extreme weather, preventing outages and reducing contingency costs. These results offer valuable insights for long-term deployment of acoustic data systems in the wild.
