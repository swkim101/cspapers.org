Aluminium and its composites are widely used in production to enhance the strength of lightweight objects. In this study, an AA7075/SiC composite was fabricated using a stir casting route. Multi-objective optimization and finite element analysis were performed with various process parameters on a manufactured aluminium composite (AA7075 + SiC) undergoing a laser beam welding process. Four welding parameters, i.e., pulse frequency, power, welding speed (transverse), and wire size were taken for laser welding as per the L-9 orthogonal array for experimental study. Tensile strength, deflection, temperature distribution, Rockwell hardness (fusion zone), and Rockwell hardness (heat affected zone) were taken as output parameters after welding. The standard deviation objective weightingâ€“grey relational optimization method optimized the process parameter. ANSYS APDL 23 software was utilized to simulate the entire laser welding method with a cylindrical heat source to predict the temperature distribution in the butt-welded plates. This software uses finite element analysis and gives a deviation of only 5.85% for temperature distribution with experimental results. This study helps to understand the effect of various parameters on the welding strength of the aluminium composite.
