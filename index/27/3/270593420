To solve a differential multi-agent pursuit-evasion game in which a pursuer tries to catch many evaders, this study presents an improved graphical Voronoï method. Trying to capture every evader within a reasonable amount of time is the aim of the game. Based on the Voronoï graph technique, the pursuer recognises the existence of an evader in the vicinity and proceeds in that direction. The evader’s cell surface area decreases as the pursuit goes on since the players are in a limited environment. This study shows the universality of the proposed approach to graphically solving multi-agent pursuit-evasion games. A small number of robots have been used in previous works to tackle the pursuer-evader game, which may not accurately reflect the applicability of these strategies. Interestingly, the suggested approach focuses on multi-agent games, whereas the earlier research is restricted to the quantity of pursuers and evaders.
