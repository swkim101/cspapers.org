With the advent of ensemble-based attacks, the transfer-ability of generated adversarial examples is elevated by a noticeable margin despite many methods only employing superficial integration yet ignoring the diversity between ensemble models. However, most of them compromise the latent value of the diversity between generated perturbation from distinct models which we argue is also able to increase the adversarial transferability, especially heterogeneous at-tacks. To address the issues, we propose a novel method of Stochastic Mini-batch black-box attack with Ensemble Reweighing using reinforcement learning (SMER) to produce highly transferable adversarial examples. We emphasize the diversity between surrogate models achieving indi-vidual perturbation iteratively. In order to customize the individual effect between surrogates, ensemble reweighing is introduced to refine ensemble weights by maximizing attack loss based on reinforcement learning which functions on the ultimate transferability elevation. Extensive exper-iments demonstrate our superiority to recent ensemble at-tacks with a significant margin across different black-box attack scenarios, especially on heterogeneous conditions. https://github.com/tangbwb/SMER
