Fine-grained monitoring is crucial for multiple data-driven tasks such as debugging, provisioning, and securing networks. Yet, practical constraints in collecting, extracting, and storing data often force operators to use coarse-grained sampled monitoring, degrading the performance of the various tasks. In this work, we explore the feasibility of leveraging the correlations among coarse-grained time series to impute their fine-grained counterparts in software. We present Zoom2Net, a transformer-based model for network imputation that incorporates domain knowledge through operational and measurement constraints, ensuring that the imputed network telemetry time series are not only realistic but align with existing measurements. This approach enhances the capabilities of current monitoring infrastructures, allowing operators to gain more insights into system behaviors without the need for hardware upgrades. We evaluate Zoom2Net on four diverse datasets ( e.g., cloud telemetry and Internet data transfer) and use cases ( e.g., bursts analysis and traffic classification). We demonstrate that Zoom2Net consistently achieves high imputation accuracy with a zoom-in factor of up to 100 and performs better on downstream tasks compared to baselines by an average of 38%.
