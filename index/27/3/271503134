Automated induction is a powerful method for the validation of

 critical systems. However, the inductive proof process faces major

 challenges: it is undecidable and diverges even with small examples.



 Previous methods have proposed ad-hoc heuristics to speculate on

 additional lemmas that hopefully stop the divergence. Although these

 methods have succeeded in proving interesting theorems, they have

 significant limitations: in particular, they often fail to find

 appropriate lemmas, and the lemmas they provide may not be valid.



 We present a new method that allows us to perform inductive proofs

 in conditional theories. This method automatically detects

 divergence in proof traces and derives primal grammars as well as

 new lemmas that schematize the divergent sequence. This new

 construction allows us to break the divergence and complete the

 proof.



 Our method is presented as a set of inference rules whose soundness

 and refutational completeness have been formally proved. Unlike

 previous methods, our method is fully automated and has no risk of

 over-generalization. Moreover, our technique for capturing and

 schematizing divergence represents the most general decidable

 schematization, with respect to description power, among all known

 schematizations.



 Our method has been implemented in C++ and successfully proved

 over fifty complex examples that fail with well-known theorem

 provers (e.g., ACL2, Isabelle, PVS, SPIKE) and related methods for

 handling divergence in proofs by induction.



 Our method represents a significant contribution to the field of

 automated reasoning as it can be integrated with existing automated

 and interactive inductive proof systems to enhance their

 performance. Moreover, it has the potential to substantially reduce

 the time needed for the verification of critical systems.
