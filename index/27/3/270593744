Passive silencers are commonly utilized to mitigate fan noise within heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Traditional approaches often rely on analytical techniques and design curves to forecast the noise reduction of standard rectangular and circular silencers. However, recent advancements in numerical methodologies, particularly the application of the finite element method (FEM) in acoustic domains, have introduced more precise analysis tools. These innovations enable the prediction of passive silencer acoustic performance with greater accuracy and facilitate the exploration of unconventional silencer geometries.In this study, we employ the finite element method to forecast the sound transmission loss of both a prismatic and an elbow dissipative silencer with a rectangular cross-section. Furthermore, we apply a design of experiment method to conduct a parametric analysis of the rectangular silencer. This approach allows us to identify the most influential design parameters and assess their impact on the transmission loss across different octave bands.
