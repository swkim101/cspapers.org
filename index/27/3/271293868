Surface reconstruction for point clouds is an important task in 3D computer vision. Most of the latest methods resolve this problem by learning signed distance functions (SDF) from point clouds, which are limited to reconstructing shapes or scenes with closed surfaces. Some other methods tried to represent shapes or scenes with open surfaces using unsigned distance functions (UDF) which are learned from large scale ground truth unsigned distances. However, the learned UDF is hard to provide smooth distance ﬁelds near the surface due to the non-continuous character of point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel method to learn consistency-aware unsigned distance functions directly from raw point clouds. We achieve this by learning to move 3D queries to reach the surface with a ﬁeld consistency constraint, where we also enable to progressively estimate a more accurate surface. Speciﬁcally, we train a neural network to gradually infer the relationship between 3D queries and the approximated surface by searching for the moving target of queries in a dynamic way, which results in a consistent ﬁeld around the surface. Meanwhile, we introduce a polygonization algorithm to extract surfaces directly from the gradient ﬁeld of the learned UDF. The experimental results in surface reconstruction for synthetic and real scan data show signiﬁcant improvements over the state-of-the-art under the widely used benchmarks. Project page
