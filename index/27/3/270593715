In this paper, a functional filter for a category of linear delayed singular system with unknown input is developed directly in the frequency domain. The constant time delay is present in both state and input vectors. An unknown input is also considered in the state equation and a bounded disturbance vector should acts in both dynamic and output equations. The proposed approach estimates both an unknown input and a functional state independently from the delay time in frequency domain. Our solution is based on polynomial approach using MFD tools. To prove the efficiency of our proposed algorithm, we give a numerical example.
