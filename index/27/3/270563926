Obtaining high-quality machine translations is still a long way off. A post-editing phase is required to improve the output of a machine translation system. An alternative is the so called computer-assisted translation. In this framework, a human translator interacts with the system in order to obtain high-quality translations. A statistical phrase-based approach to computer-assisted translation is described in this article. A new decoder algorithm for interactive search is also presented, that combines monotone and non-monotone search. The system has been assessed in the Trans Type-2 project for the translation of several printer manuals, from (to) English to (from) Spanish, German and French.
