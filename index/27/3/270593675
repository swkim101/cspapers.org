Remote work has been an integral part of business strategies across the globe since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though business operations and work functions have returned to their usual modes, remote access to business intelligence remains a crucial part of business operations, particularly in the manufacturing sector, allowing top executives and key decision makers to view real-time scenarios related to manufacturing operations and supply chains. Maintenance is another aspect of business operation that is of particular importance to the manufacturing industry, where critical equipment downtime could translate to significant economic losses. Through digital transformation, manufacturing companies can tap into technologies such as cloud computing, IoT (Internet of Things), and AI (artificial intelligence) to allow for more seamless monitoring of operating parameters and enable proactive approaches to equipment maintenance and reliability, thus ensuring continuous and efficient plant operations.
