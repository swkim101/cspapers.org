It is well known that the dependability of equipment on a production site is strongly linked to the quality of maintenance operations. This paper explores the state of the art in obsolescence management during the crucial maintenance phase and in the context of circular economy principles. Through a systematic review of the literature, the study investigates strategies and methodologies employed to address equipment obsolescence while embracing principles of sustainability and resource efficiency. The research methodology involves defining and combining relevant keywords, utilizing research databases, and implementing filters to obtain a comprehensive selection of pertinent articles. Content analysis reveals insights into the distribution of articles across different categories and time periods, highlighting evolving scholarly interest in these topics. Various approaches to obsolescence management in maintenance are identified, including traditional replacement methods, remanufacturing, and system complexity reduction. Case studies provide practical insights into the application of these strategies, demonstrating their effectiveness in extending asset lifespans and optimizing maintenance practices. Furthermore, the integration of circular economy principles into maintenance strategies presents opportunities for enhancing sustainability and resource efficiency in asset management practices. The findings underscore the importance of continued research in this area to control costs and improve availability over the entire life cycle of equipment.
