The article deals with the properties of the residual fault filter when applying this structure to the class of linear continuous systems with dynamics specified by the system matrix ostensible Metzler structure. The proposed solution is reduced to the use of a diagonal stabilization of the state observer and uses the stable form of the Metzler matrix decomposition. Moreover, a problem parameterization of such residual fault filters is solved by adapting the task to the incomplete positivity of the structure of such systems. The proposed approach creates a unified framework that covers the compactness of the parametric constraints of the Metzler matrix, the structurally constrained state of the observer and its quadratic stability. Due to the complexity of such constraints, the design conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an example is given to show the superiority and practicality of the proposed fault detection scheme.
