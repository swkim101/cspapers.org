Servo actuated mechanisms are recurrent for learning and training in low cost robotics. This research addresses the objective of speed tracking control (velocity tracking) in a velocity servo model, taking into account the challenge of parametric uncertainty in the model. To tackle this issue, a smooth adaptive controller is proposed and investigated. The analysis of the resulting nonlinear error model is performed via Lyapunovâ€™s direct method to show stability and control objective achievement globally.
