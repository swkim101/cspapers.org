In this paper, a combination of fractional order control and a classical vector control scheme is proposed to drive the PMSM speed. The new proposed control scheme with fractional order property is based on IMC structure which is known for its robustness to modelling error and Bode’s ideal transfer function chosen as the reference model which exhibits iso-damping property. Simulation results show that the proposed control scheme tracks the PMSM speed at specified values and compensates the effect of load torque. Moreover, the time constant and fractional order of the Bode’s ideal transfer function can be used as tuning parameters to improve the PMSM speed and current responses.
