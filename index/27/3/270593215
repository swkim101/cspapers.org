Quantum mechanics is the revolution in thinking of the 20th century and will be the revolution in various applications in the 21st century. The world's powers-that-be each have their own particular or common quantum plans to access these new technologies. Indeed, emerging quantum computing technologies are poised to replace classical binary logic. The development of new integrated operators, on subatomic circuits, will benefit from an exponential reduction in size, power consumption and fantastic computing capacity. Indeed, the quantum circuit is proving day by day a very high level of numerical computation disrupting communication, encryption and modelling algorithms. However, what about the reversibility of quantum operators in order to adapt them to our already widely used classical computers?Current design flows will be challenged at various levels both in terms of computer-aided design (CAD) methods and in all major aspects of quantum computing circuit design, including logic synthesis, simulation, verification and testing. On the other hand, quantum technology remains dependent on access to integrated photonics and probably on the integration of algorithms in hyper-flexible photon electron hardware. Our paper intends to present the possibility of designing classical operators based on quantum operators in order to explain and explore the mixed Qbit-Bit Using the IBM simulator, to analyse their functions, to design new electronic functions and to implement them in quantum circuits.
