The relatively recent public release of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems has ignited a significant leap in awareness of the capabilities of AI. In parallel, there has been a recognition of AI system limitations and the bias inherent in systems created by humans. Expectations are rising for more trustworthy, human-centered, and responsible software connecting humans to powerful systems that augment their abilities. There are decades of practice designing systems that work with, and for humans, that we can build upon to face the new challenges and opportunities brought by dynamic AI systems.
