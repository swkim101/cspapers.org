Nested Named Entity Recognition (Nested 001 NER) entails identifying and classifying en-002 tity spans within the text, including the de-003 tection of named entities that are embedded 004 within external entities. Prior approaches pri-005 marily employ span-based techniques, utiliz-006 ing the power of exhaustive searches to ad-007 dress the challenge of overlapping entities. 008 Nonetheless, these methods often grapple with 009 the absence of explicit guidance for bound-010 ary detection, resulting insensitivity in discern-011 ing minor variations within nested spans. To 012 this end, we propose a Boundary-aware Se-013 mantic Differentiation and Filtration Network 014 (DiFiNet) tailored for nested NER. Specifically, 015 DiFiNet leverages a biaffine attention mech-016 anism to generate a span representation ma-017 trix. This matrix undergoes further refinement 018 through a self-adaptive semantic differentiation 019 module, specifically engineered to discern se-020 mantic variances across spans. Furthermore, 021 DiFiNet integrates a boundary filtration mod-022 ule, designed to mitigate the impact of non-023 entity noise by leveraging semantic relations 024 among spans. Extensive experiments on three 025 benchmark datasets demonstrate our model 026 yields a new state-of-the-art performance 1 . 027
