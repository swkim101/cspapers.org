In our paper we explore how users consider security and privacy in light of third-party API access to their Google accounts given the disclosure and control mechanisms currently available. First, we surveyed n = 432 participants to recall the last times they used Google SSO or authorized a third-party app access to their Google account data. We then invited n = 214 participants from the first survey to return for a follow-up survey. As part of this second survey, participants installed a browser extension that parsed entries in their Google accountâ€™s "Apps with access to your account" dash-board. In our archive we make available functional artifacts that can be used to reproduce our qualitative and quantitative study results. The artifact includes the custom survey and browser extension software we developed for this study along with detailed instructions on how to deploy this software. A single PC, Mac, or Linux machine should be sufficient hardware. Software requirements include Docker, RStudio, and a Chrome or Firefox web browser. The artifact can be evaluated by running the survey software in a docker container, loading the browser extension in a web browser, running the R-programming files, and evaluating the qualitative coding results.
