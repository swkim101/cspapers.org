Research on understanding and generating di-001 agrams has used vision models such as CLIP. 002 However, it remains unclear whether these mod-003 els accurately identify diagram attributes, such 004 as node colors and shapes, along with edge 005 colors and connection patterns. This study eval-006 uates how well vision models recognize the 007 diagram attributes by probing the model and 008 retrieving diagrams using text queries. Exper-009 imental results showed that while vision mod-010 els can recognize differences in node colors, 011 shapes, and edge colors, they struggle to iden-012 tify differences in edge connection patterns that 013 play a pivotal role in the semantics of diagrams. 014 Moreover, we revealed inadequate alignment 015 between diagram attributes and language repre-016 sentations in the embedding space. 017
