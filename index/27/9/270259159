With faster wireless networks and server GPUs, offloading high-accuracy but compute-intensive AR tasks implemented in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to edge servers offers a promising way to support high-QoE Augmented/Mixed Reality (AR/MR) applications. A cost-effective way for AR app vendors to deploy such edge-assisted AR apps to support a large user base is to use commercial Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) deployed at the edge cloud. To maximize cost-effectiveness, such an MLaaS provider faces a key design challenge, i.e., how to maximize the number of clients concurrently served by each GPU server in its cluster while meeting per-client AR task accuracy SLAs. The above AR offloading inference serving problem differs from generic inference serving or video analytics serving in one fundamental way: due to the use of local tracking which reuses the last server-returned inference result to derive results for the current frame, the offloading frequency and end-to-end latency of each AR client directly affect its AR task accuracy (for all the frames). In this paper, we present ARISE, a framework that optimizes the edge server capacity in serving edge-assisted AR clients. Our design exploits the intricate interplay between per-client offloading schedule and batched inference on the server via proactively coordinating offloading request streams from different AR clients. Our evaluation using a large set of emulated AR clients and a 10-phone testbed shows that ARISE supports 1.7x--6.9x more clients compared to various baselines while keeping the per-client accuracy within the client-specified accuracy SLAs.
