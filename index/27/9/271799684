We propose the method to adapt humanoids the ability to change the body structures that modular robots have by using Attach-Lock-Detachable Magnetic Couplings(ALDMag) to give the ability to detach and attach the robot body with an arm-type robot, and the system to manage the connection state of modularized body elements. Robots and we can use the ALDMag to attach and detach mechanical and electrical connections without actuators. Using xacro for writing the file of the robot model description of each module, we can construct a system that allows the robot to attach and detach modules during task operation. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving assembly experiments of a small robot with a life-size arm and experiments with environmental contacts by the small robot.
