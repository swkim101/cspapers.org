The determination of the dynamic properties of a robot is especially important for designing highly accurate and efficient control systems. Conventional methods for dynamic model identification have proven to be effective, where deep learning (DL) approaches have shown limits due to data inefficiencies. However, thanks to novel physics-informed DL architectures, such as Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) [1], it is possible to control and extract interpretable physical information of a robot. This paper introduces an augmented DeLaN architecture for linear viscous and non-symmetrical Coulomb friction identification, which also learns motor parameters such as rotor inertia. An approach is proposed for comparing this method with the conventional dynamic identification and previous DeLaN implementations. Moreover, our friction and rotor inertia identification is validated, and the performance of our model is analyzed with a real robot (UR5e).
