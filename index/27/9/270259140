In order to achieve zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) in distributed mobile scenarios, we propose a two-stage multi-prover ZKP framework. Our method utilizes secure multi-party computation (MPC), which has advantages such as flexible adaptation, stable performance, and fewer restrictions compared to existing solutions. In addition, based on the properties of cyclic groups, we optimize secure multi-party summation, improving the balance between security and efficiency, as well as transferability of the algorithm.
