The aging population and diminishing working population in agriculture motivate the development of autonomous harvesting robots. Although autonomous harvesting is expanding rapidly, the commercial application of sweet pepper harvesting robots still faces challenges. This paper presents the development of a sweet pepper harvesting robot and reports its experimental verification, which mainly includes end-effector design, visual perception, and grasping pose control. The end-effector adopts electrical control, mainly composed of a servo-electric two-finger parallel clamping module, a swing-cutting module, and a fruit recovery device. Equipped with a tactile sensor array, it can accurately sense the sweet pepper peduncle position and the end-effector state (harvesting failure) to complete the precise cutting. An end-effector grasping pose control algorithm of the manipulator is proposed, which can control the end-effector to grasp along the direction of the fruit peduncle and perpendicular to the tangent direction of the picking point by estimating the pose of the sweet pepper peduncle. Finally, the robot and proposed method were verified in a plant factory. The experimental findings demonstrate that the developed harvesting robot can complete robust detection of fruit peduncles and non-destructive picking of sweet pepper, with an average picking time of about 15 seconds.
