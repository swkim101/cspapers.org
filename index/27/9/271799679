When a mobile robot autonomously explores an indoor space to produce a localization and navigation map, it is important to create both a stable pose graph and a high-quality occupancy map that covers all the navigable areas. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic active loop closure framework which attempts to maximally reduce pose graph uncertainty during exploration and improves occupancy map quality. We calculate a probabilistic reward of getting a loop closure at any pose on a pose graph, which considers both how much pose graph uncertainty would be reduced by getting a loop closure there, and the robotâ€™s travel cost to navigate to that pose. By choosing poses that provide the largest rewards, we can maximally reduce pose graph uncertainty while avoiding long travel times. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through on-device testing in various floor plans.
