â€” This paper presents an ongoing project of designing and prototyping a multi-functional robotic cell for the fabrication of exterior retrofit panels. To address the cost and labor-intensive challenges in producing customized retrofit panels, we first conduct a simulation-based study to evaluate the feasibility of introducing robotic technologies into the fabrication process. Then, we design and propose a robotic cell that can fabricate these retrofit panels based on their specifications. The simulation results suggested that the robotics method can increase fabrication productivity by 60%. A prototype of this robotic cell has been established as a case study in Edmonton, Alberta, enabling the research team to perform further sim-to-real tests and conduct productivity analyses of the robotic fabrication process.
