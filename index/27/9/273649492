Ads are often designed visually, with images and videos conveying information. In this work, we study the accessibility of ads on the web to users of screen readers. We approach this in two ways: frst, we conducted a measurement and analysis of 90 websites over a month, collecting ads and auditing their behavior against a subset of best practices established by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Then, to put our measurement fndings in context, we interviewed 13 blind participants who navigate the web with a screen reader to understand their experiences with (in)accessible ads. We fnd that the overall web ad ecosystem is fairly inaccessible in multiple ways: many images are missing alt-text, unlabeled links make it confusing for folks to navigate, and closing ads can be tricky. But, there are straightforward ways to improve: because only a few large companies dominate the ad ecosystem, making small changes to the way they enforce accessibility standards can make a large diference.
