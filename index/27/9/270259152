We present the performance analysis of TCP CUBIC/BBR over V2V Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11ac). Our measurements focus on three static parking scenarios with different distances at the office area. The results reveal the impact of TCP CUBIC and BBR on data transfer time and TCP metrics. (i) There are two major reasons of fluctuated TCP throughput. The first reason is narrow available bandwidth over V2V Wi-Fi. The second reason is delayed TCP connection establishment due to delayed SYN+ACK and SYN packet retransmission. (ii) The bytes in-flight of TCP CUBIC are dynamically changed by packet retransmission events on V2V Wi-Fi. The loss-based congestion control is not promising the high throughput. We believe that our analysis results provide implications for efficient data transfer over V2V Wi-Fi.
