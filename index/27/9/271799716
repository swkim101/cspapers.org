In neurosurgery, soft robots have the potential to introduce significant benefits over traditional metal tools for their ability to safely interact with delicate tissues. In this paper, we introduce a proof-of-concept soft, capacitive origami sensing module (OSM) that can measure forces during neurosurgical retraction. Using origami-inspired design and fabrication principles, the OSM is easily folded and integrated within a soft robotic retractor that interacts with brain tissue to generate a surgical workspace upon actuation. We demonstrate the individual OSM signal response to forces and folding. We further characterize the OSM response within a fully-assembled soft robotic retractor to both folding and the application of forces over 0-5 N showing a 0.38 N average prediction error and resolution of 0.25 N. The sensing capability of the retractor is validated on an in-vitro model to demonstrate prediction errors of 0.06 N and the proposed operation during neurosurgery.
