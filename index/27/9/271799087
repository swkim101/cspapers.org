In this paper, we explain the Morphable StateNet as the StateNet with pseudo-generalized behaviors for robots with various degree-of-freedom arrangements and link lengths. Pseudo-generalization is performed by analytically calculating joint angles that satisfy the desired support conditions, focusing on link lengths and antigravity joints that contribute to motion, with constraints placed on the contact conditions between the environment and the robot body. We apply Morphable StateNet to the standing-up motion of humanoids with variable body structures and conduct evaluation experiments. We have demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed method in environments with low friction coefficients with the environment by conducting evaluations using both a simulator and an actual humanoid.
