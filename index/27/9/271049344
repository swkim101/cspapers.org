It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the exciting City of Las Vegas, home of WiNTECH 2011, the 6th ACM International Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental Evaluation and Characterization. This year's workshop continues the tradition of being co-located with MobiCom, the premier conference in wireless and computing. WiNTECH aims to bring together researchers working in the broad area of experimental wireless networking for discussing experimental aspects and results concerning wireless network testbeds, systems, and real-world deployments as well as the relevant assessment and tuning of methodologies. 
 
This year's program features a rich and well assembled mix of contributions, covering a broad range of wireless technologies and systems (e.g., WLAN, sensor networks, spectrum sensing, advanced antenna, and technologies), addressing experimental issues ranging from physical layer and medium access control up to routing and monitoring/tracking applications, and tackling the description of new experimental platforms as well as new methodological insights on widely-deployed wireless network testbeds. 
 
After a thorough reviewing process, with each paper assigned up to four independent technical program committee members for review and with two papers further assigned to a shepherd after the initial reviewing phase, 11 papers have been ultimately selected for presentation. These papers are authored by researchers spanning four continents (from USA, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Japan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia). The program is complemented by an invited talk and a number of demos and posters. Indeed, the demo session has always been the highlight of WiNTECH and we expect the same this year, with a number of demos showcasing novel research work and competing for the WiNCOOL demo award.
