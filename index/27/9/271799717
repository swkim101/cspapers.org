Traditional strength and conditioning training relies on the utilization of free weights, such as weighted implements, to elicit external stimuli. However, this approach poses a significant challenge when attempting to modify or adjust the loads within a single training set. This paper introduces an innovative method for achieving adjustable loads during resistance training by leveraging physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). The primary objective is to regulate targeted muscle activation through the use of Robo-Coach (robotic coach system). We first utilize a Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) to learn the motion of coach demonstration, which can be generalized for the trainees. The 3D path extracted from the generated trajectory is then projected onto a 2D plane with respect to the direction of the load. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid stiffness/position generator for online task execution. This generator determines the desired positions in the 2D plane according to the contact point displacements in the stimuli direction and, simultaneously, sets the desired stiffness based on the muscle activation feedback. Finally, the Robo-Coach is implemented with a variable impedance controller to achieve load-adjustable resistance training with the trainee. The biceps curl exercises were conducted and the results showed favorable performance, indicating the effectiveness of this approach.
