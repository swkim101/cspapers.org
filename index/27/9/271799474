We present the integration of a Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) with mobile robots for planning and decision making. NARS enables robots to effectively handle uncertainty in real-time with complete sensor and actuator integration, thereby ensuring adaptability to evolving scenarios. We discuss essential parts of the logic, the architecture and working principles of NARS, and the integration of NARS as a ROS node. A case study is provided demonstrating the systemâ€™s proficiency to carry out a garbage collection task in an open-air environment by operating a mobile robot with manipulator arm, and we demonstrate its ability to learn about the place-dependent accumulation of garbage items. Case study also reveals that our approach performs more effectively on the overall task than the Belief-Desire-Intention model we compared with.
