 This paper is devoted to finding the critical aesthetic feature parameters for controlling and determining a car’s aesthetic appearance. First, the car’s aesthetic features in markets were analyzed and represented with representative curves, in which the control parameters were taken as the critical aesthetic feature parameters to model and control the car’s virtual shapes. The survey data between the critical aesthetic feature parameters and the car’s aesthetic evaluation values described by five linguistic evaluation word pairs were collected through a questionnaire based on cars’ virtual models related to different values of such critical feature parameters. The aesthetic evaluation curves associated with the typical critical design parameters figured out through the curve-fitting approach demonstrate that the customers’ harmonious feeling for cars is positively correlated with the soft feature but negatively associated with the avant-garde feature. Customers often prioritize and favor cars with harmonious characteristics. The values of critical aesthetic design parameters proposed in this paper are beneficial in determining a car’s optimal aesthetic appearance.
