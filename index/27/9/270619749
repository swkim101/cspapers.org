Enhancing diverse human decision-making processes in an urban environment is a critical issue across various applications, including ride-sharing vehicle dispatching, public transportation management, and autonomous driving. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learn and optimize human urban strategies (or policies) from pre-collected human-generated spatial-temporal urban data. However, standard offline RL faces two significant challenges: (1) data scarcity and data heterogeneity, and (2) distributional shift. In this paper, we introduce MODA -- a Multi-Task Offline Reinforcement Learning with Contrastive Data Sharing approach. MODA addresses the challenges of data scarcity and heterogeneity in a multi-task urban setting through Contrastive Data Sharing among tasks. This technique involves extracting latent representations of human behaviors by contrasting positive and negative data pairs. It then shares data presenting similar representations with the target task, facilitating data augmentation for each task. Moreover, MODA develops a novel model-based multi-task offline RL algorithm. This algorithm constructs a robust Markov Decision Process (MDP) by integrating a dynamics model with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Once the robust MDP is established, any online RL or planning algorithm can be applied. Extensive experiments conducted in a real-world multi-task urban setting validate the effectiveness of MODA. The results demonstrate that MODA exhibits significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its capability in advancing urban decision-making processes. We also made our code available to the research community.
