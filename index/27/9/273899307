IO Memory protection mechanisms prevent malicious and/or buggy IO devices from executing errant transfers into memory. Modern servers achieve this using an IOMMU—IO devices operate on virtual addresses, and IOMMU translates virtual addresses to physical addresses (potentially speeding up translations using a cache called IOTLB) before executing memory transfers. Despite their importance, design of memory protection mechanisms that can provide strong safety properties while achieving high performance has remained elusive. Indeed, recent studies from production datacenters demonstrate that ine � ciencies within state-of-the-art memory protection mechanisms result in signi � cant throughput degradation, orders-of-magnitude tail latency in � ation, and violation of isolation guarantees.

The key insight in F&S design is that, rather than solely focusing on minimizing IOTLB miss rates, we should focus on reducing the cost of each IOTLB miss.Wedemonstratethatthischangeofperspectiveenablesa simpleF&Sdesignthatrequiresnomodi � cations in host hardware and minimal modi � cations within the operating system.
