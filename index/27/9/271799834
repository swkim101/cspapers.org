Traditionally, powered exoskeletons have predominantly featured a back-enveloping design due to its simplicity in both implementation and user donning. However, this design results in a backward shift of the center of mass (CoM) in the sagittal plane. This paper identifies the limitations of existing design approaches and determines the optimal anterior-posterior (A/P) CoM position considering factors like actuating power, balance in the neutral posture, and userâ€™s hand workspace. Our optimization analysis recommends placing the CoM in front of the user. We address historical constraints on front-enveloping designs and propose solutions. Furthermore, we validate the usability of our designed exoskeleton through testing with a complete paraplegic user.
