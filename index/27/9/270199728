Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in optimization proxies, i.e., machine learning models that approximate the input-output mapping of parametric optimization problems and return near-optimal feasible solutions. Following recent work by (Nellikkath&Chatzivasileiadis, 2021), this paper reconsiders the optimality verification problem for optimization proxies, i.e., the determination of the worst-case optimality gap over the instance distribution. The paper proposes a compact formulation for optimality verification and a gradient-based primal heuristic that brings substantial computational benefits to the original formulation. The compact formulation is also more general and applies to non-convex optimization problems. The benefits of the compact formulation are demonstrated on large-scale DC Optimal Power Flow and knapsack problems.
