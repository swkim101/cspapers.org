It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Third Workshop on Mobile Cloud Computing and Services (MCS 2012). Like the two previous workshops, we strive to become the premium forum for discussing cutting-edge research that combines the ubiquity of the mobile platform with the power of the cloud platform. 
 
Mobile phone applications demand greater resources and improved interactivity for better user experience. Resources in cloud computing platforms such as Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and Google AppEngine are a natural fit to remedy the lack of local resources in mobile devices. Mobile cloud computing refers to an infrastructure where data storage and data processing happen outside of the mobile device to enable a new class of applications previously not possible. Mobile cloud computing is poised to become a disruptive force in the mobile world. 
 
The availability of cloud computing resources on a pay-as-you-go basis, the advances in virtualization, the emergence of LTE and WiMAX, IEEE 802.11n and 60 GHz, and mobile application programming platforms create a new set of rich problems that require re-thinking old issues with a new lens. This year's workshop features several papers that lay out a bold vision for the future of this field. We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought-provoking.
