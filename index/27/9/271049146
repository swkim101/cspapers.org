It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2013 ACM Workshop on Mobile Cloud Computing and Services, the 4th workshop since it was held in 2010. This year's workshop continues its tradition of being a forum for presentation of research results and progress on leading edge system and networking issues related to mobile cloud computing and services, including device virtualization, notification services, location services, and scalable mobile cloud computing platforms. The mission of the workshop is to share novel solutions that can facilitate mobile cloud services, and identify new directions for future research and development. 
 
In this workshop, we are pleased to have the keynote speaker Dr. Mahadev Satyanarayanan from Carnegie Mellon University, which is known to be one of the leading researchers in mobile cloud areas. 
 
The keynote speech is followed by two excellent sessions which will be held in the morning and afternoon respectively. Each session is mixed with vision presentations and technical solutions, and with speakers from both academia and industries. Specifically, we have a number of invited presentations from reputed and active researchers in the field. 
 
In addition, the program includes a panel on "My Favorite Mobile Cloud Service and Why it Will Change the Mobile World". I hope you could think about your own favorite mobile cloud services and will enjoy the panel discussions.
