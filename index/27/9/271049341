Data Warehouses are databases specialized for business intelligence applications, and have been rapidly spreading within the industrial world over the last decade, due to their undeniable contribution to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision process within business and scientific domains. This wide diffusion was supported by remarkable research results on the one hand, by the quick advancement of commercial tools on the other.The ACM International Workshop on Data Warehousing and Online Analytical Processing (DOLAP) is an annual event that provides an international forum where both researchers and practitioners can share their findings in theoretical foundations, current methodologies, practical experiences, and new research directions in the areas of data warehousing and online analytical processing. The sixth DOLAP workshop was held this year in New Orleans, LA, USA.This year, we received 28 submissions form 16 different countries. The submitted papers covered various aspects of Data Warehousing and OLAP including ETL processes, multidimensional modeling, query languages, optimization and tuning, physical organization of data warehouses, data quality, evolution, XML data warehouses. After careful review, 12 papers were selected by the program committee to be presented at the workshop and included in the proceedings. The accepted papers were presented in four sessions: OLAP, XML and architecture, query processing, maintenance and workload.
