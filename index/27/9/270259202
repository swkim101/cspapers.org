This study presents SatisFace, a novel approach to measuring customer satisfaction in amusement parks by analyzing facial expressions at entry and exit points. Recognizing satisfaction's subjectivity, SatisFace assesses facial Action Unit (AU) changes, tailoring assessments to individual user characteristics. Data were collected through an experiment with 200 participants at Soleil Hill, using questionnaires and OpenFace for facial analysis. A gradient-boosting machine learning model revealed a significant correlation between changes in facial expressions and satisfaction levels.
