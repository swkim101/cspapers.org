This work presents a novel shape evaluation and optimization approach for shape sensing, specifically targeting the constrained, irregular, and intricate spatial shapes of flexible bronchoscopes (FB) in human bronchial tree. The proposed evaluation criteria and optimization methods combine clinical significance related to bronchial anatomical structures and address issues related to singular points and discontinuities in traditional shape reconstruction models. Three-dimensional experiments were conducted within eight spatial complex configurations printed from a proportional bronchial model. The 3D experiment results demonstrate an average reduction of approximately 34.1% in shape reconstruction errors across all eight airway models compared to the traditional model, validating the effectiveness and feasibility.
