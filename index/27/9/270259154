The number of IoT devices is increasing, but applications that utilize IoT devices and their data are still developing. One reason is the tight coupling between M2M infrastructure and applications and the difficulty of handling mobile devices in a unified manner. To address these challenges, we developed a versatile M2M system called "MECM2M" that utilizes the MEC paradigm. This paper proposes "MECM2Mv2" by adopting the Pub-Sub model and redesigning modules to improve the latency and efficiency, which were issues in MECM2M. Our future research evaluates the safety of using MECM2Mv2 in autonomous driving applications.
