Non-integer multiple cell height (NIMCH) standard-cell libraries offer promising co-optimization for power, performance and area in advanced technology nodes. However, such non-uniform design introduces new layout constraints where any sub-region can only accommodate gates of the same cell height due to manufacturability concerns. The existing physical design flow for NIMCH circuits, which handles the layout constraint by clustering and relocating gates according to their cell heights, often leads to substantial gate displacement that harms circuit performance. To alleviate the above issue, this paper proposes a row-based logic resynthesis procedure that explicitly adjusts cell heights after initial placement without changing cell positions. Experiment results demonstrate that compared with the conventional NIMCH physical design flow, our proposed approach can reduce the maximal delay by 26.1%.
