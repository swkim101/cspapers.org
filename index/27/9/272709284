The rebroadcasting of screen-recaptured document images introduces a significant risk to the confidential docu-ments processed in government departments and commer-cial companies. However, detecting recaptured document images subjected to distortions from online social networks (OSNs) is challenging since the common forensics cues, such as moir√© pattern, are weakened during transmission. In this work, we first devise a pixel-level distortion model of the screen-recaptured document image to identify the robust features of color artifacts. Then, we extract a chromaticity map from the recaptured image to highlight the presence of color artifacts even under low-quality samples. Based on the prior understanding, we design a chromaticity map adapter (CMA) to efficiently extract the chromaticity map, and feed it into the transformer backbone as multi-modal prompt tokens. To evaluate the performance of the pro-posed method, we collect a recaptured office document im-age dataset with over 10K diverse samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMA method outper-forms a SOTA approach (with RGB modality only), reducing the average EER from 26.82% to 16.78%. Robustness eval-uation shows that our method achieves 0.8688 and 0.7554 AUCs under samples with JPEG compression $(QF=70)$ and resolution as low as $534\times 503$ pixels.
