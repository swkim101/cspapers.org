Image compression is increasingly important in applications like intelligent driving and smart surveillance systems. This study presents a novel cross view capture distributed image compression network (CVCDIC) to improve the compression quality by using decoder side information. The CVCDICâ€™s decoder utilizes feature extraction networks to extract features from both the primary image and the side information. Furthermore, a multi-level cross view attention module is designed to capture interrelated details between images at multiple hierarchical levels. Finally, a spatial refinement module, constructed on the foundation of information distillation networks, is designed to further refine the quality of reconstructed images. The results show that CVCDIC can achieve an MS-SSIM of 0.978 at 0.15 bpp, surpassing DSIN (0.925), NDIC (0.956), and ATN (0.955) on the KITTI Stereo dataset.
