This paper designs a smart grid energy-saving control system for real-time video streaming, named Eco-VisionGrid. According to the real-time video stream collected by the camera, through the location analysis model and intelligent lighting control model deployed on the edge device, it analyzes the location information of the person and forms the best lighting decision. Preliminary experimental results show that Eco-VisionGrid can effectively implement power regulation and management.
