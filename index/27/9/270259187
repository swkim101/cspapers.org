In this paper, we present a novel approach of symmetrical pruning for lightweight anomaly detectors based on an autoencoder, leveraging the unique encoder-decoder structure of the autoencoder. We develop an efficient network anomaly detector with reduced computational overhead by computing the reconstruction error between hidden activations of an input and its hidden reconstructions and symmetrically pruning nodes with high error values.
