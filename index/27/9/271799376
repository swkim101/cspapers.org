Deploying a safe mobile robot policy in scenarios with human pedestrians is challenging due to their unpredictable movements. Current Reinforcement Learningbased motion planners rely on a single policy to simulate pedestrian movements and could suffer from the over-fitting issue. Alternatively, framing the collision avoidance problem as a multi-agent framework, where agents generate dynamic movements while learning to reach their goals, can lead to conflicts with human pedestrians due to their homogeneity.To tackle this problem, we introduce an efficient method that enhances agent diversity within a single policy by maximizing an information-theoretic objective. This diversity enriches each agent’s experiences, improving its adaptability to unseen crowd behaviors. In assessing an agent’s robustness against unseen crowds, we propose diverse scenarios inspired by pedestrian crowd behaviors. Our behavior-conditioned policies outperform existing works in these challenging scenes, reducing potential collisions without additional time or travel.
