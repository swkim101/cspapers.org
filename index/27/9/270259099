Mobile air pollution sensing methods are developed to collect air quality data with higher spatial-temporal resolutions. However, existing methods cannot process the spatially mixed gas samples effectively due to the highly dynamic temporal and spatial fluctuations experienced by the sensor, leading to significant measurement deviations. We find an opportunity to tackle the problem by exploring the potential patterns from sensor measurements. In light of this, we propose MobiAir, a novel city-scale fine-grained air quality estimation system to deliver accurate mobile air quality data. First, we design AirBERT, a representation learning model to discern mixed gas concentrations. Second, we design a knowledge-informed training strategy leveraging massive unlabeled city-scale data to enhance the AirBERT performance. To ensure the practicality of MobiAir, we have invested significant efforts in implementing the software stack on our meticulously crafted Sensing Front-end, which has successfully gathered air quality data at a city-scale for more than 1200 hours. Experiments conducted on collected data show that MobiAir reduces sensing errors by 96.7% with only 44.9ms latency, outperforming the SOTA baseline by 39.5%.
