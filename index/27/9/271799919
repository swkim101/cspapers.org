Micromanipulation techniques that can achieve controlled fine operations at the micro scale play an important role in biomedical fields including embryo engineering, gene engineering, drug screening, and cell analysis. However, micromanipulation of biological micro-objects, such as cells and micro tissues, suffers from mechanical damage and low efficiency. Several techniques have been introduced to manipulate cells more easily, but most of them are restricted by expensive devices, limited work area, and potential damage to cellular structure. Here we develop a hydrodynamic manipulation method to rotate and transport mouse oocytes, which utilizes acoustic waves and micropipette to generate acoustic radiation force and excite microstreaming. This method can accomplish rotational and translational operations precisely and controllably. We tested the process of trapping, rotation, and transportation of the mouse oocytes, and measured rotational and translational speed with a range of applied voltage. The method was able to shorten the cost time of delivery and posture adjustment before oocyte injection. Our study provides an easy-to-use technique for oocyte manipulation without contact, and it has the potential to be universally applied in many cellular studies.
