Accurate, continuous monitoring of human physical and physiological signals is critical to enhancing healthcare, personalizing education, and human interaction with the physical environment. Current methods for acquiring human data, however, frequently rely on cumbersome environmental instrumentation, extensive manual inputs, or uncomfortable rigid or adhesive wearable sensors. The emergence of computational fabrics has ushered in a new era of ubiquitous computing. By seamlessly integrating sensing capabilities into everyday clothing and accessories, we enable uninterrupted physical and physiological data acquisition and interpretation, providing a holistic view of an individual's status.
