Alzheimer's disease and related dementia has emerged as a global health challenge due to aging population. Expressed Emotion (EE) is a widely-used medical measure of family emotional environment of patients with caregivers. We present EmoMarker, a multi-modal sensor detection system for dyadic digital biomarkers of EE in dementia patients' homes. EmoMarker consists of a privacy-preserving depth camera and a microphone to extracts interpretable dyadic (i.e., motor and acoustic) digital biomarkers of the interaction between patients and caregivers and predict the scores of Family Altitude Scale, an assessment tool for measuring the emotional climate of families. We have deployed our system in 99 elder people's homes and achieved 81.13% prediction accuracy in preliminary results.
