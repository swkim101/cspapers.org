The effective reasoning of integrated multimodal perception information is crucial for achieving enhanced end-to-end autonomous driving performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel multitask imitation learning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that leverages a dual attention transformer (DualAT) to enhance the multimodal fusion and waypoint prediction processes. A self-attention mechanism captures global context information and models the long-term temporal dependencies of waypoints for multiple time steps. On the other hand, a cross-attention mechanism implicitly associates the latent feature representations derived from different modalities through a learnable geometrically linked positional embedding. Specifically, the DualAT excels at processing and fusing information from multiple camera views and LiDAR sensors, enabling comprehensive scene understanding for multitask learning. Furthermore, the DualAT introduces a novel waypoint prediction architecture that combines the temporal relationships between waypoints with the spatial features extracted from sensor inputs. We evaluate our approach on both the Town05 and Longest6 benchmarks using the closed-loop CARLA urban driving simulator and provide extensive ablation studies. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
