Network simulations play an important role in the evolution of V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication services. Large-scale simulations involving a huge number of connected vehicles and/or heavy network traffic, however, typically take a long period of time to complete. In this poster, we explore a mechanism to accelerate network simulations (in terms of simulation time processed per unit wall-clock time) by the means of parallel and distributed simulations (PADS). Multiple instances of network simulators are run in parallel and loosely synchronized to process simulation events in a distributed manner. We develop a proof-of-concept implementation of the framework to showcase its feasibility. The results indicate that the proposed framework achieves up to 10 times faster simulation speed with eight parallel network simulation instances.
