Visual SLAM is an essential tool in diverse applications such as robot perception and extended reality, where feature-based methods are prevalent due to their accuracy and robustness. However, existing methods employ either hand-crafted or solely learnable point features and are thus limited by the feature attributes. In this paper, we propose incorporating hybrid point features efficiently into a single system. By integrating hand-crafted and learnable features, we seek to capitalize on their complementary attributes in both key-point identification and descriptor expressiveness. To this purpose, we design a pre-processing module, which includes extraction, inter-class processing, and post-processing of hybrid point features. We present an efficient matching approach to exclusively perform the data association within the same class of features. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Bag-of-Words (H-BoW) model to deal with hybrid point features in matching and loop-closure-detection. By integrating the proposed framework into a modern feature-based system, we introduce HPF-SLAM. We evaluate the system on EuRoC-MAV and TUM-RGBD benchmarks. The experimental results show that our method consistently surpasses the baseline at comparable speed.
