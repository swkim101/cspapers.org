Sensing plays a pivotal role in robotic manipulation, dictating the accuracy and versatility with which objects are handled. Vision-based sensing methods often suffer from fabrication complexity and low durability, while approaches that rely on direct measurements on the gripper often have limited resolution and are difficult to scale. Here, we present a soft robotic gripper made out of two cubic lattices that are sensorized by embedding air channels within the structure. The lattices are 3D printed from a single build material, simplifying the fabrication process. The flexibility of this approach offers significant control over sensor and lattice design, while the pressure-based internal sensing provides measurements with minimal disruption to the grasping surface. With only 12 sensors, 6 per lattice, this gripper can estimate an objectâ€™s weight and location and offer new insights into grasp parameters like friction coefficients and grasp force.
