Aggregates such as sum and count are among the most frequently used linguistic extensions of Answer Set Programming (ASP).

At-most-one (AMO) constraints are a specific form of aggregates that excludes the simultaneous truth of multiple elements in a set.

This article unleashes a powerful propagation strategy in case groups of elements in an aggregate are also involved in AMO constraints.

In fact, the combined knowledge given by aggregates and AMO constraints significantly increases the effectiveness of search space pruning, resulting in sensible performance gains.
