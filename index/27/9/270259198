Satellite computing is emerging as a promising domain for delivering mobile services that meet stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, such as low latency, to users. However, the inherent mobility of satellites as computing nodes can precipitate QoS degradation, a challenge not encountered in terrestrial cloud systems. This discrepancy poses significant adaptation challenges for cloud service orchestration systems, such as Kubernetes, due to the rapid movement of satellites. This poster introduces a service orchestration system and a corresponding service placement strategy tailored for satellite computing environments. Our proposed architecture and strategy surpass traditional fixed instance deployment by not only achieving lower average latency but also maintaining an optimal balance between benefits and costs.
