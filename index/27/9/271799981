Robot-assisted Natural Orifice Translu-minal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) represents a paradigm shift in surgical practice, significantly mini-mizing patient morbidity. However, the variability of inner diameter and the inter-luminal crossing within the luminal tracts lead to challenge for effective robotic intervention. Inspired by the motion of the chrysalis during its transformation, we designed an innovative pupal-mode actuator for NOTES robots. Through the manipulation of its internal air chambers, this actuator is capable of replicating wriggle-like movements. Through experimental analysis, we have acquired the constitutive characteristics of this actuator. Subsequently, an innovative gastric endoscopy robot is developed base the actuator and tested in a phantom. The results of the task simulations substantiate that the pupal-mode actuator has the capability to reduce resistance and enhance the safety of the endoscopic intervention.
