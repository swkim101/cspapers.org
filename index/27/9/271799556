In the natural world, insects exhibit remarkable locomotion capabilities through a combination of running and jumping. However, replicating this versatile locomotion in a soft robot poses technical and design complexities. Here, we propose a dynamic soft robot named LeapRun that possesses agile locomotion and the ability to perform continuous jumping. To achieve this, a prototype soft robot (weight of 300 mg, size of 30 mm × 15 mm × 5 mm), composed of piezoelectric thin film, shape memory alloy, magnet-locking mechanism, and corresponding support structures, is fabricated. Experimental results demonstrate a maximum moving speed of 15 cm/s and a maximum jumping height of 8.7 cm. Continuous jumping of steps and crossing of complex rugged surfaces are realized. Besides, integrated with the power source, wireless communication module, and control module, the untethered operation is also presented, showcasing the potential for multiple applications in search and rescue, exploration, and monitoring.
