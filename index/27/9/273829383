Collaborative Vehicular Perception (CVP) enables connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to cooperatively extend their views through wirelessly sharing their sensor data. Existing CVP systems employeitheravehicle-to-vehicle(V2V)orvehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)viewexchangeparadigm.Inthispaper,weadvocateahybrid CVPdesign:ourdevelopedsystem, Harbor , employs V2I as its fundamental underlying framework, and opportunistically employs V2V to boost the performance. In Harbor , vehicles ( helpers ) may serve as relays to assist other vehicles ( helpees ) in reaching an edge node, which performs sensor data merging to produce the extended view. We judiciously partition the workload between the edge and vehicles, develop a robust helper-helpee assignment model, and solve it efficiently at runtime. We conduct both real-world tests and large-scale emulation experiments using two prevailing CAV applications: drivable space detection and object detection. Our real-world evaluation conducted at one of the worldâ€™s first purpose-built autonomous driving testbeds demonstrates that Harbor outperforms state-of-the-art V2V-or V2I-only CVP schemes by up to 36% in detection accuracy, resulting in significantly fewer collisions under dangerous driving scenarios.
