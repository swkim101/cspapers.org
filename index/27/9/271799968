The navigational abilities of tip-everting soft growing robots, known as vine robots, are compromised when tip-mount devices are added to enable carrying of payloads. We present a new method for securing a vine robot to objects or its environment that exploits the unique eversion-based growth mechanism and flexibility of vine robots, while keeping the tip of the vine robot free of encumbrance. Our implementation is a tip-clutching winch, into which vine robots can insert themselves and anchor to via powerful overlapping belt friction. The device enables passive, high-strength, and reversible fastening, and can easily release the vine robot. This approach enables carrying of loads of at least 28 kg (limited by the tensile strength of the vine robot body material and winch actuator torque capacity), as well as novel material transport and locomotion capabilities.
