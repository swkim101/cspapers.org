Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a promising technology for enhancing wireless networks in challenging environments. While existing RIS designs can manipulate basic electromagnetic properties like amplitude and phase, it lacks control over polarization. This paper presents a novel RIS design with four independently controllable varactors. This design enables independent and continuous tuning of amplitude and phase for both co-polarization and cross-polarization channels, providing greater flexibility and improved performance in next-generation wireless networks. A fabricated prototype showcases two key functionalities: beam-steering with combined amplitude control, and beam-steering with six user-defined distinct polarizations.
