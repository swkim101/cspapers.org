As a new sensor, 4D radar (x, y, z, velocity) has great potential for V2X, due to its 3D point cloud, direct doppler velocity output, long distance ranging, low-cost, and more importantly, robust perception in all weathers. However, the extrinsic calibration of multiple long baseline 4D radars is rarely researched in V2X, which is the key to fuse multi-radars. The main reasons are three-folds: (1) New sensor. Thus, it is not surprising that little related work can be found. (2) Long baseline and large viewpoint-difference. Current works are mainly focused on unmanned vehicles, which is short baseline and small viewpoint-difference. (3) Sparse, noisy, and very cluttered 4D radar point cloud. Thus, it is challenging to rapidly and accurately locate the target and extract the feature. In this paper, LB-R2R-Calib (Long Baseline Radar to Radar extrinsic Calibration) is proposed to address these problems. The novelties are: (1) A new target is introduced: an eight-quadrant corner reflector enclosed by a foam sphere. The benefit is the target center is a viewpoint-invariant feature. Thus, it is ideal for large viewpoint-difference calibration. (2) A new feature extraction algorithm is proposed to rapidly locate the target and extract the target center from a very cluttered point cloud, as we observed some important characteristics of 4D radar. Experiments with two 4D radars in real environments with four configurations demonstrate our method is highly accurate and robust.
