Magnetic continuum robots (MCR) have shown great potential in minimally invasive interventions because they can be actively and remotely navigated through complex in vivo environments. However, the deformation capability of current MCRs is limited by fixed magnetization congurations, preventing them from accessing hard-to-reach areas. This is due to the fact that under a global magnetic field, fixed magnetization conguration causes the magnets on the MCRs exposed to coupled magnetic forces and torques, resulting in a lack of controllable degrees of freedom. Here, we introduce a reprogrammable magnetic continuum robot (RMCR) enabled by magnetic reprogramming modules (MRM). Actuated by shape memory alloys, the magnetic moment direction of MRMs can be selectively reprogrammed in real-time and in-situ. Magnetic reprogramming capabilities enable the RMCR to achieve complex shape transformations. Results show that the range of motion in the tip direction of the RMCR increases by 193% compared with regular MCR. Besides, MRMs on the RMCR can achieve active attraction and separation under simple magnetic fields. The reprogramming process of the RMCR is theoretically investigated. A design methodology for MRMs is then proposed and the fabrication process of RMCR is described in detail. Furthermore, a kinematic model of the RMCR is established, simulated, and experimentally validated.
