The potential of tactile sensing for dexterous robotic manipulation has been demonstrated by its ability to enable nuanced real-world interactions. In this study, the retrieval of unknown objects from confined spaces, which is unsuitable for conventional visual perception and gripper-based manipulation, is identified and addressed. Specifically, a tactile-sensorized tool stick that well fits in the narrow space is utilized to provide multi-point contact sensing for object manipulation. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent with a hybrid action space is then proposed to acquire the optimal policy for manipulating the objects without prior knowledge of their physical properties. To accelerate on-hardware training, a focused training strategy is adopted with the hypothesis that an agent trained on a small set of representative shapes can be generalized to a wide range of everyday objects. Additionally, a curriculum on terminal goals is designed to further accelerate the hardware-based training process. Comparative experiments and ablation studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach, which highlights the high success rate of our solution for retrieving everyday objects.
