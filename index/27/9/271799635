Multi-session mapping serves as the pre-requisite for autonomous robots to fulfill various long-term tasks (e.g., map updating, navigation, collaboration). However, it is challenging to implement multi-session mapping in enclosed or partially enclosed ambiguous environments (e.g., long corridors, industrial warehouses). Existing solutions either depend heavily on the matching of elementary geometric features (e.g., points, lines, and planes), which tends to fail in environments with ambiguous geometric features; or depend on the given guess of the initial transformation matrix of multiple single-session maps, which is not always obtainable and accurate enough. The ambient magnetic field has exhibited ubiquity and high distinctiveness at different location, which makes it suitable for estimating the initial transformation matrix. Thus, this paper proposes a novel probabilistic magnetic-aware Map Matching framework for Multi-session Mapping, namely MM4MM, to estimate the relative transformation of multiple single-session maps and to build the globally consistent maps in ambiguous and perceptually-degraded environments. The key novelties of this work are the designing of the hierarchical probabilistic map matching framework and the Particle Swarm Optimization strategy to associate the magnetic data of multiple sessions. Evaluations on both simulated and real world experiments demonstrate the greatly improved utility, accuracy, and robustness of multi-session mapping over the comparative methods.
