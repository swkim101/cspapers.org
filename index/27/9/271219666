Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL cloud database service that provides consistent performance at any scale. Hundreds of thousands of customers rely on DynamoDB for its fundamental properties: consistent performance, availability, durability, and a fully managed serverless experience. In 2021, during the 66-hour Amazon Prime Day shopping event, Amazon systems - including Alexa, the Amazon.com sites, and Amazon fulﬁllment centers, made trillions of API calls to DynamoDB, peak-ing at 89.2 million requests per second, while experiencing high availability with single-digit millisecond performance. Since the launch of DynamoDB in 2012, its design and implementation have evolved in response to our experiences operating it. The system has successfully dealt with issues related to fairness, trafﬁc imbalance across partitions, moni-toring, and automated system operations without impacting availability or performance. Reliability is essential, as even the slightest disruption can signiﬁcantly impact customers. This paper presents our experience operating DynamoDB at a massive scale and how the architecture continues to evolve to meet the ever-increasing demands of customer workloads.
