Virtual Reality (VR) technology, extensively utilized in gaming, social networking, and online collaboration, has raised significant security concerns due to the array of sensors integrated into VR headsets. This paper discusses several of our ongoing research that explore sensor vulnerabilities within VR headsets and proposes appropriate mitigation strategies. Specifically, we focus on three types of embedded sensors in VR headsets: unrestricted motion sensors, optical sensors, and eye-tracking sensors. Our investigation outlines the potential attacks exploiting these sensor vulnerabilities, which could result in privacy leakage and malicious signal injections. Furthermore, we detail the design and implementation of effective countermeasures to defend against these threats.
