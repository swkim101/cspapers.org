Monocular 3D human mesh estimation is an ill-posed problem, characterized by inherent ambiguity and occlusion. While recent probabilistic methods propose generating multiple solutions, little attention is paid to obtaining high-quality estimates from them. To address this limitation, we introduce ScoreHypo, a versatile framework by first leveraging our novel HypoNet to generate multiple hy-potheses, followed by employing a meticulously designed scorer, ScoreNet, to evaluate and select high-quality esti-mates. ScoreHypo formulates the estimation process as a re-verse denoising process, where HypoNet produces a diverse set of plausible estimates that effectively align with the im-age cues. Subsequently, ScoreNet is employed to rigorously evaluate and rank these estimates based on their quality and finally identify superior ones. Experimental results demon-strate that HypoNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art probabilistic methods as a multi-hypothesis mesh estimator. Moreover, the estimates selected by ScoreNet significantly outperform random generation or simple averaging. Notably, the trained ScoreNet exhibits generalizability, as it can effectively score existing methods and significantly reduce their errors by more than 15%.
