The U-shape (encoder-decoder) architecture, combined with effective blocks, has shown significant

success in image restoration. In U-shape models, there is insufficient focus on the feature fusion

problem between encoder and decoder features at

the same level. Current methods often employ simplistic operations like summation or concatenation,

which makes it difficult to strike a balance between

performance and complexity. To address this issue,

we propose a compression-in-the-middle mechanism, termed Integration-Compression-Integration

(ICI), which effectively conducts dense fusion and

avoids information loss. From the block design

perspective, we design a multi-dimension aggregation (MDA) mechanism, capable of effectively

aggregating features from both the channel and

spatial dimension. Combining the IntegrationCompression-Integration feature fusion and the

multi-dimension aggregation, our dense fusion and

multi-dimension aggregation network (DFMDANet) achieves superior performance over state-ofthe-art algorithms on 16 benchmarking datasets for

numerous image restoration tasks.
