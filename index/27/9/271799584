Deciding where to go next is a challenging task for humans. However, for robots in unknown environments, this becomes even more demanding. In planetary explorations, the robots are continuously challenged with the task of exploring novel areas, yet so far, humans decide for the robots where to go. Even then, prioritizing the next target based on previous knowledge is complex. In our proposed work, the robot utilizes data about its surroundings from drone or satellite images. Alternatively, a volumetric representation can be reduced to form a suitable input. From the input, tiles are selected and embedded by different autoencoder variants. The robot can select the most promising next exploration goal through the distance in the embedding to the previous samples. In this work, a variational autoencoder, a Wasserstein autoencoder, and a spherical autoencoder are evaluated against each other. The latter two variants yield a high information gain when evaluated on satellite data from the Netherlands. Additionally, the framework was employed on data from an analog mission in the Tabernas desert. Through the framework, the robots get an understanding of which goals yield the most information gain and, therefore, can quickly improve their knowledge about their surroundings.
