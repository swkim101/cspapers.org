Advancements in robot learning for object manipulation have shown promising results, yet certain everyday objects remain challenging for robots to effectively interact with. This discrepancy arises from the fact that human-designed objects are optimized for human use rather than robot manipulation. To address this gap, we propose a framework to automatically design 3D printable adaptations that can be attached to hard-to-use objects, thus improving "robot ergonomics". Our learning-based framework formulates the adaptation design and control as a dual Markov decision process and is able to improve robot-object interactions for various robot end effectors and objects. We further validate our designs in the real world with a Franka Panda robot. Please see the supplementary video and https://object-adaptation.github.io for additional visualizations.
