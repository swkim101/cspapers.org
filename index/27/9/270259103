In this paper, we propose a system framework of Pub/Sub-based multimodal data transmission to mobile terminals. For various sensors, we classify the data in different topics, but transmit them in the uniform data channel, with different transmission mechanisms. In this case, mobile terminals receive data via different mechanisms, the push notification and request-response connection. The proposed framework makes the data transmission more efficient and flexible.
