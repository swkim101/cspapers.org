This paper details the simulation and experimental validation of an autonomous perching and take-off method for a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a suction cup perching mechanism on vertical surfaces. The suction cup interaction with different surface types is characterized with experimental tests to accurately model the perching manoeuvre. The resulting model is used to develop a realistic hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation of the perching and take-off manoeuvre of the UAV in Gazebo. A control method is developed to automate the perching and take-off manoeuvre. The method is tested in simulation and is experimentally validated with flight tests. Comparisons between simulation and experimental data demonstrate that the simulation is accurate and can be used to continue the development of autonomous perching methods.
