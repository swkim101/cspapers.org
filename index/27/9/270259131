The rise of counterfeit powdered food products, exemplified by notorious incidents such as the Melamine Milk Scandal, poses significant risks to consumers. The primary challenge in identifying these counterfeit products comes from their intricate adulteration and substitution techniques. Currently, such identification methods are only viable in laboratory settings, making average consumers nearly impossible to authenticate their products. To address this limitation, we propose PowDew, a novel system that employs a smartphone to detect counterfeit powdered food products. PowDew utilizes the powder's physical property, namely droplet motion, as a basis for verification. Through real-world experiments, PowDew demonstrate a practicality with achieving an overall detection accuracy of up to 96.1%.
