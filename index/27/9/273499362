Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated significant success. Active learning for GNNs aims to query the valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation to maximize the GNNsâ€™ performance at a low cost. However, most existing methods for reinforced active learning in GNNs may lead to a highly imbalanced class distribution, especially in highly skewed class scenarios. This further adversely affects the classification performance. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel reinforced class-balanced active learning framework for GNNs, namely, GraphCBAL. It learns an optimal policy to acquire class-balanced and informative nodes for annotation, maximizing the performance of GNNs trained with selected labeled nodes. GraphCBAL designs class-balance-aware states, as well as a reward function that achieves trade-off between model performance and class balance. We further upgrade GraphCBAL to GraphCBAL++ by introducing a punishment mechanism to obtain a more class-balanced labeled set. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, our methods can strike the balance between classification results and class balance.
