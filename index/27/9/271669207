Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) is an important Resolution Enhancement Technology (RET) in chip manufacturing. Due to the high computational demands of ILT, large-scale layouts are typically partitioned into smaller tiles for independent processing. In this paper, we propose a multigrid-Schwarz method to overcome challenges in tile assembly. Experimental results show that our approach achieves comparable performance to the full-chip ILT, offering increased parallelizability and speedup in parallel mode. Unlike the traditional divide-and-conquer algorithm, it effectively alleviates discontinuities of tile stitching, preventing manufacturing failures.
