The rise of data science, the inherent dirti-ness of data, and the proliferation of vast data providers have increased the value proposition of Semantic Types. Semantic Types encode contextual information onto a data schema, in-forming the user about the definitional meaning of data, its broader context, and relationships to other types. Previous work focuses on the recognition of statically-defined types, but what happens when a type-set isnâ€™t known apriori and how do we connect Semantic Types to downstream use-cases? FSTO -Gen addresses these questions by leveraging LLMs to generate Functional Semantic Types that include normalization, validation, and casting code to efficiently automate human-intensive data tasks.
