Graph representation learning (GRL) is to encode graph elements into informative vector representations, which can be used in downstream tasks for analyzing graph-structured data and has seen extensive applications in various domains. However, the majority of extant studies on GRL are geared towards generating node representations, which cannot be readily employed to perform edge-based analytics tasks in edge-attributed bipartite graphs (EABGs) that pervade the real world, e.g., spam review detection in customer-product reviews and identifying fraudulent transactions in user-merchant networks. Compared to node-wise GRL, learning edge representations (ERL) on such graphs is challenging due to the need to incorporate the structure and attribute semantics from the perspective of edges while considering the separate influence of two heterogeneous node sets U and V in bipartite graphs. To our knowledge, despite its importance, limited research has been devoted to this frontier, and existing workarounds all suffer from sub-par results. Motivated by this, this paper designs EAGLE, an effective ERL method for EABGs. Building on an in-depth and rigorous theoretical analysis, we propose the factorized feature propagation (FFP) scheme for edge representations with adequate incorporation of long-range dependencies of edges/features without incurring tremendous computation overheads. We further ameliorate FFP as a dual-view FFP by taking into account the influences from nodes in U and V severally in ERL. Extensive experiments on 5 real datasets showcase the effectiveness of the proposed EAGLE models in semi-supervised edge classification tasks. In particular, EAGLE can attain a considerable gain of at most 38.11% in AP and 1.86% in AUC when compared to the best baselines.
