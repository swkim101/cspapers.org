In the realm of cross-network tasks, graph domain adaptation is an effective tool due to its ability to transfer abundant labels from nodes in the source domain to those in the target domain. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods mainly focus on domain-wise alignment. These approaches, while effective in mitigating the marginal distribution shift between the two domains, often ignore the integral aspect of structural alignment, potentially leading to negative transfer. To address this issue, we propose a joint adversarial domain adaptive graph convolutional network (JDA-GCN) that is uniquely augmented with structural graph alignment, so as to enhance the efficacy of knowledge transfer. Specifically, we construct a structural graph to delineate the interconnections among nodes within identical categories across the source and target domains. To further refine node representation, we integrate the local consistency matrix with the global consistency matrix, thereby leveraging the learning of the sub-structure similarity of nodes to enable more robust and effective representation of nodes. Empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets substantiates the superiority of our proposed method, marking a significant advancement over existing state-of-the-art graph domain adaptation algorithms.
