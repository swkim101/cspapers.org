It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Second ACM Workshop on Security and Privacy in Smartphones and Mobile Devices -- SPSM'12, held in association with the 19th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, October 19th, 2012, in Raleigh, NC (USA). 
 
The workshop was created last year to organize and foster discussion of security in the emerging area of smartphone and mobile device computing. As organizers of top security venues, we've observed an increasing number of submissions describing novel approaches to solving the challenges of this area. We wanted to provide a dedicated venue to discuss these challenges and promising approaches for future research directions. SPSM'11 was a great success, with an excellent turnout of 80 registered attendees and in-depth discussion. This year, we will continue the 15 minute back-to-back talks followed by 45 minutes of discussion and hope to meet and exceed the high bar that was set. 
 
The call for papers attracted 30 submissions from Canada, China, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Nigeria, South Africa, and the United States. The program committee accepted 11 papers that cover a variety of topics, including permission models, user studies, attacks on smartphones, and methods of defense. We are especially pleased to have a keynote speech by Geir Olsen, a Principle Program Manager in the operating systems group on the Windows Phone team, on Windows Phone 8 Security. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for security researchers and developers.
