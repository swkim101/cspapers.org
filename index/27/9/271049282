It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2015 ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense -- MTD'15. This year's MTD workshop continues its tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of access control, nincluding models, systems, applications, and theory. The mission of the symposium is to share novel access control solutions that fulfill the needs of heterogeneous applications and environments and identify new directions for future research and development. ACRONYM gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of access control. 
 
The call for papers attracted submissions from Asia, Europe, and United States. Submissions are from both industry and academia. The workshop received 19 submissions. Each submitted paper has at least 3 review comments from TPC members. The program committee reviewed and accepted the following: 
Full Technical Papers submitted 19, accepted 8 
Short Experience Reports submitted 19, accepted 4 
 
 
 
We also encourage attendees to attend the keynote and invited talk presentations. These valuable and insightful talks can and will guide us to a better understanding of the future:
