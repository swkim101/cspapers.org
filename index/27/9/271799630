Modern algorithms allow robots to reach a greater level of autonomy and fulfill more challenging tasks. However, on-board limitations regarding computational and battery resources are hindering factors regarding the deployment of such algorithms particularly on mobile robots. Although offloading a majority of the algorithmic components to the edge or even cloud offers an attractive option to leverage massive computing power in robotics applications, safety and reliability remain critical issues. This paper presents a minimalistic safety fallback mechanism when offloading mobile robot navigation to the edge, that ensures safe and collision-free navigation even in the presence of failures in the connection between the on-board and edge-devices. We show the effectiveness of our approach through extensive testing in three different relevant scenarios in a simulated warehouse environment. Our experiments demonstrate the effects of different fallback strategies and show how our proposed approach is able to ensure safety while allowing the robot to continue its mission during an interrupted connection and thus avoiding unnecessary downtime.
