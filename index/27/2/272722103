Saliency ranking detection (SRD) has emerged as a challenging task in computer vision, aiming not only to identify salient objects within images but also to rank them based on their degree of saliency. Existing SRD datasets have been created primarily using mouse-trajectory data, which inadequately captures the intricacies of human visual perception. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces the first large-scale SRD dataset, SIFR, constructed using genuine human fixation data, thereby aligning more closely with real visual perceptual processes. To establish a baseline for this dataset, we propose QAGNet, a novel model that leverages salient instance query features from a transformer detector within a tri-tiered nested graph. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across two widely used SRD datasets and our newly proposed dataset.
