Goal Recognition is the task of inferring an agent's intentions from a set of observations. 

Existing recognition approaches have made considerable advances in domains such as human-robot interaction, intelligent tutoring systems, and surveillance. However, most approaches rely on explicit domain knowledge, often defined by a domain expert. Much recent research focus on mitigating the need for a domain expert while maintaining the ability to perform quality recognition, leading researchers to explore Model-Free Goal Recognition approaches. We comprehensively survey Model-Free Goal Recognition, and provide a perspective on the state-of-the-art approaches and their applications, showing recent advances. We categorize different approaches, introducing a taxonomy with a focus on their characteristics, strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for different scenarios. We compare the advances each approach made to the state-of-the-art and provide a direction for future research in Model-Free Goal Recognition.
