Novel view synthesis is attractive for social media, but it often contains unwanted details such as personal information that needs to be edited out for a better experience. Multiplane image (MPI) is desirable for social media because of its generality but it is complex and computationally expensive, making object removal challenging. To address these challenges, we propose CORE-MPI, which employs embedding images to improve the consistency and accessibility of MPI object removal. CORE-MPI allows for real-time transmission and interaction with embedding images on social media, facilitating object removal with a single mask. However, recovering the geometric information hidden in the embedding images is a significant challenge. Therefore, we propose a dual-network approach, where one network focuses on color restoration and the other on inpainting the embedding image including geometric information. For the training of CORE-MPI, we introduce a pseudo-reference loss aimed at proficient color recovery, even in complex scenes or with large masks. Furthermore, we present a disparity consistency loss to preserve the geometric consistency of the inpainted region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE-MPI on RealEstate10K and UCSD datasets.
