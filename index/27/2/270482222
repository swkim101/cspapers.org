With the rise in the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), security concerns associated with them have become paramount. Similar to other cyber-physical systems, the primary working principle behind UAVs follows the sensor-controller-actuation cycle. Errors between the setpoints and sensor data are computed through a PID controller and translated to pulse width modulated (PWM) signals that control the orientation and movement of a UAV. Recent research has demonstrated intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI)-based alteration of PWM signals causing unauthorized maneuvers and crashes in UAVs. PWM alteration attacks can be carried out in various ways. For instance, hardware Trojans (HTs) can manipulate the PWM signals, and given the untrusted supply chain, HTs are a critical threat. Adversaries can exploit the PWM signals to manipulate UAV operations subtly, bypassing traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that only monitor sensor data. Therefore, ensuring the integrity of PWM signals and their correlation with sensor and controller data is crucial for end-to-end UAV security. We address this need by proposing ConFIDe (Control-Fused Intrusion Detection system), a novel defense technique for UAVs. It verifies the integrity of the flight controller-generated PWM signals, ensuring the motors receive the signals free from hidden exploits. We validated our proposed IDS on different PWM alteration attack scenarios. In particular, we implemented a hardware Trojan attack targeting the PWM signals on a PX4-UAV to test the efficacy of the proposed IDS on a real system. ConFIDe performed well on all the attack scenarios, achieving a high ROC-AUC, including sensor attacks like GPS spoofing.
