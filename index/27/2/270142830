Despite intensive research efforts in radio frequency noncontact sensing, capturing fine-grained geometric properties of objects, such as shape and size, remains an open problem using commodity WiFi devices. Prior attempts are incapable of characterizing object shape or size because they predominantly rely on weak signals reflected off objects in a very small number of directions. In this paper, motivated by the observation that the diffracted signals around an object between two WiFi devices carry the contour information of the object, we formulate the problem of reconstructing the 2D target profile and develop WiProfile, the first WiFi-based system that unlocks the diffraction effects for target profiling. We introduce a CSI-Profile model to characterize the relationship between the CSI measured at different target positions and the target profile in the diffraction zone. With suitable approximations, the inverse problem of deriving the target profile from CSI can be solved by the inverse Fresnel transform. To mitigate CSI measurement errors on commodity WiFi devices, we propose a novel antenna placement strategy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that WiProfile can accurately reconstruct profiles with median absolute errors of less than 1 cm under various conditions, and effectively estimate the profiles of everyday objects of diverse shapes, sizes, and materials. We believe this work opens up new directions for fine-grained target imaging using commodity WiFi devices.
