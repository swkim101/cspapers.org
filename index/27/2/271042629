â€” Humanoid robots offer significant potential in various industries, including construction, where they can address inefficiencies and safety concerns. However, integrating them faces challenges like economic feasibility and technical limitations. Simulation plays a vital role in assessing humanoid performance. This paper compares human and humanoid welders in a simulation of welding shear studs on a composite floor. Results highlight differences in production rates and task completion times, emphasizing the need for machine learning to enable humanoid efficiency. Simulation aids in understanding and overcoming challenges in humanoid integration, facilitating progress in robotics technology.
