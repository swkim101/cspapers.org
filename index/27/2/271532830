A graph is a structure made up of vertices and edges used to represent complex relationships between entities, while a graph stream is a continuous ﬂow of graph updates that convey evolving relationships between entities. The massive volume and high dynamism of graph streams promote research on data structures of graph summarization, which provides a concise and approximate view of graph streams with sub-linear space and linear construction time, enabling real-time graph analytics in various domains, such as social networking, ﬁnancing, and cybersecurity. In this work, we propose the Mayﬂy , the ﬁrst neural data structure for summarizing graph streams. The Mayﬂy replaces handcrafted data structures with better accuracy and adaptivity. To cater to practical applications, Mayﬂy incorporates two ofﬂine training phases, namely larval and metamorphosis phases. During the larval phase, the Mayﬂy learns basic summarization abilities from automatically and synthetically constituted meta-tasks. In the metamorphosis phase, it rapidly adapts to real graph streams via meta-tasks. With speciﬁc conﬁgurations of information pathways, the Mayﬂy enables ﬂexible support for miscellaneous graph queries, including edge, node, and connectivity queries. Extensive empirical studies show that the Mayﬂy signiﬁcantly outperforms its handcrafted competitors.
