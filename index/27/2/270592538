This paper presents a functional state estimation method for a bilinear system fed by unknown inputs. The main goal of this contribution concerns the simultaneous state and unknown input estimation in time domain. This is done through the synthesis of a functional observer. It is shown, also, that the observer gains are solutions of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Our approach is tested on an electromechanical actuator example to confirm the performances of the proposed functional observer.
