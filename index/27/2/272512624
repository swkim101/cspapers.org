We show how to turn a noisy and fragile active triangulation technique-three-pattern structured light with a grayscale camera-into a fast and powerful tool for 3D capture: able to output sub-pixel accurate disparities at megapixel resolution, along with reflectance, normals, and a no-reference estimate of its own pixelwise 3D error. To achieve this, we formulate structured-light decoding as a neural inverse rendering problem. We show that despite having just three or four input images-all from the same viewpoint-this problem can be tractably solved by TurboSL, an algorithm that combines (1) a precise image formation model, (2) a signed distance field scene representation, and (3) projection Pattern sequences optimized for accuracy instead of precision. We use TurboSL to reconstruct a variety of complex scenes from images captured at up to 60 fps with a camera and a common projector. Our experiments highlight TurboSL's potential for dense and highly-accurate 3D acquisition from data captured in fractions of a second.
