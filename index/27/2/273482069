Computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) play a fundamental role in various applications. To tackle COPs, many Ising machines and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) solvers have been proposed, which typically involve direct transformation of COPs into Ising models or equivalent QUBO forms (D-QUBO). However, when addressing COPs with inequality constraints, this D-QUBO approach introduces numerous extra auxiliary variables, resulting in a substantially larger search space, increased hardware costs, and reduced solving efficiency. In this work, we propose HyCiM, a novel hybrid computing-in-memory (CiM) based QUBO solver framework, designed to overcome aforementioned challenges. The proposed framework consists of (i) an innovative transformation method (first to our known) that converts COPs with inequality constraints into an inequality-QUBO form, thus eliminating the need of expensive auxiliary variables and associated calculations; (ii)"inequality filter", a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based CiM circuit that accelerates the inequality evaluation, and filters out infeasible input configurations; (iii) %When feasible solutions are detected, a FeFET-based CiM annealer that is capable of approaching global solutions of COPs via iterative QUBO computations within a simulated annealing process. The evaluation results show that HyCiM drastically narrows down the search space, eliminating $2^{100} \text{ to } 2^{2536}$ infeasible input configurations compared to the conventional D-QUBO approach.
