In this paper, a study on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is presented. The goal is to implement four PID controllers in FIL (FPGA In-the-Loop) execution mode using Simulink. These controllers are designed to manage rotation angles and altitude, aiming to stabilize the quadrotor. The controllers were developed within the MATLAB Simulink environment, utilizing blocks supported by HDL Coder. PID parameters were fine-tuned through the PID Tuner feature. The control strategy was subsequently implemented on a Zybo FPGA board, employing the HDL Workflow Advisor to assess the controllers' behavior in FIL mode. The obtained results underscore the effectiveness and performance of the adopted control design.
