This paper describes the methods used to establish a control law based on a Disturbance Observer (DO) in a generalized model of two types of alkaline electrolyzers. A physical test bench, where a test campaign took place, provided the data to identify the dominant modes. The validated model has allowed us to verify the proposed control law through simulation. These initial results encourage us to introduce the electrolyzers into an engine vehicle test bench to observe and study the effects of the hydrogen produced as a complement to gasoline in reducing pollutants.
