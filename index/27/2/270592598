Deep learning (DL) models have become prevalent and consistently exhibit outstanding performance across diverse domains, particularly in information security. As a subset of machine learning (ML), DL has proven adept at handling complex, unstructured, and large-scale data, making it well-suited to tackle the evolving challenges of cybersecurity. By leveraging DL techniques, we can develop robust intrusion detection systems (IDS) to counter a wide range of network attacks, serving as a crucial defense against hackers and cybercriminals. The integration of DL into IDS holds immense potential for significantly enhancing network security and mitigating cyber risks in various real-world scenarios. This work proposes an IDS architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for temporal feature extraction and sequential analysis to predict and classify malicious cyberattacks in IoT network traffic. Our experiments with the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset, the latest comprehensive network traffic dataset, demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our model achieves an unprecedented accuracy of over 99% in both binary and multiclass classification, surpassing existing efforts in the literature.
