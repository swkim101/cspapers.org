Recently, several scholars have contributed to the growth of a new theoretical framework in NLP called perspectivism. This approach aims to leverage data annotated by different individuals to model diverse perspectives that affect their opinions on subjective phenomena such as irony. In this context, we propose MultiPICo, a multilingual perspectivist corpus of ironic short conversations in different languages and linguistic varieties extracted from Twitter and Reddit. The corpus includes sociodemographic information about its annotators. Our analysis of the annotated corpus shows how different demographic cohorts may significantly disagree on their annotation of irony and how certain cultural factors influence the perception of the phenomenon and the agreement on the annotation. Moreover, we show how disaggregated annotations and rich annotator metadata can be exploited to benchmark the ability of large language models to recognize irony, their po-sitionality with respect to sociodemographic groups, and the efficacy of perspective-taking prompting for irony detection in multiple languages.
