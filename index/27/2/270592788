As e-Learning emerges as a promising tool for instruction delivery, personalizing the e-Learning platform for DHH learners will benefit them to improve their learning engagement and educational attainment. This study aims to collect and analyze the different features unique to DHH learners and analyze the significant features among them. This study highlights the importance of addressing the diversity among DHH learners, while creating a personalized learning environment for them. With this focus, we employ the K-Means clustering algorithm to group the learners based on similar needs and preferences and identified that distinguishing clusters can be formed within the DHH group. We also tried to understand the significant features contributing to forming well separated groups. These results provide valuable insights into the diverse preferences and requirements when they interact with the learning materials. These findings emphasize the significance of personalized approach for DHH learners in educational settings and serve as the stepping stone to develop a personalized learning environment for them.
