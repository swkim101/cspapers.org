The automotive industry is undergoing a paradigm shift towards green technology, with proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) standing out as a viable alternative to conventional power systems due to their high efficiency, low emissions, and compact design. PEMFCs convert chemical energy from hydrogen into electrical energy, positioning them as key players in the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Despite their potential, the broader application of PEMFCs hinges on enhancing performance, longevity, cost-efficiency, and developing robust control mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive multi-physics model tailored for control applications within automotive PEMFCs. It intricately captures the electrochemical reactions, thermal behavior, and fluid dynamics that characterize the operation of these cells. The proposed model aims to bridge the gap between intricate physical processes and practical control solutions, thereby facilitating advanced system management and paving the way for the integration of PEMFCs into future automotive powertrains.
