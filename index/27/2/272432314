Incident response "playbooks" are structured sets of operational procedures organizations use to instruct humans or machines on performing countermeasures against cybersecurity threats. These playbooks generally combine information about a given threat and organizational aspects relevant within the context of an organization. Both types of information are crucial for using, maintaining, and sharing playbooks across organizations as they ensure effectiveness and confidentiality. While practitioners show great interest in playbooks, their characteristics have not yet been thoroughly investigated from a research perspective. For this reason, we explore the topic by analyzing what is inside a playbook. Our approach consists of a comprehensive empirical assessment of available data (1217 playbooks), an online study with 147 participants, and final in-depth interviews with nine security professionals to consolidate and validate our findings. We notably find intrinsic ambiguities in the way practitioners and organizations define their playbooks. Furthermore, we notice that available playbooks cannot be used outright which might currently impair their wide use across different cybersecurity actors. As a result, we can conclude that organizations do "play it by the books" but individually define what is inside their playbooks and which areas of incident response they might address.
