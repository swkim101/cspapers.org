Cyclists, vulnerable road users, face an increased risk of accidents due to a variety of factors, such as lane departure. This paper introduces the design of an active steering control system in order to prevent lane departures. Both a PID control system and sliding mode control are studied to control lateral displacement. The findings obtained show that the sliding mode control, with super-twisting, is well operated and performed. Proactive safety measures such as a lateral control system could significantly decrease the number of lane departure accidents, thereby improving overall road safety.
