We show an area law in the mutual information for the maximally-mixed state Ω in the ground space of general Hamiltonians, which is independent of the underlying ground space degeneracy. Our result assumes the existence of a ‘good’ approximation to the ground state projector (a good AGSP), a crucial ingredient in former area-law proofs. Such approximations have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians and 2D frustration-free locally-gapped local Hamiltonians. As a corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any є>0 and any bi-partition L∪ Lc of the system, I^є_max(L)(L^c) ≤O( log(|L|)+log(1/є)), where |L| represents the number of sites in L and Imaxє(L)(Lc)Ω represents the є-smoothed maximum mutual information with respect to the L:Lc partition in Ω. From this bound we then conclude I(L)(Lc)Ω≤ O(log(|L|)) – an area law for the mutual information in 1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show that Ω can be approximated up to an є in trace norm with a state of Schmidt rank of at most poly(|L|/є). Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual information of 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local Hamiltonians.
