Existing Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods typically focus on transferring knowledge from a large-capacity teacher to a low-capacity student model, achieving sub-stantial success in unimodal knowledge transfer. However, existing methods can hardly be extended to Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (CMKD), where the knowledge is transferred from a teacher modality to a different student modality, with inference only on the distilled student modality. We empirically reveal that the modality gap, i.e., modality imbalance and soft label misalignment, incurs the in-effectiveness of traditional KD in CMKD. As a solution, we propose a novel f_ustomized Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation (C2 KD). Specifically, to alleviate the modality gap, the pre-trained teacher performs bidirectional distillation with the student to provide customized knowledge. The On-the-Fly Selection Distillationi OFSD) strategy is applied to selectively filter out the samples with misaligned soft labels, where we distill cross-modal knowledge from non-target classes to avoid the modality imbalance issue. To further provide receptive cross-modal knowledge, proxy student and teacher, inheriting unimodal and cross-modal knowledge, is formulated to progressively transfer cross-modal knowledge through bidirectional distillation. Experimental results on audio-visual, image-text, and RGB-depth datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively transfer knowledge across modalities, achieving superior performance against traditional KD by a large margin.
