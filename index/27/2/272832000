Ads Content Safety at Google requires classifying billions of ads for Google Ads content policies. Consistent and accurate policy enforcement is important for advertiser experience and user safety and it is a challenging problem, so there is a lot of value for improving it for advertisers and users. Inconsistent policy enforcement causes increased policy friction and poor experience with good advertisers, and bad advertisers exploit the inconsistency by creating multiple similar ads in the hope that some will get through our defenses. This study proposes a method to understand advertiser's intent for content policy violations, using Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on identifying good advertisers to reduce content over-flagging and improve advertiser experience, though the approach can easily be extended to classify bad advertisers too. We generate advertiser's content profile based on multiple signals from their ads, domains, targeting info, etc. We then use LLMs to classify the advertiser content profile, along with relying on any knowledge the LLM has of the advertiser, their products or brand, to understand whether they are likely to violate a certain policy or not. After minimal prompt tuning our method was able to reach 95\% accuracy on a small test set.
