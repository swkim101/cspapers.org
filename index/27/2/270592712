This paper present the implementation of the Model Free Control (MFC) to stabilize interconnected multi-SISO subsystems, such a the case of the Planar Vertical Take Off and Landing (PVTOL). The model free control (MFC) is integrated into a feedback control architecture to address uncertainties and external disturbances. In this study, with the mathematical model as reference, the control algorithm is implemented in simulation, comparing it with the classical PID control. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed controller present fast convergence as compered with the PID. The indexes of Performance criteria show the superiority of the MFC approach, which is able to handle system uncertainties and unmodelled dynamics.
