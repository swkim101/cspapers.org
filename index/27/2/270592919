In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, several concepts have emerged alongside this new revolution, such as predictive maintenance, which today plays a key role in sustainable manufacturing and production systems by introducing a digital version of machine maintenance. Data extracted from production processes has increased exponentially due to the proliferation of sensing technologies. Even if maintenance 4.0 faces organizational, financial or even data source and machine repair challenges, it remains a strong point for companies that use it. It minimizes machine downtime and associated costs, maximizes machine life-cycle, and improves production quality and throughput. This approach is generally characterized by a very precise workflow, starting with project understanding and data collection, and ending with the decision-making phase. Maintenance operations in a multifunctional production system, like other activities, can have a significant impact on overall system efficiency. To better highlight the effects of maintenance on system performance, it is necessary to define specific indicators that will enable in-depth analysis. A literature review is therefore undertaken to gather relevant information on the potential impact of maintenance in this system. As part of this review, it is crucial to identify the concrete aspects of maintenance that could significantly influence system performance, and to determine the parameters to be taken into account to assess these effects. The aim of this study is therefore to highlight gaps in the existing literature and to propose solutions, including adaptations in other areas such as maintenance and operations management, that could improve the performance of the multifunctional production system.
