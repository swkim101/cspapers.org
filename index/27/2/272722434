In this work, we present RepKPU, an efficient network for point cloud upsampling. We propose to promote upsampling performance by exploiting better shape representation and point generation strategy. Inspired by KPConv [47], we propose a novel representation called RepKPoints to effectively characterize the local geometry, whose advan-tages over prior representations are as follows: (1) density-sensitive; (2) large receptive fields; (3) position-adaptive, which makes RepKPoints a generalized form of previous representations. Moreover, we propose a novel paradigm, namely Kernel-to-Displacement generation, for point generation, where point cloud upsampling is reformulated as the deformation of kernel points. Specifically, we propose KP-Queries, which is a set of kernel points with predefined positions and learned features, to serve as the initial state of upsampling. Using cross-attention mechanisms, we achieve interactions between RepKPoints and KP-Queries, and subsequently KP-Queries are converted to displacement features, followed by a MLP to predict the new positions of KP-Queries which serve as the generated points. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RepKPU outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several widely-used benchmark datasets with high efficiency.
