 Adjoint-based design optimizations are usually computationally expensive and those costs scale with resolution. To address this, researchers have proposed machine learning approaches for inverse design that can predict higher-resolution solutions from lower cost/resolution ones. Due to the recent success of diffusion models over traditional generative models, we extend the use of diffusion models for multi-resolution tasks by proposing the conditional cascaded diffusion model (cCDM). Compared to GANs, cCDM is more stable to train, and each diffusion model within the cCDM can be trained independently, thus each modelâ€™s parameters can be tuned separately to maximize the performance of the pipeline. Our study compares cCDM against a cGAN model with transfer learning.
 Our results demonstrate that the cCDM excels in capturing finer details, preserving volume fraction constraints, and minimizing compliance errors in multi-resolution tasks when a sufficient amount of high-resolution training data (more than 102 designs) is available. Furthermore, we explore the impact of training data size on the performance of both models. While both models show decreased performance with reduced high-resolution training data, the cCDM loses its superiority to the cGAN model with transfer learning when training data is limited (less than 102), and we show the break-even point for this transition. Also, we highlight that while the diffusion model may achieve better pixel-wise performance in both low-resolution and high-resolution scenarios, this does not necessarily guarantee that the model produces optimal compliance error or constraint satisfaction.
