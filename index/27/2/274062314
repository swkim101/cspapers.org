This paper presents Metaâ€™s FBDetect system, which advances the state of the art in performance regression detection by catching regressions as small as 0.005% in noisy production environments. FBDetect monitors around 800,000 time series covering various types of metrics (e.g., throughput, latency, CPU and memory usage) to detect regressions caused by code or configuration changes in hundreds of services running on millions of servers. FBDetect introduces advanced techniques to capture stack traces fleet-wide, measure fine-grained subroutine-level performance differences, filter out deceptive false-positive regressions, deduplicate correlated regressions, and analyze root causes. Beyond these individual techniques, a key strength of FBDetect over prior work is its battle-tested robustness, proven by seven years of production use, and each year catching regressions that would have wasted millions of servers if left undetected.
