Finetuning the large vision-language models on video data with a set of learnable prompts has shown promising performance on zero-shot activity recognition but still requires extra video data and expensive training costs. Inspired by recent Test-time Prompt Tuning (TPT) on the image domain, this work attempts to extend TPT to video data for zero-shot activity recognition. However, monotonous spatial augmentation and short class names cannot meet the need to capture diverse and complicated semantics of human behavior during prompt tuning. To this end, this work proposes a Dual Temporal-Sync Test-time Prompt Tuning (DTS-TPT) framework for zero-shot activity recognition. DTS-TPT tunes the learnable prompts appended to text inputs on video feature sequences of different temporal scales in multiple steps during test time. In each tuning step, we minimize the semantic consistency among the predictions from video feature sequences randomly augmented via AugMix with both original class names and the corresponding description generated through LLM. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy by approximately 2% ~ 5% on popular benchmarks.
