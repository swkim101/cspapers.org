Language models often struggle with handling factual knowledge, exhibiting factual hallucination issue. This makes it vital to evaluate the models' ability to recall its parametric knowledge about facts. In this study, we introduce a knowledge probing benchmark, BELIEF(ICL), to evaluate the knowledge recall ability of both encoder- and decoder-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) from diverse perspectives. BELIEFs utilize a multi-prompt dataset to evaluate PLM's accuracy, consistency, and reliability in factual knowledge recall. To enable a more reliable evaluation with BELIEFs, we semi-automatically create MyriadLAMA, which has massively diverse prompts. We validate the effectiveness of BELIEFs in comprehensively evaluating PLM's knowledge recall ability on diverse PLMs, including recent large language models (LLMs). We then investigate key factors in memorizing and recalling facts in PLMs, such as model size, pretraining strategy and corpora, instruction-tuning process and in-context learning settings. Finally, we reveal the limitation of the prompt-based knowledge probing. The MyriadLAMA is publicized.
