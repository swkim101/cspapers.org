Carbon dots (C-Dots) have garnered significant attention in various fields, including biomedical applications, photocatalysis, sensing, and optoelectronics, due to their high luminescence, biocompatibility, and ease of functionalization. However, concerns regarding their potential toxicity persist. Conventional synthesis methods for C-Dots often require long reaction times, high pressures, expensive equipment, extreme temperatures, and toxic reagents. In contrast, microwave irradiation provides a rapid, cost-effective, and scalable alternative for the synthesis of high-quality C-Dots. In this study, we report the single-step, 3-min synthesis of water-stable carbon dots at 100 °C, 120 °C, and 140 °C using microwave irradiation. Particle stability was achieved through polyethyleneimine (PEI) functionalization. The toxicity of the synthesized carbon dots was evaluated in marine crustaceans, revealing that C-Dots with an estimated size below 10 nm did not exhibit toxicity after 24 and 48 h of exposure. These findings demonstrate the potential of microwave-synthesized carbon dots as non-toxic, water-stable nanomaterials for environmental and biomedical applications.
