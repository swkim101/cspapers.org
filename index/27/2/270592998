The digitalization of the supply chain represents a source of competitive advantage, involving the methodology of digitization and automation of flows through the utilization of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, IoT, and blockchain to ensure performance. Indeed, "The benefits of digitalizing the supply chain are numerous, including flexibility and responsiveness of the chain, cost minimization, enhancement of operational efficiency, reduction of errors and delays in processes, improvement of product visibility and traceability, data security, and enhancement of customer experience." However, the digitalization of the supply chain contributes to both strategic and operational excellence. Despite its crucial importance for competitiveness, there is a lack of experts capable of implementing Smart Supply Chains and intelligent technologies within the supply chain. Therefore, this article will address the advantages and implications of adopting intelligent technologies in supply chain management. The main objective of this research is to analyze the mediating effect of operational and strategic levers of Smart Supply Chain and intelligent technologies on supply chain performance. This perspective explores an innovative approach to assessing the performance of a Smart Supply Chain using the PROMETHEE II method (Elimination and Choice Translating Reality).
