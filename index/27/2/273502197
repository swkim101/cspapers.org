Open-domain long-form text generation requires generating coherent, comprehensive responses that address complex queries with both breadth and depth. This task is challenging due to the need to accurately capture diverse facets of input queries. Existing iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches often struggle to delve deeply into each facet of complex queries and integrate knowledge from various sources effectively. This paper introduces ConTReGen, a novel framework that employs a context-driven, tree-structured retrieval approach to enhance the depth and relevance of retrieved content. ConTReGen integrates a hierarchical, top-down in-depth exploration of query facets with a systematic bottom-up synthesis, ensuring comprehensive coverage and coherent integration of multifaceted information. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including LFQA and ODSUM, alongside a newly introduced dataset, ODSUM-WikiHow, demonstrate that ConTReGen outperforms existing state-of-the-art RAG models.
