We present ARTrackV2, which integrates two pivotal aspects of tracking: determining where to look (localization) and how to describe (appearance analysis) the target object across video frames. Building on the foundation of its predecessor, ARTrackV2 extends the concept by introducing a unified generative framework to “read out” object's trajectory and “retell” its appearance in an autoregressive manner. This approach fosters a time-continuous methodology that models the joint evolution of motion and visual features, guided by previous estimates. Furthermore, ARTrackV2 stands out for its efficiency and simplicity, obviating the less efficient intra-frame autoregression and hand-tuned parameters for appearance updates. Despite its simplicity, ARTrackV2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on prevailing benchmark datasets while demonstrating a remarkable efficiency improvement. In particular, ARTrackV2 achieves an AO score of 79. 5% on GOT-10k and an AUC of 86. 1% on TrackingNet while being 3.6× faster than ARTrack.
