We propose FlexibleBP , a novel cuffless blood pressure monitoring system using a wrist-worn flexible sensor to enhance comfort and accuracy. By capturing pulse wave signals from the radial artery, we develop a personalized estimation framework incorporating a Transformer model with fine-tuning. Experiments with 36 participants confirm FlexibleBP â€™s accuracy, meeting AAMI standards. This work marks a step toward more user-friendly, advanced wearable BP monitoring solutions.
