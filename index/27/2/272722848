In this paper, we delve into a novel aspect of learning novel diffusion conditions with datasets an order of magnitude smaller. The rationale behind our approach is the elimination of textual constraints during the few-shot learning process. To that end, we implement two optimization strategies. The first, prompt-free conditional learning, utilizes a prompt-free encoder derived from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. This strategy is designed to adapt new conditions to the diffusion process by minimizing the textual-visual cor-relation, thereby ensuring a more precise alignment between the generated content and the specified conditions. The second strategy entails condition-specific negative rectification, which addresses the inconsistencies typically brought about by Classifier-free guidance in few-shot training con-texts. Our extensive experiments across a variety of condition modalities demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework, yielding results comparable to those obtained with datasets a thousand times larger.
