The complex and diverse nature of software systems necessitates a careful manual approach to unveil vulnerabilities, involving deep analysis, creative problem-solving, and specialized expertise. Like all complex tasks, itâ€™s susceptible to mistakes stemming from cognitive limitations and behavioral factors that hinder optimal performance. Although there are significant research efforts focused on vulnerability discovery, little attention has been given to comprehending mistakes within the process. Understanding these mistakes could pave the way for better-designed education programs and automated tools, aiming to mitigate and prevent potential mistakes and enhance the efficiency of vulnerability research.In this paper, we leverage social media, specifically YouTube, to examine mistakes made by security content creators exploiting vulnerabilities in CTF-style challenges. Analyzing 30 screencasts from 11 hackers, we identified 124 distinct issues and investigated their types, underlying causes, and time investments. Additionally, we delved into the cognitive and behavioral aspects associated with these issues.
