State-of-the-art deep ISP models alleviate the dilemma of limited generalization capabilities across heterogeneous inputs by increasing the size and complexity of the network, which inevitably leads to considerable growth in parameter counts and FLOPs. To address this challenge, this paper presents MetaISP - a streamlined model that achieves superior reconstruction quality by adaptively modulating its parameters and architecture in response to diverse inputs. Our rationale revolves around obtaining corresponding spatial and channel-wise correction matrices for various inputs within distinct feature spaces, which assists in assigning optimal attention. This is achieved by predicting dynamic weights for each input image and combining these weights with multiple learnable basis matrices to construct the correction matrices. The proposed MetaISP makes it possible to obtain best performance while being computationally efficient. SOTA results are achieved on two large-scale datasets, e.g. 23.80dB PSNR on ZRR, exceeding the previous SOTA 0.19dB with only 9.2% of its parameter count and 10.6% of its FLOPs; 25.06dB PSNR on MAI21, exceeding the previous SOTA 0.17dB with only 0.9% of its parameter count and 2.7% of its FLOPs.
