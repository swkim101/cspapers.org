Time delay estimation using fixed-time terminal sliding mode control (TDEFxSMC) for unknown nonlinear systems with uncertainty and external disturbances is presented in this study. Firstly, the notion of fixed-time terminal sliding mode control (FxSMC) is outlined and thoroughly examined. Using the FxSMC scheme, nonsingular fixed-time control, non-chatter control inputs, and high performance tracking positions have been achieved. To estimate the unknown dynamics, proposed method incorporates a TDE scheme. The Lyapunov theorem is applied to find whether the proposed system can achieve its stability in a fixed-time. The effectiveness of the suggested method is evaluated and demonstrated by presenting the results of the proposed method implemented to the nonlinear robot dynamics.
