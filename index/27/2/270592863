The advancements in smart grid technologies have led to the development of highly efficient infrastructure for electric power transfer, addressing the limitations of the current power system. The integration of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar is therefore pertinent as the grid supply based on fossil fuels are not reliable. Problems such as Optimal Power Flow (OPF) arises because of this integration and MATPOWER an open-source non-linear solver can be used to solve the OPF problem. In this paper, while acknowledging their individual constraints, we modeled Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) and Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) systems and then incorporate them into a revised 5-bus power system from MATPOWER. The simulation of this integration which focused on the generation cost was done and the results shows AC optimal cost of different load demand for varying time.
