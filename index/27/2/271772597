We present AnnoRank, a web-based user interface (UI) framework designed to facilitate collecting crowdsource annotations in the context of information retrieval. AnnoRank enables the collection of explicit and implicit annotations for a specified query and a single or multiple documents, allowing for the observation of user-selected items and the assignment of relevance judgments. Furthermore, AnnoRank allows for ranking comparisons, allowing for the visualization and evaluation of a ranked list generated by different fairness interventions, along with its utility and fairness metrics. Fairness interventions in the annotation pipeline are necessary to prevent the propagation of bias when a user selects the top-ùëò items in a ranked list. With the widespread use of ranking systems, the application supports multimodality through text and image document formats. We also support the assessment of agreement between annotators to ensure the quality of the annotations. AnnoRank is integrated with the Ranklib library, offering a vast range of ranking models that can be applied to the data and displayed in the UI. Anno-Rank is designed to be flexible, configurable, and easy to deploy to meet diverse annotation needs in information retrieval. AnnoRank is publicly available as open-source software, together with detailed documentation, at https://github.com/ClaraRus/AnnoRank.
