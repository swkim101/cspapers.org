Ball bearings play a crucial role in rotating machineries, offering vital functions such as shaft support, vibration damping, and noise reduction. While numerous studies have explored the dynamics of ball bearings and simulated their vibration responses under single defect conditions, there is a notable gap in research concerning multiple defects. This work is dedicated to simulating vibration signals under various multiple defect scenarios using a 5 Degree of Freedom dynamic model. Additionally, a novel signal processing methodology is introduced for diagnosing compound defects, and it is applied to both simulated and experimental data. The results shed light on the bearing behaviour under multiple degradation conditions. The efficiency of the proposed signal processing method was demonstrated through synthetic and experimental data.
