A Novel weak signal detecting technique is proposed for event-driven maintenance/predictive diagnosis system in social infrastructure and industrial fields. The technique uses Stochastic Resonance (SR), a phenomenon that signals can be enhanced with especial noise strength in a non-linear system, as a method of sensitively detecting weak signals in a heavy noise environment. In this work, in order to sensitively detect weak signals, a non-linear circuit based on bistable potential system is designed and experimented. In the results, SR phenomenon was confirmed, and pulse signal detecting ratio was improved within audio band when signal-to-ratio is below 1 and can be used for the proposed application. The optimization of the circuit parameters is a future subject for application.
