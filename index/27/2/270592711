This paper delves into the design of a Gallium Nitride (GaN) based medium-frequency synchronous buck converter employing geometric programming (GP). GaN Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) are chosen for this configuration due to their minimized switching losses. The optimization process encompasses various constraints, such as current and voltage ripples, bandwidth, inductor dimensions, temperature, and magnetic flux density. The cost function is defined as total losses. The inductor utilized in this design features a homothetic shape and incorporates an air gap. The utilization of GP is advantageous for efficiently addressing problems with numerous variables, ensuring that the solution obtained is the global optimum if it exists. The paper aims to determine the values of the operating frequency, capacitor, inductor, and the dimensions of the inductor within this context.
