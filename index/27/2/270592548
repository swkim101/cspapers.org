Urban freight transport represents 15-20% of vehicular traffic, generating more than 20% of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from transport. Given its complexities, which differentiate it from passenger transport, it is necessary to address the opportunities for technological innovation on this topic in a distinct manner. The new generations of electric vehicles offer the opportunity to improve the environmental impact, but the use of electric vehicles cannot represent the only solution to all challenges related to urban freight transport in urban areas, which include, for example, congestion. Delivery parking is often limited and new European regulations relating to packaging collection require supply chain monitoring. The paper proposes the use of new distribution models to evaluate the impacts deriving from the use of electric vehicles for urban transportation. Through a case study applied to the city of Rome, which also includes the supply of an installation service, the polluting emissions of a light commercial vehicle are calculated, including the energy consumption if the vehicle is battery powered and the consequent time saving resulting from the adoption of micro hubs and cargo bikes for packaging collection. The results encourage a multidisciplinary approach to the topic of freight transport with electric vehicles as a planning tool for local authorities responsible for urban planning.
