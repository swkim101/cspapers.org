This paper presents a decentralized cooperative motion planning approach for surface inspection of 3D structures which includes uncertainties like size, number, shape, position, using multi-robot systems (MRS). Given that most of existing works mainly focus on surface inspection of single and fully known 3D structures, our motivation is two-fold: first, 3D structures separately distributed in 3D environments are complex, therefore the use of MRS intuitively can facilitate an inspection by fully taking advantage of sensors with different capabilities. Second, performing the aforementioned tasks when considering uncertainties is a complicated and time-consuming process because we need to explore, figure out the size and shape of 3D structures and then plan surface-inspection path. To overcome these challenges, we present a meta-learning approach that provides a decentralized planner for each robot to improve the exploration and surface inspection capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate our method can outperform other methods by approximately 10.5%-27% on success rate and 70%-75% on inspection speed.
