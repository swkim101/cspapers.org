Despite the significant advancements in pre-training methods for point cloud understanding, directly capturing intricate shape information from irregular point clouds without reliance on external data remains a formidable challenge. To address this problem, we propose GPSFormer, an innovative Global Perception and Local Structure Fitting-based Transformer, which learns detailed shape information from point clouds with remarkable precision. The core of GPSFormer is the Global Perception Module (GPM) and the Local Structure Fitting Convolution (LSFConv). Specifically, GPM utilizes Adaptive Deformable Graph Convolution (ADGConv) to identify short-range dependencies among similar features in the feature space and employs Multi-Head Attention (MHA) to learn long-range dependencies across all positions within the feature space, ultimately enabling flexible learning of contextual representations. Inspired by Taylor series, we design LSFConv, which learns both low-order fundamental and high-order refinement information from explicitly encoded local geometric structures. Integrating the GPM and LSFConv as fundamental components, we construct GPSFormer, a cutting-edge Transformer that effectively captures global and local structures of point clouds. Extensive experiments validate GPSFormer's effectiveness in three point cloud tasks: shape classification, part segmentation, and few-shot learning.
