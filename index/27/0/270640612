The host network integrates processor, memory, and peripheral interconnects to enable data transfer within the host. Several recent studies from production datacenters have established that contention within the host network can have significant impact on end-to-end application performance. The goal of this paper is to build an in-depth understanding of the various regimes and root causes of such contention within the host network. We present domain-by-domain credit-based flow control, a conceptual abstraction to study the host network. We show that the host network performs flow control over different domains (sub-networks within the host network), each having different numbers of credits and different unloaded latency. Different applications, depending on the source and the type of data transfer (compute or peripheral, and read or write), traverse different domains; thus, different applications may observe different performance degradation when the host network is contended. Exploring the host network from the lens of domain-by-domain credit-based flow control allows us to (1) near-precisely explain contention within the host network and its impact on networked application performance observed in previous studies; and (2) discover new, previously unreported, regimes of contention within the host network. More broadly, our study shows that contention within the host network is not merely due to limited host network resources but rather due to the poor interplay between processor, memory, and peripheral interconnects within the host network. Moreover, contention within the host network has implications that are more far-reaching than the context of networked applications considered in previous studies: all our observations hold even when all applications are contained within a single host. Our study thus opens up many interesting avenues of future research at the intersection of computer networking, operating systems and computer architecture.
