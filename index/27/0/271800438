This work explores the use of artificial whiskers as tactile sensors for enhancing the perception and navigation capabilities of mobile robots in challenging settings such as caves and underground mines. These environments exhibit inconsistent lighting conditions, locally self-similar textures, and general poor visibility conditions, that can cause the performance of state-of-the-art vision-based methods to decline. In order to evaluate the efficacy of tactile sensing in this context, three algorithms were developed and tested with simulated and physical experiments: a wall-follower, a navigation algorithm based on Theta*, and a hybrid approach that combines the two. The obtained results highlight the efficacy of tactile sensing for wall-following in intricate environments. When paired with an external method for pose estimation, it further aids in navigating unknown environments. Moreover, by integrating navigation with wall-following, the third, hybrid algorithm enhanced the map traversal speed by roughly 26âˆ’43% compared to standard navigation methods without wall-following.
