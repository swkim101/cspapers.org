We consider the facility location problem in the dynamic setting, where the goal is to efficiently process an intermixed sequence of point insertions and deletions while maintaining a high-quality and stable solution. Although the problem has been studied in the context of general metrics and low-dimensional spaces, much remains unknown concerning dynamic facility location in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present the first fully dynamic algorithm for facility location in high-dimensional spaces R d . For any c ≥ 1 , our algorithm achieves O ( c ) -approximation, supports point updates in ˜ O (poly( d ) n 1 /c + o (1) ) amortized time and incurs O (1) amortized recourse. More generally, our result shows that despite the linear-time lower bound on the update time for general metrics, it is possible to achieve sub-linear update times for metric spaces that admit dynamic nearest neighbour oracles. Experiments on real datasets confirm that our algorithm achieves high-quality solutions with low running time, and incurs minimal recourse.
