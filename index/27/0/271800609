In recent years, micromanipulation technology has achieved extensive applications in industry and life science. Improving the precision and bandwidth of the micromanipulator and simultaneously reducing size, weight, and cost pose significant challenges to the existing micromanipulator design and fabrication methods. Here, we propose a 3-RRS micromanipulator with an origami-inspired spherical joint based on the PC-MEMS process, aiming for miniaturization and cost-effectiveness. The spherical joint allows rotations of 140° around the x-axis approximately, 140° around the y-axis approximately, and 20° around the z-axis approximately. The micromanipulator has weights of 0.8 g, dimensions of 16 mm × 16 mm × 22 mm, and workspace of 0.7 mm3. The end platform of the micromanipulator can be equipped with various effectors to accomplish different kinds of tasks. Experimental results validated its high precision and bandwidth, exhibiting its potential to perform intricate micromanipulation tasks.
