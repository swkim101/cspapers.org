3D instance segmentation is a fundamental and critical task for enabling robots to operate effectively in unstructured 3D environments. In order to address the challenges posed by the high demand for large-scale annotated data and the limited availability of such data in the context of 3D instance segmentation, we study semi-supervised 3D instance segmentation problem and propose a novel end-to-end framework based on the mean teacher paradigm, named PCTeacher. Our PCTeacher generates both point-level and cluster-level pseudo labels to harness knowledge from unlabeled data. It notably enhances the training stability through end-to-end training and improves pseudo-label quality. Specifically, for point-level pseudo labels, PCTeacher employs a multi-view fusion strategy to achieve higher precision and recall. Regarding cluster-level pseudo labels, it introduces a hybrid grouping strategy to generate more potential proposals and utilizes a point-cluster agreement-based thresholding (PCAT) mechanism to fully exploit cluster-level pseudo labels. By combining and strengthening both point-level and cluster-level pseudo labels, our PCTeacher achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets across multiple labeled data ratios with a more compact network compared to the existing method.
