The increasing awareness of public health issues has highlighted the need for effective disinfection of crowded indoor public areas, leading to the development of automated disinfection robots. However, most of the existing robots spray disinfectant in all areas, and they are still immature to navigate in densely populated environments. Hence, in this paper, we design a new disinfection robotic system consisting of a mobile platform, an RGB-D camera, and a robotic arm with a spray disinfection device. To address the above challenges, we propose a vision-based method for accurately detecting high-touch areas in the surroundings, enabling the disinfection robot to achieve superior disinfection efficiency. In addition, we propose a dynamic pedestrian avoidance method, namely Socially Aware APF (SA-APF), which can predict the movement trend of pedestrians and plan the path in real-time. Both simulated and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our disinfection robot system, especially highlighting the ability to detect high-touch areas and navigate in the environment while avoiding dynamic pedestrians.
