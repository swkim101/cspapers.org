Remote center of motion (RCM) describes a robot with a rod-like end-effector operating through a hole in the interface separating the internal space from the external space. Considering that the control of RCM may be influenced by perturbations (noises) and that the end-effector is frequently replaced to complete different tasks, the structural information related to the robot manipulator and its rod-like end-effector may contain errors. This paper proposes an acceleration-level remote center of cyclic motion (ARC2M) control scheme, which takes into account the cyclic motion index and the physical limitations of robot manipulators to achieve repetitive motion planning and RCM control at the acceleration level. Additionally, a parameter calculation method is proposed to compute unknown parameters of the end-effector under the influence of noise. Kalman filter and a neural dynamics-based method are employed to address noises effects, and related theoretical analyses are given. To validate the proposed ARC2M scheme, simulations and physical experiments are carried out. The source code is available at https://github.com/LongJin-lab/ARCM.
