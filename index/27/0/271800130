In this paper, we introduce magnetic mobile micro-gripping microrobots with two independent actuation modes. By aligning two magnets with slight variations in magnetic moment orientations, we create a net magnetic moment for precise position and orientation control through external fields, while harnessing opposing torques on the magnets to induce internal stresses needed for gripping. Our microrobot design features a compliant spring-like structure for significant deflection, enabling a gripping motion under specific magnetic field conditions. Magnet rotation allows precise control over gripper actions, returning to a default state (normally open or closed) when the magnetic field diminishes. This work advances magnetic field-controlled microrobotics, bridging the millimeter-to-micrometer gap. It holds promise for applications in microsurgery, micro-assembly, and microscale exploration.
