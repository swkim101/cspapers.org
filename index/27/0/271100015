The primary objective of adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming is to enhance usersâ€™ quality of experience (QoE) by dynamically adjusting the video bitrate in response to changing network conditions. However, users often find frequent bitrate switching frustrating due to the resulting inconsistency in visual quality over time, especially during live streaming when buffer lengths are short. In this paper, we propose a practical smoothness optimized dynamic adaptive ( SODA ) controller that specifically addresses this problem while remaining deployable. SODA is backed by theoretical guarantees and has shown superior performance in empirical evaluations. Specifically, our numerical simulations show a 9.55% to 27.8% QoE improvement and our prototype evaluation shows a 30.4% QoE improvement compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. In order to be widely deployable, SODA performs bitrate horizon planning in polynomial time compared to brute force approaches that suffer from exponential complexity. To demonstrate its real-world practicality, we deployed SODA on a wide range of devices within the production network of Amazon Prime Video. Production experiments show that SODA reduced bitrate switching by up to 88.8% and increased average stream viewing duration by up to 5.91% compared to a fine-tuned production baseline.
