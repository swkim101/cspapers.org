We present a new class of curved block-based line structures whose component chains are flexible when separated, and provably rigid when assembled together into an interlocking double chain. The joints are inspired by traditional zippers, where a binding fabric or mesh connects individual teeth. Unlike traditional zippers, the joint design produces a rigid interlock with programmable curvature. This allows fairly strong curved structures to be built out of easily stored flexible chains. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline for generating these curved structures using a novel block design template based on revolute joints. Mesh embedded in these structures maintains block spacing and assembly order. We evaluate the rigidity of the curved structures through mechanical performance testing and demonstrate several applications.
