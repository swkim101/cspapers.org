This paper proposes a GPU-accelerated optimization framework for collision avoidance problems where the controlled objects and the obstacles can be modeled as the finite union of convex polyhedra. A novel collision avoidance constraint is proposed based on scale-based collision detection and the strong duality of convex optimization. Under this constraint, the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems of collision avoidance can be decomposed into several low-dimensional quadratic programmings (QPs) following the paradigm of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, these low-dimensional QPs can be solved parallel with GPUs, significantly reducing computational time. High-fidelity simulations are conducted to validate the proposed methodâ€™s effectiveness and practicality.
