High-resolution (HR) contact surface information is essential for robotic grasping and precise manipulation tasks. However, it remains a challenge for current taxel-based sensors to obtain HR tactile information. In this paper, we focus on utilizing low-resolution (LR) tactile sensors to reconstruct the localized, dense, and HR representation of contact surfaces. In particular, we build a Gaussian triaxial tactile sensor degradation model and propose a tactile pattern reconstruction framework based on the Kalman filter. This framework enables the reconstruction of 2-D HR contact surface shapes using collected LR tactile sequences. In addition, we present an active exploration strategy to enhance the reconstruction efficiency. We evaluate the proposed method in real-world scenarios with comparison to existing prior-information-based approaches. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach and demonstrate satisfactory reconstructions of complex contact surface shapes.
