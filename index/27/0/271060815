—Construction processes involving placement of heavy construction elements are high-risk activities. Typically, these activities are carried out by a team of masons using a lifting device (such as a crane). Following the technological development of other industries, there have been several attempts in construction to use robots for risky activities. This research work presents a multi-robotic system that consists of robots with complementary capabilities able to perform construction activities with heavy construction elements. The proposed solution consists of a “non-rigid” robot, such as a crane, and a mobile manipulator. The robotic system is able to perform heavy block assembly, while improving safety and productivity.
