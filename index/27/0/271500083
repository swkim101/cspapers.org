The Minimum Dominating Set Problem (MDSP) is an important NP-Hard optimization problem with many applications in various domains. This paper designs two exact algorithms for MDSP that use the same Branch-and-Bound framework. However, one uses LP relaxations as lower bounds for pruning the search space, and the other one is a pure combinatorial algorithm. The two algorithms possess a distinct advantage. Performance experiments on standard test datasets reveal that our combinatorial algorithm is over 1000 times faster than the previous state-of-the-art exact algorithm presented in IJCAI 2023, and our LP Relaxation algorithm can even enhance the speed of our combinatorial algorithm by over 100 times. However, our combinatorial algorithm still outperform the LP Relaxation algorithm on very dense graphs.
