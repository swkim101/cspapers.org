While existing dynamic architecture-based continual learning methods adapt network width by growing new branches, they overlook the critical aspect of network depth. We propose a novel non-parametric Bayesian approach to infer network depth and adapt network width while maintaining model performance across tasks. Specifically, we model the growth of network depth with a beta process and apply drop-connect regularization to network width using a conjugate Bernoulli process. Our results show that our proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods across various continual learning benchmarks. Moreover, our approach can be readily extended to unsupervised continual learning, showcasing competitive performance compared to existing techniques.
