This study proposes a novel movable microfluidic chip in which a microfluidic chip is integrated into a robotic manipulator for manipulating oocytes. The microfluidic device has the ability to release a single oocyte with a gap effect. The robotic manipulator can control the position of the microfluidic chip. The microfluidic chip with a pipette tip is directly fabricated using 3D printing. Xenopus oocyte was used in the experiment. When oocytes move from the back side of the channel to the front side, they generate gaps between each other. The gap distance can reach about 16 times the diameter of the oocyte. In addition, a capacitive sensor was used to detect oocytes in the manipulation processes. The results showed that oocytes were successfully released one by one with no deformation in shape using the movable microfluidic chip. The method has significant advantages in biomedicine engineering and micro-nano-manipulation.
