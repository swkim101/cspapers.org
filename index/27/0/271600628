Traditional legal retrieval systems designed to retrieve legal documents, statutes, precedents, and other legal information are unable to give satisfactory answers due to lack of semantic understanding of specific questions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in a variety of natural language processing tasks, which inspired us that we train a LLM in the legal domain to help legal retrieval. However, in the Chinese legal domain, due to the complexity of legal questions and the rigour of legal articles, there is no legal large model with satisfactory practical application yet. In this paper, we present DeliLaw, a Chinese legal counselling system based on a large language model. DeliLaw integrates a legal retrieval module and a case retrieval module to overcome the model hallucination. Users can consult professional legal questions, search for legal articles and relevant judgement cases, etc. on the DeliLaw system in a dialogue mode. In addition, DeliLaw supports the use of English for counseling. we provide the address of the system: https://data.delilegal.com/lawQuestion.
