This work presents an approach to use a last-level cache (LLC) in a memory hierarchy for cache-coherent real-time multicores that delivers a low worst-case latency (WCL) and higher performance than all of its counterparts. Our approach relies on the key observation that an exclusive memory hierarchy, by definition, eliminates back invalidations, which are one of the largest contributors to the WCL when using inclusive memory hierarchies. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no prior efforts that ensure the predictability of exclusive hierarchies for cache-coherent multicores. Consequently, in this work, we propose PECC, a predictable exclusive cache coherence mechanism, that achieves a lower average data access latency while providing a low WCL bound that scales linearly in the number of cores. Our evaluation shows that PECC reduces the bound by 6% and improves the average performance by 2.33Ã— over the predictable solution with an inclusive LLC.
