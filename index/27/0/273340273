We are trying to give meaning to a program’s source code The ideal would be a static object that we can study Neither operational nor axiomatic methods result in an object that is easy to study • Operational method results in a derivation (a kind of proof, since the rules are logical) which may not terminate if a loop does not • Axiomatic methods results in a proof involving potentially complex axioms of arithmetic
