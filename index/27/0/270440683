The diversity of recommendation is equally crucial as accuracy in improving user experience. Existing studies, e.g., Determinantal Point Process (DPP) and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), employ a greedy paradigm to iteratively select items that optimize both accuracy and diversity. However, prior methods typically exhibit quadratic complexity, limiting their applications to the re-ranking stage and are not applicable to other recommendation stages with a larger pool of candidate items, such as the pre-ranking and ranking stages. In this paper, we propose Contextual Distillation Model (CDM), an efficient recommendation model that addresses diversification, suitable for the deployment in all stages of industrial recommendation pipelines. Specifically, CDM utilizes the candidate items in the same user request as context to enhance the diversification of the results. We propose a contrastive context encoder that employs attention mechanisms to model both positive and negative contexts. For the training of CDM, we compare each target item with its context embedding and utilize the knowledge distillation framework to learn the win probability of each target item under the MMR algorithm, where the teacher is derived from MMR outputs. During inference, ranking is performed through a linear combination of the recommendation and student model scores, ensuring both diversity and efficiency. We perform offline evaluations on two industrial datasets and conduct online A/B test of CDM on the short-video platform KuaiShou. The considerable enhancements observed in both recommendation quality and diversity, as shown by metrics, provide strong superiority for the effectiveness of CDM.
