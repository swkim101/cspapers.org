Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has emerged as a frontier topic due to its capability to detect HOIs beyond a predefined set of categories. This task entails not only identifying the interactiveness of human-object pairs and localizing them but also recognizing both seen and unseen interaction categories. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for zero-shot HOI detection using Conditional Multi-Modal Prompts, namely CMMP. This approach enhances the generalization of large foundation models, such as CLIP, when fine-tuned for HOI detection. Unlike traditional prompt-learning methods, we propose learning decoupled vision and language prompts for interactiveness-aware visual feature extraction and generalizable interaction classification, respectively. Specifically, we integrate prior knowledge of different granularity into conditional vision prompts, including an input-conditioned instance prior and a global spatial pattern prior. The former encourages the image encoder to treat instances belonging to seen or potentially unseen HOI concepts equally while the latter provides representative plausible spatial configuration of the human and object under interaction. Besides, we employ language-aware prompt learning with a consistency constraint to preserve the knowledge of the large foundation model to enable better generalization in the text branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our detector with conditional multi-modal prompts, outperforming previous state-of-the-art on unseen classes of various zero-shot settings.
