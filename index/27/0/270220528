Recommender systems play important roles in various applications such as e-commerce, social media, etc. Conventional recommendation methods usually model the collaborative signals within the tabular representation space. Despite the personalization modeling and the efficiency, the latent semantic dependencies are omitted. Methods that introduce semantics into recommendation then emerge, injecting knowledge from the semantic representation space where the general language understanding are compressed. However, existing semantic-enhanced recommendation methods focus on aligning the two spaces, during which the representations of the two spaces tend to get close while the unique patterns are discarded and not well explored. In this paper, we propose DisCo to Disentangle the unique patterns from the two representation spaces and Collaborate the two spaces for recommendation enhancement, where both the specificity and the consistency of the two spaces are captured. Concretely, we propose 1) a dual-side attentive network to capture the intra-domain patterns and the inter-domain patterns, 2) a sufficiency constraint to preserve the task-relevant information of each representation space and filter out the noise, and 3) a disentanglement constraint to avoid the model from discarding the unique information. These modules strike a balance between disentanglement and collaboration of the two representation spaces to produce informative pattern vectors, which could serve as extra features and be appended to arbitrary recommendation backbones for enhancement. Experiment results validate the superiority of our method against different models and the compatibility of DisCo over different backbones. Various ablation studies and efficiency analysis are also conducted to justify each model component.
