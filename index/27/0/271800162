This paper presents a robustified time-optimal motion planning approach for navigating an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) from an initial state to a terminal state without colliding with obstacles, even when subjected to disturbances, which are modeled as random process noise and measurement noise. The approach iteratively solves the robustified problem by incorporating updated state-dependent safety margins for collision avoidance, the evolution of which is derived separately from the robustified problem. Additionally, a strategy for selecting an alternative terminal state to reach is introduced, which comes into play when the desired terminal state becomes infeasible considering the disturbances. Both of these contributions are integrated into a robustified motion planning and control pipeline, the efficacy of which is validated through simulation experiments.
