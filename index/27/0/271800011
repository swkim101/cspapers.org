Underwater robots are indispensable for aquatic exploration, yet their size and complexity often limit broader application. This research presents a pioneering micro autonomous underwater vehicle (µAUV) design. This robot is distinguished by its utilization of mass-produced drone components, novel jet propulsion mechanisms, and multifunctional spherical shell. Its architecture is modular, appendage-free, and largely seal-free. Preliminary tests highlight its motion capabilities and set new benchmarks for centimeter-scale µAUV advancements.
