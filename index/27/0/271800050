Direct teaching is a straightforward way of teaching new motion to robots. Active methods with torque sensors, for example, can be used so that the robot can follow the movements of the human, but such methods introduce delays. Alternatively, series clutch actuators are easily backdrivable without delay. However, vertical joints are subject to gravity torques, which need to be compensated when disengaging the clutch. We implemented passive gravity compensation to counteract the robotâ€™s weight, but this mechanism cannot compensate for varying payloads, as adjustable passive gravity compensation is relatively slow and mechanically complex. The varying payload causes an unintended joint movement, i.e. the arm falls down on its own, which is unacceptable during direct teaching. Therefore, this paper demonstrates how the torque output controlled with series clutch actuators can be used to compensate for varying payloads while maintaining high backdrivability. The proposed method is evaluated on a collaborative robot with a clutch in series for each actuator. Real-world experiments with payloads from 0 to 3 kg are conducted. During the experiments, the operator force is measured to evaluate the proposed method.
