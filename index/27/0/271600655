Reliably detecting when a deployed machine learning model is likely to fail on a given input is crucial for ensuring safe operation. In this work, we propose DECIDER (Debiasing Classifiers to Identify Errors Reliably), a novel approach that leverages priors from large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to detect failures in image classification models. DECIDER utilizes LLMs to specify task-relevant core attributes and constructs a ``debiased'' version of the classifier by aligning its visual features to these core attributes using a VLM, and detects potential failure by measuring disagreement between the original and debiased models. In addition to proactively identifying samples on which the model would fail, DECIDER also provides human-interpretable explanations for failure through a novel attribute-ablation strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks spanning subpopulation shifts (spurious correlations, class imbalance) and covariate shifts (synthetic corruptions, domain shifts), DECIDER consistently achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance, significantly outperforming baselines in terms of the overall Matthews correlation coefficient as well as failure and success recall.
