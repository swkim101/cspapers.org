Parametric Computer-aided design (CAD) enables the creation of reusable models by integrating variables into geometric properties, facilitating customization without a complete redesign. However, creating parametric designs in programming-based CAD presents significant challenges. Users define models in a code editor using a programming language, with the application generating a visual representation in a viewport. This process involves complex programming and arithmetic expressions to describe geometric properties, linking various object properties to create parametric designs. Unfortunately, these applications lack assistance, making the process unnecessarily demanding. We propose a solution that allows users to retrieve parametric expressions from the visual representation for reuse in the code, streamlining the design process. We demonstrated this concept through a proof-of-concept implemented in the programming-based CAD application, OpenSCAD, and conducted an experiment with 11 users. Our findings suggest that this solution could significantly reduce design errors, improve interactivity and engagement in the design process, and lower the entry barrier for newcomers by reducing the mathematical skills typically required in programming-based CAD applications
