Many emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications require on-demand provisioning of large-scale computing, which can only be enabled by leveraging distributed computing services interconnected through networking. To address such increasing demand for networking to serve AI tasks, we investigate new scheduling strategies to improve communication efficiency and test them on a programmable testbed. We also show relevant challenges and research directions.
