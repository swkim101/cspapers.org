Iontronic tactile sensors are promising to measure spatial-temporal contact information with high performance. However, no suitable measuring method has been presented, due to issues with crosstalk and non-negligible equivalent resistance. Hence, this study presents an impedance-separating method, which does not require complex analog components. A general Quadri-Terminal Impedance Network (QTIN) model is introduced to reduce crosstalk, which has specific compatibility with the impedance-separating method. The precise ranges are measured, showing non-rectangle shapes suitable for the response of iontronic tactile sensors. A simple denoising method is provided to reduce initial array noise obviously. This work could benefit various scenarios, such as human-robot interaction and physiological information monitoring.
