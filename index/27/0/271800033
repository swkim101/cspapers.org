Springtails are tiny arthropods that crawl and jump. They jump by temporarily storing elastic energy in resilin elastic cuticular structures and releasing that energy to accelerate a tail, called a furca, propelling them in the air. This paper presents an autonomous, springtail-inspired microrobot that can crawl and jump. The microrobot has a mass of 980mg and stands 13mm tall, and has on-board sensing, computation, and power, enabling autonomy. The microrobot was designed with a super-elastic shape memory alloy (SMA) spring that is manually loaded to store elastic energy. The on-board sensing and computation triggers an actuator at the jump frequency range that unlatches the spring, launching the microrobot into the air at speeds up to 3.171msâˆ’1. At the same time, the microrobot is capable of crawling, when actuated at frequencies lower or higher than the jump frequency range, demonstrating autonomous multi-modal locomotion. This work opens up new pathways toward autonomy in multi-modal microrobots.
