Visual servoing (VS) is a widely used technique in industries where there are hundreds of robots, but it requires accurate camera calibration including camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. However, it is labour-intensive to calibrate robots one-by-one in practical use. In this paper, we propose a neural uncalibrated VS policy (NUVS) that can adapt to calibration disturbances with an adaption mechanism and a control-oriented guidance. It bridges the disturbance adaption of classical VS methods and the large convergence of learning-based VS methods. NUVS estimates the calibration embedding from past observations and servos to the desired pose under the supervision of a PBVS that can access the ground truth in simulation. With this adaption mechanism, NUVS outperforms the classical IBUVS algorithm when facing large initial camera pose offsets under the calibration disturbance.
