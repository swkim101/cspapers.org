Novel-view synthesis based on visible light has been extensively studied. In comparison to visible light imaging, thermal infrared imaging offers the advantage of all-weather imaging and strong penetration, providing increased possibilities for reconstruction in nighttime and adverse weather scenarios. However, thermal infrared imaging is influenced by physical characteristics such as atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction, hindering the precise reconstruction of intricate details in thermal infrared scenes, manifesting as issues of floaters and indistinct edge features in synthesized images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a physics-induced 3D Gaussian splatting method named Thermal3D-GS. Thermal3D-GS begins by modeling atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction in three-dimensional media using neural networks. Additionally, a temperature consistency constraint is incorporated into the optimization objective to enhance the reconstruction accuracy of thermal infrared images. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our method, the first large-scale benchmark dataset for this field named Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis Dataset (TI-NSD) is created. This dataset comprises 20 authentic thermal infrared video scenes, covering indoor, outdoor, and UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) scenarios, totaling 6,664 frames of thermal infrared image data. Based on this dataset, this paper experimentally verifies the effectiveness of Thermal3D-GS. The results indicate that our method outperforms the baseline method with a 3.03 dB improvement in PSNR and significantly addresses the issues of floaters and indistinct edge features present in the baseline method. Our dataset and codebase will be released in \href{https://github.com/mzzcdf/Thermal3DGS}{\textcolor{red}{Thermal3DGS}}.
