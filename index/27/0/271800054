In this paper, we consider the problem of safety analysis of a closed-loop control system with anytime perception sensor. We formalize the framework and present a general procedure for safety analysis using reachable set computation. We instantiate the procedure for two concrete classes, namely, the classical discrete-time linear system with linear state feedback controller and an extension with variable update rates. We present an exact computational method based on polyhedral manipulations for the first class and an overapproximate method for the second class. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.
