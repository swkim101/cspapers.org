Motion scaling is essential to empower users to conduct precise manipulation during teleoperation for robot-assisted microsurgery (RAMS). A constant, small motion scaling ratio can enhance the precision of teleoperation but hinder the operator from quickly reaching distant targets. The concept of self-adaptive motion scaling has been proposed in previous work. However, previous frameworks required extensive manual tuning of core parameters, which significantly depends on prior knowledge and may potentially lead to non-optimal solutions. This paper presents a hybrid offline reinforcement learning and damping control approach to regulate the motion scaling ratio for different operations during offline training. This method can take user-specific characteristics into consideration and help them achieve better teleoperation performance. Comparisons are made with and without using the adaptive motion-scaling algorithm. Detailed user studies indicate that a suitable motion-scaling ratio can be obtained and adjusted online. The overall performance of the operators in terms of time cost for task completion is significantly improved, while the variance of average speed and the total distance for robot operation is reduced.
