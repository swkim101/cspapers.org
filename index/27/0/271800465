The presented work tackles the question of quantifying the pose deviations of robots subject to external disturbance forces. While this question may not be central for large robots perfectly rejecting disturbances through high controller gains, it is an important factor when considering collaborative settings where smaller robots may be deviated from their task because of unmodeled physical interactions. This is all the more true with human-robot collaboration where human capacities may fluctuate over time and have to be compensated by a proper adaptation of the robot control. To move forward in this direction, this work first derives a deviation prediction methodology and exemplifies it using three largely employed control approaches. The proposed prediction method is then validated using simulated and real robot experiments both in single and multiple robots cases. The obtained results constitute a stepping stone towards a quantitative metric for robots adapting their behaviour to human motor fluctuation.
