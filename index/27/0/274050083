Structural topology optimization is a computational method that distributes material within a design domain to achieve a structurally efficient layout. Topology optimization is particularly attractive for the design of aircraft structures, where low weight and high stiffness are essential criteria. Yet, a barrier to the broad implementation of topology optimization is that the results are not typically in a form that is readily manufactured. Consistent with a well-known understanding that trusses are efficient structures, many topology optimization results resemble a spaceframe structure. To create a manufacturable design, an interpreter has previously been developed to automatically convert topology optimization results into a producible welded-tube spaceframe. That interpreter accepts the optimization results file, uses image processing techniques to decipher a matching spaceframe, and creates a computer-aided-design model.
 This paper describes the enhancements made to the interpreter that were made to explicitly address characteristics that arise with air vehicle applications. Specifically, air frames support a curved outer skin that mostly requires a hollow core. Straight frame members are prone to violate the structureâ€™s design domain. Additionally, aircraft often exhibit symmetric geometry and loading. To properly address these circumstances, the results interpreter is expanded to provide the capabilities to generate curved members and accommodate symmetry. The enhancements to the interpreter are demonstrated on the frame of an aircraft with a bio-inspired, rotating empennage.
