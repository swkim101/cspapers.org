This study developed a high-precision paint deposition model that considers the position and direction of a spray-painting gun. Our angle-specific paint deposition model focused on the change in paint deposition due to the change in the painting angle; however, there was a problem with its versatility. We analyzed this problem, and the solution was achieved by separately modeling changes in the film thickness distribution using impact angle and spray distance, which were previously modeled together. For higher accuracy, a special function was proposed to convert the three-dimensional vector into two-dimensional coordinate values in the distribution function upper plane. To confirm the validity of our model, a painting test on an L-shaped surface was conducted, and the measured and predicted values were compared. The L-shaped surface is a typical shape in which the film thickness distribution changes with the angle; a complex path with varying distances and angles was employed. The results confirmed that the predicted values agreed well with the measured values in the L-shaped surface painting test, validating the developed model.
