Aligning multiple modalities in a latent space, such as images and texts, has shown to produce powerful semantic visual representations, fueling tasks like image captioning, text-to-image generation, or image grounding. In the context of human-centric vision, albeit CLIP-like representations encode most standard human poses relatively well (such as standing or sitting), they lack sufficient acuteness to discern detailed or uncommon ones. Actually, while 3D human poses have been often associated with images (e.g. to perform pose estimation or pose-conditioned image generation), or more recently with text (e.g. for text-to-pose generation), they have seldom been paired with both. In this work, we combine 3D poses, person's pictures and textual pose descriptions to produce an enhanced 3D-, visual- and semantic-aware human pose representation. We introduce a new transformer-based model, trained in a retrieval fashion, which can take as input any combination of the aforementioned modalities. When composing modalities, it outperforms a standard multi-modal alignment retrieval model, making it possible to sort out partial information (e.g. image with the lower body occluded). We showcase the potential of such an embroidered pose representation for (1) SMPL regression from image with optional text cue; and (2) on the task of fine-grained instruction generation, which consists in generating a text that describes how to move from one 3D pose to another (as a fitness coach). Unlike prior works, our model can take any kind of input (image and/or pose) without retraining.
