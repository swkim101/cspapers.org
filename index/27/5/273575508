The small dimensions of microfluidic channels allow for fast diffusive or passive mixing, which is beneficial for time-sensitive applications such as chemical reactions, biological assays, and the transport of to-be-detected species to sensors. In microfluidics, the need for fast mixing within milliseconds arises primarily because these devices are often used in fields where rapid and efficient mixing significantly impacts the performance and outcome of the processes. Active mixing with acoustics in microfluidic devices involves using acoustic waves to enhance the mixing of fluids within microchannels. Using sharp corners and wall patterns in acoustofluidic devices significantly enhances the mixing by acoustic streaming around these features. The streaming patterns around the sharp edges are particularly effective for the mixing because they can produce strong lateral flows that rapidly homogenize liquids. This work presents extensive characterizations of the effect of sharp-edged structures on acoustic mixing in bulk acoustic wave (BAW) mode in a silicon microdevice. The effect of side wall patterns in different angles and shapes, their positions, the type of piezoelectric transducer, and its amplitude and frequency have been studied. Following the patterning of the channel walls, a mixing time of 25 times faster was reached, compared to channels with smooth side walls exhibiting conventional BAW behavior. The average locally determined acoustic streaming velocity inside the channel becomes 14 times faster if sharp corners of 10Â° are added to the wall.
