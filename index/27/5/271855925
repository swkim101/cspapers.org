Indoor mapping data is crucial for navigation and accessibility, yet such data are widely lacking due to the manual labor and expense of data collection, especially for larger indoor spaces. In this demo paper, we introduce Drone-based Indoor Accessibility Mapping (DIAM), a drone-based indoor scanning system that efficiently produces 3D reconstructions of indoor spaces with automatically recognized and located accessibility features/barriers such as stairs, elevators, and doors automatically. With DIAM, our goal is to scan indoor spaces quickly and generate a precise, detailed, and visual 3D in-door accessibility map. We describe DIAMâ€™s system design
