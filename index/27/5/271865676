A novel algorithm for video lane detection is proposed in this paper. First, we extract a feature map for a current frame and detect a latent mask for obstacles occluding lanes. Then, we enhance the feature map by developing an occlusion-aware memory-based refinement (OMR) module. It takes the obstacle mask and feature map from the current frame, previous output, and memory information as input, and processes them recursively in a video. Moreover, we apply a novel data augmentation scheme for training the OMR module effectively. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing techniques on video lane datasets. Our codes are available at https://github.com/dongkwonjin/OMR.
