In this video, we present a scenario for developing vision-based Human-Robot Interaction (vHRI) components for Ubiquitous Robot Companion (URC) Intelligent Service Robots, which exploit strong Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. Here the URC means that it will provide the necessary services at any time and place to meet the user's requirements. Thus, it combines the network function with the current concept of a robot in order to enhance mobility and human interface. The vHRI components used in this video consist of caller identification, face recognition/verification, and gesture recognition. Firstly we perform face verification and recognition for the imposter and a member of family from face images of two users, respectively. After that, we use gesture recognition to provide the selection of TV channels under noise or long-distance environments. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness through vision-based scenario shown from video. The robot platform used in this video is WEVER, which is a URC intelligent service robot developed at Intelligent Robot Research Division in Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute (ETRI).
