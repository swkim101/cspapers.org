Anonymous credentials empower users with strong privacy controls by enabling them to selectively disclose specific attributes from a credential without unveiling other personal details. However, current anonymous credential systems confront two primary challenges: 1) Their designs are not tailored for resource-limited devices due to their dependence on computationally heavy techniques such as generic zero-knowledge or Groth-Sahai proofs at both presentation and verification phases; and 2) They pose complexities in deploying anonymous credentials as-a-service since users must maintain specific key materials and dedicated software. To tackle these challenges, we present SilentProof, a blockchain-backed anonymous authentication protocol, which offloads the responsibility of credential presentation from individual users to the blockchain. By harnessing the combined strengths of zero-knowledge proxy re-identification and blind signatures, SilentProof empowers the blockchain to create zero-knowledge proofs for users, while ensuring clear user consent and eliminating the need for direct access to user-specific attributes. This design broadens the use cases for anonymous credentials, making it ideal for scalable, secure, and privacy-centric authentication, especially for resource-limited clients. Furthermore, SilentProof lays the groundwork for a new era of privacy-preserving identity management as-a-service. We provide rigorous security proofs to validate our approach and have developed a SilentProof prototype, showcasing the protocol's practical efficiency.
