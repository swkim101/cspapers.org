Control-flow hijacking attacks remain a significant challenge in software security. Several means of protection and detection have been proposed but gaps still exist. To address such gaps, leading processor manufacturers have introduced new extensions in their latest-generation architectures, such as Pointer Authentication ( PA ) and Branch Target Identification ( BTI ) technologies in the ARMv8.5-A processor architecture. However, simply enabling these technologies would offer only limited security guarantees without trustworthy evidence of runtime integrity. To bridge this gap, we propose CFA +, a practical hardware-assisted control flow attestation mechanism with prevention capabilities. CFA + leverages ARMv8.5-Aâ€™s BTI security extension in combination with selective software instrumentation to enable lightweight always-on monitoring of the execution state without the need for maintaining in-memory control flow logs. The hybrid policy of CFA + enables immediate prevention or quick detection of control-flow violations while providing trustworthy evidence of runtime integrity. CFA + offers strong security guarantees for complex software stacks while maintaining high efficiency and scalability. Evaluation results demonstrate that CFA + incurs an average runtime overhead of less than 3% when applied to various benchmark applications, including the SPEC CPU2006 suite and nginx.
