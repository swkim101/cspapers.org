Quantum computers have the potential to solve important problems which are fundamentally intractable on a classical computer. The underlying physics of quantum computing platforms supports using multi-valued logic, which promises a boost in performance over the prevailing two-level logic. One key element to exploiting this potential is the capability to efficiently prepare quantum states for multi-valued, or qudit, systems. Due to the time sensitivity of quantum computers, the circuits to prepare the required states have to be as short as possible. In this paper, we investigate quantum state preparation with a focus on mixed-dimensional systems, where the individual qudits may have different dimensionalities. The proposed approach automatically realizes quantum circuits constructing a corresponding mixed-dimensional quantum state. To this end, decision diagrams are used as a compact representation of the quantum state to be realized. We further incorporate the ability to approximate the quantum state to enable a finely controlled trade-off between accuracy, memory complexity, and number of operations in the circuit. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in facilitating fast and scalable quantum state preparation, with performance directly linked to the size of the decision diagram.
