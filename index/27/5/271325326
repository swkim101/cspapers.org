The IETF released RFC 8446 in 2018 as the new TLS 1.3 standard, which recommends using X25519 for key exchange and Ed25519 for identity veriﬁcation. These computations are the most time-consuming steps in the TLS handshake. Intel introduced AVX-512 in 2013 as an extension of AVX2, and in 2018, AVX-512IFMA, a submodule of AVX-512 to further support 52-bit (integer) multipliers, was implemented on Cannon Lake CPUs. This paper ﬁrst revisits various optimization strategies for ECC and presents a more performant X25519/Ed25519 implementation using the AVX-512IFMA instructions. These optimization strategies cover all levels of ECC arithmetic, including ﬁnite ﬁeld arithmetic, point arithmetic, and scalar multiplication computations. Furthermore, we formally verify our ﬁnite ﬁeld implementation to ensure its correctness and robustness.
