Toaddresstheseaforementionedlimitations,weproposeCha-tRepair,thefirst fully automated conversation-driven APR approach that interleaves patch generation with instant feedback to perform APR in a conversational style. ChatRepair first feeds the LLM with relevant test failure information to start with, and then learns from both failures and successes of earlier patching attempts of the same bug for more powerful APR . For earlier patches that failed to pass all tests, we combine the incorrect patches with their corresponding relevant test failure information to construct a new prompt for the LLM to generate the next patch. In this way, we can avoid making the same mistakes. For earlier patches that passed all the tests (i.e., plausible patches), we further ask the LLM to generate alternative variations of the original plausible patches. In this way, we can further build on and learn from earlier successes to generate more plausible patches to increase the chance of having correct patches. While our approach is general, we implement ChatRepair using state-of-the-art dialogue-based LLM â€“ ChatGPT. Our evaluation on the widely studied Defects4j dataset shows that ChatRepair is able to achieve the newstate-of-the-artinrepairperformance,achieving114and48cor-rectfixesonDefects4j1.2and2.0respectively.Bycalculatingthecost ofaccessingChatGPT,wecanfix162outof337bugsfor$0.42each!
