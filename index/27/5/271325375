We introduce S EC VID, a correction-based framework that defends video recognition systems against adversarial attacks without prior adversarial knowledge. It uses discretization-enhanced video compressive sensing in a black-box pre-processing module, transforming videos into a sparse domain to disperse and neutralize perturbations. While S EC VIDâ€™s discretized compression disrupts perturbation continuity, its reconstruction process minimizes adversarial elements, causing only minor distortions to the original videos. Though not completely restoring adversarial videos, S EC VID significantly enhances their quality, enabling accurate classification by S EC VID-enhanced video classifiers and preventing adversarial attacks. Tested on C3D and I3D with the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets against five types of advanced video attacks, S EC VID outperforms existing defenses, improving detection accuracy by 38.5% to 866.2%. Specifically designed for high-risk environments, S EC VID addresses trade-offs like minor accuracy reduction, additional pre-processing training, and longer inference times, with potential optimization through selective security impacting strategies.
