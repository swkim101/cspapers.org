Digital ticketing systems typically offer ticket purchase, refund, validation, and, optionally, anonymity of users. However, it would be interesting for users to transfer their tickets, as is currently done with physical tickets. We propose Applause, a ticketing system allowing the purchase, refund, validation, and transfer of tickets based on trusted authority, while guaranteeing the anonymity of users, as long as the used payment method provides anonymity. To study its security, we formalise the security of the transferable E-Ticket scheme in the game-based paradigm. We prove the security of Applause computationally in the standard model and symbolically using the protocol verifier ProVerif. Applause relies on standard cryptographic primitives, rendering our construction efficient and scalable, as shown by a proof-of-concept. In order to obtain Spotlight, an auditable version, proved to be secure, users will remain anonymous except for a trusted third party, which will be able to disclose their identity in the event of a disaster.
