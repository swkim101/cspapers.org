Unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) 001 task aims to find word translations between 002 languages and has achieved great success in 003 similar language pairs. However, related works 004 mostly rely on a single linear mapping for lan-005 guage alignment and fail on distant or low-006 resource language pairs, achieving less than 007 half the performance observed in rich-resource 008 language pairs. In this paper, we introduce DM-009 BLI , a D ynamic M ultiple subspaces alignment 010 framework for unsupervised BLI . DM-BLI im-011 proves language alignment by utilizing mul-012 tiple subspace alignments instead of a single 013 mapping. We begin via unsupervised clustering 014 to discover these subspaces in source embed-015 ding space. Then we identify and align corre-016 sponding subspaces in the target space using a 017 rough global alignment. DM-BLI further em-018 ploys intra-cluster and inter-cluster contrastive 019 learning to refine precise alignment for each 020 subspace pair. Experiments conducted on stan-021 dard BLI datasets for 12 language pairs (6 rich-022 resource and 6 low-resource) demonstrate sub-023 stantial gains achieved by our framework. We 024 release our code to facilitate the community. 025
