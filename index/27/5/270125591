mmWave networks offer wide bandwidth for high-speed wireless communication but suffer from limited range and susceptibility to blockage. Existing coverage provisioning solutions not only incur high costs but also require significant expert knowledge and manual efforts. In this paper, we present AutoMS, an automated service framework to optimize mmWave coverage by strategically designing and placing low-cost passive metasurfaces. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) joint optimization of metasurface phase configurations and placement as well as access point beamforming codebooks. (2) a fast 3D ray-tracing simulator for accelerated large-scale metasurface channel modeling. (3) a metasurface design amenable to ultra-low-cost hot stamping fabrication, featuring high reflectivity, near 2π phase control, and wideband support. Simulation and testbed experiments show that AutoMS can increase the median received signal strength by 11 dB in target rooms and over 20 dB at previous blind spots, and improve the median throughput by over 3× in real-world scenarios.
