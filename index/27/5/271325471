The collection of network data poses a significant challenge for machine/deep learning-driven network defense systems. This paper proposes a new paradigm, namely In-network Serverless Data Collection (ISDC), to eliminate the bottle-neck between network infrastructure (where data is generated) and security application servers (where data is consumed). Considering the extremely mismatched scale between traffic volume and in-network resources, we stress the need to prioritize flows based on the application’s interests, and a sub-linear prediction algorithm is proposed to prioritize specific flows to optimize resource consumption effectively. Additionally, a negotiation-free task migration mechanism with task-data isolation is introduced to allocate tasks dynamically across the network to enhance resource efficiency. Furthermore, ISDC incorporates a serverless data migration and aggregation mechanism to ensure data integrity and serves as a reliable and distributed data source for network defense systems. We present two use cases to demonstrate the feasibility of ISDC, namely covert channel detection and DoS/DDoS attack detection. In both scenarios, ISDC achieves significantly higher flow coverage and feature accuracy compared to existing schemes, leading to improved attack detection accuracy. Remarkably, ISDC’s data integrity addresses a model self-poisoning issue caused by duplicated and fragmented flow measurements generated during collaborative measurements.
