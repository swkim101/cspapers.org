The Internet congestion control landscape is rapidly evolving. Since the introduction of BBR and the deployment of QUIC, it has become increasingly commonplace for companies to modify and implement their own congestion control algorithms (CCAs). To respond effectively to these developments, it is crucial to understand the state of CCA deployments in the wild. Unfortunately, existing CCA identification tools are not future-proof and do not work well with modern CCAs and encrypted protocols like QUIC. In this paper, we articulate the challenges in designing a future-proof CCA identification tool and propose a measurement methodology that directly addresses these challenges. The resulting measurement tool, called Nebby , can identify all the CCAs available in the Linux kernel and BBRv2 with an average accuracy of 96.7%. With Nebby , we detected the deployment of BBRv3 in June 2023 before it was formally announced at the IETF. We show that Nebby is extensible by extending it for an undocumented family of CCAs that is deployed by 6% of the measured websites, including major corporations like Hulu and Apple.
