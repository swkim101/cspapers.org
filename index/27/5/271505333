Recently, various deep denoising methods have been proposed to solve the insufficient feature problem in image denoising. These methods can be mainly classified into two categories: (1) Injecting learnable tensors into denoising backbone to supplement feature, which is effective to some extent but may cause serious over-fitting. (2) Using diverse natural images from large image datasets to synthesize noisy images and pre-train denoising models, which can bring model generalization but require large model size and expensive training costs. To address these issues, this paper proposes Implicit Prompt Learning for Image Denoising (IPLID) method to flexibly generate adaptive prompts without meticulously designing them. Specifically, we first introduce an efficient Linear Prompt (LP) block with ultra-few parameters to produce dynamic prompts for both different stages and samples in denoising procedure. We further propose an efficient Compact Feature Fusion (CFF) block to process previous multi-level prompted denoising feature to reconstruct the denoising images. Finally, to further efficiently and effectively produce satisfactory prompt and denoising performance, a Gradient Accumulation (GA) learning scheme is proposed. Experiments on multiple benchmarks showed that the proposed IPLID achieves competitive results with only 1 percent of pre-trained backbone parameters, outperforming classical denoising methods in both efficiency and quality of restored images.
