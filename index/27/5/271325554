We present a practical framework to formally and automatically detect security flaws in client-side security mechanisms. In particular, we leverage Web Platform Tests (WPT), a popular cross-browser test suite, to automatically collect browser execution traces and match them against Web invariants, i.e., intended security properties of Web mechanisms expressed in first-order logic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by validating 9 invariants against the WPT test suite, discovering violations with clear security implications in 104 tests for Firefox, Chromium and Safari. This artifact includes the source code of all the components of the trace verification pipeline and the execution traces and outputs for all experiments presented in the paper. In particular, all violations discovered in the WPT tests (Sec 5.1) and the new testing suite used to assess the impact of the comprehensiveness of tests on the pipeline results (Sec 5.3). To support the independent validation of the results, the artifact includes scripts to re-execute the pipeline on the violating tests.
