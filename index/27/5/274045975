 In multi-agent Bayesian optimization for Design Space Exploration (DSE), identifying a communication network among agents to share useful design information for enhanced cooperation and performance, considering the trade-off between connectivity and cost, poses significant challenges. To address this challenge, we develop a distributed multi-agent Bayesian optimization (DMABO) framework and study how communication network structures/connectivity and the resulting cost would impact the performance of a team of agents when finding the global optimum. Specifically, we utilize Lloydâ€™s algorithm to partition the design space to assign distinct regions to individual agents for exploration in the distributed multi-agent system (MAS). Based on this partitioning, we generate communication networks among agents using two models: 1) a range-limited model of communication constrained by neighborhood information; and 2) a range-free model without neighborhood constraints. We introduce network density as a metric to quantify communication costs. Then, we generate communication networks by gradually increasing the network density to assess the impact of communication costs on the performance of MAS in DSE. The experimental results show that the communication network based on the range-limited model can significantly improve performance without incurring high communication costs. This indicates that increasing the density of a communication network does not necessarily improve MAS performance in DSE. Furthermore, the results indicate that communication is only beneficial for team performance if it occurs between specific agents whose search regions are critically relevant to the location of the global optimum. The proposed DMABO framework and the insights obtained can help identify the best trade-off between communication structure and cost for MAS in unknown design space exploration.
