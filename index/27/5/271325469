QR code payment has gained enormous popularity in the realm of mobile transactions, but concerns regarding its security keep growing. To bolster the security of QR code payment, we propose P QRA UTH , an innovative implicit second-factor authentication approach that exploits smartphone poses. In the proposed approach, when a consumer presents a payment QR code on her smartphone to a merchant’s QR code scanner, the scanner’s camera captures not only the QR code itself but also the smartphone’s poses. By utilizing poses as an additional factor, in conjunction with QR code decoding, the scanner verifies the authenticity of the smartphone presenting the QR code. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of P QRA UTH , affirming its security, accuracy and robustness.
