In order to enable extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured radiology reports, we introduce RadGraph-XL, a large-scale, expert-annotated dataset for clinical entity and relation extraction. RadGraph-XL consists of 2,300 radiology reports, which are annotated with over 410,000 entities and relations by board-certified radiologists. Whereas previous approaches focus solely on chest X-rays, RadGraph-XL includes data from four anatomy-modality pairs - chest CT, abdomen/pelvis CT, brain MR, and chest X-rays. Then, in order to automate structured information extraction, we use RadGraph-XL to train transformer-based models for clinical entity and relation extraction. Our evaluations include comprehensive ablation studies as well as an expert reader study that evaluates trained models on out-of-domain data. Results demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of previous methods by up to 52% and notably outperforms GPT-4 in this domain. We release RadGraph-XL data as well as our trained model to foster further innovation and research in structured clinical information extraction 1 .
