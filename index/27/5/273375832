This paper presents, FastForward (FF), a novel full duplex relay that constructively forwards signals such that wireless network throughput and coverage is significantly enhanced. FF is a Layer 1 in-band full duplex device, it receives and transmits signals directly and simultaneously on the same frequency. It cleanly integrates into existing networks (both WiFi and LTE) as a separate device and does not require changes to the clients. FF's key invention is a constructive filtering algorithm that transforms the signal at the relay such that when it reaches the destination, it constructively combines with the direct signals from the source and provides a significant throughput gain. We prototype FF using off-the-shelf software radios running a stock WiFi PHY and show experimentally that it provides a 3× median throughput increase and nearly a 4× gain at the edge of the coverage area.
