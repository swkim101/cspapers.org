In large-scale online service systems, numerous Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as service response time and error rate, are gathered in a time-series format. KPI Anomaly Detection (KAD) is a critical data mining problem due to its widespread applications in real-world scenarios. However, KAD faces the challenges of dealing with KPI heterogeneity and noisy data. We propose KAD-Disformer , a K PI A nomaly D etection approach through Dis entangled Trans former . KAD-Disformer pre-trains a model on existing accessible KPIs, and the pre-trained model can be effectively “fine-tuned” to unseen KPI using only a handful of samples from the unseen KPI. We propose a series of innovative designs, including disentangled projection for transformer, unsupervised few-shot fine-tuning ( uTune ), and denoising modules, each of which significantly contributes to the overall performance. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that KAD-Disformer surpasses the state-of-the-art universal anomaly detection model by 13% in F1-score and achieves comparable performance using only 1/8 of the fine-tuning samples saving about 25 hours.
