Empathy is a social mechanism used to sup-001 port and strengthen emotional connection with 002 others, including in online communities. How-003 ever, little is currently known about the nature 004 of these online expressions, nor the specific fac-005 tors that may lead to their improved detection. 006 In this work, we study the role of a specific 007 and complex subcategory of linguistic phenom-008 ena, figurative language, in online expressions 009 of empathy. Our extensive experiments reveal 010 that incorporating features regarding the use of 011 metaphor, idiom, and hyperbole into empathy 012 detection models improves their performance, 013 resulting in impressive maximum F 1 scores of 014 0.942 and 0.809 for identifying posts without 015 and with empathy, respectively. 016
