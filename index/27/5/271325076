The rise of mobile payment apps necessitates robust user authentication to ensure legitimate user access. Traditional methods, like passwords and biometrics, are vulnerable once a device is compromised. To overcome these limitations, modern solutions utilize sensor data to achieve user-agnostic and scalable behavioral authentication. However, existing solutions face two problems when deployed to real-world applications. First, it is not robust to noisy background activities. Second, it faces the risks of privacy leakage as it relies on centralized training with users’ sensor data. In this paper, we introduce FAMOS, a novel authentication framework based on federated multi-modal contrastive learning. The intuition of FAMOS is to fuse multi-modal sensor data and cluster the representation of one user’s data by the action category so that we can eliminate the influence of background noise and guarantee the user’s privacy. Furthermore, we incorporate FAMOS with federated learning to enhance performance while protecting users’ privacy. We comprehensively evaluate FAMOS using real-world datasets and devices. Experimental results show that FAMOS is efficient and accurate for real-world deployment. FAMOS has an F1-Score of 0.91 and an AUC of 0.97, which are 42.19% and 27.63% higher than the baselines, respectively.
