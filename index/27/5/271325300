The ecosystem of censorship circumvention tools (CTs) remains one of the most opaque and least understood, overshad-owed by the precarious legal status around their usage and operation, and the risks facing those directly involved. Used by hundreds of millions of users across the most restricted networks, these tools circulate not through advertisements but word-of-mouth, distributed not through appstores but under-ground networks, and adopted not out of trust but from the sheer necessity for information access. This paper aims to elucidate the dynamics and challenges of the CT ecosystem, and the needs and priorities of its stake-holders. We perform the first multi-perspective study, sur-veying 12 leading CT providers that service upwards of 100 million users, combined with experiences from CT users in Russia and China. Beyond the commonly cited technical challenges and disruptions from censors, our study also highlights funding constraints, usability issues, misconceptions, and misbehaving players, all of which similarly plague the CT ecosystem. Having the unique opportunity to survey these at-risk CT stakeholders, we outline key future priorities for those involved. We hope our work encourages further research to advance our understanding of this complex and uniquely challenged ecosystem.
