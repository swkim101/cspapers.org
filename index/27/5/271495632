Proper attire is a professional requirement for teachers and teachers' dress influence students' perceptions of teacher quality. Therefore, evaluating teacher attire can better regulate and improve the teacherâ€™s dress. However, the lack of a dataset on teacher attire hinders the development of this field. For this purpose, this paper constructs a Teachers' Classroom Dress Assessment (TCDA) dataset. To our knowledge, it is the first dataset focused on teacher attire. This dataset is entirely from the classroom environment, covering 25 teacher attributes, with a total of 11879 teacher dress samples and sufficient positive and negative examples. Therefore, the TCDA dataset is a challenging evaluation dataset with characteristics such as data diversity. In order to verify the effectiveness of the dataset, this paper systematically explores a new perspective on human attribute information and proposes for the first time a Teachers' Dress Assessment Method (TDAM), aiming to use predicted teacher attributes to scoring the overall attire of each teacher, thereby promoting the development of the teacher's classroom teaching field. The experimental results demonstrate the rationality of the TCDA dataset and the effectiveness of the TDAM method.
