The spatial non-uniformity and diverse patterns of shadow degradation conflict with the weight sharing manner of dominant models, which may lead to an unsatisfactory compromise. To tackle with this issue, we present a novel strategy from the view of shadow transformation in this paper: directly homogenizing the spatial distribution of shadow degradation. Our key design is the random shuffle operation and its corresponding inverse operation. Specifically, random shuffle operation stochastically rearranges the pixels across spatial space and the inverse operation recovers the original order. After randomly shuffling, the shadow diffuses in the whole image and the degradation appears in a homogenized way, which can be effectively processed by the local self-attention layer. Moreover, we further devise a new feed forward network with position modeling to exploit image structural information. Based on these elements, we construct the final local window based transformer named HomoFormer for image shadow removal. Our HomoFormer can enjoy the linear complexity of local transformers while bypassing challenges of non-uniformity and diversity of shadow. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of our HomoFormer across public datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/jiexiaou/HomoFormer.
