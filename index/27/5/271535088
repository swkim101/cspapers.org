As manipulating images may lead to misinterpretation of the visual content, addressing the image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) problem has drawn serious public concerns. In this work, we propose a simple assumption that the effective forensic method should focus on the mesoscopic properties of images. Base on the assumption, a novel two-stage self-supervised framework leveraging the diffusion model for IFDL task, i.e., DiffForensics, is proposed in this paper. The DiffForensics begins with self-supervised denoising diffusion paradigm equipped with the module of encoder-decoder structure, by freezing the pre-trained encoder (e.g., in ADE-20K) to inherit macroscopic features for general image characteristics, while encour-aging the decoder to learn microscopic feature represen-tation of images, enforcing the whole model to focus the mesoscopic representations. The pre-trained model as a prior, is then further fine-tuned for IFDL task with the customized Edge Cue Enhancement Module (ECEM), which progressively highlights the boundary features within the manipulated regions, thereby refining tampered area local-ization with better precision. Extensive experiments on several public challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The proposed DiffForensics could significantly improve the model's capabilities for both accurate tamper detection and precise tamper localization while con-currently elevating its generalization and robustness.
