Personalized federated learning (PFL) is designed for scenarios with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) client data. Existing model mixup-based methods, one of the main approaches of PFL, can only extract either global or personalized features during training, thereby limiting effective knowledge sharing among clients. To address this limitation, we propose the Dual Calibration-based PFL (DC-PFL). It divides local models into a heterogeneous feature extractor and a homogeneous classifier. The FL server utilizes mean and covariance representations from clients' feature extractors to train a global generalized classifier, facilitating information exchange while preserving privacy. To enhance personalization and convergence, we design a feature extractor-level calibration method with an auxiliary loss for local models to refine feature extractors using global knowledge. Furthermore, DC-PFL refines the global classifier through the global classifier-level calibration, utilizing sample representations derived from an approximate Gaussian distribution model specific to each class. This method precludes the need to transmit original data representations, further enhancing privacy preservation. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DC-PFL outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods, surpassing the best-performing baseline by 1.22% and 9.22% in terms of accuracy on datasets CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.
