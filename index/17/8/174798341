Spectre attacks and their many subsequent variants are a new vulnerability class affecting modern CPUs. The attacks rely on the ability to misguide speculative execution, generally by exploiting the branch prediction structures, to execute a vulnerable code sequence speculatively. In this paper, we propose to use Control-Flow Integrity (CFI), a security technique used to stop control-flow hijacking attacks, on the committed path, to prevent speculative control-flow from being hijacked to launch the most dangerous variants of the Spectre attacks (Spectre-BTB and Spectre-RSB). Specifically, CFI attempts to constrain the possible targets of an indirect branch to a set of legal targets defined by a pre-calculated control-flow graph (CFG). As CFI is being adopted by commodity software (e.g., Windows and Android) and commodity hardware (e.g., Intel’s CET and ARM’s BTI), the CFI information becomes readily available through the hardware CFI extensions. With the CFI information, we apply CFI principles to also constrain illegal control-flow during speculative execution. Specifically, our proposed defense, SpecCFI, ensures that control flow instructions target legal destinations to constrain dangerous speculation on forward control-flow paths (indirect calls and branches). We augment this protection with a precise speculation-aware hardware stack to constrain speculation on backward control-flow edges (returns). We combine this solution with existing solutions against branch target predictor attacks (Spectre-PHT) to close all known non-vendor-specific Spectre vulnerabilities. We show that SpecCFI results in small overheads both in terms of performance and additional hardware complexity.
