Despite the broad adoption of both Apache Spark and Apache Solr, there is little integration between these two platforms to support scalable, end-to-end text analytics. We believe this is a missed opportunity, as there is substantial synergy in building analytical pipelines where the results of potentially complex faceted queries feed downstream text processing components. This demonstration explores exactly such an integration: we evaluate performance under different analytical scenarios and present three simple case studies that illustrate the range of possible analyses enabled by seamlessly connecting Spark to Solr.
