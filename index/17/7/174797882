In this paper, we study context-response matching with pre-trained contextualized representations for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots. Existing models, such as Cove and ELMo, are trained with limited context (often a single sentence or paragraph), and may not work well on multi-turn conversations, due to the hierarchical nature, informal language, and domain-specific words. To address the challenges, we propose pre-training hierarchical contextualized representations, including contextual word-level and sentence-level representations, by learning a dialogue generation model from large-scale conversations with a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture. Then the two levels of representations are blended into the input and output layer of a matching model respectively. Experimental results on two benchmark conversation datasets indicate that the proposed hierarchical contextualized representations can bring significantly and consistently improvement to existing matching models for response selection.
