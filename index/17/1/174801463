Semantic segmentation and instance level segmentation made substantial progress in recent years due to the emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs). A number of deep architectures with Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) were proposed that surpass the traditional machine learning approaches for segmentation by a large margin. These architectures predict the directly observable semantic category of each pixel by usually optimizing a cross-entropy loss. In this work we push the limit of semantic segmentation towards predicting semantic labels of directly visible as well as occluded objects or objects parts, where the networkâ€™s input is a single depth image. We group the semantic categories into one background and multiple foreground object groups, and we propose a modification of the standard cross-entropy loss to cope with the settings. In our experiments we demonstrate that a CNN trained by minimizing the proposed loss is able to predict semantic categories for visible and occluded object parts without requiring to increase the network size (compared to a standard segmentation task). The results are validated on a newly generated dataset (augmented from SUNCG) dataset.
