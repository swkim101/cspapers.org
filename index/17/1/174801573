Since the advent of the computer, many circuit analysis programs have been developed for the purpose of eliminating much of the expensive breadboarding associated with a design. However, a large class of circuits cannot be analyzed by the programs and hence many circuits are still being evaluated only by breadboard methods. A much larger class of circuits could be analyzed by the programs if the limitations on circuit size, input, and output were removed. Described in this paper is a new non-linear d-c circuit analysis program called TESS-DC, which was designed specifically to analyze a much larger class of d-c problems. Included in this paper is the description as well as an example of the program's input language. The program's capabilities are presented and a number of flow diagrams provided to illustrate the operation of the program.
