POGO is an operational interactive graphics system which allows one to create inter- active graphics programs with relatively little elapsed time, programming expertise, or graphics expertise. It features a design program for composing CRT control “pages” by example instead of by programming, and facilities for cleanly inter- facing such pages with FORTRAN computational and control subroutines, and with a standard set of curve input and display pages. The presentation will include a description of our development and usage experience, and a film showing the use of POGO in creating interactive graphics programs for trajectory analysis, for analysis of fluid balance in the human body, and for creating parts of POGO itself.
