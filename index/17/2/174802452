Irregular data structures, as exemplified with sparse matrices, have proved to be essential in modern computing. Numerous sparse formats have been investigated to improve the overall performance of Sparse Matrix-Vector multiply (SpMV). But in this work we propose instead to take a fundamentally different approach: to automatically build sets of regular sub-computations by mining for regular sub-regions in the irregular data structure. Our approach leads to code that is specialized to the sparsity structure of the input matrix, but which does not need anymore any indirection array, thereby improving SIMD vectorizability. We particularly focus on small sparse structures (below 10M nonzeros), and demonstrate substantial performance improvements and compaction capabilities compared to a classical CSR implementation and Intel MKL IE's SpMV implementation, evaluating on 200+ different matrices from the SuiteSparse repository.
