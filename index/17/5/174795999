Modern in-home entertainment platforms---representing the evolution of the humble television of yesteryear---are packed with features and content: they offer a dizzying array of programs spanning hundreds of channels as well as a catalog of on-demand programs offering tens of thousands of options.

At a high level, our goal is to provide natural speech-based access to these myriad features as an alternative to physical button entry on a remote control.
