The importance of repeatability, replicability, and reproducibility is broadly recognized in the computational sciences, both in supporting desirable scientific methodology as well as sustaining empirical progress. This workshop tackles the replicability challenge for ad hoc document retrieval, via a common Docker interface specification to support images that capture systems performing ad hoc retrieval experiments on standard test collections.
