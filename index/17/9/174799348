The connection between continuous-time dynamics and discrete-time algorithms has led to the introduction of many methods in optimization. We add to this body of work by introducing a family of descent dynamics and descent algorithms with matching non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. We use this framework to introduce a new first-order algorithm, called rescaled gradient descent (RGD), and show that RGD achieves a faster convergence rate than gradient descent provided the function is strongly smooth - a natural generalization of the standard smoothness assumption on the objective function. When the objective function is convex, we present two frameworks for accelerating descent methods, one in the style of Nesterov and the other in the style of Monteiro and Svaiter. Rescaled gradient descent can be accelerated under the same strong smoothness assumption using both frameworks. We provide several examples of strongly smooth loss functions in machine learning and numerical experiments that verify our theoretical findings.
