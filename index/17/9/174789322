In the force control of cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs), inverse dynamics (ID) algorithms are required that can consider the actuation constraints imposed by cables. As a result, a variety of different ID solution methods have been developed. This paper uses the opensource Cable-robot Analysis and Simulation Platform for Research (CASPR) to compare the properties exhibited by different ID solvers over a wide range of different CDPR types with different mechanism parameters. The results are analysed to provide better insight into determining the appropriate ID solver for different applications and a test set of CDPRs is developed to be used as a benchmarking set for future ID research.
