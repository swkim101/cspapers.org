This paper aims to build efﬁcient convolutional neural networks using a set of Lego ﬁlters. Many successful building blocks, e.g. inception and residual modules, have been designed to refresh state-of-the-art records of CNNs on visual recognition tasks. Beyond these high-level modules, we suggest that an ordinary ﬁlter in the neural network can be upgraded to a sophisticated module as well. Filter modules are established by assem-bling a shared set of Lego ﬁlters that are often of much lower dimensions. Weights in Lego ﬁlters and binary masks to stack Lego ﬁlters for these ﬁlter modules can be simultaneously optimized in an end-to-end manner as usual. Inspired by network engineering, we develop a split-transform-merge strategy for an efﬁcient convolution by exploiting intermediate Lego feature maps. The compression and acceleration achieved by Lego Networks using the proposed Lego ﬁlters have been theoretically discussed. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and deep models demonstrate the advantages of the proposed Lego ﬁlters and their potential real-world applications on mobile devices.
