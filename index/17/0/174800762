Projects, org charts, and software architecture are the best representations of value creation we have today. They are insufficient to support the scale and complexity of the software that is powering more and more of the world economy. In this talk, Dr. Kersten will propose a new set of abstractions for understanding and improving how software is built. He will introduce the concept of Value Stream Networks, which provide a set of models that span beyond the software architecture to include all of the artifacts involved in building software, from business idea to customer support. He will then show how we can visualize and operate on this new model in order to gain insights into the ground truth of what flows through organizations delivering software, and how we can improve that flow using the Flow Frameworkâ„¢. Kersten will summarize his experiences from open source, building a successful startup, and supporting some of the largest Agile and DevOps transformations in order to propose ideas for the research and practices still needed to better understand and manage software delivery at scale.
