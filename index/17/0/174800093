We consider the PAC learnability of the functions at the nodes of a discrete networked dynamical system, assuming that the underlying network is known. We provide tight bounds on the sample complexity of learning threshold functions. We establish a computational intractability result for efficient PAC learning of such functions. We develop efficient consistent learners when the number of negative examples is small. Using synthetic and real-world networks, we experimentally study how the network structure and sample complexity influence the quality of inference.
