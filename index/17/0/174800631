Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised machine learning. Lloyd’s 1957 algorithm for kmeans clustering remains one of the most widely used due to its speed and simplicity, but the greedy approach is sensitive to initialization and often falls short at a poor solution. This paper explores an alternative to Lloyd’s algorithm that retains its simplicity and mitigates its tendency to get trapped by local minima. Called power k-means, our method embeds the k-means problem in a continuous class of similar, better behaved problems with fewer local minima. Power k-means anneals its way toward the solution of ordinary k-means by way of majorization-minimization (MM), sharing the appealing descent property and low complexity of Lloyd’s algorithm. Further, our method complements widely used seeding strategies, reaping marked improvements when used together as demonstrated on a suite of simulated and real data examples.
