Neural network models have recently gained traction for sentence-level intent classification and token-based slot-label identification. In many real-world scenarios, users have multiple intents in the same utterance, and a token-level slot label can belong to more than one intent. We investigate an attention-based neural network model that performs multi-label classification for identifying multiple intents and produces labels for both intents and slot-labels at the token-level. We show state-of-the-art performance for both intent detection and slot-label identification by comparing against strong, recently proposed models. Our model provides a small but statistically significant improvement of 0.2% on the predominantly single-intent ATIS public data set, and 55% intent accuracy improvement on an internal multi-intent dataset.
