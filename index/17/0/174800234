We study an online and streaming unsupervised classiﬁcation system. Our setting consists of a collection of classiﬁers (with unknown confusion matrices) each of which can classify one sample per unit time, and which are accessed by a stream of unlabeled samples. Each sample is dis-patched to one or more classiﬁers, and depending on the labels collected from these classiﬁers, may be sent to other classiﬁers to collect additional labels. The labels are continually aggregated. Once the aggregated label has high enough accuracy (pre-speciﬁed threshold for accuracy) or the sample is sent to all the classiﬁers, the now labeled sample is ejected from the system. For any given pre-speciﬁed accuracy threshold, the ob-jective is to sustain the maximum possible sample arrival rate, such that the number of samples in memory does not grow unbounded. In this paper, we characterize the Pareto-optimal region of accuracy and arrival rate, and develop an algo-rithm that can operate at any point within this region. Our algorithm uses queueing-based routing and scheduling approaches combined with a novel online tensor decomposition method to learn the hidden parameters, to Pareto-optimality guarantees. We ﬁnally verify our theoretical results through simulations on two ensembles formed using AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet deep image classiﬁers.
