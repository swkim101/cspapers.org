It studies the changing regulation of fast out-of-step separation criterion based on equivalent two-machine power system. Analysis of the characteristics of the caring variables of fast out-of-step separation criterion on sending end and receiving end is mentioned. In order to solve the problem that the out-of-step connecting line cannot be identified correctly apply on the criterion of the existing fast out-of-step separation if the measurement point at the receiving end, it improves the power angle and active power criterion. The simulation is carried out in our actual grid model with using BPA and the results of the simulation handled by MATLAB proves that the out-of-step of line can be distinguished by using the improved fast out-of-step separation criterion in each end of line.
