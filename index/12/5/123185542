A new flatness error measurement method was proposed for large quantities of E-type AC relay, which was consisted of three discontinuous plane. The research object of this thesis is on both sides of the work piece plane. The relay was measured by utilizing multiple laser displacement sensors, and used the development of PC software to extract the measurement key points and process the collected data, which was used the method of least squares to calculate more accurate flatness error value. This method can achieve substandard work-piece fast sorting and rapid online measure.
