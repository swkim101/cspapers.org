This paper develops a constructive theory of randomness for functions based on computational complexity. We present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that transforms pairs (g,r), where g is any one-way (in a very weak sense) function and r is a random k-bit string, to polynomial-time computable functions f/sub r/:{1,..., 2/sup k} /spl I.oarr/ {1, ..., 2/sup k/}. These f/sub r/'s cannot be distinguished from random functions by any probabilistic polynomial time algorithm that asks and receives the value of a function at arguments of its choice. The result has applications in cryptography, random constructions and complexity theory.
