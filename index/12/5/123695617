Some new impulsive integral inequalities related to certain integral inequalities are established, which extend the results proved by J. Li in [On some new impulsive integral inequalities, Journal of Inequalities and Applications, Vol. 200. The inequalities given here can be used as basic tools in the qualitative theory of certain impulsive differential and integral equations.
