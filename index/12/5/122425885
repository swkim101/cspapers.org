In this paper, new upper and lower bounds are obtained for the number of gates in parallel prefix circuits with minimum depth when the number of inputs is a power of two. In addition, structural information concerning these circuits is described. Parallel prefix circuits with bounds imposed on the fan-out of the gates are also considered. In both cases, the upper and lower bounds obtained differ by small constant factors.
