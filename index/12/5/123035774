In this paper, the nonlinear analysis of the motion structures is studied by using the vector form intrinsic finite element (VFIFE, V-5) method. The main object of this research is to develop an internal hinge of two ends of the plane frame element. In this study, the hinge function of frame element is used to compute the nonlinear dynamic responses of the motion structures. A fictitious reversed rigid body motion can be used to separate the rigid body motions and the pure deformations of the frame element. It is not requires any iteration or any parameters for the VFIFE method during computation process. Four examples illustrate the accuracy of the proposed procedures in computing large motions of a flying flexible structure.
