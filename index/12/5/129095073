A new version of SODA, which covers the time period 1958–2005, is used to analyze decadal variability of the Pacific Subtropical Cell (STC) circulation. The analysis is based on transport time series across 9°S and 9°N. At the interannual time scale, STC convergence anomalies decrease during El Niños and increase during La Niñas through Sverdrup transport convergence changes. At decadal time scales, the assimilation shows a reduction of interior STC convergence of about 8 Sv from the 1960s to the 1990s and a subsequent rebound into the early 2000s by a similar amount, in agreement with the STC tendencies reported earlier from geostrophic section analysis, and associated with the occurrence and intensity of ENSO events among the decades analyzed. The results are compared with, and differ significantly from, those obtained by the German ECCO (GECCO) assimilation.
