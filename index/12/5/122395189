Shape recognition methods based on one-dimensional global feature Fourier descriptors have been widely used for the computational simplicity and high recognition rate. However, in cases of occlusion, local deformation or other complex degradation this approach shows poor performance. In this paper we present a new shape recognition method with a novel shape similarity metric, which fuses three different metrics, all of which are rotation, translation and scaling invariant. These metrics takes into account the normalized shape variance, phase correlation and modified Fourier descriptor. Experimental results show that the proposed method has high recognition rate even when the object undergoes some shape deformation. When compared with other traditional shape recognition methods, the proposed method demonstrates significantly improved performance.
