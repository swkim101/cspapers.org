The problem is to organize search from an AND node in a way that minimizes expected cost. The result is derived as a corollary to earlier work of Simon and Kadane. It is shown that, unless knowledge gained during the search changes the probability or cost estimates of remaining parts of the search, the original a priori strategy remains optimal. The effect of approximating the search statistics used to determine the optimal strategy is examined, and it is found that the impact on expected cost is linearly bounded by the quality of the approximation. Then the case of searching an infinite conjunct is considered. Finally, some related research topics are discussed.
