ABSTRACT A method for selecting boundary conditions and deformation modes for redundantly constrained flexible components in mechanical system dynamics is presented. Gaussian elimination is used to partition the coefficient matrix in equilibrium equations for each flexible component, leading to definition of a retained statically determinate set and a redundant set of boundary conditions. A method for selection of deformation modes is presented, to account for deformation due to constraint reaction forces. A door-closing mechanism and a moving flexible beam illustrate the method of selecting boundary conditions and the effectiveness of constraint modes for approximation of system dynamic response.
