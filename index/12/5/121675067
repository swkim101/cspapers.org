This paper models the electromagnetic force/torque of a long-stroke magnetically levitated planar motor. Based on the Lorenz force volume integral law and the force/torque superposition principle of rigid body, the electromagnetic force/torque is modeled. Experimenting results indicate the model is consistent with the measured results in sine distribution and sine period, and the errors between the model values and the measured values originate mainly from the measurement system. So this model represents analytically the electromagnetic forces and torques of the planar motor and it can be used to commutate and control the planar motor.
