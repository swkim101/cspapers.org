This paper discuses a new topology optimization method using frame elements for the design of mechanical structures at the conceptual design phase. The optimal configurations are determined by maximizing multiple eigen-frequencies in order to obtain the most stable structures for dynamic problems. The optimization problem is formulated using frame elements having ellipsoidal cross-sections, as the simplest case. Construction of the optimization procedure is based on CONLIN and the complementary strain energy concept. Finally, several examples are presented to confirm that the proposed method is useful for the topology optimization method discussed here.Copyright Â© 2005 by ASME
