It is well known that the tenacity is a proper measure for studying vulnerability and reliability in graphs. Here, a modified edge-tenacity of a graph is introduced based on the classical definition of tenacity. Properties and bounds for this measure are introduced; meanwhile edge-tenacity is calculated for cycle graphs and also for complete graphs.
