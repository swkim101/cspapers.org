In order to get an image with every object in focus, an image fusion process is required to fuse the images under different focal settings. In this paper, a new multifocus image fusion algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is based on Laplacian pyramid and Gabor filters. The source images are decomposed by Laplacian pyramid, then the directional edges feature and detail information can be obtained by Gabor filters. Different fusion rules are applied to the low frequency and high frequency coefficients. The experimental results show that the algorithm is simple and effective.
