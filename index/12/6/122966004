Many Studies has carried on the technology of detecting invariants, for example, Daikon can detect most of invariant by presetting some types of them. But unary polynomial inequality likely invariants are rarely discovered by traditional tools. An effective method to detect unary polynomial inequality likely invariant was proposed in this paper. Through analyzing the property of value ranges of unary polynomial inequality likely invariants, the algorithm set the threshold value and calculates neighbor distances to determine the form of invariants. Finally, experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.
