In this paper, a parametric structural shape and topology optimization method is presented. To solving structure optimization problems, the level-set method has become a powerful design tool and been widely used in many fields. Combined with the Radial Basis Functions (RBF), which is a popular tool in function approximation, the method of level-set can be represented in a parametric way with a set of advantages comparing with the conventional discrete means. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate its advantages.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
