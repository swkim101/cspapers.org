Based on the theorem of generalized synchronization for discrete chaos systems, a new discrete chaos synchronization system was designed. Using the new system and the properties of sensitive dependent on initial condition, a novel S-box generation approach was proposed. An affine transformation was used to shuffle S-box. Testing the cryptographic properties shows that the S-box generated in the proposed algorithm has sound cryptographic performance.
