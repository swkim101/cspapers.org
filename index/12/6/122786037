Human face detection is the first critical step of face recognition system. This paper proposed a face detection method based on skin color feature. Firstly, the method of building a skin color feature from RGB to YCbCr and extracting skin color region according the chrominance similarity was used to extract the face gray image. Secondly, image smoothness and image binarization were used to receive the binary image, then mathematical morphology operators were used to eliminate the binary images noise and disturbance. At last, human face regions are detected through projection operation. The result of experimentation affirms that the method is efficient to detect human face.
