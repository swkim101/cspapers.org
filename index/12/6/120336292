In this paper for LBG algorithm is very sensitive to initial code book, clonal selection algorithm is introduced and splitting method is adopted to generate the initial code book. Besides, because similarity metric based on euclidean distance can only reflect local consistency of the clustering instead of the clustering global consistency, clonal selection clustering method in terms of manifold distance is put forward to produce and optimize the final code book. Furthermore, it is proved through the experiment that algorithm of clonal selection code book design based on themanifold distance(MDCSA) is characterized by better performance .
