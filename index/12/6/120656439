Aiming at the paradox of D-S evidence theory and computations exponential growth in dealing with large scale conflict evidence combination, a new weighted evidence combination method was proposed, which used conflict coefficient and evidence distance in order to measure the conflict. Through the analysis of single conflict representations weaknesses, compound conflict coefficient has been put forward, meanwhile, the evidence center and current center distance were defined, evidence weight was determined with current center distance and conflict coefficient. The experiment results show that the algorithm settles the paradox effectively, at the same time, computing speed has been greatly enhanced.
