In order to improve the online verification calculation speed of relay settings and solve the defects of traditional partition method, which is difficult to measure the reasonable of partition results and unable to determine the optimal number of partitions. An optimal partitioning strategy of power grid based on GN splitting algorithm is presented in this paper. The initial partition of power grid was achieved through effectively utilizing the maximum edge betweenness and the optimal number of partitions was determined by calculating and comparing the weighted modularity. Then through defining a quantitative metric of checking calculation time and regarding as the optimal objective, the boundary nodes were migrated and the optimal partition was achieved. Through calculating and analyzing the 500kV network of Zhejiang grid, the results show that the method is correct and effective.
