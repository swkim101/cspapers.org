In a condom sorting process, we need to shoot the state image of condom through the camera and do the ellipse detection to determine the front position of condom on the conveyor belt, so developing the image processing algorithms which can detect the condom ring is necessary. The algorithm based on the Hough circle detection can obtain better detection effect for the most forms of the condom ring position, but it can not correctly detect the circle when the image shows linear shape; the algorithm based on the contrast of the ring detection get better effect on the ring in the image showing linear, while it has a low recognition rate in more folded case. We combined the two algorithms to use, proposed a combined algorithm which overcame the respective shortcomings of the two algorithms. Verified by experiment, the results of detection, recognition rate and the average processing time show the combined algorithms get the best comprehensive effect.
