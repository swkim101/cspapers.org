The Cable or Pipe between the Two Relatively Rotating Platforms Exists the Twisted Problem. from Viewpoint of Braid Group Theory, Rope’s Twisted State is Researched on. Based on the Characteristics of a Special Garside Braids Δn and Δnk , the Equivalence of Two Rotation Modes is Revealed. also, that the Determination of Rotation Mode’s Minimum Rotate Range is 4∏ while Using Braid Theory is Proposed. the Theory of Braid Group can Not only be Used as a Criterion for Determine Whether the Cable is Twisted, Finally, but also can be Used as Avoid Cable Twisted during Mechanism Design.
