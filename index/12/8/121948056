According to the unreasonable phenomenon of coordination of V/Hz limit and over-excitation protection, summarize the coordination principles of V/Hz limit and over-excitation protection with definite time and the principles of V/Hz limit and over excitation protection with inverse time. Analysis the operation characteristics of V/Hz limit and over-excitation protection, and understand two sets of schemes of over-excitation. By learning the relevant theoretical knowledge and their function, it can be derived that V/Hz restriction should take precedence over excitation protection action. On this basis, combined with engineering example to analysis, put forward to consider a reasonable difference to guarantee the safety of generations better when both have a reasonable coordination.
