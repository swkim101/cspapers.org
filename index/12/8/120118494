This paper presents a new method for adapting the existing manufacturing system for a requirement change, such as the change of a required motion task, by modifying its kinematic structure from the viewpoint of the degrees of freedom of the end effecter of the mechanism. In a previous report, the authors formulated the kinematic structure and motion task using Lie algebra. In this report, using these representations and their inclusion relations, the authors propose a method for evaluating the reusability of a kinematic structure for a newly specified motion task, and then propose a method for reconfiguring the mechanism in Lie algebra according to the result of the reusability evaluation. Finally, in order to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed method, it is applied to a kinematic design example of a mechanism.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
