In this paper, we consider a model of game-theoretic learning based on online mirror descent (OMD) with asynchronous and delayed information. Instead of focusing on a specific class of games (such as zero-sum or potential games), we introduce a general equilibrium stability notion for games with continuous action spaces, which we cal variational stability. Our first contribution is that the “last iterate” (that is, the induced sequence of play) of OMD converges to variationally stable equilibria provided that the feedback delays faced by the players are synchronous and bounded. Subsequently, to tackle fully decentralized, asynchronous environments with unbounded feedback delays, we propose a variant of OMD which we call delayed mirror descent (DMD), and which relies on the repeated leveraging of past information. With this modification, the algorithm converges to variationally stable equilibria, with no feedback synchronicity assumptions, and even when the delays grow superlinearly relative to the game’s horizon.
