We present LBS-AE; a self-supervised autoencoding algorithm for fitting articulated mesh models to point clouds. As input, we take a sequence of point clouds to be registered as well as an artist-rigged mesh, i.e. a template mesh equipped with a linear-blend skinning (LBS) deformation space parameterized by a skeleton hierarchy. As output, we learn an LBS-based autoencoder that produces registered meshes from the input point clouds. To bridge the gap between the artist-defined geometry and the captured point clouds, our autoencoder models pose-dependent deviations from the template geometry. During training, instead of us- ing explicit correspondences, such as key points or pose supervision, our method leverages LBS deformations to boot- strap the learning process. To avoid poor local minima from erroneous point-to-point correspondences, we utilize a structured Chamfer distance based on part-segmentations, which are learned concurrently using self-supervision. We demonstrate qualitative results on real captured hands, and report quantitative evaluations on the FAUST benchmark for body registration. Our method achieves performance that is superior to other unsupervised approaches and com- parable to methods using supervised examples.
