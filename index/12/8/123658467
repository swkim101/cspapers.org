In this paper, we design a dynamic state feedback smooth stabilizer for a nonlinear system whose Jacobian linearization may have uncontrollable because its eigenvalues are on the right half-plane. After designing an augmented system, a dynamic exponent scaling and back stepping enable one to explicitly design a smooth stabilizer and a continuously differentiable Lyapunov function which is positive definite and proper.
