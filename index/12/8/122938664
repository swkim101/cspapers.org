Robotic path planning algorithm is an important research content of optimization. The improved path planning algorithm, based on distance measurement, use the feature vector for obtaining the location and for identifies different distances in search space. In order to improve the efficient of collision detection, the earth feature vector and taboo search theory were used as tools, combined with partial matching tech and fuzzy logic could get faster and more accurate outcomes than the algorithm only use fuzzy logic.
