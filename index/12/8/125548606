We give an arithmetic algorithm using $O(|G|^{\omega/2 + o(1)})$ operations to compute the generalized Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) over group $G$ for finite groups of Lie type, including the linear, orthogonal, and symplectic families and their variants, as well as all finite simple groups of Lie type. Here $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication, so the exponent $\omega/2$ is optimal if $\omega = 2$. Previously, "exponent one" algorithms were known for supersolvable groups and the symmetric and alternating groups. No exponent one algorithms were known (even under the assumption $\omega = 2$) for families of linear groups of fixed dimension, and indeed the previous best-known algorithm for $SL_2(F_q)$ had exponent $4/3$ despite being the focus of significant effort. We unconditionally achieve exponent at most $1.19$ for this group, and exponent one if $\omega = 2$. We also show that $\omega = 2$ implies a $\sqrt{2}$ exponent for general finite groups $G$, which beats the longstanding previous best upper bound (assuming $\omega = 2$) of $3/2$.
