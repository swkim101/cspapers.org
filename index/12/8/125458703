Determining the appropriate batch size for mini-batch gradient descent is always time consuming as it often relies on grid search. This paper considers a resizable mini-batch gradient descent (RMGD) algorithm-inspired by the randomized weighted majority algorithm-for achieving best performance in grid search by selecting an appropriate batch size at each epoch with a probability defined as a function of its previous success/failure and the validation error. This probability encourages exploration of different batch size and then later exploitation of batch size with history of success. At each epoch, the RMGD samples a batch size from its probability distribution, then uses the selected batch size for mini-batch gradient descent. After obtaining the validation error at each epoch, the probability distribution is updated to incorporate the effectiveness of the sampled batch size. The RMGD essentially assists the learning process to explore the possible domain of the batch size and exploit successful batch size. Experimental results show that the RMGD achieves performance better than the best performing single batch size. Furthermore, it attains this performance in a shorter amount of time than that of the best performing. It is surprising that the RMGD achieves better performance than grid search.
