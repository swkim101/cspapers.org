The second workshop on Searching Spontaneous Conversational Speech (SSCS 2008) was held in Singapore on July 24, 2008 in conjunction with the 31st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference. The goal of the workshop was to bring the speech community and the information retrieval community together. The forum was designed to be conducive to the close interaction and the intense discussion necessary to promote fusion of these fields into a single discipline with a concerted vision of spoken content retrieval. The proceedings contain papers on a wide range of topics including vocabulary independent search, spoken term detection, combination of models/indexes, use of speech recognition lattices for search, segmentation, temporal analysis, benchmarking, exploitation of prosody, speech surrogates for user interfaces and multi-language collections. A workshop reprot has been published in ACM SIGIR Forum, issue December 2008.
