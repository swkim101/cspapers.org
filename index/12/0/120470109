The output feedback control problem is addressed for a class of switched fuzzy Systems. Using multiple Lyapunov function method and switching law, the relevant closed-loop system is asymptotically stable, with the switching law designed to implement the global asymptotic stability. The sufficient conditions to ensure the output feedback asymptotically stable output feedback control of closed-loop system are studied. The sufficient condition is transformed into Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem which are more solvable. Finally, a numerical simulation example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness and the convergence of the design methodologies.
