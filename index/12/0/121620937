In this paper a novel modular framework for adaptive control for a class of nonlinear system is developed and applied to flight controller design. The framework is based on the invariant manifolds approach with a new type of reduced-order estimator which allows for stable dynamics to be assigned to the estimation error. We show that this method can be applied to systems with unknown parameters, leading to a new class of modular adaptive controllers which is easier to tune compared to controllers obtained using the classical adaptive approaches and does not suffer from unpredictable dynamical behavior of the parameter update laws.
