The instantaneous forward problem (IFP) singularities of a parallel manipulator (PM) must be determined during the manipulator design and avoided during the manipulator operation, because they are configurations where the end-effector pose (position and orientation) cannot be controlled by acting on the actuators any longer, and the internal loads of some links become infinite. When the actuators are locked, PMs become structures consisting of one rigid body (platform) connected to another rigid body (base) by means of a number of kinematic chains (limbs). The geometries (singular geometries) of these structures where the platform can perform infinitesimal motion correspond to the IFP singularities of the PMs the structures derive from. This paper studies the singular geometries both of the PS-2RS structure and of the 2PS-RS structure. In particular, the singularity conditions of the two structures will be written in a new form. This new form will directly bring to a new geometric interpretation of their singularity conditions and to the exhaustive enumeration of the geometric conditions identifying their singular geometries. Such an enumeration will reveal that some geometric conditions were not identified in the literature. Finally, the use of the obtained results in the design of parallel manipulators which become either PS-2RS or 2PS-RS structures, when the actuators are locked, will be illustrated.
