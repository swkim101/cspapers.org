In bearings-only target motion analysis, the observer trajectory has an important effect on the accuracy of target localization and tracking. This paper presented a practical method of observer velocity optimization based on Monte-Carlo run for airborne ESM measurement system. For verifying the validity of our method, the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) is taken as the performance index. Finally, three scenarios are given and the GDOP values of the ESM measurement system in scenarios are calculated to illustrate the observer velocity optimization strategy.
