Object detection is the important foundation of visual tracking. In this paper, a real-time object detection algorithm based on back-projection was presented. Firstly, according to the principle of back-projection, the objects probability image is calculated by objects color histogram model, and then we determine the object on the basis of some contour strategy in that image. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm accurately detected the position of object in real-time if the contour of object change within a certain range and the color of object is distinct.
