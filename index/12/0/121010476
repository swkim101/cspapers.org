This paper investigates a representation model, namely, a discrete-time switched fuzzy system. In this model, a system is a switched system whose subsystems are all discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems. For the proposed discrete-time switched fuzzy system is built to ensure that the relevant system is asymptotically stable by Arbitrary Switching and the Lyapunov functions method. The main conditions are given in form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are easily solvable. The elaborated illustrative examples and the respective simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
