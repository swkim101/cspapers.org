Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) is a method for solving NP-hard problem. But it is hard to find global optimization quickly for some problems, especially for traveling salesman problem (TSP) that is a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. To solve TSP effectively, a novel estimation of distribution algorithm (NEDA ) is provided, which can solve the conflict between population diversity and algorithm convergence. The experimental results show that the performance of NEDA is effective.
