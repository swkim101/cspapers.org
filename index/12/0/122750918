In the present paper, we propose an entropy method to transform the internal representation. The entropy function is defined with respect to the state of hidden unit, that is, internal representation. The internal representation can be transformed by changing the parameter α for the entropy function. Thus, the transformation is referred to as α-transformation. The internal representation can be transformed according to given problems. By transforming the internal representation into the minimum entropy representation, we can obtain kernel networks, smaller networks with explicit interpretation. On the other hand, by changing appropriately the parameter α, we can obtain intermediate internal representations for the improved generalization. We applied the entropy method to an autoencoder and we succeeded in obtaining kernel networks with small internal entropy. In addition, we applied the method to the frequency identification problem and we could obtain derived networks whose generalization performance was significantly superior to the performance by standard back-propagation.
