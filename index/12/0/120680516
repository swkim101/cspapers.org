The authors consider problem of an accurate system identification and reproduction of control objects output signal. Also, this paper offers a solution of a control objects transfer function determining task by its step response using the Real interpolation method. An ability of using non-uniform sampling period is a characteristic property of this approach. Numeric examples are shown. Also, an ability of more than half of signal samples omitting with, however, acceptable result is shown.
