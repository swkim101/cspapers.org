THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ALGORITHM FOR COMPUTING A DEPTH MAP FOR A SMOOTH SURFACE FROM A SEQUENCE OF PROFILE CURVES. THE ALGORITHM REQURIES THAT THE VIEWING DIRECTIONS BE COPLANAR. IN ADDITION FORMULAE ARE DERIVED FOR COMPUTING DIRECTLY THE GAUSS AND MEAN CURVATURES WITHOUT FIRST COMPUTING A DEPTH MAP. WE HAVE USED THE ALGORITHM TO RECONSTRUCT CURVES FROM THEIR PROFILES WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY FROM SYNTHETIC, NOISE-FREE DATA.
