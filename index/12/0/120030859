In practical engineering problems, often only limited input data are available to generate the input distribution model. The insufficient input data induces uncertainty on the input distribution model, and this uncertainty will cause us to lose confidence in the optimum design obtained using the reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) method. Uncertainty on the input distribution model requires us to consider the reliability analysis output, which is defined as the probability of failure, to follow a probabilistic distribution. This paper proposes a new formulation for the confidence-based RBDO method and design sensitivity analysis of the confidence level. The probability of the reliability analysis output is obtained with consecutive conditional probabilities of input distribution parameters and input distribution types using a Bayesian approach. The approximate conditional probabilities of input distribution parameters and types are suggested under certain assumptions. The Monte Carlo simulation is applied to practically calculate the output distribution, and the copula is used to describe the correlated input distribution types. A confidence-based RBDO problem is formulated using the derived the distribution of output. In this new formulation, the probabilistic constraint is modified to include both the target reliability and the target confidence level. Finally, the sensitivity of the confidence level, which is a new probabilistic constraint, is derived to support an efficient optimization process. Using accurate surrogate models, the proposed method does not require generation of additional surrogate models during the RBDO iteration; it only requires several evaluations of the same surrogate models. Hence, the efficiency of the method is obtained. For the numerical example, the confidence level is calculated and the accuracy of the derived sensitivity is verified when only limited data are available.Copyright Â© 2012 by ASME
