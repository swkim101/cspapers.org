We develop an operational model of an impredicative version of explicit polymorphism. namely an extension of the second order lambda-calculus, including a fixed point combinator and a multi-sorted first order algebra. We show that typical properties of the X-calculus are preserved and we investigate new aspects that arise by the second order type structure as well as the relationships with well known, simply typed PCF-like languages. A suitable theory of observably equivalent terms is defined and its complexity is explored. Eventually a denotational model suggesting interesting extensions of the language is studied.
