One of the most important ways to enhance the speed of state estimation is to establish the constant matrix Jacobian. This essay puts forward the state estimation method of the equivalent current transformation based on the Generalized Tellegens Theorem. This estimation method establishes the constant Jacobian matrix without neglecting the secondary factor making use of the Generalized Tellegens Theorem, solves the numerical stability problem caused by the establishment of the constant Jacobian matrix in the current state estimation, and has the advantages of a relatively rapid computing rate, making advantage of measuremnt of WAMS and SCADA system, and an unparalleled astringency. The method put forward in this essay has been verified through IEEE-30 Node System, and the efficiency of it has been fully proved by the example results.
