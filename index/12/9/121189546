In this paper we formulated and analyzed a eco-epidemiological model with disease in the predator, analysis of the existing conditions of equilibrium point, the sufficient condition of the local asymptotical stability of the equilibrium was studied with the method of latent root, the global asymptotical stability of two of the boundary equilibriums and the local asymptotical stability of the positive equilibrium is proved by using the Lyapunov function.
