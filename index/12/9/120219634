This paper presents the new algorithm which is an improved normalized variable step size LMS adaptive filtering algorithm. A normalized LMS algorithm with variable step size iterative formula is deduced and at the same time the simulation results prove that the new algorithm has good performance. The LMS adaptive filtering algorithm has been widely used in many applications such as system identification, noise cancellation and the adaptive notch filter ,the paper analyses the application and implement the simulation by matlab. the result shows the proposed algorithm has been applied well.
