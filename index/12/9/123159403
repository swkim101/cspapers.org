This paper investigates the problem of H_infinity filtering fornetworked control systems (NCSs). Based on the measurementquantization of output signal before transmitted through network, asampled-data system with consideration of both network-induced delayand data dropout is modeled as a filtering-error system with twoadditive delay components in the output and, the problem ofH_infinity filter design is solved accordingly. An illustrativeexample shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.
