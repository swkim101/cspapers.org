We propose a novel approach to shape optimization that combines and retains the advantages of the earlier optimization techniques. The shapes in the design space are represented implicitly as level sets of a higher-dimensional function that is constructed using B-splines (to allow free-form deformations), and parameterized primitives combined with R-functions (to support desired parametric changes). Our approach to shape design and optimization offers great flexibility because it provides explicit parametric control of geometry and topology within a large space of freeform shapes. The resulting method is also general in that it subsumes most other types of shape optimization as special cases. We describe an implementation of the proposed technique with attractive numerical properties. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by several numerical examples.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
