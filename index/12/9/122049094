Global optimization algorithms for generalized polynomial design models using a global feasible search approach was discussed in a previous article. A new convex cutting plane algorithm (CONCUT) based on global feasible search and with improved,performance is presented in this sequel article. Computational results of the CONCUT algorithm compared to one using linear cuts (LINCUT) are given for various test problems. A speed reducer design example illustrates the application of the algorithms.
