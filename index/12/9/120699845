Closeness degree is a metric similar levels between two fuzzy sets. This paper extends the closeness degree to the filed of intuitionistic fuzzy multiple attribute decision making. First it defines the closeness degree of two intuitionistic fuzzy vector, then proposes a method based on closeness degree to solve intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute decision making problems with the known weights, and demonstrates the effectiveness of this method with examples at last.
