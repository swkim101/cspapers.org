Existing state-of-the-art salient object detection networks rely on aggregating multi-level features of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, compared to high-level features, low-level features contribute less to performance. Meanwhile, they raise more computational cost because of their larger spatial resolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel Cascaded Partial Decoder (CPD) framework for fast and accurate salient object detection. On the one hand, the framework constructs partial decoder which discards larger resolution features of shallow layers for acceleration. On the other hand, we observe that integrating features of deep layers will obtain relatively precise saliency map. Therefore we directly utilize generated saliency map to recurrently optimize features of deep layers. This strategy efficiently suppresses distractors in the features and significantly improves their representation ability. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets exhibit that the proposed model not only achieves state-of-the-art but also runs much faster than existing models. Besides, we apply the proposed framework to optimize existing multi-level feature aggregation models and significantly improve their efficiency and accuracy.
