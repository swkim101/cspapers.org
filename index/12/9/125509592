In this paper we are concerned with ∫Γ3λ I statistical convergence of pre-cauchy triple sequences. ∫Γ3λ I statistical convergence implies ∫Γ3λ I statistical pre-Cauchy condition and examine some properties of these concepts. We examine some properties of these concepts, if the triple entire sequence spaces is statistically convergent then statistically pre-Cauchy and also triple sequence of ideal (I3)- is statistically pre-Cauchy
