In this paper, we consider the vector method of solving one of the most important problems of the dynamic analysis of mechanisms - kinetostatic analysis, which is to determine the reactions in the kinematic pairs and the balancing moment (force) on the leading link of a given law of motion of the mechanism [. This problem has a great practical importance in the selection of electro engines and in the calculation of the bearings in kinematic pairs. For example, setting the constant angular velocity of the driving link can be made kinematic and kinetostatic analysis of the mechanism and determine for all site of motion the balancing moment and the reactions in the kinematic pairs. By the average value of the balancing moment define the parameters of the electro engines and on the extreme values of the reactions produce calculation and selection of the bearings that will be installed in the hinges. In addition, knowledge of analytical expressions reactions will most clearly solve the problems of dynamic mechanisms with friction in the kinematic pairs.
