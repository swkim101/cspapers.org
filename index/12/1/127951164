Convolutional networks have enjoyed much success in many computer vision applications. The convolution operation however has a significant weakness in that it only operates on a local neighbourhood, thus missing global information. Self-attention, on the other hand, has emerged as a recent advance to capture long range interactions, but has mostly been applied to sequence modeling and generative modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose to augment convolutional networks with self-attention by concatenating convolutional feature maps with a set of feature maps produced via a novel relative self-attention mechanism. In particular, we extend previous work on relative self-attention over sequences to images and discuss a memory efficient implementation. Unlike Squeeze-and-Excitation, which performs attention over the channels and ignores spatial information, our self-attention mechanism attends jointly to both features and spatial locations while preserving translation equivariance. We find that Attention Augmentation leads to consistent improvements in image classification on ImageNet and object detection on COCO across many different models and scales, including ResNets and a state-of-the art mobile constrained network, while keeping the number of parameters similar. In particular, our method achieves a 1.3% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet classification over a ResNet50 baseline and outperforms other attention mechanisms for images such as Squeeze-and-Excitation. It also achieves an improvement of 1.4 AP in COCO Object Detection on top of a RetinaNet baseline.
