Kernel parameter selection of support vector machine (SVM) is difficult in practical application. A parameter selection algorithm of SVM was proposed based on data maximum variance - entropy criterion by analyzing the principle of SVM classifier. The algorithm uses data maximum variance - entropy criterion to measure the linear separability of dataset in the feature space, and combines with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for parameter optimization. The experiment results on datasets from UCI show that the algorithm is excellence in accuracy and improves the training performance of SVM. To further verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, applying the method in fault diagnosis of biquadratic filter circuit, results prove it improves the diagnostic accuracy.
