Due to the limited pixel numbers in single TDI CCD chips, some TDI CCD chips are combined in the focal plane to reach a sufficient swath width. Basic imagery is delivered as one image data file per strip and how to convert those sub-images to a larger, accuracy equivalent image is an essential problem in satellite imagesâ€™ processing. Some key factors that affect the imaging quality of TDI CCD images are discussed firstly. It shows that discrepancies in the along-track direction which caused by different viewing angle and topographic relief are the main problem to improve the stitching accuracy. Three basic image-oriented stitching strategies are discussed. Experimental results show that the RMS of shift transformation, single affine transformation and piecewise affine transformation is 1.4 pixels, 1.3 pixels and 0.2 pixels. Piecewise affine transformation fully meets the requirements of further processing.
