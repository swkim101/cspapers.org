We analyze a randomized pivoting process involving one line and n points in the plane. The process models the behavior of the RANDOM‐EDGE simplex algorithm on simple polytopes with n facets in dimension n − 2. We obtain a tight O(log2 n) bound for the expected number of pivot steps. This is the first nontrivial bound for RANDOM‐EDGE, which goes beyond bounds for specific polytopes. The process itself can be interpreted as a simple algorithm for certain 2‐variable linear programming problems, and we prove a tight Θ(n) bound for its expected runtime. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
