In order to improve the dynamic stability of stand up lifts, this thesis set up a multi rigid body model through modeling and simulation of the lifting process of stand up lifts. This thesis analyzed and mapped the barycentric coordinates during lifting at different locations through simulation, got a fitting curve through cubic polynomial fitting, and verified the reliability of modeling and simulation through experiments.
