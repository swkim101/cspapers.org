The idea of automatic mechanism synthesis is to find an optimal linkage type as well as its geometric dimensions for a given problem without using any pre-determined linkage type. As the first step towards the automatic mechanism synthesis, the authors proposed the use of unified planar linkage consisting of rigid blocks connected by stiffness-varying zero-length springs and formulated the synthesis problem as the iterative design optimization problem. In this investigation, we extend the automatic mechanism synthesis idea to more realistic large-sized problems by resolving several numerical difficulties observed in the earlier formulation such as instable convergence and many local optima. In particular, the objective and constraint functions in the optimization formulation are newly selected. The rationale for choosing such functions is given and the effectiveness of the proposed problem formulation is verified by designing planar mechanisms of complete paths.Copyright Â© 2011 by ASME
