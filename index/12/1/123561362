This paper describes a digital system designed for the automatic detection and measurement of the velocity of moving objects in images acquired by means of a common TV-camera mounted onto a microscope. The main real-time features are: it can perform a real-time grey level difference between two successive frames in order to detect moving objects; it stores the images in the frame memory; it performs an automatic labelisation in order to recognise the moving micro-organisms; it calculates the area of the cells moving in the microscope field; it completes the analysis in few seconds.
