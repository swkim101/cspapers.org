In this paper, topology optimization problems with two types of body force are considered: gravitational force and centrifugal force. For structural design under both external and gravitational forces, a total mean compliance formulation is used to produce the stiffest structure. For rotational structural design with high angular velocity, one additional design criteria, kinetic energy, is included in the formulation. Sensitivity analyses of the total mean compliance and kinetic energy are derived. Finally, design examples are presented and compared to show the effects of body forces on the optimized results.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
