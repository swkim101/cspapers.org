For multichannel autoregressive moving average (ARMA) signal with colored measurement noises, based on classical Kalman filtering theory, a covariance intersection (CI) fusion smoother without cross-covariances is presented by the augmented state space model. It has the advantage that the computation of cross-covariances is avoid, so it can significantly reduce the computational burden, and it can solve the fusion problem for multi-sensor systems with unknown cross-covariances. Under the unbiased linear minimum variance (ULMV) criterion, three optimal weighted fusion smoothers with matrix weights, scalar weights and diagonal weights are also presented respectively. The accuracy comparison of the CI fuser with the other three weighted fusers is given. It is shown that its accuracy is higher than that of each local smoother, and is lower than or close to that of the optimal fuser weighted by matrices. So the presented fusion smoother is better in performance.
