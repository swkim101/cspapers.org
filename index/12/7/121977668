In the research of identity recognition based on lip motion features, there are limitations for the existing algorithms of lip characteristic parameters extraction. This paper uses the strategy of lip static/dynamic geometric features fusion, designs the lip feature parameter extraction program based on interpolation, and implements the major aspects of processing algorithm of the program. The solution is based on the speaker's key six primitives spelling lip sequence image, firstly generates the lip key point coordinates in the image, then based on Lagrange interpolation obtains function curve coefficient of upper and lower lips' key points , lastly the two curve coefficients are combined to form lip motion feature information of human speaker's some specific sounds; Simulation results show that the extraction of characteristic parameters of the program not only have a high efficiency and availability, but also have the advantages of good storage.
