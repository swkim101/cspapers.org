In this paper, we present a multi-hypothesis scheme of Temporal Error Concealment (TEC). The lost block is concealed by several hypothesis blocks in the previous frame, and the corresponding Motion Vectors (MVs) of hypothesis blocks are derived using a kalman filter based on the similarity of local MVs. The processing is at the level of 8x8 block and the tendency in horizontal and vertical orientations is considered to predict the candidate MVs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide better performance as compared with the conventional approaches.
