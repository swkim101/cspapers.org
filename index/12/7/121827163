According to experimental data, the model of fixed Joints stiffness in machine tools was built by least square of relative error. The new regression equations were obtained by regression analysis. Compared to the original equations with Gaussian least-square, the relative error of new regression equations is within 3.5%, which reduces by 12.5% and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreases by 18.0%, 12.4%and 19.0% respectively.
