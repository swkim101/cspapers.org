We focus on default logic, a formalism introduced by Reiter to model default reasoning. The paper consists of two parts. In the first one a translation method of non-normal defaults into the normal ones is given. Although not generally valid, this translation seems to work for a wide class of defaults. In the second part a semantics for normal default theories is given and the completeness theorem is proved.
