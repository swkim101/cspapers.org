For RBDO problems with correlated input variables, it is necessary to obtain the input joint distribution (CDF, cumulative distribution function). Then Rosenblatt transformation is used to transform the correlated input variables into the independent standard normal variables for the purpose of inverse reliability analysis. However, in practical industry RBDO problems, often only the marginal CDFs and paired samples are available from limited experimental data. In this paper, a copula, which is a link between a joint CDF and marginal CDFs, is proposed to generate an input joint CDF from these marginal CDFs and paired samples. To identify the right copula from limited data, Bayesian method is proposed to use in this paper. Using Bayesian method, the number of samples required to properly identify the right copula is investigated for different types of copulas and for different correlation coefficients. A real industry problem is used to show how a copula can be identified from the limited experimental data.Copyright Â© 2008 by ASME
