In this paper, Von Karman random media is constructed with power spectrum method. The random media with Von Karman autocorrelation cannot be constructed in time domain but in frequency domain. So power spectrum method is utilized to solve the problem. The spectrum of random function is generated in frequency domain with random field and auto-correlation function. With inverse Fourier transformation, the Von Karman random media model is constructed. With different correlation lengths, six group of Von Karman random media are constructed.
