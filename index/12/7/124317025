This paper demonstrates a novel technique to distinguish between moving or stationary objects from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Our Triangle Closure Method (TCM) is able to robustly classify – with an average accuracy of 91.9% as computed in outdoor field tests – the motion of an object using information on the egomotion of the UAV (derived from optic flow) and on the expansion/contraction of the object’s image. These parameters are used to compare the predicted and measured changes in the distance to the object, which is then used to classify the object’s motion. The main advantage of this method compared to current solutions is that it can be applied in environments with strong motion parallax.
