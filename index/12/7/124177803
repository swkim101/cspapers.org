Under the condition of interference, when to optimize the network deployment with the energy of the radiation characteristics of node, it is significant to improve the efficiency of the objective function evaluation.The overlap deployment model based on the compression projection is put forward in this paper, including the projection grid model based on the margin fitting, and the fusion boundary generation based on the projection grid, measurement of covered area and overlap coefficient evaluation algorithm to provide the efficient algorithm for the calculation of optimization goals such as the integration area, cover index and overlap coefficient . It changed the past calculation mode, which is random and extensive, as Monte Carlo sampling and the physical grid statistics method. The algorithm analysis and experiments showed that, the overlap deployment model based on the compression projection, compared with the previous model, had the characteristics of high precision and low-power, it can complete the calculation three indicators of the integration area,the covering index and overlap index with the accuracy of up to 99%.
