This paper presents a real-time interpolation algorithm of the space trajectory which based on the theory of coordinate transform. The algorithm can solve the path planning problem of six-DOF robot. According to the actual movement state of robot, the algorithm can obtain some key points for the robot motion path by teaching. Then it can realize the dimensional random trajectory interpolation by coordinate transformation after building a suitable dimensional coordinate. Finally it can obtain the corresponding joint angle though the inverse kinematics solution. The experimental results show that this algorithm has a good rapidity and practicality, it suit for the six-DOF robot real-time trajectory interpolation, so it is worth promoting.
