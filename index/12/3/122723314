We propose a new perspective on image encryption using chaotic signal and blind source separation. The original image is permuted by the chaotic signal and then mixed with key images. In the receiver, blind source separation technique is used to separate the components of the original image from the ciphertexts. Then chaotic signal is again used to restore the pixels to recover the original image. The experimental results demonstrate that the key space is large enough to resist the brute force attack and the distribution of gray values of the encrypted image has a random-like behavior.
