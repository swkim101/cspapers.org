The objectives of this contribution are twofold. First, the Domain Decomposition (DD) method used in the parafish parallel transport solver is re-interpreted as a Generalized Schwarz Splitting as defined by Tang [SIAM J Sci Stat Comput , vol.13 (2), pp. 573–595, 1992]. Second, parafish provides spherical harmonic (i.e., PN ) solutions to the NEA benchmark suite for 3D transport methods and codes over a range in parameter space. To the best of the author’s knowledge, these are the first spherical harmonic solutions provided for this demanding benchmark suite. They have been obtained using 512 CPU cores of the JuRoPa machine installed at the Julich Computing Center (Germany).
