The paper describes a method of acoustic frequency response and impedance analysis of acoustic fields in the acoustically narrow pipelines with variable cross-section (tapered pipes). The method utilizes the theory ofelectro-acoustic analogies. The expressions for the equivalent resistors, replacing the pipeline are gained. The described method is a further development of existing methods to analyze the fields in the pipes of constant cross section.Reference 6, figures 4.
