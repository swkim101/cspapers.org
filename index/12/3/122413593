Techniques employed for nonlinear design optimization with discrete variables are studied in the context of particular problem arising from the design of a gear train. The mathematical model formulation was presented in an earlier article. In this sequel, a solution derivation is described, patterned as a multistage process. After certain reformulation and relaxation, a variety of infeasibility and non-optimality tests are performed, greatly reducing the size of the space containing the global optimum. Methods used to investigate the remaining space do not guarantee a global optimum, but could be replaced by more costly methods that do provide such guarantees. A global infimum is generated, bounding any improvements on the best known solution.
