In this paper we first give a formal semantics of nonmonotonic TMS theory with CP justifications. Then we prove that the model of a theory J is also a model of theory J*(I). Next we conclude thai for every TMS theory J, there must be a theory J* such that J* has no CP justifications and all the models of J is also J*'s. Finally we prove that the concept of extension defined by U. Junker and Kun Konolige is also correct under our definition.
