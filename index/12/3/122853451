To resolve the difficulty in establishing accurate priori noise model for the extended Kalman filtering algorithm, propose the fractional-order Darwinian particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been proposed and introduced into the fuzzy adaptive extended Kalman filtering algorithm. The natural selection method has been adopted to improve the standard particle swarm optimization algorithm, which enhanced the diversity of particles and avoided the premature. In addition, the fractional calculus has been used to improve the evolution speed of particles. The PSO algorithm after improved has been applied to train fuzzy adaptive extended Kalman filter and achieve the simultaneous localization and mapping. The simulation results have shown that compared with the geese particle swarm optimization training of fuzzy adaptive extended Kalman filter localization and mapping algorithm, has been greatly improved in terms of localization and mapping.
