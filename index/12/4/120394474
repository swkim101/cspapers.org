In this paper, a generalization is suggested for the Heuristic Gradient Projection method. The previous Heuristic Gradient Projection method (HGP) has been developed for 3D-frame design and optimization. It mainly employed bending stress relations in order to simplify the process of iterations for stress constrained optimization. The General Heuristic Gradient Projection (GHGP) is used in a more general form to satisfy the stress constraints. Another direct search method is hybridized to satisfy other constraints on deflection. Two examples are solved using the new method. The proposed method is compared with the Hybrid Fuzzy Heuristic technique (FHGP) when solving a MEMS resonator. Results showed that the proposed hybrid technique with (GHGP) converges to the optimum solutions faster by an 8%. The MEMS weight is also decreased by 23.7%. For a macro level, the GHGP improved the solution time by 33.3%. The hybrid technique with (GHGP) improved the stresses in the members of the optimum ten-member cantilever.Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME
