Probability tables are a generic tool that allows representing any random variable whose probability density function is known. In the field of Nuclear Reactor Physics, this tool is currently used to represent the variation of cross-sections versus energy (TRIPOLI4®, MCNP, APOLLO2, ECCO/ERANOS, …). In the present article we show how we can propagate uncertainties, thanks to a probability table representation, through two very simple mathematical problems: an eigenvalue problem (neutron multiplication factor, …) or a depletion problem.
