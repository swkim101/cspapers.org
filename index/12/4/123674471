To improve the precision and real-time of the virtual liver surgery simulation system with haptic feedback, a novel deformation modelling based on wave equation and spherical harmonic is proposed. Continuous changed liver models were mapped into a common reference system in which corresponding coefficients of spherical harmonic were compared with method of principal components analysis and force feedback were calculated by simplified deformation wave equation. Moreover, system structure design, fast collision detection and real-time feedback operation are also discussed in detail. Experimental platform of virtual liver surgery was established based on vizard 4.0 and Sensable-phantomÂ® desktopTM. Experiment results show that the system can provide a stable force to the human operator and which satisfy the requirement of real-time performance. Establishing a simple and lifelike physics deformation model and a precise and rapid collision detection algorithm favors the performance improvement of the virtual liver surgery simulation system.
