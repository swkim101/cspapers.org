By using Hamilton improved circle, transversely and longitudinally cut up paper join together. By scanning image and image extraction techniques, the images of shredded paper are obtained. The process of shredding splicing is mainly divided into two parts, the image preprocessing and edge matching. Then the images conver into grey value matrixes and binarization are implemented on the image with appropriate threshold. The images of shredded paper are classified into nineteen lines. With the shortest Euclidean distance between the edge of shredding and Hamilton improved circle, shredded paper is transversely spliced. The test shows that accuracy is as high as 100%.
