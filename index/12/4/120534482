This paper presents a novel image acquisition technology for raised characters. First, laser stripes modulated with height information of raised character are captured using the 3D vision technique; then, laser stripes are combined into a grating image, in which are complete character images with grating background; Finally, a rational design Gabor kernel is applied to filter the grating image. Through this way, the background was removed and the grayscale images of the raised characters are reserved. Experiments show that the proposed method can get the well-separated character images. Also, it is more simple and efficient than the existing methods.
