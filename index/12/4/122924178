A bottleneck problem in mechanical productions design is presented in this paper. The fundamental conceptions and problems of relation design should be resolved at present. A method of relation design, which using mate relation constraint and align relation constraint and dimensions equation relation constraint, is putted forward. This way is implemented to mechanical productions relation design.
