A novel compliant mechanism with three degree of freedom (DOF) is proposed, based on the method of Freedom and Constraint Topology (FACT). One movement and two rotations are obtained in Case 3, Type 2 freedom space. A redundant constraint is added to improve the symmetry. The finite element modal (FEM) is established and static force analysis is conducted. Results demonstrate that the compliant mechanism is decoupled. Modal analysis is carried out with the finite element method. And four orders natural frequency and main vibration mode are obtained.
