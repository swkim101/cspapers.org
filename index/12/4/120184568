We study static network reliability models in which the component failures are not independent. To model the dependence and also to develop effiective simulation methods that estimate the system unreliability, we extend the static model into an auxiliary dynamic model where the components fail at random time, according to a Marshall-Olkin multivariate exponential distribution. We examine and compare diffierent versions of this model and develop efficient unreliability estimation methods based on conditional Monte Carlo and on a generalized splitting methodology.
