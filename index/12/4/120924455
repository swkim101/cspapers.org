In order to improve the accuracy of segmentation, analysis of backtracking-forward maximum matching algorithm exists two defects when dealing with crossing ambiguity, and on this basis, an improved-backtracking forward algorithm for maximum matching algorithm is presented. The improved algorithm is based on the backtracking-forward maximum matching algorithm and adds a module, a chain length of one and 3-words, that can detect and process crossing ambiguity, and taking advantage of counting method, we can merely sort out the defragmenter fields that occurred crossing ambiguity. A number of selected language corpus tests prove that under the premise of the segmentation speed, the improved algorithm can enhance the segmentation accuracy.
