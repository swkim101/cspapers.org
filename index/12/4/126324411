This article presents an efficient method for global optimization of constrained black-box systems. As we know, constrained black-box optimization is a great challenge because of expensive evaluations, and the optimum point of most constrained optimization problems is located at constraint boundary. Considering these characters, efficient constrained global optimization method based on support vector machine (ECGO_SVM) is proposed in this article. ECGO_SVM uses SVM classification to approximate the limit state function, which can guide the constraint boundary sampling process. Besides, Trust Region (TR) method is used in the algorithm to downsize the search space to a local range around the constraint boundary, which probably contains the optimum point. Numerical optimization example is posed in the end of the article to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the method.
