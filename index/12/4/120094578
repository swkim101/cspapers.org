This paper provides two separate methodologies for implementing the Voronoi Cell Finite Element Method (VCFEM) in topological optimization. Both exploit two characteristics of VCFEM. The first approach utilizes the property that a hole or inclusion can be placed in the element: the design variables for the topology optimization are sizes of the hole. In the second approach, we note that VCFEM may mesh the design domain as n sided polygons. We restrict our attention to hexagonal meshes of the domain while applying Solid Isotropic Material Penalization (SIMP) material model. Researchers have shown that hexagonal meshes are not subject to the checker boarding problem commonly associated with standard linear quad and triangle elements. We present several examples to illustrate the efficacy of the methods in compliance minimization as well as discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method.Â© 2009 ASME
