A new color fidelity algorithm to reduce sensor noise for high-ISO images has been proposed. The new algorithm uses HSV color space on wavelet domain to denoise high-ISO images by a weighted mean filter, which is designed based on analysis of the different noise models of high-ISO images. Testing results are satisfactory, which have shown that the new algorithm could reduce noise in high-ISO images faster, as well as no any color distortion in original images during the denoising processing.
