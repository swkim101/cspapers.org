This paper takes the following measures to solve the problem of 3D reconstruction. Camera calibration is based on chessboard, taking several different attitude images. Use corner point coordinates by corner detection to process camera calibration. The calibration result is important to be used to correct the distorted image. Next, the left and right images should be matched to find out the object surface pointsâ€™ imaging position respectively so that the object depth can be calculated by triangulation. According to the inverse process of projection mapping, we can project the object depth and disparity information into 3D space. As a result, we can obtain dense point cloud, which is ready for 3D reconstruction.
