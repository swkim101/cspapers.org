Used equivalent tree to construct the minimum distance diagram of triple loop networks and found the relationships between the layer of the equivalent tree and the shortest path of any two points in triple loop networks, and provided a formula to compute its average diameter. The experimental results show that average diameter approaches to a half of the diameter at the same network, in one infinite family, the diameter must obtain minimum value when average diameter obtains the minimum value, but the inverse is not. Studies also show that average diameter is the better parameter to measure transmission efficiency about loop networks instead of diameter.
