Aimed at the high dynamics and uncertainty of road traffic, we propose a method combine BDD (binary decision diagram)-Based heuristic algorithm which used to do the initial path planning with BDD-Based incremental to solve the route replanning problem. In order to get the optimal path set, BDD-Based heuristic Search is firstly used for global planning. BDD is a compact data structure, the BDD-Based heuristic Search use this characteristic to represent state space and compress the search space through heuristic information at the same time; when the road network information changes, incremental replanning was used in difference type of congestion and the optimum path set again. The simulation results show that the BDD-Based heuristic Search and incremental replanning method has high efficiency and practicability in solving vehicle routing problem under dynamic and uncertain environment.
