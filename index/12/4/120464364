The paper begins with a graphical technique to locate the pole; i.e., the point in the plane of motion which is coincident with the instantaneous center of zero velocity of the coupler link. Since the single flier linkage is indeterminate, the Aronhold-Kennedy theorem cannot locate this instantaneous center of zero velocity. The technique that is presented here is believed to be an original contribution to the kinematics literature and will provide geometric insight into the velocity analysis of an indeterminate linkage. The paper then presents an analytical method, referred to as the method of kinematic coefficients, to determine the radius of curvature and the center of curvature of the path traced by an arbitrary coupler point of the single flier eight-bar linkage. This method has proved useful in curvature theory since it separates the geometric effects of the linkage from the operating speed of the linkage.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
