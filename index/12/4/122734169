The main results of this paper have the following flaÂ­ vor: given one algorithm for multiplying matrices, there exists another, better, algorithm. A consequence of these results is that w, the exponent for matrix multiplication, is a limit point, that is, cannot be realized by any single algorithm. We also use these results to construct a new algorithm which shows that w < 2.495364.
