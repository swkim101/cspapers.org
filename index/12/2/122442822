This work comprises two parts: lower bounds and upper bounds in VLSI circuits. The u~per bounds are for the sorting problem: we describe a large number of constructions for sorting N numbers in the range (0, M) for the standard VLSI bit model. Among other results, we attain: • VLSI sorter constructions that are within a constant factor of optimal size for almost all number ranges M (including M = N), and running times T. • A fundamentally new merging network for sorting numbers in a bit model.
