The variable precision rough set theory is introduced into the fault diagnosis of power transformer. Using the reduction method of the variable precision rough set,the hidden information in power transformer faults data is reduced , and the information which plays a major role in fault classification can be obtained. This approach can overcome the defects of the classical rough set, such as the sensitivity to noise of input information, and accordingly improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The example shows that the variable precision rough set used in the power transformer fault diagnosis, enhance the robustness of the data analysis and processing, so, the proposed approach has a more effective diagnostic performance.
