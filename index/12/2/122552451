In this paper, we consider semi-supervised classification on evolutionary data, where the distribution of the data and the underlying concept that we aim to learn change over time due to short-term noises and long-term drifting, making a single aggregated classifier inapplicable for long-term classification. The drift is smooth if we take a localized view over the time dimension, which enables us to impose temporal smoothness assumption for the learning algorithm. We first discuss how to carry out such assumption using temporal regularizers defined in a structural way with respect to the Hilbert space, and then derive the online algorithm that efficiently finds the closed-form solution to the classification functions. Experimental results on real-world evolutionary mailing list data demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms classical semi-supervised learning algorithms in both algorithmic stability and classification accuracy.
