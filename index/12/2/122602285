Fault diagnosis is essentially a kind of pattern recognition. In this paper propose a novel machinery fault diagnosis method based on supervised locally linear embedding is proposed first. The approach first performs the recently proposed manifold learning algorithm locally linear embedding on the high-dimensional fault signal samples to learn the intrinsic embedded multiple manifold features corresponding to different fault modes. Supervised locally linear embedding not only can map them into a low-dimensional embedded space to achieve fault feature extraction, but also can deal with new fault samples. Finally fault classification is carried out in the embedded manifold space. The ball bearing fault signals are used to validate the proposed fault diagnosis method. The results indicate that the proposed approach obviously improves the fault classification performance and outperforms the other traditional approaches.
