Establishing calculation model on the probability of saliency objectness likelihood based on superpixels is introduced to dectect image saliency. At first,analysing factors which affect the size of visual attention according to the law of universal gravitation; And then use the SLIC algorithm to divide image into superpixels; Next, according to the texture, color,and gradient feature information, establish calculation models on probability saliency object under different rules: Including compactness in class color ,spatial distribution estimation and edge continuity; And then refer to the principle that activity in cells responding to stimuli,.a new feature combination theory is proposed to deal with the relationship of the characteristics of independence and mutual interaction for achieving features fusion accurately. Afterwards, the proposed algorithm applied in virtual and reality interaction to detect the effective region and eliminate noise area.
