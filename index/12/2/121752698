In the acquisition process of palmprint image, the image is often subject to interference from the outside noise.This noise will affect the future of Palmprint feature extraction. Denoising of wavelet is a common method for denoising of palmprint image. The defect of traditional soft and hard threshold functions in image denoising is analyzed. An improved threshold function is proposed on the basis of soft and hard threshold functions. The conventional hard, soft threshold functions and the improved function are used respectively in image denosing. Experiments prove that the improved wavelet threshold function is better than conventional soft, hard threshold function in denoising effect.
