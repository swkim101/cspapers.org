Conflict among knowledge is commonly seen during fuzzing reasoning. By far, some effective methods have been available for eliminating the conflict among knowledge, they are referred to as conflict resolution methods or conflict resolution strategies. The methods of sorting method according to average with weight and sorting in generalizing sequential relation are new methods proposed in recent year. As verified by researches, sometimes these two methods cannot calculate accurate matching degree in fuzzy reasoning. Therefore, this article proposes a new conflict resolution strategy, i.e., sorting method for approximate matching. The results show that this method is consistent with Hamming distance which is recognized worldwide, thus proving the effectiveness of this method.
