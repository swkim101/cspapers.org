As the availability and affordability of consumer products continues to increase around the world, consumers — especially those in developing countries and living on less than $10/day — will express more discerning in their tastes and preferences. Design teams have already been operating in design for the developing world contexts for many years and more are moving into the arena on a regular basis. Many designers do not have cultural knowledge of the customers cultures they are designing for. Cultural ignorance can lead to misinterpretation of customer needs that can lead to products that do not satisfy customer needs and results in disappointed customers, low sales figures, and a frustrated design team. The Customer Needs Cultural Risk Indicator (CNCRI) method introduced in this paper provides a method for design teams to rapidly analyze customer needs for “Risk Indicators” in customer needs based upon cultural differences between the customers and the design team. By understanding early on in the design process where a lack of cultural knowledge may be a risk to the design, the design team can make informed decisions on how to satisfy customer needs effectively.Copyright © 2015 by ASME
