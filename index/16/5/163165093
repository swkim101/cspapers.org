Machine learning, in particular deep learning, is being used in almost all the aspects of life to facilitate humans, specifically in mobile and Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications. Due to its state-of-the-art performance, deep learning is also being employed in safety-critical applications, for instance, autonomous vehicles. Reliability and security are two of the key required characteristics for these applications because of the impact they can have on humanâ€™s life. Towards this, in this paper, we highlight the current progress, challenges and research opportunities in the domain of robust systems for machine learning-based applications.
