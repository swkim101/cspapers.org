The requirement of high performance computing at low power can be met by the parallel execution of an application on a possibly large number of programmable cores. However, the lack of accurate timing properties may prevent parallel execution from being applicable to time-critical applications. This problem has been addressed by suitably designing the architecture, implementation, and programming models, of the Kalray MPPA (Multi-Purpose Processor Array) family of single-chip many-core processors. We introduce the third-generation MPPA processor, whose key features are motivated by the high-performance and high-integrity functions of automated vehicles. High-performance computing functions, represented by deep learning inference and by computer vision, need to execute under soft real-time constraints. High-integrity functions are developed under model-based design, and must meet hard real-time constraints. Finally, the third-generation MPPA processor integrates a hardware root of trust, and its security architecture is able to support a security kernel for implementing the trusted execution environment functions required by applications.
