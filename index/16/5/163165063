The ability to repeat the execution of a program is a fundamental requirement in evaluating computer systems and apps. Reproducing executions of mobile apps has proven difficult under real-life scenarios due to different sources of external inputs and interactive nature of the apps. We present a new practical record/replay framework for Android, RandR, which handles multiple sources of input and provides cross-device replay capabilities through a dynamic instrumentation approach. We demonstrate the feasibility of RandR by recording and replaying a set of real-world apps.
