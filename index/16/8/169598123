In many practical settings, the decision makers have to learn their best actions by experimenting with possible options and collecting feedback (data) over time. It is often assumed that the collected data can be trusted as they reflect the ground truth. But this assumption is violated when the data are generated by strategic players. Consider online advertising market in which the ad exchange (decision maker) aims at learning the best reserve prices in the repeated auctions. In this setting, the data are advertisers’ submitted bids. Such data can be strategically corrupted by advertisers to trick the learning algorithm of the ad exchange to offer them lower reserve prices in the future auctions. In “Dynamic Incentive-Aware Learning: Robust Pricing in Contextual Auctions,” N. Golrezaei, A. Javanmard, and V. Mirrokni design effective learning algorithms with sublinear regret in such environments that are robust to the strategic behavior of the players.
