In this work we consider the interplay between multiprover interactive proofs, quantum entanglement, and zero knowledge proofs - notions that are central pillars of complexity theory, quantum information and cryptography. In particular, we study the relationship between the complexity class MIP*, the set of languages decidable by multiprover interactive proofs with quantumly entangled provers, and the class PZK-MIP*, which is the set of languages decidable by MIP* protocols that furthermore possess the perfect zero knowledge property. Our main result is that the two classes are equal, i.e., MIP* = PZK-MIP*. This result provides a quantum analogue of the celebrated result of Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Kilian, and Wigderson (STOC 1988) who show that MIP = PZK-MIP (in other words, all classical multiprover interactive protocols can be made zero knowledge). We prove our result by showing that every MIP* protocol can be efficiently transformed into an equivalent zero knowledge MIP* protocol in a manner that preserves the completeness-soundness gap. Combining our transformation with previous results, we obtain the corollaries that i) all languages that can be solved in non-deterministic double exponential time have zero knowledge MIP* protocols and ii) all co-recursively enumerable languages (which include undecidable problems as well as all decidable problems) have zero knowledge MIP* protocols with vanishing promise gap.
