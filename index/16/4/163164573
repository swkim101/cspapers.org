We present a low-overhead ransomware-proof SSD, called Ran-somBlocker (RBlocker). RBlocker provides 100% full protections against all possible ransomware attacks by delaying every data deletion until no attack is guaranteed. To reduce storage overheads of the delayed deletion, RBlocker employs a time-out based backup policy. Based on the fact that ransomware must store encrypted version of target files, early deletions of obsolete data are allowed if no encrypted write was detected for a short interval. Otherwise, RBlocker keeps the data for an interval long enough to guarantee no attack condition. For an accurate in-line detection of encrypted writes, we leverages entropy-and CNN-based detectors in an integrated fashion. Our experimental results show that RBlocker can defend all types of ransomware attacks with negligible overheads.
