Technology scaling and architectural innovations have led to increasing ubiquity of embedded systems across applications with widely varying and often constantly changing performance and reliability specifications. However, the increasing physical fault-rates in electronic systems have led to single-layer reliability approaches becoming infeasible for resource-constrained systems. Dynamic Cross-layer reliability (CLR) provides scope for efficient adaptation to such QoS variations and increasing unreliability. We propose a design methodology for enabling QoS-aware CLR-integrated run-time adaptation in heterogeneous MPSoC-based embedded systems. Specifically, we propose a combination of reconfiguration cost-aware optimization at design-time and an agent-based optimization at run-time. We report a reduction of up to 51% and 37% in average reconfiguration cost and average energy consumption respectively over state-of-the-art approaches.
