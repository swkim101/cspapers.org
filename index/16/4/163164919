Data processing and communication in almost all electronic systems are based on Central Processing Units (CPUs). In order to guarantee confidentiality and integrity of the software running on a CPU, hardware-assisted security architectures are used. However, both the threat model and the non-functional platform requirements, i.e. performance and energy budget, differ when we go from high-end desktop computers and servers to low-end embedded devices that populate the internet of things (IoT). For high-end platforms, a relatively large energy budget is available to protect software against attacks. However, measures to optimize performance give rise to microarchitectural side-channel attacks. IoT devices, in contrast, are constrained in terms of energy consumption and do not incorporate the performance enhancements found in high-end CPUs. Hence, they are less likely to be susceptible to microarchitectural attacks, but give rise to physical attacks, exploiting, e.g., leakage in power consumption or through fault injection. Whereas previous work mostly concentrates on a specific architecture, this paper covers the whole spectrum of computing systems, comparing the corresponding hardware architectures, and most relevant threats.
