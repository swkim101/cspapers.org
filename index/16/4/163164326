This paper proposes a novel methodology for multi-level logic synthesis that is independent from a specific graph data-structure, but formulates synthesis procedures using an abstract concept definition of a logic representation. The idea is to capture the essence of optimisations in a general manner and tailor only small performance-critical sections to the underlying logic representation. This generic, yet scalable approach, saves many man-months of development time and enables logic synthesis and technology-mapping procedures parameterised in a logic representation. We present the generic design methodology and demonstrate its practicality by providing a complete state-of-the-art logic synthesis flow.
