The performance of sparse problems suffers from lack of spatial locality and low memory bandwidth utilization. However, the distribution of non-zero values in the data structures of a class of sparse problems, such as matrix operations in neural networks, is modifiable so that it can be matched with an efficient underlying hardware, such as systolic arrays. Such modification helps addressing the challenges coupled with sparsity. To efficiently execute sparse neural network inference on systolic arrays, we propose a structured pruning algorithm that increases the spatial locality in neural network models, while maintaining the accuracy of inference.
