As clock frequencies increase, topology-matching bus routing is desired to provide an initial routing result which facilitates the following buffer insertion to meet the timing constraints. Our algorithm consists of three main techniques: (1) a bus clustering method to reduce the routing complexity, (2) a DAG-based algorithm to connect a bus in the specific topology, and (3) a rip-up and re-route scheme to alleviate the routing congestion. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms all the participating teams of the 2018 CAD Contest at ICCAD, where the top-3 routers result in 145%, 158%, and 420% higher costs than ours.CCS CONCEPTS.
