This paper presents analog layout automation efforts under the ALIGN (“Analog Layout, Intelligently Generated from Netlists”) project for fast layout generation using a modular approach based on a mix of algorithmic and machine learning-based tools. The road to rapid turnaround is based on an approach that detects structure and hierarchy in the input netlist and uses a grid based philosophy for layout. The paper provides a view of the current status of the project, challenges in developing open-source code with an academic/industry team, and nuts-and-bolts issues such as working with abstracted PDKs, navigating the “wall” between secured IP and open-source software, and securing access to example designs.
