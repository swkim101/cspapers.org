With the increasing integration of semiconductor design, many problems have emerged. Row-hammering is one of these problems. The row-hammering effect is a critical issue for reliable memory operation because it can cause some unexpected errors. Hence, it is necessary to address this problem. Mainly, there are two different methods to deal with the row-hammering problem. One is a counter based method, and the other is a probabilistic method. This paper proposes the improved version of the latter method and compares it with other probabilistic methods, PARA and PRoHIT. According to the evaluation results, comparing the proposed method with conventional ones, the proposed one has increased row-hammering reduction per refresh 1.82 and 7.78 times against PARA and PRoHIT in average, respectively.
