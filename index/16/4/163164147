Hardware debugging facilities, such as watchpoints, have been used for software development and analysis. In this paper, we expanded the use of watchpoints as a hardware security primitive for enhancing the runtime security of mobile devices. By analyzing the watchpoints in detail, we derived useful watchpoint properties that can be exploited to build security applications. Based on our analysis, we designed example applications for hardening the OS kernel by exploiting watchpoints. The proposed applications were implemented on a Juno development board with 64-bit ARM architecture (ARMv8). Hardening the kernel by fully enabling the proposed schemes was found to impose reasonable overhead, i.e., 3% with SPEC CPU2006.
