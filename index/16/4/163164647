Internet of Things (IoT) devices have access to an abundance of raw data for processing. With deep neural networks (DNNs), not only the demand for the computing power of IoT devices is increasing, but also privacy concerns are motivating the importance of close-to-edge computation. DNN execution by distributing its computation is common in IoT systems. However, managing unstable latencies in a network and intermittent failures are serious challenges. Our work provides robustness and close-to-zero recovery latency by adapting coded distributed computing (CDC). We analyze robust execution on a mesh of Raspberry Pis by studying four DNNs.
