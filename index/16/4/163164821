Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistor (NCFET) is an emerging technology that incorporates a ferroelectric layer within the transistor gate stack to overcome the fundamental limit of sub-threshold swing in transistors. Even though physics-based NCFET models have been recently proposed, system-level NCFET models do not exist and research is still in its infancy. In this work, we are the first to investigate the impact of NCFET on performance, energy and cooling costs in many-core processors. Our proposed methodology starts from accurate physics models all the way up to the system level, where the performance and power of a many-core are widely affected. Our new methodology and system-level models allow, for the first time, the exploration of the novel trade-offs between performance gains and power losses that NCFET now offers to system-level designers. We demonstrate that an optimal ferroelectric thickness does exist. In addition, we reveal that current state-of-the-art power management techniques fail when NCFET (with a thick ferroelectric layer) comes into play.
