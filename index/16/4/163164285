Vibration generated in modern computing environments such as autonomous vehicles, edge computing infrastructure, and data center systems is an increasing concern. In this paper, we systematically measure, quantify and characterize the impact of vibration on the performance of SSD devices. Our experiments and analysis uncover that exposure to both short-term and long-term vibration, even within the vendor-specified limits, can significantly affect SSD I/O performance and reliability.
