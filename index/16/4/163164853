This paper presents vC2M, a holistic multi-resource allocation framework for real-time multicore virtualization. vC2M integrates shared cache allocation with memory bandwidth regulation to mitigate interferences among concurrent tasks, thus providing better timing isolation among tasks and VMs. It reduces the abstraction overhead through task and VCPU release synchronization and through VCPU execution regulation, and it further introduces novel resource allocation algorithms that consider CPU, cache, and memory bandwidth altogether to optimize resources. Evaluations on our prototype show that vC2M can be implemented with minimal overhead, and that it substantially improves schedulability over existing solutions.
