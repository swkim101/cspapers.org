Inexact hardware design techniques have become popular in error-tolerant systems, where energy efficiency is a primary concern. Several techniques aim to identify circuit portions that can be discarded under an error constraint, but research on systematic methods to determine such error is still at an early stage. We herein illustrate a generic, scalable algorithm that determines the influence of each circuit gate on the final output. The algorithm first partitions the graph representing the circuit, then determines the error propagation model of the resulting subgraphs. When applied to existing approximate design frameworks, our solution improves their efficiency and result quality.
