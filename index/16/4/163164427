Data insertion and deletion are common operations exist in various applications. However, traditional memory architecture can only perform an indirect insertion/deletion with multiple data read and write operations, which is significantly time and energy consuming. To mitigate this problem, we propose to leverage the unique capability of emerging skyrmion racetrack memory technology that it can naturally support direct insertion/deletion operations inside a racetrack. In this work, we first present a circuit level model for skyrmion racetrack memory. Then, we further propose a novel memory architecture to enable an efficient large size data insertion/deletion. With the help of the model and the architecture, we study several potential applications to leverage the insertion and deletion operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency of these operations can be substantially improved.
