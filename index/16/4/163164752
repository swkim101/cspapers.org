We present a stretchable DRAM refresh control for energy-efficient processing of DNNs, namely St-DRC. We exploit the characteristic that the recognition accuracy of DNNs is insensitive to errors of insignificant bits. By replacing some insignificant bits with parity bits for the error-correction of significant bits, the St-DRC can protect the significant bits under stretched refresh periods. This significantly improves DRAM refresh energy without performance degradation of DNNs, applicable to both training and inference operations. Our simulation shows that in training, the St-DRC obtains 23%/12% DRAM energy savings for graphic/main memories, respectively. Further, the St-DRC accelerates the training speed by 0.43\sim 4.12%.
