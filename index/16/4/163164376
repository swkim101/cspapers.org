Superblocks are widely employed in SSDs for improving performance. However, the standard superblock organization which links blocks with the same block ID across planes into one superblock leads to SSDsâ€™ ineluctable lifetime waste due to inter-block wear tolerance variations. This work proposes a wear-aware superblock management, called WAS, which (1) dynamically organizes superblocks according to real-time block wear levels to make strong blocks relieve wear on weak ones, and (2) employs a wear-based garbage collection scheme to reduce inter-block wear gap. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in SSDsim. Results show that WAS greatly prolongs SSD lifetime by 51.3% compared with the state-of-the-art superblock management.
