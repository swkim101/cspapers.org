The Clock Constraint Specification Language (CCSL) has been widely investigated in verifying causal and temporal timing behaviors of real-time embedded systems. However, due to limited expertise in formal modeling, it is difficult for requirement engineers to completely and accurately derive CCSL specifications from natural language-based design descriptions. To address this problem, we present a novel approach that facilitates automated synthesis of CCSL specifications under the guidance of sampled (expected) timing behaviors of target systems. By encoding sampled behaviors and incomplete CCSL constraints provided by requirement engineers using our proposed transformation templates, the CCSL specification synthesis problem can be naturally converted into a SKETCH synthesis problem, which enables the automated generation of CCSL specifications with high accuracy. Experiments on both well-known benchmarks and synthetic examples demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.
