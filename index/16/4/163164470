Monolithic 3D IC overcomes the limitation of the existing through-silicon-via (TSV) based 3D IC by providing denser vertical connections with nano-scale inter-layer vias (ILVs). In this paper, we demonstrate a thorough RTL-to-GDS design flow for monolithic 3D IC, which is based on commercial 2D place-and-route (P&R) tools and clever ways to extend them to handle 3D IC designs and simulations. We also provide a low-cost built-in-self-test (BIST) method to detect various faults that can occur on ILVs. Lastly, we present a resistive random access memory (ReRAM) compiler that generates memory modules that are to be integrated in monolithic 3D ICs.
