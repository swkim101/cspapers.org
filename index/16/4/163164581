Existing secure deletion approaches are inefficient in erasing data permanently because file systems have no knowledge of the data layout on the storage device, nor is the storage device aware of file information within the file systems. This inefficiency is exaggerated on the emerging shingled magnetic recording (SMR) drive due to its inherent sequential-write constraint. On SMR drives, secure deletion requests may lead to serious write amplification and performance degradation if the data layout is not properly configured. Such observation motivates us to propose a file-oriented fast secure deletion (FFSD) strategy to alleviate the negative impacts of SMR drives' sequential-write constraint and improve the efficiency of secure deletion operations on SMR drives. A series of experiments was conducted to demonstrate the capability of the proposed strategy on improving the efficiency of secure deletion on SMR drives.
