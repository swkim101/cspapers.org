A popular countermeasure against IP piracy relies on obfuscating the Finite State Machine (FSM), which is assumed to be the heart of a digital system. In this paper, we propose to use a special class of non-group additive cellular automata (CA) called $D 1 \ast CA$, and it’s counterpart $D1 \ast CA_{dual}$ to obfuscate each state-transition of an FSM. The synthesized FSM exhibits correct state-transitions only for a correct key, which is a designer’s secret. The proposed easily testable key-controlled FSM synthesis scheme can thwart reverse engineering attacks, thus offers IP protection.
