DRAM based memory-centric computing architectures are promising solutions to tackle the challenges of memory wall. In this paper, we develop a novel design of DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture which achieves lower cycles in every basic operation than prior arts. Our small yet fast in-memory computing units support basic logic operations including NOT, AND, and OR. Using those operations, along with shift and propagation, bitwise operations can be extended to word-wise operations, e.g. increment and comparison, with high efficiency. We also optimize the designs to exploit parallelism and data reuse to further improve the performance of compound operations. Compared with the most powerful state-of-the-art PIM architecture, we can achieve comparable or even better performance while consuming only 6% of its area overhead.
