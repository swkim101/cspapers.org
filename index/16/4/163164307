Making embedded memory symmetric provides the capability of memory access in both rows and columns, which brings new opportunities of significant energy and time savings if only a portion of data in the words need to be accessed. This work investigates the use of ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), an emerging nonvolatile, low-power, deeply-scalable, CMOS-compatible transistor technology, and proposes a new 3transistor/cell symmetric nonvolatile memory (SymNVM). With $\sim 1.67\mathrm{x}$ higher density as compared with the prior FeFET design, significant benefits of energy and latency improvement have been achieved, as evaluated and discussed in depth in this paper.
