Non-stencil kernels with irregular memory access patterns pose unique challenges to achieving high computing performance and hardware efficiency in FPGA high-level synthesis. We present a highly versatile and systematic approach, termed as Graph-Morphing, to constructing a reconfigurable computing engine specifically optimized to perform non-stencil kernel computing. Graph-Morphing achieves significant performance improvement by fragmenting operations across loop iterations and subsequently rescheduling computation and data to maximize overall performance. In experiments, Graph-Morphing achieves 2â€“13 times performance improvement albeit with significantly more hardware usage. For accelerating non-stencil kernel computing, Graph-Morphing proposes a new research direction.
