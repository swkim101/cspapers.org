Verification is essential to prevent malfunctioning of software systems. Model checking allows to verify conformity with nominal behavior. As manual definition of specifications from such systems gets infeasible, automated techniques to mine specifications from data become increasingly important. Existing approaches produce specifications of limited lengths, do not segregate functions and do not easily allow to include expert input. We present BaySpec, a dynamic mining approach to extract temporal specifications from Bayesian models, which represent behavioral patterns. This allows to learn specifications of arbitrary length from imperfect traces. Within this framework we introduce a novel extraction algorithm that for the first time mines LTL specifications from such models.
