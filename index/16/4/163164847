Shadow stacks are the go-to solution for perfect backward-edge control-flow integrity (CFI). Software shadow stacks trade off security for performance. Hardware-assisted shadow stacks are efficient and secure, but expensive to deploy. We present authenticated call stack (ACS), a novel mechanism for precise verification of return addresses using aggregated message authentication codes. We show how ACS can be realized using ARMv8.3-A pointer authentication, a new low-overhead mechanism for protecting pointer integrity. Our solution achieves security comparable to hardware-assisted shadow stacks, while incurring negligible performance overhead (<0.5%) but requiring no additional hardware support.
