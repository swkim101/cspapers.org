In this paper, we propose a novel and SAT-resistant logic-locking technique, denoted as Full-Lock, to obfuscate and protect the hardware against threats including IP-piracy and reverse-engineering. The Full-Lock is constructed using a set of small-size fully Programmable Logic and Routing block (PLR) networks. The PLRs are SAT-hard instances with reasonable power, performance and area overheads which are used to obfuscate (1) the routing of a group of selected wires and (2) the logic of the gates leading and proceeding the selected wires. The Full-Lock resists removal attacks and breaks a SAT attack by significantly increasing the complexity of each SAT iteration.
