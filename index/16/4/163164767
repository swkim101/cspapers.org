Non-volatile memories (NVMs) are vulnerable to serious threat due to the endurance variation. We identify a new type of malicious attack, called Uniform Address Attack (UAA), which performs uniform and sequential writes to each line of the whole memory, and wears out the weaker lines (lines with lower endurance) early. Experimental results show that the lifetime of NVMs under UAA is reduced to 4.1% of the ideal lifetime. To address such attack, we propose a spare-line replacement scheme called Max-WE (Maximize the Weak linesâ€™ Endurance). By employing weak-priority and weak-strong-matching strategies for spare-line allocation, Max-WE is able to maximize the number of writes that the weakest lines can endure. Furthermore, Max-WE reduces the storage overhead of the mapping table by 85% through adopting a hybrid spare-line mapping scheme. Experimental results show that Max-WE can improve the lifetime by 9.5 X with the spare-line overhead and mapping overhead as 10% and 0.016% of the total space respectively.
