To satisfy increasing computing demands, heterogeneous computing platforms are gaining attention, especially CPU-FPGA platforms. Recently, emerging tightly coupled CPU-FPGA platforms with shared coherent caches (such as the Intel HARP and IBM POWER with CAPI) have been proposed to facilitate data communication and simplify the programming model. In this work, we propose LAMA, a static analysis and dynamic control combined framework for memory access management in such platforms, to further enhance the memory access efficiency and maintain the data consistency. Based on implementation results on the real Intel HARP2 platform, LAMA is shown to improve the performance by 34% on average with low overhead.
