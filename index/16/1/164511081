The Web contains many APIs that could be combined in countless ways to enable Intelligent Assistants to complete all sorts of tasks. We propose a method to automatically produce task completion flows from a collection of these APIs by combining them in a graph and automatically extracting paths from the graph for task completion. These paths chain together API calls and use the output of executed APIs as inputs to others. We automatically extract these paths from an API graph in response to a user query and then rank the paths by the likelihood of them leading to user satisfaction. We apply our approach for task completion in the email and calendar domains and show how it can be used to automatically create task completion flows.
