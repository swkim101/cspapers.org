This chapter introduces an activity-based framework for the adoption of radio frequency identification (RFID) in emergency management. The framework is based on a rather loose interpretation of the tasktechnology fit (TTF) theory. The chapter provides an overview of emergency management, a description of RFID characteristics and a scheme for classifying emergency management activities. It also reports literature survey on emergency management models, the use of RFID and RFID adoption models. Last but not least, it outlines the perceived benefits associated with the use of RFID in emergency management. It is hoped that the proposed framework can serve as a useful guidance for RFID adoption in emergency management.
