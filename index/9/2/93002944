• Motivation: DNNs usually require expensive storage and computation. • Goal: compress DNNs by (i) simultaneously eliminating unimportant neurons; (ii) tying together weights that correspond to strongly correlated neurons. • Outcome: by automatically tying together weights corresponding to highly correlated features, we alleviate the negative effect of strong correlations that may be induced by noisy inputs or co-adaption.
