Feature correspondence selection is pivotal to many feature-matching based tasks in computer vision. Searching spatially k-nearest neighbors is a common strategy for extracting local information in many previous works. However, there is no guarantee that the spatially k-nearest neighbors of correspondences are consistent because the spatial distribution of false correspondences is often irregular. To address this issue, we present a compatibility-specific mining method to search for consistent neighbors. Moreover, in order to extract and aggregate more reliable features from neighbors, we propose a hierarchical network named NM-Net with a series of graph convolutions that is insensitive to the order of correspondences. Our experimental results have shown the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four datasets with various inlier ratios and varying numbers of feature consistencies.
