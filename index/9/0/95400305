The purpose of this work was to explore the application of microwaves for the regeneration of activated carbon fibers saturated with ethanol. The efficacy of the regeneration was analyzed by the rate of desorption and mass loss. When the microwave power was 528W , the dosage of activated carbon fiber was 3.0g , the nitrogen gas flow rate was 1.4m3/h and the microwave irradiation time was 180s, the desorption rate was up to 90.2% and the outlet concentration of ethanol was 95.6%. The adsorption of activated carbon fiber after microwave regeneration for many times was larger than the fresh activated carbon fiber. And the rate of total mass loss was 4.74%.
