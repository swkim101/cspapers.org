A novel type of chiral methacrylamide derivative, N-[o-(4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazol-2-yl) phenyl]methacrylamide ((R)-PhOPMAM), was synthesized and radically polymerized to the corresponding polymers in moderate yields. The polymerization characteristics and the chiroptical behavior of the resultant polymers have been examined in detail by using IR and 1H NMR spectroscopies in comparison with our previous observation. The polymers showed relatively high molecular weights(Mn=5000-10000) and large specific rotations([α] 25D = -326.0°～-357.4°).
