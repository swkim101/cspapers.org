Rod-shaped β-FeOOH was synthesized through a well controlled hydrothermal reaction of FeCl3 and NH2CONH2. By varying the preparatory conditions such as NH2CONH2 concentration and reaction parameter we could establish precise control on the morphology of the sample. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were used to characterize the as-prepared products. The results showed the aspect ratio and mean size of theβ-FeOOH nanorods was achieved systematic control by regulating the concentration of urea. When the experimental time increased to 96h, the morphology of the resulting β-FeOOH changed from rod to nanocubes. Furthermore, the resulting rod-shaped iron hydroxides were transformed into pseudocube α-Fe2O3 by increasing the synthesis temperature at 160°C.
