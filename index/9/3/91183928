Accurate manipulation of a deformable body such as a piece of fabric is difficult because of its many degrees of freedom and unobservable properties affecting its dynamics. To alleviate these challenges, we propose the application of feedback-based control to robotic fabric strip folding. The feedback is computed from the low dimensional state extracted from a camera image. We trained the controller using reinforcement learning in simulation which was calibrated to cover the real fabric strip behaviors. The proposed feedback-based folding was experimentally compared to two state-of-the-art folding methods and our method outperformed both of them in terms of accuracy.
