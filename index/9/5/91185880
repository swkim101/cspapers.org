We use empirical methods to argue that deep neural networks (DNNs) do not achieve their performance by memorizing training data in spite of overlyexpressive model architectures. Instead, they learn a simple available hypothesis that fits the finite data samples. In support of this view, we establish that there are qualitative differences when learning noise vs. natural datasets, showing: (1) more capacity is needed to fit noise, (2) time to convergence is longer for random labels, but shorter for random inputs, and (3) that DNNs trained on real data examples learn simpler functions than when trained with noise data, as measured by the sharpness of the loss function at convergence. Finally, we demonstrate that for appropriately tuned explicit regularization, e.g. dropout, we can degrade DNN training performance on noise datasets without compromising generalization on real data.
