The detection of anomalies and exceptional patterns in social interaction networks is a prominent research direction in data mining and network science. For anomaly detection, typically two questions need to be addressed and defined: (1) What is an anomaly? (2) How do we identify an anomaly? This paper discusses model-based approaches and methods for addressing and formalizing these issues in the context of feature-rich social interaction networks. It provides a categorization of model-based approaches and provides perspectives and first promising directions for its implementation.
