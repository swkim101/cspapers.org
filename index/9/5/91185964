Network traffic for delay-sensitive services has become a dominant part in the network. Proactive caching with the aid of predictive information has been proposed as a promising method to enhance delay performance. In this paper, we analytically investigate the problem of how to efficiently utilize uncertain predictive information to design proactive caching strategies with provably good access-delay characteristics. We first derive an upper bound for the average amount of proactive service per request that the system can support. We then analyze the behavior of a family of threshold-based proactive strategies using an innovative Markov chain analysis, and show that the average amount of proactive service per request can be maximized by properly selecting the threshold. Finally, we propose the UNIFORM strategy, which is the threshold-based strategy with the optimal threshold. Surprisingly, we show that it outperforms the commonly used Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) type proactive strategies in terms of delay. We perform extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the influence of thresholds on delay performance, and explicitly compare performance of the EDF strategy and the UNIFORM strategy.
