Introduction: To infer the causal relations among sets of measurement variables in neuroimaging data Granger causality [4] and the equivalent directed transfer function (DTF) approach [5] have been invoked. Granger causality is a fundamental tool for the empirical investigation of dynamic interactions in multivariate time-series and causality is here based on the common sense conception that causes always precede their effects. As such, an event taking place in the future cannot cause another event in the past or present. The causal relations are derived by fitting the following autoregressive model to the space-time dataXI×T [5] xi(t) = ∑Υ τ=1 ∑I j=1 qi,j(τ)xj(t− τ) + ei(t). In the frequency domain these systems of equations correspond to [5] x(f) = Q(f)x(f) + e(f)⇒ x(f) = (I −Q(f))−1e(f) = H(f)e(f) whereH(f) = (I −Q(f))−1 denotes the transfer function such that hi,j(f) denotes the influence of channel/voxel j to channel/voxel i at frequency f . In the time domain this can equivalently be written as xi(t) = ∑T τ=1 ∑I j=1 hi,j(τ)ej(t+ 1− τ) where ej(t) is the input signal to channel j and hi,j(τ) the influence of channel j to channel i at delay τ . Methods: Instead of operating with channel specific input functions e(t) derived from the autoregressive model we will operate with latent input functions s(t) based on the following convolutional representation xi(t) = ∑Υ τ=1 ∑D d=1 ai,d(τ)sd(t+ 1− τ) + εi(t). Where εi(t) is residual noise. The above bilinear convolutive representation assume that the data are caused by underlying latent sources rather than causes stemming from the measurement channels themselves. This we believe to hold for neuroimaging data in general as the voxels/channels record the manifestation of underlying latent neural activity hence it is these underlying sources that drive the measurements rather than voxel/channel specific inputs. We note that this representation corresponds to the convolutive ICA model [8] which was used in [3] for the analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics in EEG. Comparing the above convolutive bilinear decomposition with Granger causal modelling it can be seen that ai,d(τ) and the transfer tensor hi,j(τ) in the Granger causality analysis are closely related. The difference being that the transfer tensor hi,j(τ) is based on channel specific input signals e(t) whereas the transfer tensor in the above convolutive bilinear model is based on latent input signal s(t). Hence, causal relations from latent variables to the measuring channels can be inferred directly from the above convolutive bilinear representation and as such the representation above can potentially perform dimensionality reduction resulting in fewer latent sources than observed measurement voxels/channels. Furthermore, constraints on the causal relations can be directly imposed onA(τ) such as sparsity or restricting the transfer function to specific delays. These two types of constraints can improve interpretation of the causal relation between the latent sources and the measured voxels/channels. Finally, spatial regions that are caused by the source sd(t) are automatically grouped in ad(τ) while the propagation over time of the source to the voxels/channels is encoded in the temporal mode. As such, the latent modeling above naturally group instantaneous effects inA(τ) whereas Granger causality is hard to interpret in case of instantaneous propagation between voxels/channels [4] .
