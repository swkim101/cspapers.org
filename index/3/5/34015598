In implantable antenna applications for human health care, normal-mode helical antenna (NMHA) is considered to be one of promising candidates. Due to antennas put inside human body, electromagnetic simulations are needed to model human body and clarify electrical characteristics of antennas. Electromagnetic performances of NMHA can be conveniently calculated by using Method of Moment (MoM). However, accuracies of calculated results were not clear. In this paper, another simulation method of finite element method (FEM) is employed as a reference. Calculated results such as self-resonant structures, electromagnetic field distributions, input impedances and radiation pattern are compared between MoM and FEM. Through very good agreements between two simulation methods, calculation accuracies of MoM are ensured.
