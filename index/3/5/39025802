A consultant is necessary whenever on is faced with a problem solving situation in a domain one does not fully understand. The lack of knowledge may be incidental, as it is when the domain or device is fairly simple but time constraints make it impossible for the user to learn all that is necessary. Computer systems like MACSYMA in which the level of commands is so close to the level of the task environment that the user is apt to confuse a simply defined procedure (like COEFF) with its mathematical counterpart (here coefficient) that it at best approximates. A computer program is described which has the capability of conversing with its user in English about a difficulty he has encountered, and providing information tailored to his need. The MACSYMA Advisor is a program distinct from MACSYMA with its own separate data base and expertise. For convenience the program can be called directly from MACSYMA and can access the user's data structures contained therein. The Advisor described here deals only with the "straightline" or nested use of MACSYMA commands and not loops or user-defined functions. The implementation of the Advisor relies heavily on an explict, internal "model" of the user's state of knowledge, his goals, and his "plan" for achieving them.
