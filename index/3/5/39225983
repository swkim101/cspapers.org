Digital mobile devices, such as smart phones, have become an essential part of daily lives for the young generation, especially college students. The rapid growth of wireless and mobile technologies results in a huge demand on qualified professionals in this area. More and more schools started teaching wireless and mobile networking, but how to provide students with hands-on practice experience is still a challenge. The networking capabilities of smart mobile devices make it a perfect instructional tool for networking related course teaching. In this study, we have designed and developed a labware with Android smart phones that focuses on teaching and learning of fundamental data communications and networking concepts by making use of the mobile nature of smart phones and mobile devices. The goal of this labware is to provide students with hands-on experience with mobile devices to better understand networking concepts such as different layers of TCP/IP protocol, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and a wide range of networking methodologies/implementations in a easy-adoptable, affordable, and effective way.
