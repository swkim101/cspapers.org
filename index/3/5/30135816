Different implementations of remote controlled robots with wheels or stepping mechanisms are in use that can inspect and repair the interior of a pipe or duct. However, autonomous locomotion in complex shaped hollows with corners, steps and branches remains a major challenge. This paper describes a robot with articulated legs that opens up the possibility of servicing complex pipe systems. To solve the pipe climbing task autonomously, the robot has a hierarchical control architecture with reflexive and reactive behaviour. Experiments were carried out in a 2D simulation as well as with an eight-legged robot test-bed. The experiments show the physical feasibility of such a robot, and that it is possible to achieve a robust, safe and powerful operation using reflexive and reactive behaviour.<<ETX>>
