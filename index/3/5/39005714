The objective of the International Music Information Retrieval Systems Evaluation Laboratory project (IMIRSEL) is the establishment of the necessary resources for the scientifically valid development and evaluation of emerging Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Music Digital Library (MDL) techniques and technologies. IMIRSEL is located at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign (UIUC). Project Principal Investigator is J. Stephen Downie of GSLIS and Co-Principal Investigator is Prof. Michael Welge of the Automated Learning Group (ALG) of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). A mission of the project is the creation of secure, yet accessible, terascale collections of music materials in a variety of audio, symbolic and metadata forms. These collections, when coupled with a set of standardized experimental tasks and standardized evaluation metrics, will allow members of the international MIR/ MDL research community to participate in the newly created, TREC-like, Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) contests.
