In a world saturated with computers, it is important that the popnlace have some understanding of what thesedevices am, how they work, what they can do, and what they cannot do. People will not intelligently live with machines if they regard them as indistinguishable from magic. In fact, many authors (Brookshear(1988), Schaffer(1988), Tucker (1992)) have called for &eased breadth in the early computer science courses specifically to better educate nonmajors who may never take another computer course and to give perspective to majors who are looking forward to a series of specialized courses. In the education of majors, many recent committees and writers haveargued for kreased breadth in the early courses including Denning et al. (1989), the ACIWIEEE-CS Joint Curriculum Task Force (1991), and Barker et al (1992).
