This paper addresses the problem of trajectory optimization for the transition of a Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) tailsitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The proposed strategy performs a model based optimization, where the model represents the closed-loop dynamics of the UAV with low-level control, ensuring attitude stabilization over the whole trajectory. We discuss the design of an optimization framework, vehicle modeling, and elaborate on the cost function construction. An additional feedback gain is implemented on the throttle channel with altitude discrepancies as its input to provide some level of robustness to wind disturbances. The overall approach is verified in simulation and experimental results with a focus on optimization of the back-transition (cruise-to-hover) of the Wingtra S100 VTOL tailsitter.
