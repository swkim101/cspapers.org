These results reveal that the costs of testing are perceived to be 30% of development resources by the people attending these meetings. I believe that the actual costs throughout the product life cycle are much higher. In an economic analysis of the costs of testing, one should also include the risks involved in poorly funded or poorly executed tests. A defect that escapes from system test into the field increases the cost of customer support, and distracts developers from their primary task of producing the next release on time. There has been some work done on this issue by the Software Metrics community but I recommend that further research be carried out to increase our understanding of the full economic impact of software testing.
