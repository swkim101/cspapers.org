Public school choice at the primary and secondary levels is one of the key elements of the U.S. No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). If a school does not meet assessment goals for two consecutive years, by law the district must offer students the opportunity to transfer to a school that is meet- ing its goals. Making a choice with such potential impact on a child’s future is clearly monumental, yet astonishingly few parents take advantage of the opportunity. Our research has shown that a signiﬁcant part of the problem arises from issues in information access and information overload, particularly for low socioeconomic status families. We have developed an online application, called SmartChoice , to provide parents with school recommendations for individual students based on parents’ preferences and students’ needs, interests, abili-ties, and talents. The application employs content-based rec- ommender systems techniques to generate a personalized list of schools that have a demonstrated track record with chil- dren who share a child’s interests, skills, and needs. The ﬁrst version of the application is deployed and live for fo- cus group participants who have been using it for the January and March/April 2008 Charlotte-Mecklenburg school choice periods.
