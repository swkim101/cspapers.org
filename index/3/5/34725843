Summing up: We introduce an algorithm to obtain an effective discrete description of a large class of POWS on surfaces. Trajectories of flows are represented by words, and our algorithm is able to approzimate to any length these words by composing simple substitutions, i.e by iterating simple parallel rewriting on symbols. These approximations are controlled by a convergent multidimensional continued fraction. Also, the method allows us to obtain recurrent words with linear complexity over any number of letters.
