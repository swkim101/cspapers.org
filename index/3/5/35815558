I will describe and demonstrate the "Meeting List Tool", a shared application built with the Access Grid Toolkit for use in AG meetings.At present, the two most common ways of sharing text-based information during an AG meeting are shared presentations and the chat tool built into the Venue Client. The former is ideal for static content which is known in advance. The latter is ideal for sharing short pieces of information, such as a URL. What is apparently missing is an application for which data can be prepared in advance, displayed and quickly manipulated during a meeting, and kept at the close of the meeting by all the participants in the collaboration.This application is designed to fill this gap. The current version provides a list of items that can be highlighted, added, deleted, edited, and re-ordered, with the changes being propagated to all instances of the tool.
