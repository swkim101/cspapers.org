Abstmct Our success in deploying the illusion of infinite stomge to applications rests in the use of database tebhnology. Tht3 paper presents the support for transactions in the ADSTAR Dhtributed Stomge Manager, (A DSiU) system. For a user, ADSM offers a backup and archive service in a heterogeneous cliint-server environment. It also operates as a file migratton mposito~ in some Unix environments. As a stomge manager, the ADSM server is a Mass Stomge System (MSS) that administers stomge hiemrchies of arbitrary depth in which all activities are done on behatf of transactions. Its systems goals include to epemte in many computing phz#omts, to pmvidG h@lyavaihtble metadata, to administer effective& a huge amount,of entities, to support continuous and unattended opemtion, and-to support a high degree of concutrent requests.
