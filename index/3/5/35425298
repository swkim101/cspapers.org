The issues of recognition of and representation for motion concepts, with all their semantic richness, have been largely ignored by the AI community.

Badler considered image sequences attempting to provide English descriptions for motions recognized in the images. He provided precise definitions for directionals and adverbials and also outlined ideas on representation of the verb semantic components from [1].
