1. Summary Intellectual constructs and tools that are widely used to solve the problems of society have been woven into educational programs. For example, the three R’s (reading, ‘riting & ‘rithmetic) are core to a strong fundamental education, and practitioners and researchers routinely apply these tools to their daily work. Computing has become an essential and pervasive problemsolving toolset. This development has fostered much discussion about the role of computing in a modern education, the broadening nature of computing majors and concentrations and their place in post-secondary institutions, for example, [6,7]. Computer science educators recognize the importance of improving information technology (IT) skills and fluency, and a number of studies have developed guidelines on how to do this [3,4]. However, computer science has analytical concepts and tools that offer educational benefits beyond simple IT fluency.
