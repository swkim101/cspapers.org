We describe a new tree search method which searches best few paths with backtracking in parallel by the following algorithm(α-β-γ search). Expand the best nodes at one time. If the number of new nodes which have been expanded by a selected node exceeds a preset threshold(β), only the best β nodes are kept and others are pruned. If the total number of newly generated node sequences and non-expanded node sequences exceeds a preset threshold (γ), only the best y node sequences are kept, and others are removed. Repeat these consecutive processes until a complete sequence is generated. We evaluated this method by simulations and experiments, and obtained good performances both in the search efficiency and in the recognition rate.
