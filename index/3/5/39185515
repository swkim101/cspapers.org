The automation of program development procedures is one of the important subjects to be solved for improving productivity. The documentation of program specification and coding process involve many mechanical operations. Presently, however, they are done mostly by human efforts. This greatly hinders the improvement of both productivity and program quality.
 For the purpose of solving all the problems, we developed an experimental system SDL/PAD. Upon receipt of the specifications described in a structured form which has been defined in accordance with structured design, the SDL/PAD. system automatically generates programs written with a computer language such as PL/M or the like and specification documents.
 This system eliminates the troublesome inconsistency between documents and source programs.
