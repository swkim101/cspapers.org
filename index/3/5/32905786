Long-term evolution (LTE) and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) have earned reputations to be a cutting-edge technology, which can boost significantly wireless communication performances. The paper aims at providing LTE MIMO performances in indoor environments and, therefore, guidelines for network operators can be proposed. Medium access control throughput (MAC TP) and some system parameters in LTE network that are linked with MAC TP, such as Channel Quality Indicator (CQI), Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), Ranking Indicator (RI), Pre-coding Matrix Indicator (PMI), as well as MIMO utilization, are analysed. Effects of indoor propagation, Line of Sight (LoS), No-line of Sight (NLoS), strong and weak signal levels on Signal to Noise Radio (SNR) strength and MIMO utilization are clarified. In this paper, the performances of MIMO transmission mode over transmit diversity (TxDiv, Multiple Input-Single OutputMISO) and single antenna (Single Input Multiple Output-SIMO) modes are also analyzed and compared at overall manner and at channel-specific manners.
