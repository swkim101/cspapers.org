Cell: (925) 876-4131 larry@maggotranch.com Walnut Creek, CA. Over nine years in massively multiplayer videogame development. An industry leader in bringing a strong focus on process automation, metrics and scalable system architectures into game development after my work in helping turn around EA’s flagship online game The Sims Online. My previous work in the 80’s and 90’s was also a leadership role in large-scale virtual worlds, where I created system architectures for military real-time, large-scale training simulations based on a parallel and distributed supercomputing backbone. My last role was CTO for an online games startup, Emergent Game Technologies, where I worked on market analysis, system architecture, business development and fund raising.
