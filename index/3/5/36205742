1. Summary The four women on this panel devote their scholarship to computer games. We love games of all sorts. We love to play them and build them. Both activities require creative, inquisitive, problem solving that is essential to good computer science. We also love to use games as vehicles for teaching important ideas about computer science and software design. At least one of us is a hard core gamer. And one of us is old enough to have played, as an adult, the very first video games. So it is with just a bit of frustration that we repeatedly hear that “boys like games and girls like stories.” Granted, that is hyperbolic, but in subtler ways the current trend to use games as a vehicle to attract students to computer science is focused on a narrow perception of what a video game is, as well as a narrow perception of who a “gamer” is. The bifurcation of focus: that to attract a particular kind of male to computing through games, and a particular kind of female through media and storytelling, is quite frankly, in the words of a panel member, “hogwash.” We four love both games and interactive stories. From our scholarship and our classroom experience we know that girls do like games, and boys like stories. This calls into question how undergraduate programs in computer science, media, game design and information science embrace or reject “games” in their core. The CS community must consider the assumptions being made both about what game design is, and how it can be used as a vehicle to fulfill a pedagogic agenda. This panel will address four important issues: (1) Perceptions of what computer science and game design are, (2) Taking a broad view of what a game is, and focusing on the creative process of game design (3) exploiting the range of game genre to fulfill learning objectives, and (4) Assessing whether or not those learning objectives have been reached.
