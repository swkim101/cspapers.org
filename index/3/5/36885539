EXTENDED ABSTRACT Educating students on Digital Library (DL) research and practices has become an important course taught in many universities. Due to the rapid development of DL field and students’ diverse backgrounds and learning preferences, students face a steep learning curve when they try to grasp core concepts/topics and understand different DL views/approaches. DiLight is an interactive, integrated and active e-learning environment. One of the goals of DiLight is to organize course-related materials into an ontology [1] to support students to learn DL related topics and complete their learning tasks quickly and easily. DiLight is built on top of DSpace 1 , a leading open-source digital repository system, to take advantage of DSpace’s powerful content management and search tools. Our demonstration will concentrate on DiLight’s ontology-based information access functions.
