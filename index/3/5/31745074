The goal of the Conro project is to build deployable self-reconfigurable robots, i.e., small homogeneous modular robots that can be reconfigured into different shapes such as snakes or hexapods. In this paper we describe the mechanical design of the first generation of Conro modules: the philosophy of their design, their parts and functionality and derive two inequalities that relate the design parameters of a module. Each module is fully self-contained in every sense; it carries its own CPU, power supply, and actuators. The modules were designed to work in groups, as robots, and thus, they also support inter-module communication. We conclude the paper describing a Conro hexapod as an example of the robots that can be built using these modules.
