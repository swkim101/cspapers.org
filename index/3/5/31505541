This paper explores the fundamental differences between two sentence-parsers developed in the early 1970's: Riesbeck's parser for $chank's'conceptual dependency' theory (4, 5), and the 'LNR' parser for Norman and Rumelhart's 'active :~emantic network' theory (3). The Riesbeck parser and the I,NR parser share a common goal that of trsnsforming an input sentence into a canonical form for later use by memory~inference~paraphrase processes, l,'or both parserz, this transformation is the act of 'comprehension', although they appear to go about it in very (Jifferent ways. Are these differences real or apparent?
