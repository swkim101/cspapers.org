Ad-servers have to satisfy many different targeting criteria, and the combination can often result in no feasible solution. We hypothesize that advertisers may be defining these metrics to create a kind of "proxy target". We therefore reformulate the standard ad-serving problem to one where we attempt to get as close as possible to the advertiser's multi-dimensional target inclusive of delivery. We use a simple simulation to illustrate the behavior of this algorithm compared to Constraint and Pacing strategies. The system is then deployed in one of the largest video ad-servers in the United States and we show experimental results from live test ads, as well as 6 months of production performance across hundreds of ads. We find that the live ad-server tests match the simulation, and we report significant gains in multi-KPI performance from using the error minimization strategy.
