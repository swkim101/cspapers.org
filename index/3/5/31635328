We present a breadth-first, lecture- and lab-based approach to introducing Computer Science that uses functional programming. Functional programming provides a low-overhead introduction to programming (no types, few constructs, and little syntax), enabling students to write, in their first semester, programs sophisticated enough to exemplify important concepts of Computer Science. It also encourages good programming style (modular design and testing, e.g.) and serves as an introduction to an important problem-solving paradigm. The course gives the students a broad overview of Computer Science and helps them gauge their interest in the field.
