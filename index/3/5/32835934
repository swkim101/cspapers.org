This paper proposes a new type of two wheels caster type odometer to estimate the current position and orientation of omni-directional vehicles. The proposed odometer is composed of two passive wheels and one passive rotational axis. The two wheels rotate independently, and the rotational axis changes the odometer's orientation as the omni-directional vehicle moves. Three rotary encoders using a gear train measure angular velocities of the two wheels and rotational axis. A mechanism of the gear train is proposed to prevent the encoder from being entangled with it. Using measured values of the three encoders, the current velocity vector of an omni-directional vehicle is calculated by kinematics of the odometer. Using the velocity vector, the current position and orientation of the omni-directional vehicle are estimated by dead reckoning. Results of localization experiments by the developed odometer are shown.
