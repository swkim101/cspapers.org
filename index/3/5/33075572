Data mining started its move out of the statistics and machine learning ghettos and into the mainstream almost 10 years ago. With great fanfare and a large influx of venture capital, data mining was going to change the very nature of business. Yet data mining products have had relatively modest success in the marketplace. The reasons include limitations and misplaced emphasis in the products' features and functions, unrealistic expectations set by messages from the data mining community, and a lack of readiness by many prospective users. This session will look at where vendors have succeeded and failed with their products, what expectations users should have, and suggestions for achieving the potential of this exciting and valuable technology.
