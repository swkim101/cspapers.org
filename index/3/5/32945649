The evolution of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has radically changed our lives, making information available from anywhere at any time through different kinds of devices. The advantage of the growing availability of computational power and connectivity resources at low prices is the easiness of collecting, sharing, processing, and accessing information. This advantage however does not come for free as it introduces unprecedented privacy risks. The attention toward these problems is growing every day and the need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques has been widely recognized. WPES is a yearly forum, this year at its 12th edition, that brings together researchers and practitioners interested in discussing the privacy issues characterizing our global and interconnected society.
