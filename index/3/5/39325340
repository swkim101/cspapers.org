While large scale digital computers have brought about major changes in many areas of the engineering process, these changes have been felt primarily where analytical, accrual, or clerical functions are performed. Here computer programs have been applied to a broad spectrum of problems that have the properties of being well defined, solvable by equations, bounded by machine capability and suited to batch processing. Such applications are by no means exhausted; however, there does exist both a firm precedent for usage, and a set of definable goals for future development and exploitation by computerized techniques. While applications of this nature have received usage in the design areas, they are limited in scope and do not satisfy the essential needs of the designer. The designer does not have the luxury of working with a defined problem; his function is to create the definition. Until recently, the computer did not seem suitable for â€œpure&rdquo design applications. Computing machines have not been powerful enough to handle the masses of data that the designer requires. Operational procedures did not produce answers in time to be of use to the designer. But worst of all, there seemed little hope of economically defining a realistic three-dimensional structure by a computer program.
