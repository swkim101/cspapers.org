Extended story generation, such as the creation of soap opera stories, is a difficult and interesting problem for Artificial Intelligence.

This method concentrates on the need to keep story-telling universes consistent and coherent. We describe "the information that must be maintained for characters and interpersonal relations, and the use of stereotypical information about people to help motivate trait values.
