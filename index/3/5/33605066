We present HIGGINS, a system for Knowledge Acquisition (KA), placing emphasis on its architecture. The distinguishing characteristic and novelty of HIGGINS lies in its blending of two engines: an automated Information Extraction (IE) engine, aided by semantic resources and statistics, and a game-based Human Computing (HC) engine. We focus on KA from web pages and text sources and, in particular, on deriving relationships between entities. As a running application we utilize movie narratives, from which we wish to derive relationships among movie characters.
