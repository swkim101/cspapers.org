Data and information facilitate the creation of knowledge" is Big Idea III in the Computer Science Principles effort. The June issue of ACM Inroads spotlighted some of the pilot offerings of CS Principles, which included spreadsheets, database structure, and XML as coverage of this big idea. The implementation of the CS Principles framework is quite flexible, as illustrated by these pilots. An article in the subsequent September ACM Inroads specifically mentioned the importance of big data and "Data Science." What concepts do you think should be included as part of data and information? The goal of this Birds-of-a-Feather session is to bring database educators together with those interested in teaching CS Principles to brainstorm this big idea.
