In this paper we show how the pattern samples generated from the unknown asymmetric finite mixture distribution are dichotomized by the Karhunen-Loeve orthogonal system in the optimal way. We introduce the concept of the difference of features of two categories and prove that decreasing the error probability of dichotomy is equal to increasing the difference of features of two categories. And it can be shown that the maximum difference of features obtained by the KL system is equivalent to that which is obtained by the Bayes solution. Moreover it can be proved that there exists a dichotomy which converges to the Bayes soJution by increasing the number of samples.
