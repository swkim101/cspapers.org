Robotics education is one of the most important subjects now and for the foreseeable future. Our project focuses on designing a robotics education platform, which includes extensive libraries of code that allows any student from high school to college level to study robotics. We also have significantly addressed two of the major problems in robotics, usability and affordability. Using a Cellbot, a robot that uses an Arduino microcontroller and an Android smartphone, enables us to quickly and affordably add new sensors or features to the entire robotics system. By combining a Cellbot with the advance software we developed, we have designed a system, which is easy to learn and allows the robot to perform numerous high performance tasks. As students advance in their programming abilities more complex algorithms and sensors can be easily added to the system. Effectively making the robot "grow" with the students.
