This paper describes the development of a parser based on the Moulton and Robinson (1981) dependency theory of syntax, and several strategies by which we are attempting to apply the outputs of this parser to the processes of Information Retrieval. We first discuss the limits of present Information Retrieval theory and the potential benefits of linguistic analysis for Information Retrieval. Next we briefly present the Moulton and Robinson theory, contrast it to rewrite rule based theories, and outline its general advantages as an approach to natural language processing. Next we describe the parser we have implemented based on the Moulton and Robinson theory, and some of the implementation issues we have addressed. Finally, we discuss several strategies by which this parser could be applied to Information Retrieval, and the problems involved in this application.
