The whole idea of this paper is to power a sensor which is buried inside concrete at a certain depth by delivering power to the load resistance of the sensor antenna. The sensor antenna inside concrete has to absorb power from the power transmitted by the antenna outside concrete. If an antenna is buried inside concrete then the power would decay according to the parameters of concrete. The purpose of this paper is to also investigate which antenna would be the best to receive maximum power inside concrete. This paper researches into the parameters of concrete as well as the behavior of electromagnetic waves as it penetrates into concrete.
