The design of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) requires collaborative effort by a group of diverse co-designers. This group is typically constrained to meet in the same time and place. In this poster, we describe TelePICTIVE, an experimental groupware prototype that supports this design process by users at multiple, dispersed, geographical and temporal locations.
