This paper describes an automatic string placement program used to reorder cells in polycell rows such that channel routing in the adjacent channels (a) is not blocked by cyclic constraints, and (b) needs fewer routing tracks. The program utilizes cell reflections and pairwise neighbor exchanges, simultaneously monitoring both the channels immediately above and below the row being reordered. Reductions of 25% in the number of required routing tracks are commonly obtained.
