Goal specificity is an essential factor for learning with educational hypertexts. A trade-off has been reported between specific tasks, which have more effective navigation with better detail knowledge, and unspecific tasks, which have less effective navigation with better general knowledge. For this study, learners answered both multiple choice items and open-ended questions either while processing online a hypertext about English Grammar (searchers), or after processing the hypertext (readers). It was found that searchers answered questions online in more detail, while readers answered more questions. Moreover, only searchers’ performance changed over time. Differences between both processing tasks were most evident in open -ended questions showing searchers’ better understanding of details and their time management problems for collecting extensively details. Results demonstrate that processing task is an effective factor for influencing learning and should be taken into account before manipulating hypertext designs. Moreover, differences in reproduced details between learners with specific or unspecific processing task could be affected not only by different familiarity with the learning system but also by different learning strategies and acquired knowledge structures.
