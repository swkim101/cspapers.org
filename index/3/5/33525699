The integrated fabrication of body structures, actuators, sensors, and electronic circuits into one robot system is an open problem in robotics. Simple and rapid construction of electric actuators in the body through existing approaches is difficult. We take advantage of the liquid-to-gas phase change, and propose an electric phase-change actuator comprising a printable fluidic actuator controlled by an inkjet printed electric heater. The actuator can easily be integrated with origami robots. We theoretically analyze the dynamics of electro-fluidic conversion in the actuator and compare it with actual measurement data. The proposed actuator is verified in real examples of a shape-shifting origami structure and a robot gripper with a printed touch sensor.
