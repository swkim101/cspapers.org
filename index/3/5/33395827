In the next decade, video-on-demand and digital library services will likely be widely available. To design effective storage systems for these applications, computer architects need accurate models of expected workloads. However, due to the fiercely competitive nature of these emerging industries, traces of existing systems and predictions of future workloads are difficult to obtain. We present our predictions for these workloads and some of the evidence we have gathered to support these predictions. We characterize several aspects of the candidate workloads: the number of objects managed by the system, the size of the objects, the size of requests made by users, locality of accesses to the storage system, the number of users active in the system at peak loads, the response time goals of the system, and the throughput required by each user of the system.
