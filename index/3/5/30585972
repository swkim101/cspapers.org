The current generation of mobile smartphones are not just devices for voice communication. Instead, they are frequently used as mobile PC replacements that are used to edit documents, browse the web, check email, and play games. However, this functionality comes at the cost of battery lifetimes. Indeed, to maintain the slim form factor required for these phones (which impacts the amount of battery that can be put into the phone), it is quite common for the battery lifetimes of smartphones to be significantly shorter compared to previous generation of "dumber" phones.
 In modern smartphones, the three main sources of power consumption are, 1) the CPU, 2) the display, and 3) the network interfaces. Games are popular applications which tend to consume a lot of system resources. In this demonstration we aim to show our system [1] for reducing power consumption of the LCD display during game play. The Demonstration will involve Quake 3 Running on an Android powered Mobile phone.
