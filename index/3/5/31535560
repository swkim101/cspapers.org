MCC (Mobile Cloud Computing) performs computation offloading from mobile edge devices to centralized cloud services for achieving the reduction in resource consumption of mobile devices. MBaaS is considered as a new service model within the range of MCC and firebase by Google has been accepted as the most popular MBaaS. However, firebase has not made the efforts for performing computation offloading, as it is expected from an MCC platform. We have contributed in two folds by 1) identifying the limitations of firebase as an MCC platform and by 2) proposing RQL (REST Query Language) as a wrapper over firebase to improve its services for achieving computational offloading. RQL is used for requesting data in the form of JSON instead of using URLs for making REST requests. We have also explained different case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of RQL for converting firebase to an MCC platform.
