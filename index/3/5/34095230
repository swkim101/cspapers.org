Sensing contact forces can be a key enabler for higher order dexterous manipulation in robotic hands. To sense the full range of contact pressure distribution would provide the best solution, but it is in practice unfeasible when considering very deformable and adaptable hands. This paper proposes an approach to estimate the contact forces acting on an under-actuated adaptable hand by combining the compliance model of the hand with the geometric configuration of the hand itself. This is done by introducing reasonable assumptions about the net contact force on each phalanx. The proposed method is introduced and experimentally validated on two fingers of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand.
