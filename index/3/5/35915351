In this paper, the expression of the power variance (PV) of an OFDM symbol has been explored for peak to average power ratio (PAPR) reduction. It is seen through simulation results and complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) curves that PV expression used in PAPR comparison can be simplified to a point where it becomes practical to use such a computationally complex PV expression for PAPR comparison.
