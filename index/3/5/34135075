Current smartphones have been equipped with different kinds of sensors and enhanced by powerful mobile operating systems, such as Android OS, iOS, Windows Mobile, Blackberry and Symbian OS. These advantages, however, are not fully utilized by operating smartphone only in isolation. Therefore, we demonstrate Uno, a platform that is specifically designed to allow people to share resources in smartphone environments. Uno allows users to cooperate by sharing their files and sensors under a strong privacy protection. The fundamental idea is to map a smartphone to a networked node by the means of tagged objects in the distributed sharing system and to treat sensors and resources as sub-objects to the smartphones. Sensors or resource sharing are based on different attributes' settings in the system. Furthermore, Uno also supports a user with multiple smartphones. A Uno prototype implemented in Android OS [1] with full features will be shown in this demo.
