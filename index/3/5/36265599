A meta-analysis is performed on the last twenty years of SIGCSE Technical Symposium Proceedings, looking for the kind of CS Educational Research that has been done at the CS1/CS2 level. A six-point taxonomy of articles types is described. It is shown that about one in five of all CS1/CS2 presentations have used some kind of experimental model, albeit "experimental" is defined quite broadly. Over the last ten years both the number of experimental models, and the percentage of experimental models among CS1/CS2 has significantly increased. SIGCSE members are challenged to adopt a research model for their presentations to the Technical Symposium.
