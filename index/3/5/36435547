The University of Kentucky College of Architecture has had a program in computer applications to architecture since 1967. Because (1) UK's program is an undergraduate one (5 year, B. Arch) and (2) the level of funding has been low (.5 to 1.0 full time equivalent faculty assigned to the program) the emphasis is on teaching fundamentals. Originally the program had only one elective course available to upper classmen and consisted primarily of ad hoc applications of computers to the architectural programming, design and construction process. Fortran and plotter graphics material composed about 2/3's the semester's work with the remainder devoted to space planning, multiple solution generation, problem decomposition, structural, acoustical, and critical path exercises.
