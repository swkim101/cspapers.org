Besides a definition of " trivial " theorem, this paper presents a sketch of our methodology for the generalization of recurrence proofs on "trivial" theorems but that lead, in a context of automatic theorem proving, to very lengthy (or even impossible to achieve) proofs. 
 
This paper reduces to a description of a detailed example, we hope to make clear that our methodology is of a much wider field of application.
