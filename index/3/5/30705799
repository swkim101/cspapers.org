In Engineering curricula, the introductory course in computer science is an essential component of the lower division preparation of all engineers. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no consensus what should be included in an introductory computer science course for engineers. Moreover, limited energy has been given by the departments who deliver this introductory course to the currency and vitality of the course. The focus of this paper is to promote a discussion regarding the design and implementation of a three credit course that meets the overriding concerns voiced by Engineering faculties and by students who enroll in the courses. We present a prototype of a course that addresses the concerns of language preference expressed by Engineering faculty as well as their concern regarding the selection of the ever changing software packages to be presented to the students. Our design presents a course that will challenge all students regardless of their background in computing. This course would set in place a continuing mechanism to insure relevancy of the course to the students.
