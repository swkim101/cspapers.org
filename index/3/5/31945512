Using visual information such as TV monitors is the most important function in telerobotic task execution. The authors have proposed an intelligent control system for a monitoring camera to achieve telerobotic task execution. In this paper they extend the previously proposed system to the problem of monitoring multiple and concurrent tasks. The authors propose a higher level monitoring framework which takes into account the supervisor's view rather than working robot itself. Several results from an experiment are presented.
