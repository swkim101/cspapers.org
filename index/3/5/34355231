We present a simple generalised technique, for sequencing a multi-attribute file, which can be used in a situation where the query pattern is unknown and the term content equiprobable. The method is based on constructing a short spanning path through the records thereby minimising the sum of the Hamming distances between them. Retrieval performance is simulated over a range of query expressions and results suggest a significant reduction in the number of block accesses, using this technique, as compared with records randomly distributed over the file space.
