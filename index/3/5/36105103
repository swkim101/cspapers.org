In the field of character recognition, OCR is a success as many software have been commercialized, thanks to the exhaustive efforts of scientists. Nevertheless, there are existing cases in which these sophisticated systems fail, which has not been excavated that demands further investigation. This paper presents an attempt to build an effective algorithm in response to a cutting-edge topic in OCR, to determine the content of writing of type-written text document images in a special situation, where the source images are acquired by mobile phone camera, at a distant location. Through evaluating by ABBYY Finereader, it is observed that our system produced an improved gain in success rate.
