We are proposing an undergraduate course to introduce cloud computing technologies with guidance from an industry recognized certification: Amazon Certified Associate Developer. Today, cloud computing providers provide many services. For example, Amazon Web Services provide 46 broad types of services, without mentioning the combinations of these services. It is impossible to introduce all or even most of them in one course. This poster addresses the question of how to select an important and representative subset of cloud computing technologies for developing an undergraduate course on cloud computing. We propose to align our education with what the Amazon Certified Associate Developer certification covers. This certification addresses the core technologies that need to be mastered by software developers that use the Amazon Web Services, clearly the leader in cloud computing. The learning outcomes in the proposed course will be found to be consistent with the four domains identified by the certification.
