Different factors that may influence emotion perceptions, including visual content, social context, temporal evolution, and location influence are jointly investigated via the presented rolling multi-task hypergraph learning. For evaluation, we set up a large scale image emotion dataset from Flickr, named Image-Emotion-Social-Net, with over 1 million images and about 8,000 users. Experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to state-of-the-art.
