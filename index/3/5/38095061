The OnRamp project provides a web portal which coaches users, primarily computer science (CS) undergraduate students, through a collection of interactive curriculum modules teaching them about parallel computing and the software ecosystem while allowing them to launch parallel applications on parallel compute environments (PCEs) from day one. There are a number of hurdles for instructors to incorporating a parallel and distributed computing (PDC) curriculum module into an existing course -- from setting up the materials to preparing the students to work on a remote PCE. The OnRamp project removes these hurdles allowing instructors to easily connect to PCEs, deploy existing PDC curriculum modules, and setup user accounts for a course in just a few minutes. This demonstration of the OnRamp project will show the process an instructor will go through to set up a "workspace" for a class with a few PCEs and curriculum modules. Additionally, we will show how students will interact with this workspace to explore the curriculum module and launch parallel jobs on actual PCEs. We will have time for questions following the demonstration and provide materials for instructors to get started using OnRamp in their courses.
