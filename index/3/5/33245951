The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the problems with, hopefully, some suggestions or lessons learned from past experiences to provide guidelines for workable solutions to these problems.
 Some universities, including the one where I am presently employed, permit graduate students in doctoral programs to take two courses in statistics and two courses in Computer Science in lieu of a satisfactory knowledge of two foreign languages. The courses in Computer Science and statistics are referred to as “research tool courses.”
