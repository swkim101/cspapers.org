We present the components of model undergraduate and graduate programs in computational science that have been developed as part of the XSEDE Education Program. The models serve as a template to assist institutions in creating formal programs in computational science that span multiple disciplines including the sciences and engineering, mathematics, computer science, and, more recently, social sciences. The aim of the services is to encourage more institutions to consider computational science as a part of their core curriculum and to reduce the time it takes to integrate new materials and programs. The services provided include campus visits to explore program creation in the context of the interests of the current faculty conducting research and instruction that includes computational modeling. XSEDE also sponsors professional development workshops for faculty and students. These include one day to full week workshops focusing on computational science education in various disciplinary areas as well as technical training that focusing on a variety of computational tools and methods. XSEDE has also created an index to sharable instructional materials focused on building a virtual community interested in computational science education. The index will allow faculty and students to find reviewed examples of models, exercises, and instructions that can be incorporated into current and future courses.
