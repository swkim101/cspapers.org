It is our great pleasure to welcome you to MobiArch 2014, the 9th Workshop on Mobility in the Evolving Internet Architecture. This year continues the tradition of presenting the most recent challenges of mobility architectures, covering aspects in system design and new protocols. 
 
We live in fast changing times. Wireless access devices by far outnumber stationary Internet hosts and an increasing share of traffic traverses at least one wireless link. With recent advances in technologies for wireless access and mobile devices, mobility has become a fundamental characteristic of today's Internet. Yet, basic architectural issues related to mobility such as efficient mobility management, the locator-identifier split, multi-homing, security, and various operational, deployment concerns are still not fully explored. Moreover, the Internet architecture itself, its endto- end principles and business models require rethinking due to the massive penetration of mobility into the Internet. 
 
The mission of MobiArch is to act as a forum where these changes can be discussed and new ideas can be shared. MobiArch has been giving researchers a dedicated environment where to share perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of the new mobile world. 
 
This year, we had 17 interesting submissions from the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Europe. The program committee accepted 11 papers that cover a variety of topics, divided in three large groups: new mobility protocol issues, virtualization challenges and solutions, and information centric approaches. We hope that our proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for future mobility research. 
 
We also encourage attendees to attend the two keynotes. These valuable and insightful talks can and will guide us to a better understanding of mobility future(s). We will have Marco Gruteser (Rutgers) discussing connected vehicles while Lili Qiu (University of Texas) will address the relevance of physical analytics.
