Diaries are used to record aspects of lives --- activities, events, experiences, feelings, thoughts, and physiological measures. Smart diaries can reduce the user's burden by automatically registering some of these aspects. Existing systems have two weaknesses: (a) they are not extensible, and (b) their design is not theory-driven. We introduce LifeMaps, a cloud-based automated, extensible, theory-driven smart diary. Because it is inspired by theory, "The Deep Structures of Lives," it organizes data to conform to the way we experience our lives and may lead a deeper understanding of lives.
