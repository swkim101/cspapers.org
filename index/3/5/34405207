The goal of the workshop is to develop and to get a better perception of the possible interrelations of these two fields of interests. The workshop will be divided into two parts of 3 hours each. In the morning the discussion will be opened by 2 short presentations (15-20 minutes each) by representatives of users and librarians, which will be the basis for discussion. The needs of that sector, especially oriented to the end users, will be the common theme of the presentations and the following discussion. In the afternoon the researchers and commercial companies will be also invited to present their points of view and their ideas on the solutions they can offer to solve the problems raised during the morning. Participation of the audience in the debate will be supported by the moderator. Concrete recommendations and ways of possible future cooperation should result from that finishing workshop. The moderator will be responsible for summarizing the main ideas of the speakers and the audience.
