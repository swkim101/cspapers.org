Aerial robotic platforms are an increasingly sought-after solution for a variety of sensing, monitoring, and transportation challenges. However, as invaluable as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been for these applications, fixed-wing and multi-rotor systems each have individual limitations. Fixed-wing UAVs are generally capable of high-altitude surveillance and long flight times, while quad-rotors are most effective when used for their maneuverability and close-quarters surveying. This paper improves upon the prototypes discussed in [1] by creating a series of three next-generation prototypes to isolate the aspects of solar powered fixed-wing flight, quad-rotor flight, and transformation modes of the SUAV:Q platform. Improvements to the transformation mechanism, airframe design, variable pitch propulsion system, and custom-designed power electronics are presented along with validation of the designs through empirical testing.
