We introduce participants to Peer Instruction (PI): an active learning technique applicable to the teaching of many subjects, including CS. In PI, Students work together to exchange perspectives and answer challenging conceptual questions, and are supported by short teaching segments. We will introduce and motivate PI, demonstrate its use in combination with a clicker system, and show that PI is much more than the use of clickers. Participants will work in groups to develop new PI questions addressing challenges to their students' learning, and discuss numerous pedagogical benefits conferred through PI.
 Instructors interested in increasing engagement in any CS course may attend. Participants are encouraged to bring current lecture materials. Laptop optional.
