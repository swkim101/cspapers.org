An m <supscrpt>th</supscrpt>order recurrence problem is defined as the computation of X<subscrpt>1</subscrpt>, . . . X<subscrpt>N</subscrpt>, where X<subscrpt>i</subscrpt>&equil;f (&abarbelow<subscrpt>i</subscrpt>, X<subscrpt>i-1</subscrpt>, . . X<subscrpt>i-m</subscrpt>) and &abarbelow;&abarbelow;<subscrpt>i</subscrpt> is a set of parameters. On a pipelined computer, where the total stage delay in computing f is d<subscrpt>f</subscrpt> time units, the solution output rate is one new X<subscrpt>i</subscrpt> each d<subscrpt>f</subscrpt> time unit. This paper describes a method for increasing this rate to 1 per time unit when the function f has certain simple functional properties. The total stage delay and complexity of the resulting pipelines are also described.
