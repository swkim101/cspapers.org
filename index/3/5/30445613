ARGOS-II is a problem solving system developed at L.S.I, laboratory. Its purpose is to embody a general model of the decision function of a robot. After a brief global characterization of the system, an overview of the initial specialization process is provided. Then two interesting particularities of the system are emphasized : "formal prospective aptitude" and "automatic control of feature associations". ARGOS-II generates action plans but also performs the execution monitoring. ARGOS-II is a pattern directed inference system. The "formal prospective aptitude" allows to continue to build plans even when some circumstances are unknown. They permit to avoid some awkwardnesses or failures and are open to learning. Not only does the "feature associations" mechanism deal with the heavy problem of updating the attributes of a group of objects involved in a unique action, but it also allows to easily create powerful demon functions useful for Artificial Intelligence programming.
