In this session the final oral report from the first committee created under the SIGCSE Committee Initiative will be presented. The Committee on Implementation of a Discrete Mathematics Course was charged with developing implementation models and materials for the one-semester discrete math course proposed in Computing Curriculum 2001. The report will include a description of two course modelsâ€”a computer science-focused one and a mathfocused one--goals and learning objectives for each model, a collection of exercises and other resource materials to support these models and a list of possible applications which connect the mathematics to fundamental ideas in computer science. Comments from the SIGCSE community will be solicited. Presentation will by Bill Marion, one of the two committee co-facilitators and two other committee members.
