This paper deals with the diagnosis problem of hybrid dynamic system. An Efficient diagnosis technique has to be adopted to detect, isolate faults. The modeling tool selected is the hybrid automata for its power analysis. A simple process is used to demonstrate the modeling steps and the time analysis method to reach the diagnosis results.
