The development of products with a modular structure, where the constituent modules could be derived from a set of common platforms to suit different market niches, provides unique engineering and economic advantages. However, the quantitative design of such modular product platforms could become significantly challenging for complex products. The Comprehensive Product Platform Planning (CP 3 ) method facilitates effective design of such product platforms. The original CP 3 method is however typically suitable for scale-based product family design. In this paper, we perform important modifications to the commonality matrix and the commonality constraint formulation in CP 3 to advance its applicability to modular product family design. A commonality index (CI), defined in terms of the number of unique modules in a family, is
