Adapt/X Harness is an information integration system, platform, and tool set that provides integrated and seamless access to heterogeneous and distributed information in a networked environment (LAN, WAN, Intranets, and the global Internet).

Once the useful information is found, the user may use that information as needed; the Harness server would automatically launch the appropriate application or tool (e.g., Word Processor or Spread Sheet) for viewing, printing or using that information. Because the Harness servers talk HTTP, separate httpd is not needed for providing access to the information resources. The Adapt/X Harness platform is ext,ensible for easily supporting new information types without re-
