In December 2013, the ACM and IEEE-Computer Society sponsored joint Task Force on Computing Curricula released the comprehensive Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013). At the same time, a geographically diverse group of volunteers, known as the CS2013 Assessment Council, met to begin the work of creating a valid three option multiple-choice exam to comprehensively assess the tier-1 core learning outcomes of CS2013. This project has been facilitated by the Institute for the Certification of Computing Professionals (ICCP). This paper describes the motivation and desire to create an assessment exam for the CS2013 tier-1 core learning outcomes, a brief review of the relevant research in psychometrics and educational assessment, the process used to create test items for this exam, the alpha testing and analysis of test questions, the beta testing and analysis of the complete exam, and the current state of the completed exam that is now available for use.
