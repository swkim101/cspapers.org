Recentl~there has been a areat deal of interest aithin the .\rtificial intelligence communits in deseloping a qualiiauseph~sies (e.g.. qualitatiseprocesstheor~. ensisioning. naiveph~sics) that predicts and explains the behasiorof mechanismsin qualitatiseterms. The goalsfor the qualitatisephysics are(1) to be far simpler thanclassical ph~sicsand ~et retainall the importantdistinctions(e.g.. state,oscillation, gain, momentum) without insokng the mathematicsof continuousl~sarsingquantitiesanddifferential equations,(2) to produce causalaccountsof phssicaimechanismsthat are easy to understand, and (3) to prosidethe foundationsfor common-sensemodels for the next generationof expertsystems.This paperconsistsof threeparts. First, se present a framework for understandingand unifying the various approachesto qualitative physics as well as posing certain criteria that sucha physics should satisfy. Second,we compareand contrastthreeapproachesto qualitativephysics. Finally, we explore theuseof proofasexplanationandtherole reduciio ad absurduni plays in qualitativeargumentsin physics.
