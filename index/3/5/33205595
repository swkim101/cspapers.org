In this paper, we present a multi-sensory terrain classification algorithm with a generalized terrain representation using semantic and geometric features. We compute geometric features from lidar point clouds and extract pixel-wise semantic labels from a fully convolutional network that is trained using a dataset with a strong focus on urban navigation. We use data augmentation to overcome the biases of the original dataset and apply transfer learning to adapt the model to new semantic labels in off-road environments. Finally, we fuse the visual and geometric features using a random forest to classify the terrain traversability into three classes: safe, risky and obstacle. We implement the algorithm on our four-wheeled robot and test it in novel environments including both urban and off-road scenes which are distinct from the training environments and under summer and winter conditions. We provide experimental result to show that our algorithm can perform accurate and fast prediction of terrain traversability in a mixture of environments with a small set of training data.
