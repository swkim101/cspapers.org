This paper introduces a more general client/server example than is typically described. Whereas many client/server examples often involve communication between two C programs or two Java programs, this paper describes a program demo containing two clients (one in C and one in Java) and two servers (one in C and one in Java). Furthermore, either client is capable of connecting to and downloading a file from either server using a socket connection over the TCP/IP protocol. None of these programs make any assumptions regarding what language or platform supports the program at the remote end.
