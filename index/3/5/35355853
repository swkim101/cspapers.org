Automatically assessing image quality from an aesthetic perspective is of great interest to the high-level vision research community. Existing methods are typically non-personalized and quantify image aesthetics with a universal label. However, given the fact that aesthetics is a subjective perception, how to understand user aesthetic perceptions poses a formidable challenge to image aesthetics assessment. In this paper, we propose to model user aesthetic perceptions using a set of exemplar images from social media platforms, and realize personalized aesthetics assessment by transferring this knowledge to adapt the results of the trained generic model. In this way, image aesthetics is measured from both aspects of visual quality and user tastes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets well verified the potential of our approach for personalized image aesthetics assessment.
