Context is the "circumstances and conditions" which "surround" an event. Various areas of computer science, mainly, semantic Web have been investigating the concept of context aware information retrieval for the past few years. Context aware information retrieval involves, either, building refined queries that can retrieve most relevant and precise information or refining retrieved results to match user's needs. Currently most of the queries processed on the web do not return the desired results because they fail to take into account the user's context, query relevance, user's intent, current location, time, and other user's preferences in combination. This leads to high recall and low relevance. Different architectures have been proposed in this field. However, there is still lot more to be done to achieve the results in the areas of query refinement, context retrieval and result refinement. Our approach is based on a proposed concept of 'role ontology' and 'query schemas', incorporating user's profile, context, history, ontology's and user feedback.
