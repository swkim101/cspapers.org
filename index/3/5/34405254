The session will introduce participants to curricular modules (projects) based entirely on primary historical source material, developed by an interdisciplinary team of seven computer science and mathematical sciences faculty at New Mexico State University and Colorado State University Pueblo. More than twenty projects have been developed and are available on the Internet at: http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/historical-projects/ . The projects are intended for courses in discrete mathematics, algorithm design, automata, graph theory, and logic.
