Sharing electronic health record (EHR) between various healthcare locations is a significant challenge: patient's healthcare information are split across several information sources, and often owned by various healthcare organizations. Throughout the last decade, there have been various regional, national and international plans concentrated on the development of healthcare network architecture for secure access and sharing of federated patient information. This paper consists of two main segments: first it will start by reviewing the issues regarding the EHR architectures and networking approaches and how it influences the quality and efficiency of service provided, and second we simulate the performance of those approaches based on OPNET system in order to approve on an optimal approach with highest performance. OPNET will compare the efficiency of those approaches with a synchronously access the system functions regardless of the location.
