In this video we discuss the design and implementat i on of a novel system which allows wireless fu l l -body interact ion between a human part ic ipant and a graphical wor ld inhabi ted by autonomous agents. The system is called " A L I V E , " an acronym for Ar t i f ic ia l Life In teract ive Video Env i ronment [5]. One of the goals of the A L I V E project is to demonstrate that v i r tua l env i ronments can offer a more emotional and evocative experience by a l lowing the part ic ipant to interact w i th an imated characters which have complex behaviors and which react to the user and the user's actions in the virtua l wor ld . The A L I V E system has been demonstrated and tested in several publ ic forums. It was demonstrated for 5 days at the S IGGRAPH-93 Tomorrow's Realities show in Anahe im, Cal i forn ia and for 3 days at the A A A I 9 4 A r t Show in Seattle, Washington. The system is instal led permanent ly at the M I T Media Laboratory in Cambr idge, Massachusetts. I t w i l l feature in the Ars Electronica Museum, currently under construction in L inz, Aus t r ia and the ArcTec electronic arts bienale in Tokyo , Japan, May 1995. In the style of M y r o n Krueger's Videoplace system, the A L I V E system offers an unencombered, fu l l -body interface to a v i r tua l wor ld [4]. The A L I V E user moves around in a space of approximately 16 by 16 feet. A video camera captures the user's image and removes the background envi ronment; thus, no blue-screens or other special walls are needed. The separated out l ine is then composited in to a 3D graphical wor ld . The resulting scene is projected onto a large (approximately 10 'x l6 ' ) screen which faces the user ana acts as a "magic mirror : " the user sees h im/herse l f in the environment, surrounded by objects and agents. No goggles, gloves, or te ther ing wires are needed for interact ion w i th the virtua l wor ld .
