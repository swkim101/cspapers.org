This paper derives new compact capacity expressions of N Ã— N multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) independent Rayleigh fading channels with N transmit and TV receive antennas. The complex-valued channel parameters are assumed to be identically-distributed, zero-mean, unit-variance and circularly-symmetric Gaussian. A new and straightforward method to compute the individual MIMO channel capacity expressions is given which should improve the efficiency of calculating the ergodic channel capacity in fading environments. Corrections to ergodic multiple-input single-output (MISO) and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel capacity expressions available in the literature are given which offer fresh insights into SIMO, MISO and MIMO system capacity computation.
