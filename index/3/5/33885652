As the number of cores and utilization of the system are increasing quickly, shared resources like caches are interfering tasks' execution behaviors more heavily. In order to achieve resource efficiency in both temporal and spatial domains for multi-core real-time systems, caches should be taken into consideration when performing partitions. In this paper, partitioned Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling on a preemptive multi-core platform is considered. We propose a new system model that covers inter-task cache interference and describe some ongoing work in identifying proper partition schemes under such settings.
