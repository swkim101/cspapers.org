We introduce a new principled method grounded in the Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movements to automatically generate synthetic stroke gestures across user populations in order to support ability-based design of gesture user interfaces. Our method is especially useful when the target user population is difficult to sample adequately and, consequently, when there is not enough data to train gesture recognizers to deliver high levels of accuracy. To showcase the relevance and usefulness of our method, we collected gestures from people without visual impairments and successfully synthesized gestures with the articulation characteristics of people with visual impairments. We also show that gesture recognition accuracy improves significantly when using our synthetic gesture samples for training. Our contributions will benefit researchers and practitioners that wish to design gesture user interfaces for people with various abilities by helping them prototype, evaluate, and predict gesture recognition performance without having to expressly recruit and involve people with disabilities in long, time-consuming gesture collection experiments.
