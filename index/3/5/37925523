Strategic planners for robots designed to operate in a dynamic environment must be able to decide (i) how often a sensory request should be granted, and (ii) how to recover from a detected error. This paper derives closed-form formulas for the appropriate frequency of sensor integration as a function of parameters of the equipment, the domain, and the types of errors from which the system wishes to recover.
