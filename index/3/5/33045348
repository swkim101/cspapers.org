A writer leaves a message in a write-once memory accessible via address lines. Before the intended recipient has a chance to get the message, the address lines are permuted by an adversary. We provide a simple, nearly optimal algorithm for the reader and writer to communicate over such a channel. This problem arose in the context of FPGA hardware design. Our algorithm has been implemented and is part of the design tool suite in use within Compaq.
