An information re t r i eva l system must mainta in the accuracy and consistency of i t s data at an acceptable level i f i t is to be useful. Recent experiments by Lee, Slagle, and Mong (1978) demonstrated the potent ial of using c luster ing techniques as an aid in the detection of data errors which are d i f f i c u l t to f ind by other means. Further experiments directed at determining the p r a c t i c a l i t y of th is technique are described here.
