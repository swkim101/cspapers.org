Summary form only given. In recent years, MIMO (multi input, multi output) is a technique that attracts many scientistspsila attention. A 2times2 MIMO testbed which is base on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is carry out at department of wireless communication, College of Technology. The purpose of this paper is introduce this testbed and the implementation of most important component in this testbed-symbol synchronization module
