Intelligent computer agents are both the original goal and the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence research. In striving toward that goal, our community has followed a practical research strategy of "divide-and-conquer," with different sub-communities attacking important component functions of intelligence, such as planning, search, knowledge representation, vision, and natural language. This strategy has been almost too successful, yielding both challenging theoretical problems that have come to dominate the inquiries of many researchers and a spate of practical techniques that have enabled other researchers to move into profitable commercial enterprises. While each of these pursuits is worthy in its own right, together they have had the unfortunate sideeffect of fragmenting the field and almost completely diverting it from efforts to build intelligent agents.
