The vocal user interface (VUI) Myna allows a user to interact with the block-based language development environment Scratch. Unfortunately, the original implementation of Myna does not allow for screen resolutions outside of its original implementation, for the scrolling of scrollbars, and the navigation of prompts and dialogs created by Scratch, essentially halving its functionality relative to what the Scratch graphical user interface (GUI) offers. In this paper, I offer three solutions to these problems, which will be evaluated by Computer Science students and users with mobility impairments in order to determine the validity of these solutions as well as the user's satisfaction with Myna and using voice as an input modality.
