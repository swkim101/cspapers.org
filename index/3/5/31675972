This paper describes the design and implementation of a junior-level course in formal languages and automata theory which satisfies CSAB guidelines for the computer science core curriculum in the area of theoretical foundations of computer science. The optimal prerequisites for such a course, as well as its impact on advanced computer science courses, are discussed. Several suggestions on how to present the subject matter in such a formal languages course, which has traditionally been considered too difficult to be taught below the senior level, are also discussed.
