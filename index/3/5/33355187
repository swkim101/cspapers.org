The aim of the standard query processing architecture is to retrieve the required results. The important aspects of any query processing architecture should be query reformulation. As there are many equivalent interpretations of the same high-level query, the focus of query reformulation is to enhance or change the original query, so that it minimizes the number of results and maximizes the accuracy of the results being retrieved. In this paper, the authors are trying to enhance the original query by using users' context, which is being generated from sensor data, domain ontology and user profiles. The authors present a query processing architecture which is based on query reformulation and validate our architecture with the help of experimental results. Our proposed approach proves to be better than the standard query processing as well as other proposed query reformulation approaches
