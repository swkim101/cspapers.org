Team-Based Learning (TBL) is an active learning pedagogy that involves a substantial amount of preparation work by students. While previous work shows that objective measures of student learning outcomes improved after TBL adoption in CS, little work has been done to evaluate the students' perspectives rigorously. In this work, we present the qualitative findings from a larger mixed-methods study of student perspectives. These results suggest that most students find TBL rewarding, although there are some aspects of the pedagogy that can be frustrating and may require alteration for TBL adoption in CS.
