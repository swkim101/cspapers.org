Technovation Challenge introduces computer science to high school girls in a dynamic learning environment that offers exciting, real-world challenges to conquer; fresh new ways of thinking and problem solving; and the support of hands-on female mentors drawn from academia and the tech industry. Over the course of 12 intensive weeks, students identify a problem drawn from their own real-life experiences and program a mobile phone application to solve it. They practice their pitch with experienced investors who give them feedback on their app and business plan. After some more polishing and practice, the girls then pitch their ideas to a panel of venture capitalists. The winning team receives funding to take their app to market.
