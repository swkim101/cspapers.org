Information technology contributes greatly in improving people's health. Through our interaction with different communication channels such as social media, telephone calls or purchasing over-the-counter medicines, we emit signals and leave trails of information related to our health. Information that can be used to understand our health situation. Some of these communication channels are more structured, filtered and suited for evaluation, as a result they require less demanding filtration and analysis than others. One such channel is the Swedish National Telephone Health Service 1177, where professional healthcare personnel assist and give advice to callers. The main aim of this work is to detect point source outbreaks. For this purpose a project called Event-based Surveillance System (ESS) was initiated to develop a system for surveillance and detection using the former mentioned information source. The system is currently running and is used to notify local authorities whenever a deviation in the telephone traffic pattern is recorded.
