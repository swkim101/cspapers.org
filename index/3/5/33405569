This paper describes current research on the computational modeling of change phenomena in design. In particular it introduces a tutorial view of the moel of design situations (DS) as a methodological basis for experimentation with change processes at the individual and the collective levels of an agent society. Creativity in the DS model takes place within the situated interaction of individuals in a social environment transcending its conventional characterization as purely a cognitive process.
