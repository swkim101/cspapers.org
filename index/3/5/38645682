Peer-to-Peer networks are very popular these days due to their use in data and resource sharing. Trust and reputation of a peer not only make it easy to take a decision to ask for resource from the trustworthy node but also provide a way to punish evil peers for malicious act. Incentive mechanism provokes a peer to share resource and discourage the well known free riding. In this paper we studied proposed schemes and discuss some open issues to cope as the future research work as well as we have provided solution of some problems such as to detect malicious peers, false rating problem and sudden change in the behavior of peers that can be helpful in designing a new novel and robust frame work for trust and reputation based incentive mechanism.
