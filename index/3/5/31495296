In a field study (29 engineers), the transfer from expertise acquired in training to software use at work was shown to be mediated by task application knowledge (i.e. knowledge used to connect skills learned in training with tasks at work). Moreover, person variables like setting long range goals and developing detailed plans and an organizational variable like job decision latitude (i.e. how much freedom do workers have to do their work) influenced the transfer process. People with high goal orientation and planfulness and with high job decision latitude showed a higher transfer.
