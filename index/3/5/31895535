Blocks-based programming has become a very popular technology for teaching introductory programming in schools, but it still faces some issues as learners progress. The large transition gap between blocks-based and text-based programming is a source of worry for many educators. However, the difficulties learners have with developing and maintaining progressively larger and more complex programs in block-based systems force teachers to move students on to text-based systems rather than remain with blocks. Greenfoot 3 introduces frame-based programming, a hybrid of blocks-based and text-based programming. Frame-based programming adds comprehensive keyboard support, along with several other usability improvements aimed at removing frustrations for intermediate and experienced programmers, while also providing a way to fill the gap in the transition process. This workshop will show how to teach introductory programming using the new frame-based editor from Greenfoot 3. We will help the participants to explore the new editor in a hands-on session, accompanied by explanations of its distinctive features and how they have been designed to overcome the friction and niggles present in current blocks-based editors, while also providing pedagogical guidance for learners. Participants should bring their own laptop with the latest version of Greenfoot installed, available from www.greenfoot.org
