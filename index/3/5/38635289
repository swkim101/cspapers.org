A definition of computing literacy is a necessary prerequisite to any computing literacy effort. The definition that will be presented here represents the authors' interpretation of the term. It is the result of research and experiences accumulated over six years while preparing and promoting a computing literacy program for a liberal arts environment. Computing literacy will be viewed in terms of competencies and will address both cognitive and affective goals. Four levels of computing literacy will be defined: computing awareness; computing literacy; computing fluency; and computing expertise. The transition from level to level and from broad goals to specific objectives will be made by identifying the knowledge and skills required for each level.
