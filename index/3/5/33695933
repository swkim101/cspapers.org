Web development is widely considered to be a difficult topic to teach successfully within post-secondary computing programs. One reason for this difficulty is the large number of shifting technologies that need to be taught along with the conceptual complexity that needs to be mastered by both student and professor. Another challenge is helping students see the scope of web development, and their role in an era where the web is a part of everyday human affairs. This paper describes our 2014 textbook [2], its reception, and our plans for a second edition revision (which will be published in early 2017). Our hope is that a discussion of current teaching materials will provide opportunities to spark a dialogue not only about current technological topics, but perspectives on web development from other disciplines.
