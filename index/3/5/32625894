This paper discusses the work of automatexperiencer; if a person who uses this concept ically extracting Case Frames from Machinebelieves that seeing is a process of active selecReadable Dictionaries based on a three layer tion, then this person will assign to its subject, a posteriori Case Theory[5]. an active Case such as agent. The theory is intended to deal with two 3. c o n t e x t layer : in this layer, Cases problems: 1. To dynamically adjust grains of Cases. This is where a posteriori comes from. 2. To provide a procedure to determine Cases. This is where three layer comes from. The three layers are: 1. base layer: This layer is intended to accomplish transformations of words to concepts by explicating language and word specific implicants, e.g., for the verb eat in the intransitive case, its subject is eater, while for verb break in the intransitive case, its subject is the broken. 2. de fau l t layer: in this layer, implicit assumptions of naive theories are made explicit, e.g., for concept see, there are two different views towards its subject: if a person who uses this concept believes that seeing is just a process of passive perception, then this person will assign to its subject, a passive 1 Case such as
