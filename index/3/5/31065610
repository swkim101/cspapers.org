It is more attractive for students to learn programming concepts like control structures, data structures or recursion by the means of examples based on graphical objects. The use of a graphical PASCAL extension is a well-suited way of realizing this goal. In particular, we emphasize the use of interactive graphical input-output, graphical types and data structures bases on graphical types. Typical examples are arrays of circles or linked lists of figures entered by the student.
