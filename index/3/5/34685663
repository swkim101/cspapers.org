“Curriculum '68”, the recommendations of the ACM Curriculum Committee on Computer Science (C<supscrpt>3</supscrpt>S), established computer science as an academic field of study and specified to a great extent its content. The field has evolved over the ten years since the publication of the report; however, it remains an important reference point, still being used to describe courses and programs.
 The ten year period following the publication of “Curriculum '68” saw C<supscrpt>3</supscrpt>S carefully monitoring the changes and developments in computer science education at the undergraduate level. This work resulted in the preparation of a new set of recommendations, “Curriculum '78”, which are to appear in the February 1979 <underline>Communications of the ACM</underline>.
