The rapid advances in the development of low-cost computer hardware have led to many proposals for the use of this hardware to improve the performance of database management systems. Usually the design proposals are quite vague about the performance of the system with respect to a given data management application. In this paper we develop an analytical model of the performance of a conventional database management system and four generic database machine architectures. This model is then used to compare the performance of each type of machine with a conventional DBMS. We demonstrate that no one type of database machine is best for executing all types of queries. We also show that for several classes of queries certain database machine designs which have been proposed are actually slower than a DBMS on a conventional processor.
