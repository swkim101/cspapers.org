Several methods for analyzing three dimensional scenes are discussed with respect to their advantages and difficulties in getting real three dimensional coordinates. Stereo picture processing and light intersecting methods are described along with the result of a new hardware system. On the example of a software system some special problems with the abstraction of scenes with primitive objects are mentioned. A short look ahead to the future closes this paper.
