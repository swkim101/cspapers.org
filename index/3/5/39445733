The objective of this research is to demonstrate a methodology for the design and use of a physiological model in a computer program that suggests medical decisions. The physiological model is based on first principles and facts of physiology and anatomy, and it includes inference rules for analysis of causal relations between physiological events. The model is used to analyze physiological behavior, identify the effects of abnormalities, suggest appropriate therapies, and predict the results of therapy. This methodology integrates heuristic knowledge traditionally used in artificial intelligence programs with mathematical knowledge traditionally used in mathematical modeling programs. In recognition of its origins in artificial intelligence and mathematical modeling, the system is named AI/MM. This paper briefly introduces the knowledge representation and examples of the system analysis of behavior in the domain of renal physiology.
