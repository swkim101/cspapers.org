We describe the Iraq Body Count Corpus (IBC-C) dataset, the ﬁrst substantial armed conﬂict-related dataset which can be used for conﬂict analysis. IBC-C provides a ground-truth dataset for con-ﬂict speciﬁc named entity recognition, slot ﬁlling, and event de-duplication. IBC-C is constructed using data collected by the Iraq Body Count project which has been recording incidents from the ongoing war in Iraq since 2003. We describe the dataset’s creation, how it can be used for the above three tasks and provide initial baseline results for the ﬁrst task (named entity recognition) using Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, and Recursive Neural Networks.
