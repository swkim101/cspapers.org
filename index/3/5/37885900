A test plan generation algorithm is proposed for systems such as process-control systems or transaction-processing systems. Input to the algorithm is a description of the functional requirements for a given system. This is converted to an augmented finite state automaton (fsa) from which a regular grammar is derived. The grammar is used to generate test “sentences” each of which describes a sequence of stimuli to be applied to the system under test and responses required of the system under test.
