This paper is concerned with a new implementation of a production system by using a relational DBMS and FORTRAN and its application to construction of an intelligent man-machine interface of a speech database called SPEECH-DB. Our Production system can be viewed as a nondeterministic FORTRAN programming system based on content-directded invocation of subroutines. The interface is composed of the following three subsystems: Japanese Command processing Subsystem (JCS), which translates the queries stated in Japanese into commands, Problem Solving Subsystem (PSS), which diagnoses errors and answers user's questions, and MONITOR, which manages the flow of control among these subsystems and SPEECH-DB. Design philosopy and basic mechanism are presented together with some examples of the system performance.
