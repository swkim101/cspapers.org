Geocoding is the process of converting addresses to geocoordinates. It is widely used in several fields such as public health to monitor socioeconomic inequalities for example or in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to be able to use with its provided features. In this work, we describe a method to create an address geocoder from a free and open government street lines data source. The address geocoder transforms a street address into a location typically measured in latitude-longitude coordinates. The address geocoder is used in a search engine to relate spatial data to search results and improve accuracy.
