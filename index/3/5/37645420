This tutorial concerns with more advanced and more recent topics in the area of click models. Here, we discuss recent developments in the area with a particular focus on applications of click models. The tutorial features a guest talk and a live demo where participants have a chance to build their own advanced click model. While this is the second part of the two half-day tutorials, it is not required for participants to attend the first one. In the beginning of this part, a short introduction to basic click models will be given so that all participants share a common vocabulary. Then, recent advances in click models will be discussed.
