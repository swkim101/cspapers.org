A control system architecture is described for an autonomous flying vehicle. The vehicle, equipped with fourteen sensors, uses a model helicopter as an airframe. The control system utilizes these sensors to: remain aloft and in stable flight; navigate to a target; and manipulate a physical object. The overall approach to the problem is based on a behavioral paradigm. The key contribution of this paper is the demonstration of a situated agent under these severe circumstances; as the craft is airborne, it is in constant risk of crashing. Unlike terrestrial mobile robots, the craft must constantly make sound decisions to maintain its integrity.
