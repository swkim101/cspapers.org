Algorithm visualizations (AVs) are widely viewed as having the potential for improving computer science education, yet the rate of AV use and overall impact has progressed little from the mid 1990s. Surveys of CS faculty [1] show that the impediments to successful use of AVs are related to difficulties in first finding good materials, and then difficulties in effectively deploying them in classes. Fortunately, much progress has been made in recent years. There are many high-quality AVs available (though there are enough poor quality AVs that sorting out the good ones can be time consuming) [2]. There is a growing body of research on how to effectively use AVs in the classroom (though getting up to speed on this information is again time consuming). These impediments could be overcome with adequate dissemination of information about which AVs are of good quality and how they can best be used. From the developersâ€™ side, more information about what makes for an effective AV, as well as information about which topics are of greatest need, could lead to more effective AVs being produced. Thus, we find that information and dissemination of best practice plays a key role in the successful deployment of AVs into the classroom. Given that much of the needed information has to do with rating of educational material and experiences with use of this material in the field, the most effective way to improve instruction is through an active community of AV users and developers interacting to provide the necessary information.
