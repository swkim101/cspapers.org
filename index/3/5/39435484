The parsing of building facades is a key component to the problem of 3D street scenes reconstruction, which is long desired in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method for segmenting a facade into semantic categories. Man-made structures often present the characteristic of symmetry. Based on this observation, we pro-pose a symmetric regularizer for training the neural network. Our proposed method can make use of both the power of deep neural networks and the structure of man-made architectures. We also pro-pose a method to reﬁne the segmentation results us-ing bounding boxes generated by the Region Pro-posal Network. We test our method by training a FCN-8s network with the novel loss function. Experimental results show that our method has out-performed previous state-of-the-art methods significantly on both the ECP dataset and the eTRIMS dataset. As far as we know, we are the ﬁrst to employ end-to-end deep convolutional neural network on full image scale in the task of building facades parsing.
