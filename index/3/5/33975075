The demonstration proposal focuses on presenting the capabilities of a wireless biometric badge, which integrates a localization and tracking service along with an automatic personal identification mechanism, to control the access to restricted areas with a high level of security. The wireless biometric badge is the result of R&D activities conducted by several professors, researchers, and students in the Center of Excellence in Research DEWS at the University of L' Aquila in Italy, as well as its R&D Spin-Off WEST Aquila S.r.l.
