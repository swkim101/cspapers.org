Startups have always held a particular fascination for data scientists. Data scientists often are creators. They create new data mining technology. They use data mining technology to create (or discover) new knowledge. Startups are fascinating because the data scientist has the opportunity also to create an entirely new company, possibly with an entirely new business plan, revolving around the extraction of knowledge from data. Whatâ€™s more, entrepreneurial data scientists can even create within a startup company new research initiatives focusing on the questions that they believe to be important, and if they succeed quickly see the fruits of their research be implemented in practice. Startups also can be very exciting places to work. There is a huge difference in excitement between working for a company that is growing at a healthy 5% or 10% a year, and a company that is growing at 30% (or maybe much more) a year.
