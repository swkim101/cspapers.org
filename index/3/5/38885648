In this research, we have proposed a data center network architecture based on the Software-Defined Networks (SDN). By assigning topology-aware addresses to each switch, auto routing not only reduces human error, but also decreases the size of the FIB. Besides, the centralized management can avoid the broadcast storm and increase the bandwidth utilization by global routing decisions. In terms of the path selection strategy, we adopted the On-Line Routing (OLR) method to calculate the optimal path. We also studied the effect of the distributing network traffic via multipath routing. We compared the performance of the OLR with that of the ECMP via running simulations using the Mininet emulator. Our numerical results show that the throughput of the OLR increases by 30% when compared to that of the ECMP.
