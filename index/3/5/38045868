The use of low-cost imagers in sensor network applications is imminent. Small low-power imagers have many potential applications in visual confirmation of events, target recognition, security and entertainment. To make the autonomous operation of imager sensors in such applications possible, smart imager sensors should be able to calibrate their views with respect to other imagers in the network and should become aware of the locations of other non-imager sensors. Such calibration will allow cameras with multiple vantage points and sensors distributed in physical space to jointly undertake collaborative tasks.
