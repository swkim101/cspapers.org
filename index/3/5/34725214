For this note we say that a problem is computable in time sub-exponential in n if there is an effectively computable monotone increasing function g(n) with lim,,, g(n) = CQ such that the problem is computable in time O(2”‘g(n)). We establish that a maximal independent set of a graph on n vertices can be found in time sub-exponential in n iff the same holds for the class of those graphs that have maximum degree at most 3.
