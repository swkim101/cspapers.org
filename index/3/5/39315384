A novel architecture of Integer Motion Estimation (IME) for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) processing 8K video is presented in this paper. This architecture achieves 8K (7680Ã—4320) video in real time at 45 fps (frames per second) with frequency of 96.4 MHz and latency of as low as 260 clock cycles. The proposed design has been implemented by Xilinx ISE 13.1 using Virtex-7 28nm technology.
