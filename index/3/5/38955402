This paper describes the first course in computers as taught at community colleges, colleges, or universities. The paper is divided into two major parts. The first part describes four Approaches and three courses. The four Approaches refer to the mix of language constructs and computer concepts; the Approaches underlie the presentation used in teaching the three courses. The second part discusses the frequency of occurrence of these courses based on a survey performed by Addison-Wesley.
