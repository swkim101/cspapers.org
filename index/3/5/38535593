At POPL 1994, we presented a paper on “Decidable Bounded Quantification” [CP94]. Sadly, subsequent discussion on the Types mailing list [G94,P94] has revealed that, while strictly speaking our stated results were correct, the central idea was fundamentally flawed.

The standard formulation, due to Curien and Ghelli, includes the following rule for comparing polymorphic types:
