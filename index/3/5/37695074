This paper is about the design and simulation of interdigital filter in Serenade and High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS). The filter was designed using Serenade. But there was a problem with the design in Serenade. This software assumes perfect TEM mode between coupling conductors. To overcome this problem, HFSS is being used. This software is based on finite element method (FEM) and it solves this problem very well. After the simulation and optimization, the results of the finalized simulation and actually manufactured filter are very close to each other.
