WORK EXPERIENCE July 1993 to Present UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INFORMATION SCIENCES INSTITUTE, MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA MING HSIEH DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA Titles: Research Assistant Professor, Project Leader, Computer Scientist Directed VLSI efforts of several DARPA-funded projects. Developed ASIC test articles for the Trusted Integrated Circuits program. Contributed to the architecture design of polymorphous computing architectures and co-led the VLSI implementation of a representative chip in IBM 90nm technology that contained on the order of 100 million gates. Directed the VLSI development of two prototype 64Kbit SRAM chips to demonstrate radiation-hardening-by-design principles. Contributed to the architecture design of processor-in-memory chips (PIM) based on embedded DRAM technology and led the corresponding VLSI implementation efforts that produced two 55-million transistor PIM chips: one integer-based and one enhanced with single-precision floating-point units. Developed a routing algorithm for ring structures which yields lower latency and more throughput than previous research. Supervised the work of several PhD and MS graduate students and served on numerous PhD qualifier and defense committees. Helped administer PhD screening exams. Taught EE577B VLSI Design Project several semesters.
