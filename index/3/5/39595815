The printed inverted L antenna on a dielectric substrate is proposed and numerically analyzed. This antenna is composed of the coplanar waveguide. When the size of antenna is 16 mm by 43 mm by 2.4 mm, the S11 less than -10 dB is satisfied from 2.39 GHz to 2.51 GHz. In this antenna, since the size of ground plane is small, the directivity becomes 3.4 dBi. When the size of antenna is 28 mm by 39 mm by 2.4 mm, S11 less than -10 dB is satisfied from 2.43 GHz to 2.47 GHz. The directivity becomes 4.42 dBi.
