Why do we name a way of thinking about computer education 'Quantitative Methods'? As will be explained below Quantitative Methods (QM) has a unique view of computer processing. The outlook is not 'Computer Science' or 'Data Processing' or 'Information Systems' or 'Management Information Systems' or any other such title. If you get right to the heart of a digtal computer what do you find? Binary digits or quantities! The Q.M. philosophy advocates that given a set of binary digits - what methods do we apply to these to obain the results desired. Thus, the name Quantitative Methods. Admittedly, the name is unique (see i, p. 153) but the philosophy is also unique.
