Cultural stereotypes about women's "fit" and ability in technical fields, like computing, are alive and well. These cultural beliefs can make their way into women's personal belief system. When this happens, women's self-conceptions in computing suffer, namely, self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and identification with computing. The current research examines whether collaborative learning methods (pair programing; supplemental instruction) can erase the negative relationship between women's endorsement of negative gender stereotypes and their computing self-concept. Longitudinal survey data from 48 women computing majors indicated that participation in collaborative learning activities nullified the negative impact of gender stereotype endorsement on women's self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and identification with computing. These findings showcase the benefits of existing pedagogical strategies in computing on increasing the likelihood that women will persist in a computing career path.
