This poster delves into the interactions of pair programming students to observe the equality or inequality across three modes of discussion. These three modes are coding, designing and logistics. Coding being when students are discussing code, designing being the discussion of aesthetic aspects, and logistics being the discussion of saving or manipulating files. The students whose interactions are reviewed and assessed in this poster are participants in a three-week elementary computer science program taking place in Northern California in the years 2009, 2012, and 2013. The students' ages range between ten and eleven years old. This poster will compare and contrast specific interactions and examples to highlight how modes can present an interaction as equitable, inequitable, or both. The poster will also present tables to aid in the explanation of how one mode in an interaction can be equitable while the other two modes are not.
