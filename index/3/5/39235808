In this paper the method of Joint Channel Coding and Cryptography has been analyzed and simulated. Joint Channel Coding and Cryptography is an extension of Soft Input Decryption with feedback, which is used for improvement of channel decoding of secured messages. Results of simulations of Joint Channel Coding and Cryptography are compared to results of convolutional coding with the same coding rate. In this way, Joint Channel Coding and Cryptography brings coding gain of 0.72 dB, fulfilling security requirements at the same time.
