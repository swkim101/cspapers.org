A primary electrochemical cell having an oxidizable active anode material, a cathode current collector, and an electrolytic solution comprising a liquid cathode material and an electrolyte solute dissolved therein. The cathode current collector includes a catalytic material comprising a mixture of carbon and a polymer which is the product of the reaction of a transition metal salt such as ferric acetylacetonate or colbaltic acetylacetonate with tetracyanoethylene.
