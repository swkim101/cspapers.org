The advent of microcomputer systems with their inherent cost/performance advantages had precipitated a reassessment of known application areas that heretofore were not considered candidates for digital systems solution.
 Described in this paper is a <underline>MICRO</underline> processor oriented <underline>D</underline>ata <underline>A</underline>cquisition and <underline>C</underline>ontrol system referred to as MICRODAC which is capable of monitoring high voltage perturbations (via transducers), accepting and issuing control commands, performing format changes and error encoding/decoding, performing system self checks, and transmitting data to supervisory computers. This system performs a very necessary function in power system data acquisition and control at low cost, high reliability, and low power consumptions.
