Next generation services are a trend that places emphasis on providing value-added services. This trend remains a challenge to telecommunication operators who in an effort to survive and remain relevant, now have to contend with managing their existing network-based services as well as their new application-based next generation services. A critical implication is that operation management systems, which used to be network-centric, now have to be migrated into application-centric systems in support of next generation services. Consequently, this paper discusses the requirements of an operation management system for managing service resources in the application layer of an NGN architecture. Additionally, this paper presents an efficient approach to managing the resources of next generation services. To validate the applicability and efficiency of the approach, we present a prototype implementation, so-called Application Service Management System (ASMS) and share some useful insights that can help to improve resource management system architectures for next generation services.
