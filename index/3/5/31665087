We describe the design for a distributed game-playing environment suitable for student software development of player strategies. The framework has three main components: the game server, which runs as a RESTful web service on the Internet, the game client, which runs on the student's computer, and the graphical interface, which runs inside a web browser on the student's computer. Our earlier framework ran all components locally, and in a single programming language. The new framework supports single-user sessions, in which the student-implemented player plays against another, possibly faculty-supplied, software player, or against a human player. It also supports multi-user sessions, in which student players on two or more separate computers can play against each other in a single game. Supported by the NSF, award ID 1044721.
