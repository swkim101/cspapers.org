Regional governments are playing an increasingly important role in stimulation and influence of technology - the "Information Superhighway" being the latest icon. Reminiscent of the industrial revolution built upon manufacturing advances, the "Information Revolution" is being built upon the internet and sweeping advances in computing and telecommunications enabling rapid product development, agile manufacturing and electronic commerce. A significant share of this vision relies on advances in the use of electronic design automation (EDA) technology; however, the marriage of government policy and innovation in EDA is an untested partnership. Models such as SemaTech in the U.S. and JESSI in the European community have largely been focused on silicon manufacturing technology. A pattern has emerged from recent government technology focused initiatives: emphasis on leveraging technology for military and commercial use, job creation, and infrastructure development. However, if the "Information Revolution" is viewed by the regional governments as a major economic growth engine then their respective technology policies need to be understood by the EDA business and technical leadership who create jobs and compete today in a global marketplace. The panel will describe elements of their technology policies in the context of the following issues: Critical technologies - now - 10 years. Where does Electronic Design Automation rank and where should it grow? National vs. Global technology interests. Views on where countries should compete vs. cooperate (e.g., support of standards). Role of government funding in R&D. Basic research only, should we pick winners, or are consortiums the answer? Intellectual Property Rights - How can worldwide protection of investment and incentives for innovation be realized? Panelists' views of the Top Three Actions the EDA Industry should take NOW.
