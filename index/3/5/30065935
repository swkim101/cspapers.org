We describe ArtForm, a tool for exploring the codebase of dynamic data-driven websites where users enter data via forms. ArtForm extends an instrumented browser, so it can directly implement user interactions, adding in symbolic and concolic execution of JavaScript. The tool supports a range of exploration modes with varying degrees of user intervention. It includes a number of adaptations of concolic execution to the setting of form-based web programs.
