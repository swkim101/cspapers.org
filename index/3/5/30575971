While unquestionably research on CSE education is centered in the SIGCSE conference, other venues such as the International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp), and the Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction (TEI), and the Conference on Interaction Design and Children (ICD) explore CS education focusing on educational play and novel off the desktop techniques for CS education. Unfortunately, this literature remains isolated from the mainstream CSE literature, and this lightning talk attempts to help contribute to rectifying this by presenting a core recent educational theory "Computational Making" and discuss its contributions to CSE.
