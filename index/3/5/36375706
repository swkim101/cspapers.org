We propose a method to compress the enormous amount of data originating from tactile sensors is presented that explicitly exploits the inherent sparseness over space and time, sending tactile “events” only when a contact is detected. The resulting modular architecture is based on FPGA modules that acquire data samples from off-the-shelf tactile sensors based on capacitive transducers and generate and transmit an event-driven readout. This architecture has been specifically implemented for integration on robots with a large number of tactile sensors, to reduce communication bandwidth, power and processing requirements. An asynchronous serial address-event representation protocol further optimises effective data transmission rate (efficiency of 94.1%) and latency (340 ns) with respect to more common transmission protocols (e.g., Ethernet, CAN). We propose two complementary algorithms for the translation of raw-data into events, optimising data rate and bandwidth, or exploiting the asynchronous nature of the event-driven encoding and the temporal information within the sensory signal. Data reduction capability can reach up to 20 % of the correspondent clock-based encoding, with limited information loss due to the compression.
