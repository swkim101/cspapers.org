Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a well-established multi-disciplinary research field. The goal of SHM is to develop technologies and techniques to automatically detect, localize, and classify damages in large structures (ships, bridges, aircraft and buildings). The state of the art in SHM relies on collecting response of these structures to ambient phenomena such as wind, passing vehicles or earthquakes at various points in the structure (either via manual inspections or expensive wired data acquisition systems) to be analyzed centrally. In our demonstration we will show a proof of concept working model of an automated distributed damage detection system using a sensor-actuator network.
