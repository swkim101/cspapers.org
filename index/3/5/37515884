Percutaneous needle procedures are mostly carried out with the guidance of 2D ultrasound (US) imaging. US images are inherently noisy and their resolutions are low. Hence, target tracking can be challenging. Image based tracking methods can be used to track the needle and the target. This paper proposes visual tracking of multiple moving points, such as biopsy needles and targets, in 2D US images using normalized cross correlation and mutual information similarity functions. Both moving and deformable targets can be tracked. An affine motion model is used for small and moving target tracking and a thin plate spline motion model is used for deformable target tracking. During the tracking, needle and target template images are updated with a template update strategy. Also, tracking outputs of normalized cross correlation and mutual information are fused using the Kalman filter to reduce the tracking error. During the experiments, needle is inserted using a needle insertion robot. 2D US probe is attached to a robotic arm's end effector to servo the probe along the needle insertion path. Proposed needle and target tracking methods were tested with phantoms. Accuracies of the needle tip and moving target tracking methods were measured using an optical tracking system. Experimental results showed that the proposed tracking method could be used to simultaneously track the needle tip and the targets in real-time in 2D US guided percutaneous needle procedures.
