T-Mobile USA is looking at all possible ways to optimize the quality of user experience (QoE) for our customers in while balanceing with our network resources and device energy consumptions needs. In the mobile smart phone world, users often have a the misperception that people often held about use experience is the faster the network speed is and, the faster the phone CPU speed is;, the better the quality of experience (QoE) will beis. On the contrary, we intend to use three practical examples to unveil the mystery behind the mobile network black box and illustrate it is actually the end-to-tend (E2E) latency which impacts the QoE of one of the most commonly used data services -- mobile browsing. A lengthy E2E latency due to rarely-understood and hard-to-uncovered phone or network issues may render a very poor browsing page loading speed time even if you have a super hero dual core smart phone with the fastest 4G network speed. In order to understand the E2E latency better in the transient wireless channel conditions and optimize data QoE in a much fastermore expedient way, we advocate the use of the cCross-device/network evaluation methodology. Finally, we presented a few research questions that we are facing and to solicit the research community's input.
