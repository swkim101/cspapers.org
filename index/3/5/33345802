Ground state (energy-minimizing) texture patterns in Markov random field (MRF) image models, in particular, the second-order Ising model, are addressed. Ground state texture patterns are obtained for arbitrary parameter values. A small number of texture classes can be generated from the binary Ising model if the global minimum field energy criterion is used to terminate the sampler. Implications for texture synthesis are discussed. >
