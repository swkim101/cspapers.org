As IC fabrication capabilities extend down to sub-half-micron, the significance of interconnect delay and powerdissipation can no longer be ignored. Existing enhancements to synthesis and physical design tools (such as non-linear delay modeling, custom wire load models, back annotation of calculated delays, early oorplanning, post-layoutre-mapping and resizing) have not been able to solve theproblem. It thus remains that tradeoffs in logical and physical domains must be addressed in an integrated fashion.Huge business opportunities will be lost unless more revolutionary changes to design flow are made.This panel of experts will address the current split between logic synthesis and physical design and its effecton the design flow. It will then discuss possibilities formerging the two, or at least bringing them closer together.In particular, issues such as consistent wire load and timing models and algorithms which must be employed acrossthe design flow, EDA standards and common databasesto support the integration of layout and synthesis tools,evolving structured design styles that offer lower wiringoverhead, interconnect-driven logic synthesis, and timing-driven physical design will be discussed. Finally, the panelwill seek to highlight challenges and potential pitfalls that lie ahead.
