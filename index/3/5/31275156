Missing value is common in many machine learning problems and much effort has been made to handle missing data to improve the performance of the learned model. Sometimes, our task is not to train a model using those unlabeled/labeled data with missing value but process examples according to the values of some specified features. So, there is an urgent need of developing a method to predict those missing values. In this paper, we focus on learning from the known values to learn missing value as close as possible to the true one. It's difficult for us to predict missing value because we do not know the structure of the data matrix and some missing values may relate to some other missing values. We solve the problem by recovering the complete data matrix under the three reasonable constraints: feature relationship, upper recovery error bound and class relationship. The proposed algorithm can deal with both unlabeled and labeled data and generative adversarial idea will be used in labeled data to transfer knowledge. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
