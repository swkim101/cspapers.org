This poster highlights a sociocultural analysis of a multifaceted K12 outreach program at New Mexico State University, a Hispanic Serving Institution that has had success recruiting local young women into the computer science department and beyond into the computing workforce. YWiC began in 2006 and has become a rich, extensive outreach program, reaching over 10,200 students across southern New Mexico. Over the years, YWiC has produced strong evaluation results related to computer science knowledge gains and computing interest (see Nesiba, et. Al 2015). The social scientists used Lave and Wenger's (1991) community of practice concept to analyze program design and implementation. Findings show four ways in which the program promotes individual agency, belonging to the local and global computing communities, and "positioning" (Davies and Harre, 1990) of young women as competent computer scientists. Specifically, YWiC: a) makes multiple pathways into computing education and computer science careers via intentional role modeling, b) provides common base knowledge through initial experiences and deep support from multiple role models, c) gives opportunities for young women to identify, and be identified by others as, competent in computing, and d) promotes belonging to a group of like-minded girls with multiple interests.
