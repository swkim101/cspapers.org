In this paper, we propose the trajectory planning method of multiple mobile manipulators which carry a common object in cooperation. We derive a dynamic equation considering dynamic characteristics of mobile manipulators and the object. The dynamic equation consists of equations of motion of mobile manipulators and the object, nonholonomic constraints of mobile platforms, and geometrical constraints between end-effectors and the object. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as an optimal control problem. A simulation result is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
