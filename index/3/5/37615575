This research focuses on the development of a machine learning technique based on Time-Delay Neural Networks (TDNN) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), to analyze EEG signal dynamics related to the initiation and propagation of epileptic seizures. We aim at designing a generative model to simulate EEG time-series after alteration of specific localized channels (electrodes) in order to explore the effects of brain surgery ex-vivo.
