The intent of this paper is to describe an implementation of a curriculum computable with the recently established ACM Community and Junior College Career in Computer Programming Guidelines (the “Little” Report). The proposed curriculum consists of a two-year associate degree program in Computer and Information Studies containing four options, one of which is a career option for computer programmers. The programs are supported by a set of twenty-five one, two, and three credit courses. Those courses will be discussed in this report.
