In our first programming course we introduce elements of machine organization and JCL, and the balance of the course is FORTRAN and algorithm development in equal portions. To support the second course, we introduce the concept of program structure and top-down design, although there is not enough time to treat these adequately in a one semester course. Documentation is taught: internal, external, user, and maintenance. Structured control constructs and their implementation within FORTRAN are given.
 Our objectives are to teach structured design and programming and to provide a setting that reinforces student use of software engineering techniques.
