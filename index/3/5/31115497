This text describes a project which aims to explore the scope of the discipline Web Science; an emerging subject which is fundamentally inter-disciplinary. There are very few definitive subject definitions currently available for Web Science. Additionally, the nature of the subject is constantly evolving as an increasing number of different disciplines begin to practice what might identifiably be called Web Science. This potentially provides educators and students with a problem; how do you teach or learn about Web Science when there is no clear definition? This text provides a brief overview of a PhD project, the final aim of which involves the emergence of a framework for a working definition of Web Science. This will be achieved by an examination and overview of current existing Web Science curricula, as well as available Web Science literature.
