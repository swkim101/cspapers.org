Twenty years after the paper No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering by Frederick P. Brooks first appeared in IEEE Computer in April 1987 (following its 1986 publication in Information Processing, ISBN 0444-7077-3) does the premise hold that the complexity of software is not accidental? How have the "hopes for silver" which included high-level language advances, object-oriented programming, artificial intelligence, expert systems, great designers, etc. - evolved? Panelists will discuss what has changed and/or stayed the same in the past twenty years - and the paper's influence on the community.
