These issues were exposed dramatically during the Snowbird meeting of Computer Science and Engineering Departments in July 2000. Peter Freeman, Dean of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech, organized a workshop for IT deans, expecting half a dozen attendees. Instead, nearly 50 people attended. About half were heads of IT schools or similar units, a quarter were planning such units at their universities, and the rest were interested observers. They were all concerned about the issues above and about whether a common core curriculum could be designed for an IT school. The IT school is fast becoming a mainstream concern.
