Towards persuasive system for efficient use of water resource, we propose a method to detect "water waste" among water-related activities based on water sound analysis. We supposed two types of water-wastes: inter-activity water waste and intra-activity water waste. An evaluation with a variety of experimental conditions presents that the aggregate accuracies to identify the inter-activity water waste and the intra-activity waste are 96.3% and 92.6%, respectively.
