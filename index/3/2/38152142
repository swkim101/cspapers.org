This paper presents a new method for planning and controlling dynamic multi-contact motions for humanoid robots. Our motion planner takes a sequence of multi-contact stances and generates closed-form reference trajectories for the robot center of mass (CoM) position, velocity, and acceleration, based on the concept of Divergent Component of Motion (DCM). The timing of the contact transitions and the end-effector trajectories are automatically computed such that the motion is feasible with respect to kinematic and dynamic constraints. We verify the constraints using a simplified model of the robot to achieve a very fast planner that finds a feasible solution within a few seconds. The reference trajectories serve as inputs to a passivity-based whole-body controller which includes a DCM controller for tracking the CoM trajectory. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in simulation and experiments with the humanoid robot TORO.
