My term came at the time of the New York World Fair. The Association, still of MT as well as CL, was trying to crash the club that shared profits from the annual meetings of AFIFS. These were producing something over $20,000, a sum which in those days would do more than pay a fraction of one's annual overhead on an NSF grant. ACM of course was grabbing the bulk of this, but √ÅEEE wasn't doing badly, to Judge by the magnificence of its Journal. I attended the powwows of the powers national and international. In spite of our run-down heels, they treated me courteously. Among other actlvltfes we Journeyed out for a preview of the World Fair exhibits.
