This panel aims to explore the nature of the emerging Web engineering discipline. It will attempt to strongly engage with the issue of whether Web Engineering is currently, and (more saliently) should be in the future, viewed primarily as a technical design discipline with its attention firmly on the way in which Web technologies can be leveraged in the design process, or whether it should be viewed primarily as a socio-positioned discipline which focuses on the nature of the way in which projects are managed, needs are understood and users interact.
