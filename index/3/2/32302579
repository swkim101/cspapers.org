The purpose of this paper is to present cost and error data collected during the development cycle of a large-scale software effort, to analyze this data in comparison with other available data from similar projects, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the techniques utilized on the project. The project being reported on is Computer Sciences Corporation's development of the Central Flow Control Software System for the Federal Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Control System Command Center. Analysis of the cost data provides insight not only into the added development costs associated with severely limiting module sizes, but also into the effectiveness of various cost estimation techniques. The error data analysis supports the usefulness of the software engineering techniques which were used on the project in conjunction with definitive module-level test requirements. The paper provides a foundation upon which to establish the development and data collection environment for future software systems.
