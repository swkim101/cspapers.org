My CIGRE-career started in 1972 with the presentation of a CIGRE-paper on extra large GSU-transformers at the Paris session. From 1982 until 1994 I joined Study Committee 12 Transformers as the ordinary German member and from 1994 to 2000 I was the chairman of SC 12, now SC A2. In this position I was member of the Technical Committee of CIGRE. During all that time I participated actively in several working groups, organised the 1983 Transformer Colloquium in Aachen, acted as Special Reporter and contributed several papers and reports to the biannual Paris sessions and the transformer colloquia which happened every uneven year.
