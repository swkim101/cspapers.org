Worcester Polytechnic Institute is a technologically oriented university, wit h a strong major in computer science. Since the inception of its project-centered WPI Plan in 1970 [WORC93], both the undergraduate curriculum and many individual courses have been based on large-scale projects. This paper describes software to support a large-scale project in an undergraduate Computer Networks course, and our experience using that software. The idea of basing undergraduate systems courses on large scale projects is well-established. Both the MINIX operating system [TANE87] and the OSP project environment [KIFE91], among others, provide a framework for a project-based undergraduate operating systems course. The undergraduate Computer Networks course is taken primarily by thirdand fourth-year students, mostly computer science and electrical engineering majors. The students have taken a minimum of four previous courses in computer science, including a first operating systems course, covering roughly Chapters 1-6 of [TANE87]. Typically, the students have had courses in data structures, file structures, and a second course in operating systems before taking the Computer Networks. Thus the students are well-prepared to handle large programming assignments.
