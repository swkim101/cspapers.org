ARK (Autonomous Robot for a Known environment), is a visually-guided mobile robot which is being constructed as part of the Precarn project in mobile robotics. ARK operates in a previously mapped environment and navigates with respect to visual landmarks that have been previously located. While the robot moves, it utilizes an active vision sensor to register the robot with respect to these landmarks. As the landmarks may be scarce in certain regions of its environment, ARK plans paths which minimize both path length and path uncertainty. The global path planner assumes that the robot will use a Kalman filter to integrate landmark information with odometry data to correct path deviations as the robot moves, and then uses this information to choose a path which reduces the expected path deviation.
