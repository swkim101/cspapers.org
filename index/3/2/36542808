We adopt the generalized Pareto distribution for the information-based model and show that the parameters can be estimated based on the mean excess function. The proposed information retrieval model corresponds to the extension of the divergence from independence and is designed to be data-driven. The proposed model is then applied to the specific object search called the instance search and the effectiveness is experimentally confirmed.
