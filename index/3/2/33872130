A new kind of motion simulation is proposed for the purpose of simulating complicated motions such as those caused by interactions between objects in special environments (e.g., those of micro-gravity). The motion simulation is based on a hybrid simulation: consisting of a combined analog-digital system. Hence it has functions of real-time numerical simulation and embedding a physical model in the simulation. In addition, the motion simulation is equipped with flexibility of modeling, effective human interface and scalability of system. Finally, as a preliminary experiment, motion caused by interactions between a chaser (space robot) and a target (nano satellite) has been simulated with a prototype of the hybrid motion simulator.
