In the current mobile communication networks, users have to trtistnetwork operators to make correct. charges over the cds they made. There islack of evidence to resolve possible disputti+ over thenurnberofcdls and the duration of each cd. Such a concern may grow when users roam among different network operators. This paper proposes an efficient solution to undeniable b]~ng when a mobile user roams into foreign networks. This is achieved by the combination of digitd signature and hash-chaining techniques. Mobile users need to submit a digitd signature when requesting a cd and release chained h~<h vahtes during the session so that the cd and its duration are undeniable. Our mechanism is tight-weighted regarding the storage requirement and comput ation overhead~ on a mobile user, and is apphcable for mobile phone users equipped with a smart card.
