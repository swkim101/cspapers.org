If failures occur at one site of a distributed data base system, then in most cases multi-site-transactions will be affected. Since these transactions cannot commit, processing at remote sites is affected, too. Until the end of recovery the transaction throughput of these sites remains diminished. In this paper two strategies will be discussed for handling transactions during recovery. An algorithm will be given, which selects for any transaction the strategy with minimal costs during recovery.
