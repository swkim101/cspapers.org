Current approaches in artificial intelligence (AI) typically focus on solving a narrow subset of problems in a given space - for example: automatic speech recognition as part of a conversational assistant, machine vision as part of a question answering service for blind people, or planning as part of a home assistive robot. This approach is necessary to scope the solution, but often results in a large number of systems that are rarely deployed in real-world setting, but instead operate in toy domains, or in situations where other parts of the problem are assumed to be solved. The framework I have developed aims to use the crowd to help in two ways: (i) make it possible to use human intelligence to power parts of a system that automated approaches cannot or do not yet handle, and (ii) provide a means of enabling more effective deployable systems by people to provide reliable training data on-demand. This summary begins with a brief review of prior work, then outlines a number of different system that I have developed to demonstrate the capabilities of this framework, and concludes with future work to be completed as part of my thesis.
