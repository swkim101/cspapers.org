Recently, many historical texts have become digitized and made accessible for search and browsing. Professionals who work with collections of such texts often need to verify the correctness of documents' key metadata - their creation dates. In this paper, we demonstrate an interactive system for estimating the age of documents. It may be useful not only for tagging a large number of undated documents, but also for verifying already known timestamps. In order to infer probable dates, we rely on a large scale lexical corpora, Google Books Ngrams. Besides estimating the document creation year, the system also outputs evidences to support age detection and reasoning process and allows testing different hypotheses about document's age.
