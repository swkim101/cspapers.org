As the industry moves to personalization and mobility, users expect their applications to be location savvy, and relevant to their lives in increasing detail. While we can pinpoint a user at a location within 700 meters with just their IP address, and within a meter with their GPS-enabled mobile phone, we fall short when it comes to understanding their geographic context. A person's geographic context includes their current and previous location, the things that surround them, their activity in a given place, as well as their thoughts and feelings in that place. Understanding this context allows us to personalize their experience and refine their interactions with an application, on a hyper-local level.
