 
 We developed a course in which students train an instance of Watson and develop an application that interacts with the trained instance. Additionally, students learn technical in-formation about the Jeopardy! version of Watson and they discuss a future infused with cognitive assistants. In this poster, we justify this course, characterize major assessment items and provide advice on choosing a domain.
