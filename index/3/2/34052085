OISE's Computer Support-Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE) is an innovative collaborative educational hypermedia system designed to facilitate student-centred knowledge-building through the collaborative construction of computerized knowledge bases. Previous CHI posters have described results of the last six years of classroom use [1]. Throughout the school year, students enter their work into a common database of text and graphics which is available to all students through browsing and searching based on topics, keywords, and other links. Through this work, students are encouraged to formulate their own problems, develop their own theories, and construct their own knowledge. Thus, the main design challenge for CSILE is to support the development of cognitive skills required for self-directed (intentional) learning. This poster focuses on the continuing development of facilities that require students to take intentional control of and responsibility for the process and content of their spelling and vocabulary learning.
