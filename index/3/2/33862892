Web applications can leak confidential user information due to the presence of unintended side-channel vulnerabilities in code. One particularly subtle class of side-channel vulnerabilities arises due to resource usage imbalances along different execution paths of a program. Such side-channel vulnerabilities are especially severe if the resource usage imbalance is asymptotic. This paper formalizes the notion of asymptotic resource side-channels and presents a lightweight static analysis algorithm for automatically detecting them. Based on these ideas, we have developed a tool called SCANNER that detects resource-related side-channel vulnerabilities in PHP applications. SCANNER has found 18 zero-day security vulnerabilities in 10 different web applications and reports only 2 false positives. The vulnerabilities uncovered by SCANNER can be exploited using cross-site search attacks to extract various kinds of confidential information, such as a user's medications or purchase history.
