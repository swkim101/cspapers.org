We propose a hierarchical structure for control of autonomous robots. We draw on ideas from the hybrid systems theory, which describe systems governed by a discrete set of continuous modes of operation and transitions between these modes. We aim to enable rapid development of test applications and to allow easy performance upgrades. Our structure is based on the creation of agents to process inputs and outputs at the highest level of abstraction in the system (the application domain). We describe our implementation of this structure in two systems: a nonholonomic car-like robot and a quadrupedal entertainment robot. Both examples demonstrate how abstraction of planning away from the implementation details of the robot enables rapid development.
