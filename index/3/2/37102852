As more and more people are using Cray XT3, we wish to gather the user experiences of problems encountered and solutions implemented successfully. We will invite major sites to share their experiences with the purpose that we benefit from common experiences, avoid problems suffered by others, and compile a list of still lingering problems. In addition, we may want to create a Wish List of desirable features to be communicated to the manufacturer. We will invite pertinent Cray personnel and welcome future users as well.Our goal is to acknowledge this community of users and their problems so as to share in the solution or help expedite a solution where none exists. This activity, possibly a subset of activities of Cray User Group, is to focus our attention on a platform gaining popularity.
