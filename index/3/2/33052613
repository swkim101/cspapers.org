The object of the present paper is to discuss the results of the work carried out to define as strictly as possible the formal system of representation of the inference procedures ("hypotheses") characteristic of the RESEDA project. RESEDA is a question-answering system which operates on a data base containing biographical information concerning characters involved in the medieval history of France.
