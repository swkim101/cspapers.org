Mathematical models are developed for the following motion primitives: (a) self-motion and -propulsion of a robot, (b) single- and dual-arm catching or release of a workpiece by a robot, and (c) catching and release of a robot chain by another robot. These primitives can be combined to build strategies for automated handling and cooperative assembly in space. The developments in this paper, even though illustrated for planar systems, easily extend to spatial free-floating robot systems.
