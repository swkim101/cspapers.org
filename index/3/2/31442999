This paper presents a brief description of a general multiprogramming (and time-sharing) system in operation at the University of Michigan. A number of time and space distributions obtained from a typical month of operation are presented. The performance is summarized by a load diagram. Efficiency as a comparison with ideal performance is discussed and a model suitable for idealization is proposed.
