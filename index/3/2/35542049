Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph and l: V → [k] := {1, . . . , k} a level assignment such that l(u) In the problem C onstrained L evel P lanarity (CLP for short), we are further given a partial ordering ≺i of Vi := l−1(i) for i ∈ [k], and we seek a level planar drawing where the order of the vertices on li is a linear extension of ≺i. A special case of this is the problem P artial L evel P lanarity (PLP for short), where we are asked to extend a given level-planar drawing H of a subgraph H ⊆ G to a complete drawing G of G without modifying the given drawing, i.e., the restriction of G to H must coincide with H. We give a simple polynomial-time algorithm with running time O(n5) for CLP of single-source graphs that is based on a simplified version of an existing level-planarity testing algorithm for single-source graphs. We introduce a modified type of PQ-tree data structure that is capable of efficiently handling the arising constraints to improve the running time to O(n + kl), where l is the size of the constraints. We complement this result by showing that PLP is NP-complete even in very restricted cases. In particular, PLP remains NP-complete even when G is a subdivision of a triconnected planar graph with bounded degree.
