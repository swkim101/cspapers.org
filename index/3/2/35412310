A computer-assisted instruction in Thermodynamics developed during the past two years at the U. S. Naval Academy has been used for teaching a number of midshipmen individually . An IBM 1500 instructional system is used in which each midshipman is provided with a terminal, with a cathode ray tube (complete with a typewriter keyboard, and a light pen), and an image projector. The instructional material, optional supplementary instruction, questions and tests are presented to each midshipman individually, enabling him to proceed at his own demand and pace. Detailed records of each section of material are stored in the computer and will enable the instructors to review each midshipman's progress through the course.
 The content of the course, the background of the midshipmen, as well as the equipment which the system comprises in use is described. The overall logic and approach to the course is discussed. The method of development of programmed material and a study of its effectiveness toward the stated goals along with recommendations, are also included.
