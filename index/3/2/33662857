The era of "multiple devices per user" brings a new requirement of cross-device task migration. Web browsing is one of the most frequent activities in daily life, however it still lacks an effective mechanism to support user-friendly migration of web browsing across multiple devices. In this paper, we develop the TaskShadow-W, an NFC-triggered web session migration system, to address this issue. TaskShadow-W provides the functionality of session management to guarantee the continuous experience of web browsing. It supports an NFC-based interaction to activate the migration in a user-friendly way. The system is compatible with most of the existing websites, and does not require dedicated proxy servers or modifying the existing web servers. In addition, it is also easy to learn & use.
