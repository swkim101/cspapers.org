Current electric power grids in nowadays are facing many issues as: the power balance, reliable electricity supply, reduction of energy prices, and the integration of distributed energy resources. Conventional electric grids cannot handle with these problems. Current trend to monitor and control the power grid is Multi-Agent System (MAS). In this work, we aim to demonstrate the efficiency of the implementation of MAS in a microgrid to protect and manage its operation. The connection between the MAS and microgrid is achieved using Multi-Agent Control for Simulink (MACSimJx) toolbox. Simulation results proved that MAS has isolated the primary power source when a fault is occurred, and has protected the critical load. Also, it shows that the duration where the critical loads are off power has been reduced.
