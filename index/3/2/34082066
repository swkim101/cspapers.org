Finding the source of gaseous compounds released in the air with robots finds several applications in various critical situations, such as search and rescue. While the distribution of gas in the air is inherently a 3D phenomenon, most of the previous works have downgraded the problem into 2D search, using only ground robots. In this paper, we have designed a bio-inspired 3D algorithm involving cross-wind LÃ©vy Walk, spiralling and upwind surge. The algorithm has been validated using high-fidelity simulations, and evaluated in a wind tunnel which represents a realistic controlled environment, under different conditions in terms of wind speed, source release rates and odor threshold. Studying success rate and execution time, the results show that the proposed method outperforms its 2D counterpart and is robust to the various setup conditions, especially to the source release rate and the odor threshold.
