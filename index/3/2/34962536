In this workshop participants will receive an overview of teaching practices in computer science that research indicates are effective. While the field of computer science education is young, it has uncovered several teaching practices that can be adopted by instructors that can improve both the retention and performance of students. These evidence based teaching practices include active learning techniques such as peer instruction and prior-knowledge activities, pair programming, and use of subgoal labels. Participants will experience firsthand many of these techniques and will be provided with resources on where to find more information, including the original research papers, on each technique. If you want to attend a workshop that will have an immediate impact in your class -- attend this one. The workshop will be interactive, engaging, and show you how to incorporate teaching practices that are empirically proven to provide benefits. You are guaranteed to leave with a list of many freely available resources and ideas to use in your next class. You will also have the opportunity to "ask the experts" as the authors of many of these research papers will be leading that session of the workshop.
