The Graphic Applications Subroutine Package, GASP, is a set of interdependent two-dimentional programs capable of producing drawings on an automatic digital plotter. GASP was justified and developed in an engineering support environment to satisfy certain requirements within the workload responsibilities of a production drafting room and within the engineering areas. In FORTRAN (G or H level) for the IBM System/360, the package utilizes plotter dependent routines through a simple standard interface.
 Users with minimal FORTRAN experience can produce drawings using basic geometric elements drawn with selected line types and widths. More experienced users invoke multiple level transformations to manipulate groups of elements as subpictures and utilize features for drafting dimensioning and automatic pen-width compensation.
 The paper presents features and design philosophy of GASP, and comments on its use and extension. Simple graphic programs are presented along with several representative samples of production artwork.
