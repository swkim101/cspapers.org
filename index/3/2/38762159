International user interfaces are those which are intended for use in more than one country. Designing international user interfaces may or may not involve translation, but it should certainly involve consideration of the special needs of other countries and cultures. Increasing technological sophistication in many countries of the world and the msuiting larger world trade implies greater need to pay attention to international aspects of user interfaces. Many American companies have reached a situation where half of their sales are outside the US, and companies in smaller countries often have an even larger proportion of their sales outside their own country. Viewed from the vendor perspective, this means that software sales will increasingly depend on the international usability of products and not just the domestic usability. And seen from a user perspective, we will end up having more than half the of the worldâ€™s software users using interfaces which were originally designed in a foreign country. Usability for this large number of users will depend upon increased awareness of the issues in designing user interfaces for international use.
