In the context of energy constrained wireless sensor networks where individual nodes can cooperate together to deploy the cooperative communications, Relay and cooperative Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) techniques can be used to exploit the diversity gain to increase the performance or to reduce the transmission energy consumption. Based on the energy efficiency of cooperative communication, a new scheme of using cooperative MISO and Relay techniques for two way data transmission in cluster based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is proposed in this paper. The energy consumption of the multi-hop, Relay and cooperative MISO transmission have been investigated in this paper. Simulation and energy calculation results show that the proposed cooperative scheme has a much lower energy consumption than the traditional multi-hop transmission scheme and the proposed scheme can be used to increase efficiently the size of WSN cluster.
