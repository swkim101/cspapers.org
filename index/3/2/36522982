The article describes a systematic procedure to design a force controller with active observers (AOB). The design is based on pole placement using discrete state space theory. The concept of AOB is introduced as a starting point to perform robust estimates of the system state. The robustness of the system is accomplished through optimal noise processing embedded in the control strategy. The design was tested as a force controller in a Manutec R2 Robot at the DLR.
