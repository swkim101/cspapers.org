In this talk we will discuss a general framework to solve certain sums of products of functions over semi-rings. This captures many well-known problems in disparate areas such as CSPs, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Databases, Logic and Matrix Operations. This talk is based on joint work titled FAQ: Questions Asked Frequently with Mahmoud Abo Khamis and Hung Q. Ngo, which appeared in PODS 2016.
