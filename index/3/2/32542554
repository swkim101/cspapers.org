The emerging CS2013 Curriculum recommendations call for greatly expanded emphasis on parallel and distributed computing (PDC), in response to recent industry changes. CS2013's PDC knowledge units relate to many undergraduate courses. Participants in this BOF will consider responses to CS2013 PDC recommendations that involve multiple undergraduate CS courses at an institution, as opposed to approaches that concentrate PDC topics primarily within a single course. This sharing and brainstorming session will bring together: people having experience with a multi-course or multi-level approach to teaching PDC; people contemplating a multi-course approach to introducing PDC material; and people wishing to provide and/or hear rationale for a multi-course strategy for teaching PDC.
