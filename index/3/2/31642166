The AT&T Interchange Online Network is an online service designed to foster a sense of community while making it easy for customers to find information. This briefing describes how numerous design iterations aided by usability testing led to progressive refinement of the interface, specifically the information space layout for navigation. By combining context and content, Interchange allows orientation in a large information space. It becomes possible to understand all that is contained in a specific area at a glance. One design goal was to leverage editorial expertise while simultaneously taking advantage of publishing models extended to a very large online information space. Our overriding objective was to create an elegant, modern, and professional information service that values the time of busy people. Testing showed that even people who had never used an online service successfully navigated the large information space and enjoyed using Interchange. At the time of this writing, Interchange is at a Beta test stage and the design may be modified by the time the briefing is presented.
