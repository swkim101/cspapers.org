Parallel Computing Toolkit is a Mathematica package that allows users to develop and run parallel computations. It provides a high-level language for expressing parallel algorithms in a machine-independent way supporting many standard parallel programming paradigms. gridMathematica takes full advantage of Parallel Computing Toolkit for providing an easy-to-use environment for parallel computations on multi-processor machines, clusters, or grids of compute nodes using the scale and power of Mathematica. Among the new features under development is an extension of the Wolfram Workbench (which is based on Eclipse) that allows development, debugging and profiling of parallel Mathematica applications. The presentation discusses the features of gridMathematica and demonstrates examples of real world applications currently being used today. Attendees are encouraged to bring their problems to the workshop for evaluation and suggestion.
