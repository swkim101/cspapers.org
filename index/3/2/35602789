Motivation Adequate modeling of the manufacturing yield is of crucial importance in both the design process and in controlling the actual VLSI fabrication process. The goal of the proposed panel discussion is to assess the current status of yield modeling and indicate the directions for future research in this area. We feel that advances in this area are essential to be able to take advantage of the ever changing technology and that current approachLes are not general enough to address the overall complexity of yield modeling. We intend to cover a number of controversial issues related to yield modeling. In the following, we will present some of those issues, the panel organization and the list of panelists.
