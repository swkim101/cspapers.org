One of the biggest unaddressed challenges for the digital economy is what to do when electronic transactions go wrong.

Businesses are frustrated by the high cost of providing quality customer service.We believe that many simple problems, such as mistyped numbers or lost orders, could be easily diagnosed if users were supplied with end-user tools for e-commerce problem solving. Working analogously to tools for software debugging, these tools show the history of actions and data and allow the user to explore hypotheses about what went wrong.
