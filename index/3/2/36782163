Stack Overflow is a useful Q&A online community for programmers. However, it has not been as popular among programmers who are women. Prior studies have shown low participation of women programmers on Stack Overflow, but have not demonstrated how the presence of their peers may promote activity. In this work, we understand how the presence of women, through peer parity, can encourage women to participate more on Stack Overflow. We extracted 3,2209,817 posts from the most recent Stack Overflow data dump. By modifying a popular gender computing tool, we took the first names of online users and identified the gender of 2,502,438 users from the 5,987,284 list of current users. We randomly selected peer parity and non peer parity questions asked by women and identify differences in participation on those posts. We found that women become more active after they have taken part in a peer parity post. With further analysis of peer parity through eye tracking and tone detection tools we can determine ways to foster a more welcoming community that would encourage women to participate.
