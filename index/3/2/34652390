Cornhole is a fun and social game with simple rules, but involves strategy and physical training for humans to play competitively; thus, developing a robot that can play at the level of even the average human player presents a multitude of opportunities for curricular integration at a variety of levels. We characterize the AI tasks involved with the game, and present results and resources gained from preliminary offerings.
