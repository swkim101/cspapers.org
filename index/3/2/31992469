In this paper, a modular neurocontroller for an arbitrary N-DOF (degree of freedom) manipulator is proposed. The recursive nature of the Newton-Euler formulation is used as a base for the modular neurocontroller. The neural modules can be trained by the direct inverse or indirect adaptive control schemes. Computer simulation results for a 2-DOF SCARA manipulator are given. Due to its modular structure, this neurocontroller can be applied to a manipulator with arbitrary degrees of freedom such as distributed or cellular robotic systems.
