The Picture Division of The Public Archives of Canada has undertaken the construction of a thesaurus of iconographic terms as part of its preparations for a computerized inventory system. The thesaurus which complements an existing set of descriptive standards will serve as a terminological control device enabling indexers and researchers to translate natural language into a more restrained and logical system language. General characteristics of the thesaurus will be described. Special emphasis will be given to the impact of on-line information retrieval computer technology on the design and development of the system language. Sample pages of the thesaurus will be available for examination and further discussion. An overview of other Canadian experiments in the field of subject access to visual records will also be provided.
