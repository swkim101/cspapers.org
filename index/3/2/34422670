In this report several propulsion systems of air cushion vehicles are introduced, and a state feedback control law for trajectory control of an air cushion vehicle is proposed. We consider that the vehicle should be controlled so that it may not drift sideways for good driving performance. We apply a Lyapunov-like function to develop a nonlinear state feedback control law. Effectiveness of the nonlinear state feedback control law for an ACV model is verified through numerical simulations.<<ETX>>
