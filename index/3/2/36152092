This paper will describe implementations of three combinatorial file organization schemes, viz., an inverted filing scheme of order 1 (IFS1), a generalized Hiroshima University balanced filing scheme of order 2 (GHUBFS2), a filing scheme having consecutive retrieval property with redundancy (CRWR), as a document retrieval system. The results of an experimentation for evaluating the efficiency of those storage and retrieval schemes will be presented. The characteristic features of those schemes by the growth of the number of data will also be discussed.
