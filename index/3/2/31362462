The mechanical design of robotic hands has been converging towards low-inertia, tendon-driven strategies. As tendon driven robotic fingers are serial chain systems, routing strategies with compliant tendons lead to multi-articular coupling between the degrees of freedom. We propose a generalized analysis of such serial chain linkages with coupled passive joint stiffnesses. We analyze the effect of such coupling on maximum achievable stiffness control boundaries while maintaining passivity at the actuators by analytically deriving the boundaries. We believe that we can use this information to form mechanical design guidelines for intelligently selecting arrangements of compliance elements (mechanical springs) and transmission strategies, i.e. tendon routing and pulley radii, to provide intrinsic stability and customizable controller stiffness limits for high performance manipulation in robotic hands.
