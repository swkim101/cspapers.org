We live in an increasingly multilingual multimodal world where it is common to find multiple views of the same entity across modalities and languages. For example, news articles which get published in multiple languages are essentially different views of the same entity. Similarly, video, audio and multilingual subtitles are multiple views of the same movie clip. Given the proliferation of such multilingual multimodal content it is no longer sufficient to process a single modality or language at a time. Specifically, there is an increasing demand for allowing transfer, conversion and access across such multiple views of the data. For example, users want to translate/convert news articles to their native language, automatically caption their travel photos and even ask natural language questions over videos and images. This has led to a lot of excitement around this interdisciplinary research area which requires ideas from Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Speech and Computer Vision among other fields. In this tutorial we focus on neural network based models for addressing various problems in this space. We will first introduce the participants to some of the basic concepts and building blocks that such approaches rely on. We will then describe some of these approaches in detail. There are two important parts to the tutorial. In the first part, we will talk about approaches which aim to learn a common representation for entities across languages and modalities thereby enabling cross lingual and cross modal access and transfer. In the second part we will talk about multilingual multimodal generation. For example, we will discuss neural network based approaches which aim at (i) generating translations in multiple languages, (ii) generating images given a natural language description and (iii) generating captions in multiple languages.
