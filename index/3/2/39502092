(1) In a previous paper(1) a s ta t i s t i ca l theory of visual thresholds was reported which accounts for the influence both of quantum noise and of visual noise added to the test patterns. This theory finds part icular application in the preÂ­ dict ion of thresholds of vision through image intensifying systems which superimpose system noise on the observed scenes. In a subsequent paper(2) an addit ional factor was introduced to allow for alternative mechanisms of noise integration within the summation areas.
