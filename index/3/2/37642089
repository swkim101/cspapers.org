One of the essential parts of dextrous manipulation with fingers is the use of sliding motion. Sliding manipulation techniques can fulfil tasks, such as a change of contact point between fingers and objects, a change in the location of objects without losing contact under unknown object-fingertip surface conditions or the determination of an optimal grasp force in order to avoid losing grasped objects. These techniques require a knowledge of the friction coefficients between the finger and the object. A method of slip detection and static friction coefficient determination, requiring no additional sensors than the existing joint position and force sensors of a two fingered robot hand system, is proposed. This method is applicable to general use in multi-fingered robot hand systems. The authors describe the principle of slip detection using the stick-slip effect and the required control algorithm for grasp forces. The performance of the described method is demonstrated on a pick-up task application. Considerations due to experimental results are discussed.<<ETX>>
