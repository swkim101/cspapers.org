This paper discusses the contents of an introductory course in the applications of computer technology in the health sciences. A set of instructional goals is described, designed to meet the basic needs of the health professional involved in understanding and developing computer-based applications in his environment. From these goals, a list of specific objectives is constructed and presented as the student's minimum level of achievement for the course. The implementation, evaluation and impact of the course are reviewed.
