Crossings represent a classical example for the conflict regions of mobile robot systems. Two robots in a crossing situation are considered where the priorities and sequences of passing have been determined beforehand. Communication and sensing are regarded as an ideal combination of data sources for the collision avoidance control process. Nevertheless, in this case, temporal uncertainties have to be considered in parallel to the spatial uncertainty of sensing and localisation. The event transformation into the local space-time coordinate frame of a robot is introduced as a major element of the iterative process to reduce the sources of uncertainty. This transform is the basic part of the collision avoidance control procedure.<<ETX>>
