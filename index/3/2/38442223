We present a workshop proposal focusing on future digital home infrastructures and systems needed to support ubiquitous computing applications and services. The workshop aims to be the premiere venue that brings together researchers and practitioners across the disciplines of Systems and Networking, Ubiquitous Computing and HCI to elaborate ways in which the current infrastructure in the digital home can be reshaped to meet the needs of users.
