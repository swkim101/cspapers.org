The term "Social Machine" (SM) has been commonly used as a synonym for what is known as the programmable web or web 3.0. Some definitions of a Social Machine have already been provided and they basically support the notion of relationships between distributed entities. The type of relationship molds which services would be provided or required by each machine, and under certain complex constraints. In order to deal with the complexity of this emerging web, we present a language that can describe networks of Social Machines, named SMADL -- the Social Machine Architecture Description Language. In few words, SMADL is as a relationship-driven language which can be used to describe the interactions between any number of machines in a multitude of ways, as a means to represent real machines interacting in the real web, such as, Twitter running on top of Amazon AWS or mash-ups built upon Google Maps, and obviously, as a means to represent interactions with other social machines too.
