In this paper, we will explore the role of mathematics in both the undergraduate and pre-college curricula. We will begin with a brief survey of existing undergraduate computer science curricula, with particular emphasis on the recommendations and controversies related to mathematics topics. Next, we will explore standards for pre-college mathematics, including the Advanced Placement Courses for Computer Science, the new Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, and the recommendations from Project 2061. Finally, we will explore the relationship between the pre-college standards and the computer science curricula of the future.
