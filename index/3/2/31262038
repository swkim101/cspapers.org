Fiber-Reinforced Elastofluidic Enclosures (FREEs), are a subset of pneumatic soft robots with an asymmetric continuously deformable skin that are able to generate a wide range of deformations and forces, including rotation and screw motions. Though these soft robots are able to generate a variety of motions, simultaneously controlling their end effector rotation and position has remained challenging due to the lack of a simple model. This paper presents a model that establishes a relationship between the pressure, torque due to axial loading, and axial rotation to enable a model-driven open-loop control for FREEs. The modeling technique relies on describing force equilibrium between the fiber, fluid, and an elastomer model which is computed via system identification. The model is experimentally tested as these variables are changed, illustrating that it provides good agreement with the real system. To further illustrate the potential of the model, a precision open-loop control experiment of opening a rotational combination lock is presented2.
