In this paper we address the issue of continuous keyword queries on multiple textual streams. This line of work represents a significant departure from previous keyword search models that assumed a static database. In our model the user poses a query comprised by a collection of keywords, which is subsequently applied on multiple text streams (these can be RSS news feeds, TV closed captions, emails, etc). A result to a query is a combination of streams "sufficiently correlated" to each other that collectively contain all query keywords within a specified time span.
