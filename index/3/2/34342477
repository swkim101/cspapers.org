A wide variety of personal data is routinely collected by numerous organizations that, in turn, share and sell their collections for analytic investigations (e.g., market research). To preserve privacy, certain identifiers are often redacted, perturbed or even removed. A substantial number of attacks have shown that, if care is not taken, such data can be linked to external resources to determine the explicit identifiers (e.g., personal names) or infer sensitive attributes (e.g., income) for the individuals from whom the data was collected. As such, organizations increasingly rely upon record linkage methods to assess the risk such attacks pose and adopt countermeasures accordingly. Traditional linkage methods assume only two datasets would be linked (e.g., linking de-identified hospital discharge to identified voter registration lists), but with the advent of a multi-billion dollar data broker industry, modern adversaries have access to a massive data stash of multiple datasets that can be leveraged. Still, realistic adversaries have budget constraints that prevent them from obtaining and integrating all relevant datasets. Thus, in this work, we investigate a novel privacy risk assessment framework, based on adversaries who plan an integration of datasets for the most accurate estimate of targeted sensitive attributes under a certain budget. To solve this problem, we introduce a graph-based formulation of the problem and predictive modeling methods to prioritize data resources for linkage. We perform an empirical analysis using real world voter registration data from two different U.S. states and show that the methods can be used efficiently to accurately estimate potentially sensitive information disclosure risks even under a non-trivial amount of noise.
