Information Retrieval is often only one step towards the satisfaction of an information need. After a user has retrieved a number of relevant documents, they need to extract information from these resources, and possibly gather information from several in order to satisfy their need. There are several reasons for this: . The resource does not have the right degree of granularity for the information need. . There is no single “good” answer to an information need. . Several resources need to be compared before the information need is fulfilled. This process of extraction/gathering is quite common in traditional library environments; however, some experiments tend to indicate that users of electronic search tools do not readily perform extraction/gathering [1], but rather expect the tool to provide them “ready-to-use” answers. Unfortunately, current information retrieval systems force the user to see their need in terms of topics, and therefore might support some form of extraction, but no gathering.
