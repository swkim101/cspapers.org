This paper argues that interface design can be made more effective by borrowing techniques from graphic design. User interface designers often explore interface ideas through coded prototypes, which do not facilitate quick turnaround and require a complete interface definition. This method of prototyping is too detailed and laborious to appropriately facilitate early design decisions, such as brainstorming about the task the interface will support.
