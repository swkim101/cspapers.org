n(l-e) for large enough n [3]. No results are known, however, as to the existence of specific functions with nearly maximal complexity. One of our results is that there must be such functions in the set of monatonic boolean functions and hence in the set of unate functions. In contrast we have found that there is a constant a such that any threshold function of n variables can be computed in time c~ log n. We also examine the set Q~ functions 9~ n variables which contain 2 n/ or 2 n 2 n/K minterms. We shall give a very tight upper and lower bound on the complexity class of this set. It is felt that our results could be a sigConsider the subclass of M N F which conn sists of functions whose prime implioants
