Rule-based diagnostics of power generating equipment is an important task in industry. In this demo we present how semantic technologies can enhance diagnostics. In particular, we present our semantic rule language sigRL that is inspired by the real diagnostic languages in Siemens. SigRL allows to write compact yet powerful diagnostic programs by relying on a high level data independent vocabulary, diagnostic ontologies, and queries over these ontologies. We present our diagnostic system SemDia. The attendees will be able to write diagnostic programs in SemDia using sigRL over 50 Siemens turbines. We also present how such programs can be automatically verified for redundancy and inconsistency. Moreover, the attendees will see the provenance service that SemDia provides to trace the origin of diagnostic results.
