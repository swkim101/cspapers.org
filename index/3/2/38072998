Ontologies provide formed conceptualization of the concepts of domain under study. It is emerging research area due to its unique features of sharing knowledge and its rich structure to adopt structured as well unstructured content. Ontology utilization has extended its scope to other fields like retrieval systems including content and image retrieval. In this paper, we have proposed new framework for image retrieval system based on the domain ontology. The proposed domain in this paper is regarding national heroes of Pakistan. The ontology of diverse nature has been constructed including various contexts related to certain resources, who are personalities in this domain. We have discussed the ontology creation process, implementation of the complete image retrieval system using latest tools including Jena API architecture for inferencing mechanism. The results depict that semantic technique gives better results as compared to keyword search. This work encourages us to add the concept of result ranking for the results achieved using domain ontology.
