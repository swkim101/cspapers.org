We introduce a restriction on the structure of a database scheme, called the primary key condition, and show that this condition characterizes independent database schemes when constraints are presented as keys. The primary key condition provides added insight into the structure of independent schemes, and leads to a general design methodology. We describe a linear-time algorithm for recognizing independent schemes.
