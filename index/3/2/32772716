The creation of modern software systems requires knowledge from a wide range of domains: application domains, computer hardware and operating systems, algorithms, programming languages, vast amount of component libraries, development environments, the history of the software system, and users. Because few software developers have all the required knowledge, the development of software is no longer confined to an individual but has to rely on distributed cognition by reaching into a complex and networked world of information and computer mediated collaboration. Knowledge collaboration has thus become an important aspect of software development.
