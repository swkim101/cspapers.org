A mid-career review is presented, of how the teaching of Computer Science I has changed for this instructor over the last two decades. The content of the course has evolved to include algorithm development and program design. Assessment in the course has gone online and moved away from testing how clever the student is, to how much the student has learned in the course. Professional practices are now covered that help students understand and incorporate preferred practices of the discipline. Changes incorporated into the pedagogy include going from using anthropomorphic and ad-hoc to discipline-specific and consistent vocabulary, and from writing code in the class like an experienced programmer to writing it to suit a beginning learner. It is hoped that this review will help new Computer Science I instructors avoid some misconceptions with which this instructor started out.
