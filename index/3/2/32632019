Elderly people would like to maintain independence for as long as possible in a familiar environment. Limitations within that environment often necessitate a move into residential care facilities where care attendants are available for assistance. This research investigates one potential area where a robot based technology may provide a solution that is usable by an elderly clientele. The application area is that of assisting a person to achieve independent transfer between a seated and a standing position such as might be encountered in moving between a chair, wheelchair, bed, toilet, or shower seat. An important goal of this work is to demonstrate that advanced technology can be simple and effective. To be successful the technology must be easy to use, meet the needs of elderly people and become an accepted component of daily life.<<ETX>>
