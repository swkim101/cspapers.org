U-City is a city where diverse public information is provided through IT technology. In the past, IT infrastructure for public information was not considered in city planning. However, in recent construction of new cities, this kind of infrastructure is becoming necessary. Safety, transportation, and weather information are gathered and provided to residents through the Internet, mobile devices, etc [1]. To provide this kind of information, local governments operates U-City control center, and there is an issue of increased operating cost of the city. To solve this problem, U-City business platform is designed which can incorporate diverse commercial services. Different from public information platform, a private sector can participate and provide services. This work suggests Business Service Platform (BSP) system structure where USN-based services can be provided in U-City business platform. Then, USN-based service applications are introduced on U-City platform. Business Service Platform (BSP) is a service platform of U-City for services in a private sector, and provides overall functionalities required for the creation, distribution, and billing. A service provider for U-City can develop a new application using BSP. It can also register, distribute, and handle billing using functionalities of BSP. BSP started with a target advertisement service related to public transportation information as its initial service, however USN technology in diverse areas are expected to be applied to BSP in the future. To apply such diverse USN to BSP, a general framework should be provided to integrate USN, and a system is needed that each service provider can control. In this demo, we will explain U-City service platform, which will be deployed at CHEONGRA zone of Korea, and how it is integrated to USN to provide healthcare, smart grid services, and finally major system components.
