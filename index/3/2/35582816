We present a method based on the use of generalized momenta for detecting and isolating actuator faults in robot manipulators. The FDI scheme does not need acceleration estimates or simulation of the nominal robot dynamics and covers a general class of input faults. Numerical results for a 2R robot undergoing also concurrent actuator faults are reported. This method is extended to robots with joint elasticity and to the inclusion of actuator dynamics.
