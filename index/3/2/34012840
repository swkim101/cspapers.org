In this paper, we propose an autonomous multiagent system composed of an intelligent environment (static agents) and mobile agents (robots). We focus on procedure that autonomous mobile agents construct feasible paths. In the system, not a mobile agent but an environment gathers information and makes decisions. We formulate the optimal condition and an optimization algorithm by means of media agents that play the role of communication links between static agents. We also formulate the appropriate ratio of the media agents in the system. We discuss the efficiency of the system by results of simulations.
