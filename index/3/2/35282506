In courses involving team programming projects, it is desirable to have team members share files, and establish procedures for developing a configuration. Often, faculty members also wish to track each team to detect team problems and to determine the team dynamics.This paper describes a system that uses the Web to provide a simple to use student interface for getting and submitting files to their team for building a new configuration. It also describes some of the tools available to the faculty member to organize the teams. Since the system backend is programmable, the faculty member can add any functionality desired.
