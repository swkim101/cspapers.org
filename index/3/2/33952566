As computing becomes increasingly embedded into the fabric of everyday life, systems that understand people's context of use are of paramount importance. Regardless of whether the platform is a mobile device, wearable, or smart infrastructure, context offers an implicit dimension that is vital to increasing the richness of human-computer interaction. In my thesis work, I introduce multiple enabling technologies that greatly enhance context awareness in highly dynamic platforms, all without costly or invasive instrumentation. My systems have been deployed across long periods and multiple environments, the results of which show the versatility, accuracy and potential for robust context sensing. By combining novel sensing with machine learning, my work transforms raw signals into intelligent abstractions that can power rich, context-sensitive applications, unleashing the potential of next-generation computing platforms.
