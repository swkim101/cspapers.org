Modality and negation are ubiquitous phenomena in language. Generally speaking, modality is a grammatical category that allows to express aspects related to the speaker's attitude towards her statements in terms of degree of certainty, reliability, and subjectivity. In this tutorial modality is understood in a broad sense, which involves related concepts like subjectivity, hedging, evidentiality, uncertainty, committed belief, and factuality. Negation is a grammatical category that allows to change the truth value of a proposition. Modality and negation are treated together because they are interrelated phenomena and are protypically expressed by linguistic devices that share some formal characteristics. For example, modality and negation cues function as operators that scope over certain parts of the sentence.
