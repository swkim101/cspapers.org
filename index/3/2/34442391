The authors of this paper have had the opportunity to view computer science (CPS) curricula from three different perspectives - as students themselves, as professional applications programmers, and as employers of current computer science majors. We are concerned that the typical course of study is no longer adequate to prepare students for the real world of computer applications. The purpose of this paper is to point out some problem areas and to suggest an alternative.
