A system is described which produces explanatory animation sequences for a small CAD system. The animation is data-driven from a scriptal knowledge structure describing the user-system interaction for a given design operation. The use of a unified data representation scheme results in the potential to generate animation in coordination with natural language output from an existing knowledge-based system.
