Abstract : Recent advances in small unmanned aircraft systems (SUAS)have greatly broadened the scope of their potential applications.However, traditional design processes applied to SUAS produce asingle design for a single set of requirements. Off-design missionperformance is often greatly degraded due to the vehicles small scale.This paper considers a different approach to SUAS design aimed ataddressing this issue. In this approach, a hybrid modular and scalableproduct family is coupled with linked engineering analyses in order toautomatically formulate a design given a set of mission requirements.This allows multiple SUAS designs to be rapidly synthesized frommultiple sets of design requirements using a common set ofcomponents. Designs are then rapidly generated and manufacturedon-demand using automated manufacturing techniques in order toaddress unforeseen mission needs.The design approach, named Aggregate Derivative Approach toProduct Design (ADAPt Design), consists of four actions: (1)requirements analysis, (2) architecture selection, (3) interface design,and (4) concept refinement and design. The outcomes of the methodare a family of designs which are highly compatible with designautomation, and a toolset that automatically translates changes inrequirements to changes in detailed 3-D models. Results of theapplication of this approach are presented via the design of severalSUAS. The capability of the design paradigm is assessed through acomparison of design requirements to the measured performance ofthe designed vehicle, and conclusions are drawn about the approachsapplicability and scalability.
