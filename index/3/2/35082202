We propose a class of doubly-generalized LDPC (DGLDPC) codes that use single-parity-check (SPC) codes as component codes at the super-variable nodes (SVNs) and SPC product-codes (SPC-PCs) as component codes at the super-check nodes (SCNs). We propose a low-complexity iterative decoding algorithm catered for the special structures of the SPC-PCs. Finally, we present the error performance and the convergence rate of the proposed DGLDPC codes.
