This paper presents a fast estimation technique and a measurement procedure for measurement systems using scalar electric field probes to determine the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of multiple antenna transmitting devices. For devices with N-element antenna, measurements for N(N - 1) + 1 pre-known relative phase combinations of the antennas are required in order to evaluate SAR for any other phase combinations. The technique provides accurate estimated SAR, and is able to identify the maximum SAR corresponding to particular phase combinations of the sources.
