Parallel-jaw robot grippers can grasp almost any object and are ubiquitous in industry. Although the shape, texture, and compliance of gripper jaw surfaces affect grasp robustness, almost all commercially available grippers provide a pair of rectangular, planar, rigid jaw surfaces. Practitioners often modify these surfaces with a variety of ad-hoc methods such as adding rubber caps and/or wrapping with textured tape. This paper explores data-driven optimization of gripper jaw surfaces over a design space based on shape, texture, and compliance using rapid prototyping. In total, 37 jaw surface design variations were created using 3D printed casting molds and silicon rubber. The designs were evaluated with 1377 physical grasp experiments using a 4-axis robot (with automated reset). These tests evaluate grasp robustness as the probability that the jaws will acquire, lift, and hold a training set of objects at nominal grasp configurations computed by Dex-Net 1.0. Hill-climbing in parameter space yielded a grid pattern of 0.03 inch void depth and 0.0375 inch void width on a silicone polymer with durometer of A30. We then evaluated performance of this design using an ABB YuMi robot grasping a set of eight difficult-to-grasp 3D printed objects in 80 grasps with four gripper surfaces. The factory-provided gripper tips succeeded in 28.7% of the 80 trials, increasing to 68.7% when the tips were wrapped with tape. Gripper tips with gecko-inspired surfaces succeeded in 80.0% of trials, and gripper tips with the designed silicone surfaces succeeded in 93.7% of trials.
