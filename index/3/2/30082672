MC-CDMA (Multi-Code Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) both multiple access techniques may provide high data rates, but they suffer from high PAPR (Peak to Average Power Ratio), which is a major issue in the said Multiple Access techniques. In this communication RM (2, 6) second order Reed Muller code is implemented for optimizing PAPR in MC-CDMA and OFDM. Simulation result show that RM (2, 6) gives optimal power in MCCDMA, and OFDM as well, but much varying in the latter. However, error rate is also almost zero for both techniques.
