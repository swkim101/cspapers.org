We introduce DemoMatch, a tool for API discovery that allows the user to discover how to implement functionality using a software framework by demonstrating the functionality in existing applications built with the same framework. DemoMatch matches the demonstrations against a database of execution traces called Semeru and generates code snippets explaining how to use the functionality. We evaluated DemoMatch on several case studies involving Java Swing and Eclipse RCP.
