This paper deals with the problem of multiple actuator failures occurring successively at different times. Based on the LQ problem, we propose two different strategies of fault tolerant control in order to accommodate the affected system. Both classic fault tolerant control strategy and progressive accommodation are investigated. The progressive accommodation is proved to be more efficient in maintaining a satisfactory performance even with the presence of the failures. An illustrative example is given to illustrate the proposed approaches.
