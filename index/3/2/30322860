The work which demonstrates the feasibility of a different approach to 3-D object recognition is described. The authors construct a definition of a generic object category, such as a chair, in terms of the function required of the object. This definition is based on qualitative reasoning about 3-D shape, and does not imply any particular geometric or structural model for an object. Thus, this approach has the potential to lead to recognition systems of much greater generality than current CAD-based or model-based approaches. >
