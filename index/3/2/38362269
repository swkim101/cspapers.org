This poster documents three approaches that we are undertaking to increase security awareness within undergraduate computer science classes. The first approach is a verbal password entry system, with surreptitious photos being taken when the mobile device is stolen. The second approach is a lab where students develop a password entry and verification system between a mobile device and a remote server. The third approach is a captcha system, where students implement a simple challenge that can be verified. Like password entry, the captcha communications must be secure and difficult to automatically manipulate. Unlike password entry, the captcha is meant to allow humans access while denying other computers.
