In this paper we discuss a survey recently completed of graduates of Penn State who earned the M.S. in Computer Science degree. The purpose of this survey was to permit an evaluation of the effectiveness of the curriculum in preparing students to meet the job requirements of their employers. Of equal importance was the former student's evaluation of the program after having had a period in which to reflect. In this paper we report some of the more important findings of the survey.
