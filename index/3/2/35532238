This workshop will provide details on the projects that we recommend for non-residential computing summer camps for 4th -- 12th grade students. Georgia Tech has been offering computing summer camps since 2004. These camps are financially self-sustaining and effective at improving attitudes towards computing, especially for females and African-American students. Items used in the camps include: CS Unplugged, LightBot, Scratch, Alice, LEGO robots (WeDo, NXT, and Tetrix), EarSketch, and App Inventor. Georgia Tech has also helped eleven other colleges and universities in Georgia start or expand computing summer camps. Some of these other institutions also offer camps on GameSalad, GameMaker, and web development. These other camps have also improved attitudes towards computing. The workshop will include an overview of the projects that we have found to be successful and include hands-on work with App Inventor, GameSalad, LEGO NXT robots, and LEGO EV3 robots. laptop optional
