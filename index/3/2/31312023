Local-path-planning-method has been proposed for positioning autonomous guided vehicles ( AGVs). This method minimizes the cost function to constrain AGV's sudden accel- eration change (jerk). The method allows AGVs to malie the velocity and the curvature of the local path continuous, so that AGVs can smoothly travcl along the path. The mcthod was iriil)lcrrioritctl on tlie CI'U of an cxpciiriic.iitnl vcliic.lc tor posi- tioniiig. It was shown that tlic cxpciiiiicntal vcliiclc ~oiiltl plan the local path in rcal time and travel along the path.
