The use of microcomputers in an undergraduate computer science program may be handled in several ways. One approach is to first teach the use of a microcomputer followed by the design of a microcomputer system, and then to send the students out to recommend and install a complete microcomputer system for some organization in the community. In this way, not only do the students learn how to program a microcomputer, but they also learn the internals of the microcomputer, the design of a microcomputer system, the assembly language on a microcomputer, and a final, total application of all their knowledge to a real life situation. We feel this greatly improves upon the common combination of lectures and programming assignments with realistic microcomputer system design and implementation.
