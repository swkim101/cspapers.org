This paper introduces a new method for the session construction problem, which is the first main step of the web usage mining process. The proposed method is capable of extracting all possible maximal navigation sequences of web users. Through experiments, it is shown that when our new technique is used, it outperforms previous approaches in web usage mining applications such as next-page prediction.
