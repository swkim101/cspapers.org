There is a growing body of evidence showing active learning pedagogies are effective for ensuring long-term student learning, reducing course failure rates, and retaining majors. While active learning pedagogies are more often employed in lower divisional CS courses, systems classes-such as OS, architecture, and networks-are just beginning to see a shift from standard lecture to active learning. This BOF will provide a forum for sharing ideas of how to integrate active learning techniques into systems courses, using the following questions as starting points: What are active learning techniques, and how are they used? What impact does active learning have on coverage? Must adoption of active learning techniques entail abandoning lectures entirely? If not, how can I use active learning to augment, rather than replace, my lectures? What transitional steps can I take toward active learning methodologies? If you've tried active learning techniques, what results have you seen?
