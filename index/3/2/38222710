This paper discusses dynamical motion control for a quadruped walking machine. A quadruped walking machine requires dynamical control to keep its stability in high speed walking. The authors make the dynamical compensator by using a weight oscillator built in the center of the body. First, the authors calculate the exact oscillator motion that can neutralize the moment, completely. Next, they try to use a harmonic oscillation for the oscillator's motion instead of the accurate motion. Finally, the authors use a notion of autonomous distributed control for motion control and expand it to quasi-dynamical walking.<<ETX>>
