Six degree-of-freedom (DoF) pose feedback is essential for the development of closed-loop control techniques for microrobotics. This paper presents two methods for depth estimation of transparent microrobots inside an Optical Tweezers (OT) setup using image sharpness measurements and model-based tracking. The x-y position and the 3D orientation of the object are estimated using online model-based template matching. The proposed depth estimation methodologies are validated experimentally by comparing the results with the ground truth.
