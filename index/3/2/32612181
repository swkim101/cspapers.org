Randomness and probability are essential notions in CS studies. They are invoked and employed in diverse courses at different levels. Although a structured course on these notions does not usually appear early in the curriculum, students and educators may benefit from their encapsulation already in CS0 and CS1. The special session will involve motivation, demonstration, and discussion with the audience of the assets of such an encapsulation. Attending CS educators will enrich their teaching perspectives, pedagogical tools, and assignment repertoires.
