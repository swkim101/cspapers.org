SRI International has a long tradition in the field of qualitative analysis and control of complex systems, starting with the development of the early mobile robot Shakey. More recently, we have developed a fuzzy controller for our new platform, Flakey. Flakey's controller can pursue strategic goals while operating under conditions of uncertainty, incompleteness, and imprecision. This controller includes capabilities for: • Robust, uncertainty-tolerating goal-directed activity. • Real-time reactivity to unexpected contingencies (e.g., unknown obstacles). • Blending of multiple goals (e.g., reaching a position while avoiding static and moving obstacles).
