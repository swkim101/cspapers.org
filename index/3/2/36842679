We propose a cross-language retrieval model that is solely based on Wikipedia as a training corpus. The main contributions of our work are: 1. A translation model based on linked text in Wikipedia and a term weighting method associated with it. 2. A combination scheme to interpolate the link translation model with retrieval based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation. On the CLEF 2000 data we achieve improvement with respect to the best German-English system at the bilingual track (non-significant) and improvement against a baseline based on machine translation (significant).
