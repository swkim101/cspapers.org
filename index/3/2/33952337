This paper proposes a manipulation skill mapping for dextrous manipulation task modeling in the intelligent cooperative manipulation system-ICMS. Mapping between desired object task trajectories and finger contact point locations, this skill mapping can efficiently describe complex manipulation tasks, where contact states of the fingers change during the task. Further issues discussed are how this skill mapping can be acquired into the manipulation skill database of the ICMS and transferred for execution by dextrous robotic hands. Examples show the applicability of the proposed scheme.<<ETX>>
