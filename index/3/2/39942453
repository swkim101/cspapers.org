Much of the promotional hype, congressional interest, and consumerist activity surrounding Electronic Funds Transfer Systems (EFTS) has involved the retail side of banking; i.e. handling consumer transactions electronically at the teller window, through automated teller machines, and at the point of sale. Wholesale EFTS, on the other hand, deals with the electronic movement of funds and funds-related messages between banks on their own behalf and on behalf of their corporate customers.
