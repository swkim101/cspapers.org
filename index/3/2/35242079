The intent of this forum is to generate a really lively discussion on the gamut of our relationship - as computer science educators - to industry.How dependent are we/should we be on specific industry software and platforms? (Many examples come to mind - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET, Red Hat Linux, C#, Sun's version of Java.)How obligated are we to jump on board the newest upgraded software version of whatever we might be using?How does our desire for good job placement of our graduates square with our oft-repeated claim that we are educators, not trainers?Pursuing this issue of "where do we fall on the spectrum between training and education," what to do about all these industry certification programs - Cisco, Novell, Oracle, Microsoft. Do we teach these curricula? Do we give credit to students who take it, say at a community college, and then transfer?What about a service course in, say, Photoshop? Is this college-level material?Do opportunities for summer internships or research projects in an industry setting place some special obligations on us with respect to that company?
