The Remote Centre of Motion (RCM) is an essential movement for most of the medical robotic systems during the minimal invasive surgeries. In literature, there are many references which had analysed the techniques for modelling the problem of RCM constraint. However, only very few have discussed the RCM with Path Following Controller which ensures the complexity of surgical tasks. Therefore, this article is focusing on presenting the Task Priority Controller. Such task controller deploys exteroceptive sensor (visual servoing scheme) in order that the surgical tool follows the reference path while maintaining the RCM constraints. The experimental results showed good performance of the proposed controller.
