This paper examines the capability to incorporate spatial force feedback to the human toe when teleoperating a robotic arm in a force task. Due to the growing complexity of teleoperated systems new means of feedback get increasingly important. To investigate the viability of spatial toe-feedback, experiments with 12 subjects were conducted. The participants had to teleoperate a DLR Light-Weight Robot (LWR) via optical tracking of one finger in order to push a toy train. The orientation of the rail was unknown to the subject and had to be explored using the haptic feedback — a three-dimensional spatial force to the toe, reflecting the contact forces at the robotic end-effector — in absence of visual feedback. The rail was mounted in one of four possible orientations (differences of 45°). The main task of the experiment was to identify the present orientation. In our study subjects could successfully identify the orientation of the rail in more than two thirds of all trials (68%). In almost half of the trials (44%) the subjects were able to move the train along the rails long enough to reach the bumpers at the end and identify them as such. Assuming no feedback would be provided at all, the first metric has a chance level of 25%, and reaching the bumper can be considered impossible. Thus, we can conclude that humans can incorporate spatial force feedback to the toe into their sensorimotor loop.
