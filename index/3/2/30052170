o Expense Optimizing compilers are expensive to write and to run. This expense is to some degree inherent, especially if the important classes of inter-procedure optimizations are considered. Conceptually, every line of code to be loaded together must be examined before even very basic decisions about code generation can be made within each procedure: this is expensive, and makes separate compilation of procedures difficult. Attempts to circumvent these information-flow problems by forcing the user to do more work in declarations usually have led to rather ponderous languages that are neither efficient nor easy to compile.
