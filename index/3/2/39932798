The model is desc r ibed in which the cho ice o f no t i ons out o f t h e p r i n c i p a l ( l ong te rmed) memory is determined by t h e i r connect ions w i t h the no t ions o f the c o n t o x t u a l ( s h o r t t e r m e d ) memory and by t h e importances of the no t ions at a c e r t a i n moment. A molecu la r compu te r is suggested as a p o s s i b l e mechanism of t he r e a l i z a t i o n of such memory.
