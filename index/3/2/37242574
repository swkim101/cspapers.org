This paper proposes a single-feed, compact, metasurface-based antenna with circularly-polarized (CP) radiation for the Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. The antenna consists of a square patch on the metasurface, which is a periodic lattice of 4 × 4 square metallic patches arranged on a grounded dielectric substrate. The CP radiation is obtained by truncating corners of the patch radiator. The truncated-cotner square patch on the metasurface structure is used to achieve an antenna miniaturization. The final design, with a size of 60 × 60 × 4.0 mm<sup>3</sup> (0.315λ<inf>o</inf> × 0.315λ<inf>o</inf> × 0.021λ<inf>o</inf> at the GPS L1 frequency) yields a bandwidth for |S<inf>11</inf>| < −10 dB of 1.562–1.733 GHz (171 MHz) and 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 1.570–1.592 GHz (22 MHz). At 1.58 GHz, the proposed antenna yielded a gain of 2.75 dBic and a 3 dB AR beamwidth of 138º and 144º in the x-z and y-z planes, respectively.
