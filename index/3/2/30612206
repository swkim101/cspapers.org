Saving energy without causing discomfort and without demanding human intervention is the need of the day. It is important to develop sensor systems which not only satisfy user requirements, but also take energy consumption into consideration. In this demo, we present the sensing subsystems of a Smart Academic Environment, based upon the core concept of 'Observability' [1] which -- while satisfying user needs -- helps to reduce the number of sensors required.
