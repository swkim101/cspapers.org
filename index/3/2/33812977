Research was undertaken with the goal of applying general universally-applicable induction methods to complex real-world problems. The goal was only partially met. The chosen domain—the card game Eleusis—was still somewhat artificial, and the universally-applicable induction methods were found to be lacking in important ways. However, the resulting Eleusis program does show that by using knowledge-based data interpretation and rule evaluation techniques and model-fitting induction techniques, general induction methods can be used to solve complex problems.
