System Description The end of the Cold War bas brought significant changes for GM Hughes Electronics, one of the world’s leading satellite and defense electronics companies. Their response to the loss of defense revenue was to marry their satellite communications expertise with the rapidly expanding entertainment industry to produce DIRECTV”, the first all-digital direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service in the United States. For years, customers in rural areas have used large, unsightly satellite dishes to receive television programming. The cost, size and complexity of these systems has limited their appeal. Hughes has now launched two geosynchronous satellites that use higher powered transmitters to send streams of compressed digital data to 18 inch antennas that can be mounted inauspiciously. A specialized video processor decompresses the signal and displays it on the consumer’s television with better-thanbroadcast quality audio and video. The programming offered inchrdes a number of cable-like television broadcast services, music and scores of offerings of pay-per-view movies, sports and special events. The low cost and very high quality of the system have created a demand for receivers that significantly outstrips the current supply. Consumer frustration with cable television companies has added to the demand.
