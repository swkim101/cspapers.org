This paper describes a primitive intelligent system that analyzes and understands simple cartoon films of a dynamic mini-world; each film contains a dynamic line image in which an actor, a personified frog named Besi, and objects such as a tree or a rock exist. The first goal of our research is to give the machine vision system the capability of understanding what the frog is doing or meanings of its actions.
