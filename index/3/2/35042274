We discuss the concept of relevance criteria in the context of e-Commerce search. A vast body of research literature describes the beyond-topical criteria used to determine the relevance of the document to the need. We argue that in an e-Commerce scenario there are some differences, and novel and different criteria can be used to determine relevance. We experimentally validate this hypothesis by means of Amazon Mechanical Turk using a crowdsourcing approach.
