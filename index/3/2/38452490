This paper considers 2D contact arrangements where several bodies grasp, fixture, or support an object via frictional point contacts. Within a strictly rigid body modelling paradigm, when an external wrench (i.e. force and torque) acts on the object, the reaction forces at the contacts are indeterminate and span an unbounded linear space. This paper analyzes the contact forces within a quasi-rigid body framework that keeps the desirable geometric properties of rigid body modelling, while also includes more realistic physical effects. Using two principles governing the mechanics of quasi-rigid contacts, we show that for any given external wrench acting on the object, the contact forces lie in a bounded polyhedral set. The polyhedral bound depends on the external wrench, the grasp's geometry, and the preload forces. But it does not depend on any detailed knowledge of the contact mechanics parameters. The bound is useful for "robust" grasp and fixture synthesis. Given a collection of external wrenches that may act on an object, the grasp's geometry and preload forces can be chosen such that all of these external wrenches would be automatically supported by the contacts.
