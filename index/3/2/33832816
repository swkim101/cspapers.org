RFID sensor networks comprising batteryless devices that are passively powered by RFID readers present exciting possibilities for ubiquitous computing applications. They require minimal maintenance, are cheap to manufacture and have small form factor. However, their lack of autonomy due to the need for constant power from an RFID reader hinders their deployment. We demonstrate that RFIDs augmented with ambient energy-harvesting capabilities may be used as a first-class sensor platform, allowing them to operate untethered from reader infrastructure. Specifically, we show that a CRFID-based accelerometer sensor can provide both real-time and delayed access to time-stamped sensor data when provided with a small amount of solar energy. The data is collected using a standard RFID reader and displayed in a graphical interface.
