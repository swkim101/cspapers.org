The robotic model considered hereafter is an attempt to deal with the problem of mobility for simplified holonomic mobile robots, such as Braitenberg vehicles. The aim is to find out which behavioural constraints are needed to make emerging a collective behaviour in the form of "mobility task". In our model "situatedness" and "embodiment" are defined as in the traditional behaviour-based approaches. The situated body of such a simplified robot is reach enough to be more than a merely symbol manipulating process. The model provides sensor data and effector commands with the same meaning of energy exchange between the robot and its environment, eventually populated by other robots. When a group of robots want to cooperate for a common goal it uses "stigmergy" to allow each individual to take advantage from other individual behaviours. Stigmergy detection is evaluated by the so called "macroparameters" and triggered by a dynamical assignment of "roles", which can force a collective behaviour. The concept of "perceptual perturbation" introduced in our robotic model is a useful abstract tool to figure out collective mobility tasks. This property stems from the "autopoietic loop" shown by each individual and which, under specified conditions, can interact with other ones to form one or more autopoietic loops involving two or more individuals. Collective behaviours eventually emerge as a consequence of a non-linear interaction among behaviours.
