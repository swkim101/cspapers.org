A global logical architecture for distributed databases is presented in the form of a series of logical layers which, taken together, link the user to the physical database. Associated with each layer is a schema or view of the database at the appropriate level, and (in priciple) a processor which handles inter-layer transactions. Each layer is defined in terms of its functions, which are constrained to be dependent only upon adjacent layers. An example, is presented.
