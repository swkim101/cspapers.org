Control system has been widely used in various fields. The angle error and turning angles are the main factors that affect the accuracy performance of the interfacing system. It is important to notice that these control loop parameters error cannot be eliminated from the interaction system completely. Within these possibilities, the control systemâ€™s performance and the robustness must be considered as important. The aim is to provide solutions and improve the general behavior of a control system, with a Single-Degree-of-Freedom (1DoF) Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller structure. Even after calibration, these errors still exist and will be fluctuated during the operating system running. This paper proposed a new method of finding the best position and orientation for turning to perform a specific working path based on the current accuracy capacity of the control loop system. By analyzing the system forward/inverse kinematics and the angle error sensitivity of different combination in the PID system, a new evaluation formulation is established for combined operation and performance trade-off autotuning methods for PID controllers. The accomplishment of the claimed robustness is checked. The influence of different position and orientation on the movement accuracy of the end effector has been verified by experiments and discussed thoroughly.
