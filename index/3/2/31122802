Policy driven management is widely used to manage networked resources and protect sensitive resources. Existing policy-driven management strategies rely heavily on policy administrators to specify and validate policies, which not only require in depth understanding of policy languages and domain knowledge, but also are error-prone. To simplify the tasks of policy administration, this paper proposes a novel policy administration framework, named collaborative policy administration (CPA). Essentially, the idea is that applications with similar functionalities shall have similar policies. Thus, to specify or validate policies, CPA will examine policies already specified by other applications in the same category and perform collaborative recommendation. In this paper, we consider the Android systems as a case study and show that CPA can strengthen Android security.
