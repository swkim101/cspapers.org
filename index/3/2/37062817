Support structures for highway signs and barricades include collapsible assemblies which cause the structure, upon impact by a vehicle, to rotate away from the impact without flying apart. The collapsible assemblies utilize a connector fixture to couple a first member to a second member. The connector fixture includes a pivot pin which provides an axis of rotation for the second member and shear pins which hold the second member in a fixed orientation until the application to the second member of an impact. The impact fractures one of the shear pins and the second member rotates about the pivot pin away from the impact. Single post and multiple post support structures are disclosed. A support structure having two vertical members collapses to a flattened position when struck from any direction. The vehicle passes over the flattened support structure. In an alternate embodiment, the support structure rotates upward upon impact and passes over the vehicle.
