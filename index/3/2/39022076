Server URLs including domain names, resource path, and query parameters are important to many security applications such as hidden service identification, malicious website detection, and server vulnerability fuzzing. Unlike traditional desktop web apps in which server URLs are often directly visible, the server URLs of mobile apps are often hidden, only being exposed when the corresponding app code gets executed. Therefore, it is important to automatically analyze the mobile app code to expose the server URLs and enable the security applications with them. We have thus developed SMARTGEN to feature selective symbolic execution for the purpose of automatically generate server request messages to expose the server URLs by extracting and solving user input constraints in mobile apps. Our evaluation with 5,000 top-ranked mobile apps (each with over one million installs) in Google Play shows that with SMARTGEN we are able to reveal 297,780 URLs in total for these apps. We have then submitted all of these exposed URLs to a harmful URL detection service provided by VirusTotal, which further identified 8634 URLs being harmful. Among them, Phising belong to phishing sites, 3,722 malware sites and 3,228 malicious sites (there are 387 overlapped sites between malware and malicious sites).
