PHILOSOPHY SUNY Geneseoâ€™s Computer Science Department believes that the heart of computer science is a combination of design, mathematical analysis, and empirical analysis. The emphasis is on methods of inquiry rather than topic areas [Baldwin]. Design includes the creation of specific algorithms, programs, and architectures. Mathematical analysis includes the formulation of functions describing the behavior of some phenomenon, given specified assumptions about the phenomenon. Empirical analysis includes the testing of hypotheses through scientific experiments.
