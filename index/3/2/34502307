To enhance the learning process a certain amount of hands-on experience is desirable to supplement the theory portion of computer security-related courses. This includes courses in information assurance, database security, computer security and computer forensics, among others. Many classrooms designed for teaching computer programming have personal computers for use by each student. Some universities have dedicated laboratories. These labs and classrooms can be expensive to maintain and upgrade and this may be done by a separate IT department. There are budget constraints and political issues that must be addressed between the school, faculty and university administration. Because of these constraints, many schools and universities may be lacking in their lab resources for teaching computer security. This situation could be improved in many cases with little financial investment. This presentation is based on sharing the experience of professors that are currently teaching these courses to graduate and undergraduate students. These professors will present ideas on specific hardware and software that can be used to develop a computer security lab or to enhance a classroom environment, with an emphasis on free and open source software, operating systems and the use of virtual machines.
