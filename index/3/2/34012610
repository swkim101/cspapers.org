The College Board's CS Principles (CSP) Project is an effort to develop a language-neutral, breadth-first advanced placement (AP) course in computer science. MobileCSP is an NSF-funded effort to train high school teachers to teach a CSP course that engages students in building mobile apps with App Inventor. The workshop will provide an overview of MobileCSP training including a hands-on introduction to App Inventor and a representative sample of CSP-based lesson plans, assessment materials, and other resources. MobileCSP training will be available for free to all high school teachers in summer 2014 through an online course. Attendees will be provided information about getting involved in the summer 2014 training. Target audience: high school teachers. Laptop required.
