An elongated tool handle has a solid wood shaft member and a molded, tool holding section molded directly to the wood at the tool end portion of the shaft member. The tool holding section is composed of a high impact material which is effective to secure a tool in place on the tool holding section. The tool holding section includes a volumetric mass of high impact material which gives off an amount of heat in its molten condition effective to drive moisture out of kiln dried wood. The wood of the shaft member has an amount of moisture sufficient to maintain the natural handle strength characteristics of the wood with the tool holding end section molded directly thereto. When the tool having an eye for the reception of the handle is placed over the molded, tool holding section, a slight outward expansion occurs in the material behind the tool head. A novel method is required to produce the tool handle with a molded tool holding section molded directly to a wood shaft.
