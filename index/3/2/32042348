This paper presents several techniques for performing automatic coreference annotation and performance results for each of them. To demonstrate that they can be applied to real-world data, we have built a simple question-answering system which uses the techniques. A system using coreference is compared to a baseline system with the result that the addition of the coreference annotation improves performance.
