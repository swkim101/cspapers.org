In this paper we describe our work on enabling dynamic access control and secure management over federated data resources, such as relational or XML databases exposed to public network infrastructures via OGSA-DAI middleware. We have proposed some extensions to the OGSA-DAI architecture and successfully implemented new mechanisms enabling secure communication and distributed data integrity along with fine-grain authorization and policy enforcement to minimize the complexity of the security right management. As a proof of concept some preliminary results of various performance tests of our solutions are also presented in this paper. We then analyze our achievements and describe future work and research.
