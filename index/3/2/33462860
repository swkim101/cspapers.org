This paper discusses the design of a prototype data flow machine that has memory management hardware in each memory block. This facility allows loading and deleting code that is produced by independent compilations. The first sections of the paper deal with the general architecture of the machine and the format specifications for the instruction cells, logical addresses, and switch packets. The paper concludes with a discussion of the mapping hardware used in the memory blocks. The results of a simulation study for this subsystem are also presented.
