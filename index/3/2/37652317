Consideration is given to the separation of the data and control structures of a microprogrammed processor. The use of functional memory techniques to provide a suitable medium for containing and processing the control structure and giving one possible solution to this separation problem is described. The design considered is that of an associative processor but the techniques involved are applicable to other types of processors. Some of the advantages of this approach are given, together with their implications in the light of advances in microprocessor technology and cellular logic.
