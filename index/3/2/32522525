Due to the strong job market for recipients of Bachelor of Computer Science degrees, fewer graduates are immediately continuing with post-graduate education. These individuals will experience a need for graduate education later, at a time when they are less able to attend school on a full-time basis. This will lead to an increasing demand for part-time graduate programs, especially near centers of computer technology. This paper reports the results of an informal survey of existing part-time degree-granting graduate programs in computer science. Topics discussed include program format, student enrollment, source of faculty, and characteristics of students.
