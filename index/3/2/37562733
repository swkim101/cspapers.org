A graduate program leading to the Master of Computer Science degree is described. It is a terminal degree intended to provide advanced training for computer science professionals, particularly those whose original training was in areas other than computer science. The paper starts by comparing this type of program to master's programs at other schools. The potential audience for a program of this type is described. The actual program at Wichita State University is explained and four sample student schedules are given.
