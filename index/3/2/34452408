Reuse is about more than sharing code. As technology, standards and ideas evolve: so do the artifacts available for reuse. Our understanding of the non-technical issues associated with reuse also progresses. This panel will look at reuse from 5 different perspectives. We will look at the reuse of design patterns and of services in a service-based, distributed architecture as examples of artifacts relatively new to the corporate world. We will also focus on the psychological factors affecting the success of reuse programs along with organizational modifications and measurement techniques that will help make reuse work. Lastly, we will take a look at how certain kinds of reuse can affect the success of a project at the user level, and what this might imply for measuring the effectiveness of our reuse programs. The audience will leave with some concrete ideas about how to implement and measure reuse program as well as new thoughts on what artifacts may be reused.
