Can having a mentor influence the likelihood that a woman will succeed in establishing a career in computer science? A number of studies and reports suggest that an effective mentoring relationship can, indeed, make a difference in attracting women to academic and industrial careers in computer science and then keeping them in the field. For example, in the report â€œBecoming a Computer Scientist (Pearl, et al, 1990), the shortage of female mentors and role models is identified as one of four major areas of generaI concern for attracting and keeping women in computer science fields.
