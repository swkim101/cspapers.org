During the last decade enrollments in computer science courses have increased dramatically. Classes are very large and faculty members are nearly impossible to recruit. The “seller's” job market has contributed to both of these problems and universities must deal with the problems of too many students and too many majors.
 The panelists have been asked to address the following questions:
 1) How large should classes be at the upper and lower levels?
 2) Does everyone have a birthright to be a computer scientist?
 3) Are there reasonable ways to limit enrollments?
 4) Are we pleased with the quality of the average undergraduate computer science graduate?
 5) Have academic standards declined because of large enrollments?
 Although the panelists do not have solutions to all of these problems we feel that it is important to identify them and discuss what sorts of alternatives have been tired. It is expected that about one-half of the session's time will be devoted to audience interaction.
