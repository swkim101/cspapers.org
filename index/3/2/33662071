In laparoscopic surgery the surgeon keeps control by handling patientâ€™s tissues inside an insufflated cavity with an external fulcrum point for instrumentation. It changes drastically in robotic surgery, with the surgeon taking place in a virtual environment outside the operative field, with a distant and indirect control. SAGES defines robotic surgery as a surgical procedure that adds a computer technology enhancement interface to the interaction between the surgeon and his patient during a surgical operation and assumes some degree of control heretofore completely reserved for the surgeon.
