Over the past several years the Curriculum Committee on Computer Science (C3S) of the Association for Computing Machinery has been preparing updates and revisions for “Curriculum '68'”. This has resulted in a number of surveys, and the preparation of three major interim reports.
 A series of topics is presented which represents the curriculum in the first two years. These topics fall in the general areas of (1) Programming Topics, (2) Software Organization, (3) Hardware Organization, and (4) Data Structures and File Processing.
