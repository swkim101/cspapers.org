In this paper, we present the implementation of an OFDM system based on the TMS320C6416 DSP. Methods for synchronization and channel estimation are shortly described. Structure of the used DSP board, and the interface between host and target are reviewed. Protocols for implementing a whole real time system are introduced. Synchronization results and received signal obtained by the DSP are visualized to verify the implemented system.
