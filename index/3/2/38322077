Designing MOS/LSI devices can be, and in many cases is a complex, tedious task; one that is frustrating because sources of errors can be great and means of overcoming them are limited. When one considers the magnitude of the job, the finished size of the device, and the packing density of the elements, it becomes a challenging undertaking for the most capable of designers.
 Consider what must be accomplished in many of these complex devices. The number of gates is counted in thousands; the interconnections provide a network maze to lose many a tracer. All this is on a chip of 175 × 200 mils - less than two-tenths of an inch. The required spacing between elements must be, in many cases, less than three ten-thousands of an inch.
 Even with drawings made at 400 times size, this spacing distance is less than an eighth of an inch. The 175 × 200 mil chip at 400 to 1 becomes a drawing 70 × 80 inches. On this large drawing, signal lines are generally drawn 1/8 inch wide. Transistor gates are .25 × .30 inches. If the device is a random access or read only memory, or a shift register, the drawing is a collection of repetitive patterns in the center portion, with control logic around the periphery. On the other hand, if the device is a computer or a one chip calculator, then there is a minimum of repetitive logic. It is to this design that computer aids are most needed. The programs described here can be used on designs with repetitive cells equally as well as on the random logic designs.
