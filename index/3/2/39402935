This paper describes a lightweight, modular and energy efficient robotic vehicle platform designed for broadacre agriculture - the Small Robotic Farm Vehicle (SRFV). The current trend in farming is towards increasingly large machines that optimise the individual farmer’s productivity. Instead, the SRFV is designed to promote the sustainable intensification of agriculture by allowing farmers to concentrate on more important farm management tasks. The robot has been designed with a user-centred approach which focuses the outcomes of the project on the needs of the key project stakeholders. In this way user and environmental considerations for broadacre farming have informed the vehicle platform configuration, locomotion, power requirements and chassis construction. The resultant design is a lightweight, modular four-wheeled differential steer vehicle incorporating custom twin in-hub electric drives with emergency brakes. The vehicle is designed for a balance between low soil impact, stability, energy efficiency and traction. The paper includes modelling of the robot’s dynamics during an emergency brake in order to determine the potential for tipping. The vehicle is powered by a selection of energy sources including rechargeable lithium batteries and petrol-electric generators.
