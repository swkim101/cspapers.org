We report the numerical and experimental studies of a spectrally filtered fiber-based optical limiter at 170 Gbit/s. The device, including less than 1 km-long of highly nonlinear optical fiber and a 3 nm-width filter, exhibits good performance at an average input power of 14.5 dBm. No power penalty has been observed and a strong robustness against optical noise has been demonstrated.
