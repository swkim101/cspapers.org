This paper describes two case studies of motion planning that uses a space called Perceptual Control Surface (PCS) introduced previously as a basis for visually controlling a robot manipulator. The motion planning problems discussed here are limited to dynamic robot hand positioning for interception tasks. Using this approach, a motion planning problem can be regarded as finding a path in robot's PCS which satisfies certain criteria. Qualitatively different tasks correspond to different type of paths in the PCS. These correspondences are discussed and techniques to find these different paths are outlined.<<ETX>>
