The purpose of this paper is to propose a new impedance control concept for elastic joint robots with programmable passive impedance devices in the transmission. The concept allows us to use the same index both for free motion and for contact task. We apply it to a one-DOF elastic joint robot and derive an adjustment law for the robot. The numerical simulations show that implementation of the concept can be realized without any dynamic models.
