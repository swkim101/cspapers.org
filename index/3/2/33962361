Automatic determination of proper neural network topology by trimming over-sized networks is an important area of study, which has previously been addressed using a variety of techniques. In this paper, we present Information Measure Based Skeletonisation (IMBS), a new approach to this problem where superfluous hidden units are removed based on their information measure (IM). This measure, borrowed from decision tree induction techniques, reflects the degree to which the hyperplane formed by a hidden unit discriminates between training data classes. We show the results of applying IMBS to three classification tasks and demonstrate that it removes a substantial number of hidden units without significantly affecting network performance.
