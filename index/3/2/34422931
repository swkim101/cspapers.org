The Olin Experimental Classroom at Case Western Reserve University provides a laboratory-like environment in which instructors can assess the results of trying out different teaching methods, techniques, etc. From a hasty look at three of the essential hardware components of this facility as shown in Figure 1 - keyset response units for each student, a process-control computer which scans the response units, and a display for the instructor - one could easily conclude that the Olin Experimental Classroom is simply another “student response system” or “wired classroom”. In fact, the differences between the traditional student response systems and the Olin Experimental Classroom begin with the very purposes for which these facilities are intended, and the differences extend to every aspect of t h e i r respective operation.
