Sites such as GitHub have created a vast collection of software artifacts that researchers interested in understanding and improving software systems can use. Current tools for processing such GitHub data tend to target project metadata and avoid source code processing, or process source code in a manner that requires significant effort for each language supported. This paper presents GitcProc, a lightweight tool based on regular expressions and source code blocks, which downloads projects and extracts their project history, including fine-grained source code information and development time bug fixes. GitcProc can track changes to both single-line and block source code structures and associate these changes to the surrounding function context with minimal set up required from users. We demonstrate GitcProc's ability to capture changes in multiple languages by evaluating it on C, C++, Java, and Python projects, and show it finds bug fixes and the context of source code changes effectively with few false positives.
