This session describes an NSF-funded initiative 3,4 to introduce underrepresented students to the numerous and varied career opportunities in the computing sciences, and prepare them to succeed in college degree programs as well as prepare their teachers to be effective in the computer science class room. The initiative involves the design, development, implementation and evaluation of curricula for teaching computer science in high schools that will prepare students to succeed in taking and completing the AP Computer Science course and exam. The three presentations include: 1) An overview of the CyberTech-ITEST program along with the many challenges of implementation in ten different high schools without being a regularly scheduled course, 2) CyberTech I (Principles of Computing): An online introductory course for second-semester sophomores including curriculum, delivery issues and student attitudes survey, and 3) CyberTech II: An on-campus June-based intense introduction to computer programming using Visual Basic.NET as the object-oriented language to prepare students for AP Computer Science (using Java as the programming language).
