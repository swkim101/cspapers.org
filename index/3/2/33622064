The motor impaired people have much limit in moving. The devices augmenting their mobility will be much helpful for improving their living experiences. This poster develops a brain-controlled assistive system, called FlyingBuddy2, to aid the handicapped in mobility. It uses the brain EEG signals to directly control a quadrotor. Signals from an EEG headset are transmitted wirelessly to a computer, then the decoded brain signals are converted to trigger the quadrotor to move in 3D space. Three applications are developed: thinking to play games, thinking to see, and thinking to take pictures.
