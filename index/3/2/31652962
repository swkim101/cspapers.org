The course and project description for a one quarter (or semester) senior level course in evaluation and measurement techniques for computer systems is described. The primary purpose of the course is to introduce the students to evaluation and measurement techniques and to use some of these techniques in evaluating and measuring the performance of a multiprogramming operating system designed for a simple machine. The project is based on the availability of a simple multiprogramming operating system that can be modified by students to perform evaluation and measurement experiments. Five experiments are described in the paper. If a simple multiprogramming operating system is not available then the project may be omitted.
