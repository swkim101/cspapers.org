The purpose of this poster is to introduce a dialectical theory for plan synthesis based on a multiagent approach. This approach is a promising way to devise systems able to take into account partial knowledge and heterogeneous skills of agents. We propose to consider the planning problem as a defeasible reasoning where agents exchange proposals and counter-proposals and are able to conjecture i.e., formulate plan steps based on hypothetical states of the world.
