In this paper, we describe our experience in the Jazz project, beginning from a "Classical" repository- and Java-centric design and evolving towards an architecture which borrows heavily from the architecture of the Web. Along the way, we formed an open community to collaborate on adapting this architecture to various tool domains. Finally, we discuss our experience delivering the first generation of tools built and integrated using these techniques.
