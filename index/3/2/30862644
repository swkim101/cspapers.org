Flexible manipulator enables curvilinear accessibility through small incisions or natural orifices for minimally invasive surgery and diagnosis, which makes it a good choice for minimally invasive surgery. In order to control the robot precisely and safely, the real-time position and shape information of the robot need to be measured well. In this paper, we propose a magnetic tracking based tip pose and shape detection method for wire driven flexible robots. A permanent magnet is mounted at the distal end of the robot. Its magnetic field can be sensed with a sensor array. Therefore, position and orientation of the tip can be estimated utilizing the tracking method. A shape sensing algorithm is then carried out to estimate the real-time shape based on the tip pose. With the tip pose and shape display in the reconstructed visual environment, navigation can be achieved. This method provides the advantages that no sensors are needed to mount on the robot and has no line-of-sight problem. Experimental results verified the feasibility of the proposed method. A navigation error of 1.9mm is achieved.
