Refresh operations consume substantial energy and bandwidth in high-density DRAM memory. To cope with this issue, Fine-Grained Refresh (FGR) is recently proposed to eliminate unnecessary refresh operations caused by minor weak cells. Even JEDEC's DDR4 DRAM specification announces the support of FGR to make DRAM refresh more scalable. Unfortunately, we observe that the effectiveness of FGR is greatly confined by the procedure of refresh-oblivious device integration because all memory devices within a module have to be controlled and refreshed in a lockstep way after the step of assembly. In this work, we firstly propose to intelligently integrate the "compatible" devices through a pre-assembly testing and retention-aware matching method. Second, we reuse the reconfiguration structure from yield-oriented remapping mechanism in memory chips and propose Microfix to create a balanced distribution of retention time in memory banks through fine-grained row-address tuning. With this optimization architecture, RADAR, we can eliminate the refresh overhead of produced memory modules by 28% on average.
