This paper presents a summary of findings and some conclusions of a teleprocessing in higher education study conducted by the University of Vermont. The 1971 study, funded by the National Science Foundation, was to shed light on the future of computing networks in higher education. A copy of the complete report is available from Richard deGrasse, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont.
 Forecasting the future in a changing environment, like educational teleprocessing, is risky business. Unless educators want to turn over to AT & T, the FCC and computer industry marketing the entire responsibility for defining future educational computing systems, we must begin to figure out where we are going and what kinds of systems we will need. This is a tall order and because of the nature of higher education, it may be unachievable. We need better, more responsive hardware and software systems; certainly a more sympathetic common carrier and FCC. It is very safe to say the computer-communications industry has a more accurate forecast of what our needs will be five years from now than we do. To prove it they are committing a lot of money based on their forecasts. Some of the projections made in the study will be debatable; that's good. Let's begin the debateâ€”it can only help the future of computing in higher education.
