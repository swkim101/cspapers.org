The realization of a new protocol is a long and complicated procedure whose inherent technical difficulty is exacerbated by the scarcity of useful tools. This paper discusses the initial use of a system that is being developed by Bell Communication Research to help in the specification, analysis, and implementation of communications protocols. This paper describes the application of this system to the specification and implementation of an industry standard protocol.
