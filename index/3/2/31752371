The widespread use of online social networks provides a particularly compelling domain for introducing computer science techniques and concepts to undergraduate students. As part of the HarambeeNet project, I developed a new course on the Science of Networks that explores the interconnectivity of social, technological, and natural entities. Students in the course learn fundamental techniques from graph and game theory to analyze network structure and behavior. Material for the course was developed and refined through a survey of exemplar courses, workshops, and faculty learning communities all focused on network science. The poster describes the course framework, provides some example assignment and lecture material, and presents some lessons learned.
