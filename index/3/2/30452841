We propose a decision-theoretic notion of invariance in bounded rational decision making. We show how optimal decision making in sensory robotics can be approximately preserved under transformations of the decision rule. In particular, we present a decision theoretic analysis of the use of visual routines in action arbitration in real-time robot soccer. In this domain, stochastic dominance, and therefore decisions, can be sensed approximately from the environment, and we exploit this in our decision making.
