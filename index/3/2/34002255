The panel’s challenge to the audience: We claim that understanding of different user groups’ information seeking behavior, values, motivations, desires, and expectations should influence information system design, specifically, should enable the tailoring of information systems better to each group’s needs. The panelists will each present specific examples where user research on a particular group or class of people can be or has been directly applied to information system design for that group.
