The human visual system can interpret two dimensional (2-D) line drawings like the Necker cube as three dimensional (3-D) wire frames. We focus attention on a principle to minimize the entropy of angle distribution between line segments in a 3-D wire frame as a concrete definition of the law of pragnanz in Gestalt Psychology. And we implement the principle with the perceptual preference of planarity to the loops of wire frames using a genetic algorithm. Experimental results show the good coincidence with human perception.
