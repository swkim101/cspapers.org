The goal of this project was to design a site that would make the online process of joining the Columbia House Music or DVD club faster and easier. Faced with low conversion rates from online advertising, our challenge was to quickly solve the main problems with the existing join process, which were identified through user testing and site data logs.In response we designed a separate mini-site that reduced the entire process to 3 steps (and as many pages). The Club-based ecommerce experience is unique: the number of products a user selects is fixed, allowing us to implement a unique and transparent interaction model for the shopping cart design.The project was extremely successful. Conversion rates increased 180%. The design work for this project then set direction for subsequent visual and interface design projects for Columbiahouse.com.
