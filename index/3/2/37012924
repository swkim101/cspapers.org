This paper addresses the issues of developing fault tolerant control system for telerobotic systems in operational space. First, the characteristics of operational faults and the relevant sensor signals are studied and classified. Secondly, the framework for FDI and the associated supervisory control scheme are proposed to effectively integrate the FDI approaches into telerobotic systems.
