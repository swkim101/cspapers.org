We propose a novel DTM scheme based on the user-perceived response time analysis, called SmartDTM. Unlike existing DTM schemes that can significantly degrade the quality of user experience, SmartDTM takes explicit account of the quality of user experience into making the DTM decisions. Our experimental results on an ODROID-XU+E board show that the proposed technique can improve the user-perceived performance by up to 37% over the Android's default DTM policy without any thermal violations.
