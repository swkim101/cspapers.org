Hands-on activities can reinforce a variety of Computer Science concepts covered in class. Active learning techniques that utilize tangible manipulatives such as LEGO or other simple objects provide unique opportunities for students to explore or reinforce topics during class in a playful setting. This kinesthetic learning approach can also provide a platform that has a low learning curve, can facilitate creative thinking, improve student engagement with content and peers while adding gamification elements to the course. Different Computer Science topics lend themselves to such activities to differing degrees and the logistics of conducting these activities in large classrooms requires careful planning and execution, especially where cost is a factor and replication is desired between classes. Some educators may have experience while others may be interested but do not know where to start. BOF attendees will hear from those who have used different types of manipulatives, applied manipulatives to different Computer Science topics, and utilized said activities in different scenarios and contexts (e.g. large vs. small classes, single student vs. team activities). The sharing of ideas, strategies, and resources, as well as potential collaborations is also central to the discussion. The audience is expected to consist of both university faculty/lecturers (especially those who teach lower division courses) and high school teachers of computer science who are interested in engaging students in course content via kinesthetic activities and tangible manipulatives.
