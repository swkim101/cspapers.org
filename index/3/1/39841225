This paper introduces a novel software visualisation aid, the EROSI (Explicit Representer Of Subprogram Invocations) tutor, hypothesised to support the acquisition (by novice programmers) of a mental model to facilitate the comprehension and use of recursion as a problem solving technique. Novices found the EROSI tutor easy to use, interesting and a valuable visualisation aid to forming correct mental models of recursive processes. Studies concluded that although novices many have a correct mental model of recursion, various errors and misconceptions (identified) due to exogenous factors affect their ability to complete recursive tasks.
