Here is the real background to the stage show created by a team of Rhizomatiks Research engineers and director/choreographer MIKIKO of ELEVENPLAY. For the live production of an entertainment show, we can rarely expect favorable conditions in an environment like a museum, cozy hall or a laboratory. Even for a live show that rallies hundreds of thousands of people or a TV program watched by more than a hundred million people, there are barriers different from those found in art and research projects---e.g. there is only one minute available for a conversion process or insufficient time for rehearsals. Therefore, there is still a very limited number of cases in which a risky system is adopted, using real-time image analyses and/or image processing. In most productions, a performer moves, adjusting to the pre-rendered images. The topics to be covered in this lecture include how the producer realizes an ideal world based on such conditions as the size of a venue or the available time for setting up, how to use image recognition, image processing techniques, control techniques, and data analysis techniques at a huge arena for a live performance or on a live broadcast program, while actual software and data used in the production process are introduced.
