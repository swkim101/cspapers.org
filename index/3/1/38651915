We propose a fast, parallel maximum clique algorithm for large sparse graphs that is designed to exploit characteristics of social and information networks. Despite clique's status as an NP-hard problem with poor approximation guarantees, our method exhibits nearly linear runtime scaling over real-world networks ranging from 1000 to 100 million nodes. In a test on a social network with 1.8 billion edges, the algorithm finds the largest clique in about 20 minutes. Key to the efficiency of our algorithm are an initial heuristic procedure that finds a large clique quickly and a parallelized branch and bound strategy with aggressive pruning and ordering techniques. We use the algorithm to compute the largest temporal strong components of temporal contact networks.
