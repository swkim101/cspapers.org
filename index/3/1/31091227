Software inter-failure time series analysis has always been a question mark for the reliability engineers. Many models have been proposed since the problem of reliability discovers, but none of them produces adequate results. This study presents a neural network perspective of modeling inter-failure time of software. We compare different parametric models of software reliability with our proposed neural network model and found the proposed more suitable.
