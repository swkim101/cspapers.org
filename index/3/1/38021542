The work is founded on a comprehensive database model which provides various user languages and supports different "views" of the data. The low-level database structure is based on the n-ary relational model. 
 
A special-purpose processor is described which can directly perform the relational primitive operations. 
 
Novel algorithms for these operations are outlined.
