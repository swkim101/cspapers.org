This paper presents an approach to introducing multiple programming language paradigms in the CS I course through the use of a single multiparadigm language. The approach uses multiple paradigms in the design and implementation of solutions to computer projects. The paper illustrates the approach by outlining a solution to a sample project which utilizes the imperative, object-oriented, and the functional paradigms.
