In this work, we present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton ( eFSA ), which takes advantage of the event-driven nature of control programs in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. eFSA provides new detection capabilities to detect data-oriented attacks in CPS control programs, including attacks on control intensity (i.e., hijacked for/while-loops) and attacks on control branch (i.e., conditional branches). We implement a prototype of our approach on Raspberry Pi and evaluate eFSA 's performance by conducting CPS case studies. Results show that it is able to effectively detect different CPS attacks in our experiments.
