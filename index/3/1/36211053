A polished version of “Computers and Programming” of ACM Curriculum 68 is presented. The central theme here is the design philosophy of the course. The approach is (1) historical, in that it quickly draws an idealized picture of the history of computers and programming. It is (2) generalistic, in that it teaches various sides of the subject, including advanced software engineering ideas, in parallel in a balanced manner. Finally, it is (3) complementary, in that it takes into account the fact that a conventional Fortran course, corresponding to “Introduction to Computing” of Curriculum 68, is being taught simultaneously by another instructor.
