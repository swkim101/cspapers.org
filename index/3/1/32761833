A die is unpackaged from a Chip on Tape by grinding off molding compound from an upper surface of the COT until the COT's leads are evenly exposed across the upper surface, selectively etching out the leads using the remaining molding compound as a mask, removing an underlying layer of gold plating, and then removing the remaining molding compound. The unpacked die can then be reframed with new leads and molding compound for failure analysis and electrical failure verification.
