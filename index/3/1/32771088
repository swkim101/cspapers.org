A utility connection bar (30) dimensioned to extend between a gas supply line (42) and a customer gas line (44) of a conventional gas connection (41) is formed of molded plastic and has a bar (36) extending between threaded ends (32) and (34). The plastic bar (36) and the ends (32) and (34) have a plurality of channels (38) which extend the length of the connection bar. A pair of 1/4 inch diameter holes (40) extend through the plastic bar (36) near the threaded ends (32) and (34). The combination of the channels (38) and the holes (40) makes it very difficult to form a gas flow path between the threaded ends (32) and (34) without altering the external appearance of the connection bar (30). In a utility connection bar (70), channels (86, 92) extend vertically between bottom (88) and top (90) of plastic bar (72).
