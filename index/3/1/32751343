It is happening. The fragmentation in the building industry is beginning to congeal. The mobile home industry has grown from 60,000 units per year in 1947 to over 400,000 units per year in 1970. National Homes Corporation produced 28,000 houses in 1970, a bad year in building. Levitt Technology is building an automated plant to produce houses. The concept of the house as a product of industrialized processes is a reality.
 I am concerned about the effect of this process on the future texture of our residential environment. The process and its economies are efficient but not a justification for the types of solutions that are beginning to appear.
