We propose a convolutional neural network model for text-based speaker identiﬁcation on multiparty dialogues extracted from the TV show, Friends . While most previous works on this task rely heavily on acoustic features, our approach attempts to identify speakers in dialogues using their speech patterns as captured by transcriptions to the TV show. It has been shown that different individual speakers exhibit distinct idiolec-tal styles. Several convolutional neural network models are developed to discriminate between differing speech patterns. Our re-sults conﬁrm the promise of text-based approaches, with the best performing model showing an accuracy improvement of over 6% upon the baseline CNN model.
