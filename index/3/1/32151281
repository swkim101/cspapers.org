Abstract : An algorithm for synchronizing concurrent operations on extendible hash files is presented. The algorithm is deadlock free and allows the search operations to proceed concurrently with insertion operations without having to acquire locks on the directory entires or the data pages. It also allows concurrent insertion/deletion operations to proceed without having to acquire locks on the directory entries. The algorithm is also unique in that it combines the notion of verification, fundamental to the optimistic concurrency control algorithm, presented. (Author)
