Adaptive cable-driven parallel robots can adjust the position of one or more pulley blocks to optimize performance within a given workspace. Because of their augmented kinematic redundancy, adaptive systems have several advantages over their traditional counterparts featuring the same numbers of cables. In this paper, we explore the application of adaptive cable-driven robots to cable-suspended camera systems. Performance of the traditional and of the adaptive designs are analyzed, using dexterity and stiffness as performance metrics. Results show superior performance of the adaptive design compared to the traditional system. An illustrative design problem for adaptive cable-suspended camera systems is also presented and solved.
