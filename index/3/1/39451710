St:irburst is an extensible relational database system prototype dc>clopcd at lll\I’s Alrnadcn Research Center. ‘I”hc goal tlu-oughout its dct-clopmcnt has been to build a complete relational database system kernel, engineered throughout with the infrastructure for generic extensions, rather than specific extensions for a single applicxition area not previously supportable by relational technology. Grrcntly, Starburst consists of over 300,000 Iincs of C (and sotne C+ + ) source code, and cxccutcs an extended form of the SQL D;ita Definition [ anguagc and the SQL SliI, IIC’f, lXSERI, and DELETE commands, including joins on any number of tables. \Ve demonstrate it on IIl\l’s first RISCtcchnology lvorkstatioo, the 1{1 PC, under the AIX ~pcrating s}stcm (based on ~rli~ J’]).
