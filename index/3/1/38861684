This workshop is for high school and college teachers of general-interest ("CS 0") computer science courses. It presents the programming environment used in two of the five initial AP CS Principles pilot courses. Snap! (Build Your Own Blocks) is a free, graphical, drag-and-drop extension to the Scratch programming language. Scratch, designed for 8-14 year olds, models programs as "scripts" without names, arguments, or return values. Snap! supports older learners (14-20) by adding named procedures (thus recursion), procedures as data (thus higher order functions) structured lists, and sprites as first class objects with inheritance.
 Participants will learn Snap! through discussion, programming exercises, and exploration. See http://snap.berkeley.edu for details. Laptop required.
