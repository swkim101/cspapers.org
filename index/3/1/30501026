In this study thin films of poly-N epoxipropylcarbazole (PEPC) doped by anthracene (An) were deposited over the surface of nickel (Ni) substrate at the gravity condition of 277g (where g = 9.81 m2/sec). The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the fabricated devices (Ga/PEPC/Ni) were determined at different ambient temperature environment ranging from 30 degC to 60 degC. From the conductivity versus temperature response of the devices derived from their I-V characteristics, it is observed that devices follow three dimension variable range hopping phenomena for their charge transport mechanism. By applying variable range hopping charge transport model, hopping conduction parameters of organic semiconductor material are estimated. From the results of these estimations, the dependence of electrical properties of the devices as a function of temperature is evaluated and discussed
