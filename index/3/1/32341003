The Red Brick WarehouseTMis a commercial Relational Database Management System designed specifically for query, decision support, and data warehouse applications. Red Brick Warehouse is a software-only system providing ANSI SQL support in an open cliendserver environment. Red Brick Warehouse is distinguished from traditional RDBMS products by an architecture optimized to deliver high performance in read-mostly, high-intensity query applications. In these applications, the workload is heavily biased toward complex SQL SELECT operations that read but do not update the database. The average unit of work is very large, and typically involves multi-table joins, aggregation, duplicate elimination, and sorting. Multi-user concurrency is moderate, with typical systems supporting 50 to 500 concurrent user sessions. Query databases are often very large, with tables ranging from 100 million to many billion rows and occupying 50 Gigabytes to 2 Terabytes, Databases are populated by massive bulk-load operations on an hourly, daily, or weekly cycle. Time-series and historical data are maintained for months or years. Red Brick Warehouse makes use of parallel processing as well as other specialized algorithms to achieve outstanding performance and scalability on cost-effective hardware platforms.
