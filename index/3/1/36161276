One can identify two important developments in software architecture, i.e. software product lines and software architecture design. This tutorial addresses these topics by presenting an method for architectural design explicitly focusing on assessment of and transformation for quality attributes. In addition, the notion of software product lines and the process, technology, business and organizational issues of adopting the approach are presented. Both design and product-lines are extensively illustrated by examples and experiences from numerous industrial cases. The tutorial is based on a recently published book [2] authored by the tutorial presenter and published by Addison-Wesley and ACM Press.
