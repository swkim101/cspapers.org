Micro Energy Efficiency System (MEES) provides energy saving while enabling each individual office in a large building to control heating, cooling, and electricity with its own policy. The usage of a decentralized independent control of each office, rather than a centralized one, is common in Korea. MEES provides measuring and controlling points at multiple granularities. An installation became easy and efficient using QR code, and the user configuration through an energy web portal further enhances the energy efficiency.
