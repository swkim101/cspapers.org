This poster reports upon the ongoing efforts being made to establish TREC-like and other comprehensive evaluation paradigms within the Music IR (MIR) and Music Digital Library (MDL) research communities. The proposed research tasks are based upon expert opinion garnered from members of the Information Retrieval (IR), MDL and MIR communities with regard to the construction and implementation of scientifically valid evaluation frameworks.
