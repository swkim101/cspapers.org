The synergy between language sciences and language technology has been an elusive one for the computational linguistics community, especially when dealing with a language other than English. The reasons are two-fold: the lack of an accessible comprehensive and robust account of a specific language so as to allow strategic linking between a processing task to linguistic devices, and the lack of successful computational studies taking advantage of such links. With a fast growing number of available online resources, as well as a rapidly increasing number of members of the CL community who are interested in and/or working on Chinese language processing, the time is ripe to take a serious look at how knowledge of Chinese can help Chinese language processing.
