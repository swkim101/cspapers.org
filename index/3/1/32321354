The shortage of human resources on the International Space Station (ISS) is becoming a serious problem. To tackle this problem, smart robot systems that support human activities in space should be developed. In this paper, a new space robot system named "Intra-Vehicular Free-Flyer System (IVFFS)" is proposed. The IVFFS supports not only non-contact but also contact tasks during intra-vehicular activities (IVA). To accomplish such requirements, we introduce a prototype model called "Space Humming Bird" (SHB) which has a variably structured body to satisfy both safety and dexterity requirements. Furthermore, several SHBs can be combined to achieve more complicated tasks. To confirm the feasibility of our concept, a CG simulator is developed. In addition, several operator support techniques are incorporated into the tele-operation system.
