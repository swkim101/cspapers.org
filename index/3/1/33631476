In the spring of 2005 our department offered a new course entitled “Intelligent Systems” (IS). This course, which will be required for future CS majors, provides an introduction to a number of AI topics including predicate logic, frames, rule-based systems, neural networks, Bayesian networks, decision trees, and fuzzy logic. The theme of agents is woven throughout the course. Each section of the course employs a different simulation tool or language so that students can apply and experiment with the techniques they learn about in the classroom. The culminating project for the course was a two week project where students were given a basic Lego MINDSTORMS robot to experiment with. Their task was to program the robot for a race to be held on the final day of class.
