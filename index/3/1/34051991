A 20/20 vision in ophthalmology implies a perfect view of things that are in front of you. The term is also used to mean a perfect sight of the things to come. Here we focus on a speculative vision of the VLDB in the year 2020. This panel is the follow-up of the one I organised (with S. Navathe) at the Kyoto VLDB in 1986, with the title: "Anyone for a VLDB in the Year 2000?". In that panel, the members discussed the major advances made in the database area and conjectured on its future, following a concern of many researchers that the database area was running out of interesting research topics and therefore it might disappear into other research topics, such as software engineering, operating systems and distributed systems. That did not happen.
