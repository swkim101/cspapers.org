Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) can be used to model bodies in motion. The model might be used, for example, to illustrate a solar system. A body may be rotating on its axis, the axis may be tilting with the seasons, and the body may have a satellite to form a system. A system, e.g., a body and its satellite, may then be rotating around a sun according to an elliptical orbit. The elliptical orbits for satellites and systems alike can be calculated easily using a spreadsheet.This paper will take the reader through the steps to show orbiting, rotating, and tilting bodies including how to create the objects, visually show the paths of the orbits, and set the time length for rotations, tilting of axes, and orbits for bodies. In addition, an explanation is given on how to create satellites of orbiting bodies and run the whole system continuously. The procedure for examining the model from various distances and angles during the animation is dependent on the VRML plug-in being used. Methods for creating the x, y and z coordinates of orbits using trigonometric functions and the timing for placement of objects are also explained.
