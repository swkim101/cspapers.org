A 12-channel 120Gb/s laser diode driver array has been designed in 0.18μm CMOS technology. Under a supply voltage of 1.8V, simulated results show that a single channel has a speed of 10Gb/s at a power consumption of 98mW. A total capacity of 120 Gb/s can be obtained from 12 channels. With three stages of differential amplifiers directly coupled, the single channel amplifier can supply the current up to 26mA adopting negative feedback and capacitive coupled current amplifier (C3A) structure. The adjustable modulation current from 1mA to 16mA and the bias current up to 10mA can be generated from this driver circuit. The layout area of the driver array is 3205μm×506μm. This design can be used in high speed optical chips.
