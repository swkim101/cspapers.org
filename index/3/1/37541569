Data Structures is one of the fundamental computing courses but also among those with the highest rate of drops and failures. Its importance for a timely completion of Computer Science college programs implies the need of employing innovative instructional methods and technologies to improve student engagement and performance. This poster presents an instructional method that leverages strategies from both flipped learning and gamification. The flipped classroom has been shown to effectively support active learning activities. Moreover, flipping a Data Structures classroom allows introducing programming labs in class, which is not typical for the standard way of teaching the course. However, the success of flipped learning depends crucially on the proper engagement of students in and outside of class. Here gamification can help. Gamification, defined as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts, has shown promises in shaping user behavior in desirable directions, which can be used to increase students' motivation and engagement in the learning process. The poster describes a gamified flipped learning approach and the author's experience and findings in using it in a Data Structures course at a minority university. In the proposed method, the in-class work features group problem solving and pair-programming labs. The employed gamification elements include accruing points, virtual currency, rapid feedback, unlocking content, freedom to fail, and social engagement. The measures used in assessing the effectiveness of the proposed approach include students' grades, information about class attendance and submission of lab assignments, and an attitudinal survey.
