The dual role of edges as boundaries and as periodic groupings is supported by human experimental findings". A relaxation model (Zucker, et al., 1975) based on line detectors can underlie both mechanisms. The existence of these edge operators (Mubel and Wiesel, 1962) and parallel interactions has strong neurophysiological support.
