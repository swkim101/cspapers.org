The Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science (CS) A Development Committee is replacing the large case study (GridWorld) with a hands-on structured lab component with the following characteristics: At least three labs explore computing in context at a significant level, building upon supplied code that provides examples of good style and appropriate use of programming language constructs. -- Each lab contains a significant problem-solving component in which students study alternative approaches for solving a problem, solve new problems, or modify existing code to solve altered problem. -- At least one lab provides students with experience working with programs involving multiple interactive classes and may involve decomposing a program into classes and using inheritance, interfaces, and other object-oriented concepts as identified in the AP Computer Science A topic outline. -- Collectively, lab experiences will cover at least 80% of the topics listed in the course description and will involve at least 20 hours of class time. In investigating the use of labs, the AP CS A program developed three labs that cover many introductory topics and may be used at various times throughout a course. Since these labs cover many basic concepts and perspectives, the labs are appropriate for both AP CS A courses and many college CS1 courses. This workshop will introduce teachers to the AP CS A lab materials and provide practical experience in using these materials within introductory courses.
