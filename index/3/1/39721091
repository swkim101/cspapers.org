The Y2K problem or the Millennium Bug represents the single largest problem ever faced by the computing community and, according to some pundits, the largest problem ever to be solved by humankind. Due to widespread media coverage, students at all levels are aware of the Y2K problem and have concerns about what it means for them and for their futures. We as teachers of computing and software engineering have a unique opportunity to address this problem in the classroom and to use it as an example of the long-term consequences of decisions made in good faith that can cause catastrophic results down line. The four panelists on this panel bring four different but related perspectives on how to deal with the Y2K problem in the classroom.
