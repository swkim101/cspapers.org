The purpose of this symposium is three-fold:First, by presenting a selection of our work as examples, we seek to define a model of intelligent interaction and illustrate points in the interface process where artificial intelligence can play a role.
Second, by comparing the approaches represented in our efforts, we intend to explore a fundamental philosophical difference in the field of intelligent interfaces: the distinction between the power tools vs. the intelligent assistant paradigms. (As part of this discussion, we intend to consider how to mine the rich ground that lies between these two extremes.)
Third, by examining the design process underlying our examples, we seek to provide a better understanding of the relationship between AI interface tools and the applications that they communicate with.
