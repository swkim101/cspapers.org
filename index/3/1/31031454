Springs have been employed in a wide range of mechanical systems. This work deals with the design of multi degree-of-freedom spring mechanism. The adaptable spring is desired for enhancing performances of various mechanical systems employing springs. We demonstrate that such adaptable springs can be realized by adopting anthropomorphic musculoskeletal structures of the human upper-extremity, which possesses highly nonlinear kinematic-coupling among redundant muscles existing in its structures. We propose multi-degree-of-freedom spring mechanisms resembling the musculoskeletal structure of the human upper-extremity, and verify the applicability of these mechanisms through simulation.
