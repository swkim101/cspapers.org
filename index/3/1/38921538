We are studying control knowledge for a general problem solver, named BLOCKHEAD. Currently the problem solver is based on negative heuristics, which has led to surprising efficiency in suitable domains. The lesson seems to be that it is easier to avoid being stupid than to try to be smart. Stupid plans are defined and a plan improvement method proposed. Analyses of stupid plans and failed plans suggest effective negative heuristics.
