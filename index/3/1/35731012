Providing Quality of Experience (QoE) for Web Services (WS) with minimal performance penalties is a problem that still confounds many eminent researchers in the field. The current solutions offered ignore many factors which effect QoS and the subjective nature of client requirements thereby reducing the client's QoE. The objective of this work is the design of a framework to improve QoE for the WS client. This approach is based on the application of history, environment and rating information to the selection of decomposed web services.
