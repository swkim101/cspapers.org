Room-temperature liquid metal GaIn25 (Eutectic Gallium- Indium alloy, 75% gallium and 25% indium) has distinctive properties of reversible deformation and controllable locomotion under an external electric field stimulus. Liquid metal's newly discovered properties imply great possibilities in developing new technique for interface design. In this paper, we present LIME, LIquid MEtal interfaces for non-rigid interaction. We first discuss the interaction potential of LIME interfaces. Then we introduce the development of LIME cells and the design of some LIME widgets.
