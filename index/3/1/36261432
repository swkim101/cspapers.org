The Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) protocol is always used to locate a URL of a configuration file through DHCP, DNS or some other discovery methods. WPAD is a very convenience way for the management of network administrator. However, in the meantime, it may lead to a potential compromise to our LANs. In this poster, we propose a novel attack method based on WPAD protocol which can be used by attacker to intercept traffic, sniff and propagate malwares in LAN.
