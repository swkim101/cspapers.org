The avallablhty of mexpenslve, large mam memories coupled with the demand for faster response time are brmgmg a new perspective to database technology Designers of database systems are reconsldermg the assumption that databases must reside on disk during transactlon processmg Subatantlal performance gams can be achieved by makmg a large portlon of, or the entlre database, reside m mam memory One approach 1s to use very large buffers to Improve conventional disk access methods A more radical approach 1s to view the database as part of the user’s address space m mam memory, rather than as a collection of mass-storage files This leads to the advent of Main Memory Database Systems (MMDBS’s), which exploit memory residency of the database m their schemes for physical data organlzatlon, query optnnlzatlon, concurrency control and crash recovery
