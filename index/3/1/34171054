The task of routing large multilayer printed wiring boards (most commonly back-planes) is a tedious, time-consuming and error-prone procedure if done manually. The size and general uniformity of the board plus the large number of connections makes the probability of error very high.
 To aid this process, an interactive graphics system has been built. Because of the specialized nature of the problem, it was both necessary and possible to build the program in such a way as to allow the interactive graphics terminal to be a true design station instead of just an efficient data capture station.
