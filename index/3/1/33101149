Computer science instructors are incorporating Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and MOOC material, into their campus courses. The closed instance is the dominant model being followed, in which MOOC material (e.g., in AI, in Programming Languages, in Software Engineering) is ported to a protected LMS so that campus students can use the MOOC video and other material (e.g., assessments) and infrastructure (e.g., autograders) in a "private" manner. In an embedded instance, campus students take a live MOOC as one component of their on-campus course. Another model, albeit nascent, is to exploit self-paced open online courses so that campus cohorts can move through a course when a campus instructor wants, and at a pace the instructor wants, but still availing campus students to the advantages of interacting with global students (and vice versa). The BoF session will allow participants to talk about MOOC-based blended models, form a group interested to archiving experience, synthesizing best practices, creating shared learning-object repositories (e.g., of active learning, in-class activities), and to discuss issues of policy (e.g., FERPA).
