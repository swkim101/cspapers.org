So far all the efforts to automate the EMI/EMC testing facility consider only the automation of instruments used in these tests, for example Antenna, Spectrum Analyzer, RF Generator and different software to manipulate the results of these tests. Movement of Device Under Test (DUT) has not been automated to meet the new standards. Currently it is being done manually by switching off the test setup. This discontinuity increases the testing time along with the increase in error. If different operators are involved in performing these tests, it also increases human error. We have designed an automatic testing process to speed up the tests along with improving the precision and accuracy of test measurements. It also helps to avoid human health hazards. By using the suggested improved testing process, we have decreased the testing time by about 50%, increased accuracy by more than 20% and precision by 40% respectively.
