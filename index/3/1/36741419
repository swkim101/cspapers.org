The course CS8, Organization of Programming Languages [i], requires computer projects to illustrate and reinforce the concepts of the course. One effective strategy is to require three major projects each in a different language new to the student and each taking about one,third of the semester. We argue here that a reasonable alternative is to require one larger, very well chosen, significant project, which can then be supplemented by some lesser projects. The project that we recommend is an interpreter for a small subset of LISP. For our students, the language of choice is Modula92, a language with which the students are familiar.
