The pole placement self-tuning control method is applied to the control of the manipulators directly in the task coordinate system, which results in highly desirable task-oriented performance characteristics. In the task coordinate, the position control axes and force control axes are orthogonal, therefore, hybrid control can be achieved without degradation in performance of the control system. With the learning mechanism at the task location, dynamic friction and compliant effects are automatically compensated. Simulation results for both position control and hybrid control using the JPL-Stanford Arm demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
