MapInfo SpatialWare is an integrated spatial information management system implemented as a “Spatial Extender” to the IBM Universal Database (GA to be determined), a “Spatial DataBlade” on the Informix Dynamic Server with the Universal Data Option, or as a spatial server on Oracle. It provides on-line spatial data services and improves critical business processes and operational applications. It enables the storage of spatial data in the RDBMS and its rapid retrieval using a sophisticated RTree indexing. SpatialWare uses a robust data model, fully scaleable client/server architecture for the desktop (PC and UNIX) and an extended SQL-based spatial query language to provide a single source for creating custom spatial solutions.
