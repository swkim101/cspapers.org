Features of the GLISP programming system that support knowledge-based programming are described. These include compile-time expansion of object-centered programs, interpretation of messages and operations relative to data type, inheritance of properties and behavior from multiple superclasses, type inference and propagation, conditional compilation, symbolic optimization of compiled code, instantiation of generic programs for particular data types, combination of partial algorithms from separate sources, knowledge-based inspection and editing of data, menu-driven interactive programming, and transportability between Lisp dialects and machines. GLISP is fully implemented for the major dialects of Lisp and is available over the ARPANET.
