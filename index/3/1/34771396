Wind power resources in mountainous regions are conditioned on a vast variety 
of factors influencing air flow. Complex topography causes various phenomena 
such as localised thermal winds, acceleration due to tunneling and Foehn winds 
interfering at a range of spatial scales and varying in time due to weather seasonality. 
It increases the dimensionality of parameter space and adds additional 
complexity to sampling strategies and monitoring network design for wind resource 
assessment and location allocation for wind turbines. This work explores 
an active learning approach to multiple kernel learning (MKL) to explore the highdimensional 
space of topographic features influencing wind speeds. MKL allows 
handling spatial heterogeneity and non-stationarity while providing physically interpretable 
data-driven models useful for decision support. Our results on real data 
from the Swiss Alps suggest the efficiency of MKL both for feature selection, predictive 
modelling and sampling design, also showing that care has to be taken to 
avoid over-fitting by over-localised terms in kernel dictionaries.
