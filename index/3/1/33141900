This workshop will introduce a set of hands-on laboratory activities appropriate for a first Computer Organization course. Participants will work with real equipment: first implementing elementary digital circuits with TTL logic chips, and then programming AVR microcontrollers in assembly to drive fun accessories such as LEDs and speakers. Participants will not take equipment home afterwards, but will receive parts lists and vendor information. The workshop is intended for educators with little electronics background who are interested in incorporating electronics laboratories into their courses. Laptops (Linux, Mac, or Windows) will provide the programming environment for the AVRs. Free software will be available before the workshop. Participants will work in pairs. Laptop recommended.
