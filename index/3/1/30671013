GOALS There are grand opportunities for individual and group access to information, education, entertainment, exploration, and communication through effectively designed computer systems. Our goal is to research user interface designs that "serve human needs" while building feelings of competence, mastery, confidence, and satisfaction. When the user interface is well-designed, the users should be able to accomplish their goals with a sense of control or mastery over the technology and a feeling of respect for the designer.
