We report on a network traffic warehousing project at Telcordia. The warehouse supports a variety of applications that require access to Internet traffic data. The applications include Service Level Agreement (SLA), web traffic analysis, network capacity engineering and planning, and billing. We describe the design of the warehouse and the issues encountered in building the warehouse.
