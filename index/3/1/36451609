Smart Cities denote a stronger integration of information technology into the organisation of a city and the interaction and participation of its citizens. In developing the concept further, we propose to understand Smart Cities through the lens of Social Machines and thus stronger focus on the city as a socio-technical construct. We draw from an interdisciplinary background of computer science and urban planning to reexamine and combine existing theories and find a common understanding. We substantiate our claim to the validity of the concept of Smart-City-as-a-Social-Machine with a thorough literature study and comparison. We discuss the resulting system complexity issues and ways to address them. We further propose areas where this understanding can be useful in furthering research on both the Smart City and the Social Machine topics.
