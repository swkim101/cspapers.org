A theory of heuristic game tree search and evaluation functions for estimating minimax values is developed. The result is quite different from the traditional minimax approach to game playing, and it leads to product-propagation rules for backing up values when subpositions in the game are independent. In this theory Nau's paradox is avoided and deeper searching leads to better moves if one has reasonable evaluation functions.
