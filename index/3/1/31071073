The advent of "big data" is causing a merging of fields, due to the need of simultaneously solving a variety of problems which are usually in distinct domains. As someone with a Bachelors degree in computer science, my PhD involved a rapid change in mindset, as I quickly embraced the necessity of using statistics and optimization together for effectively solving modern data problems. Indeed, this spirit is captured by my wide range of successful research projects, exploring the depths of multiple related fields with collaborators from the Department of Statistics, Machine Learning Department and the Tepper School of Business, together informing my overall research agenda.
