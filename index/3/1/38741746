In 2004, the European COLUMBUS Module is to be attached to the International Space Station. On the way to the successful planning, deployment and operation of the module, computer generated and animated models are being used to optimize performance. Under contract of the German Space Agency DLR, it has become IRF's task to provide a Projective Virtual Reality System to provide a virtual world built after the planned layout of the COLUMBUS module enabling astronauts and scientists to practice operational procedures and the handling of experiments. The possibility for distributed multiuser access to the virtual lab and the visualization of real-world experiment data comprise the key features of the system. Through the ability to share the virtual world, cooperative operations can be practiced easily and trainers and trainees can work together more effectively in the shared virtual environment. The ability to visualize real-world data will be used to introduce measured experimental data into the virtual world online in order to allow realistic interaction with the science reference model hardware: The user's actions in the virtual world are translated into corresponding changes of the inputs of the science reference model hardware; the measured data is then in turn fed back into the virtual world. In order to provide astronauts and scientists with an even more complete insight into various aspects of COLUMBUS and the ISS, the simulation of the COLUMBUS module is currently being extended to include the entire International Space Station. This paper describes the background and the developed features which allow the creation of a virtual world that provides users with the feel of being on board the ISS.
