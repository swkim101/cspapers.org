In this work we report on progress in integrating deep convo-lutional features with Deformable Part Models (DPMs). We substitute the Histogram-of-Gradient features of DPMs with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features, obtained from the top-most, fifth, convolutional layer of Krizhevsky's network [8]. We demonstrate that we thereby obtain a substantial boost in performance (+14.5 mAP) when compared to the baseline HOG-based models. This only partially bridges the gap between DPMs and the currently top-performing R-CNN method of [4], suggesting that more radical changes to DPMs may be needed.
