Many answer selection techniques have been proposed. Densitybased ranking, which considers the surface distance between question terms and the answer target, is employed by most stateof-the-art QA systems. While density-based ranking may be effective for questions with answer targets of certain named entity (NE) types, it may fare poorly with questions whose answer target type is unknown, for instance: “What does AARP stand for?” For such questions, there is a much larger answer candidate space to choose from, and the density-based method often does not have enough information to pinpoint the correct answer. In addition, even for those questions with known NE-type answer targets, lexical level matching often leads to false positives [1].
