Proposes a versatile visual servoing control scheme with a Jacobian matrix estimator. The Jacobian matrix estimator does not need a priori knowledge of the kinematic structure and parameters of the robot system, such as camera and link parameters. The proposed visual servoing control scheme ensures the convergence of the image-features to desired trajectories, by using the estimated Jacobian matrix, which is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory. To show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, simulation and experimental results are presented.<<ETX>>
