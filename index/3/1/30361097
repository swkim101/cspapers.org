The Cell Design System (CDS) is part of a set of tools developed in the 1970s by the Electronics Division of Xerox to support CAD design. This paper describes the CDS, which is a highly interactive graphics system used for layout of custom chips. Described are the hardware environment and language, the kinds of manipulation allowed, types of objects, and viewing options. The CDS benefitted from experience with Icarus [1] which is an early research effort for cell design layout. As with Icarus, a strong benefit of the CDS is its availability on a personal computer, thus providing a layout capability within the office confines of the designer. Also, we feel that the CDS has provided a unique and powerful method of viewing cells and has a highly effective human interface.
