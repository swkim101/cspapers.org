Visual markers are useful tools that aid autonomous robots in object recognition and pose measurement; however, conventional markers have two fundamental problems in orientation estimation: (1) inaccurate estimation in the frontal direction and (2) pose ambiguity. We previously developed a visual marker “LentiMark” that solves problem (1). In this paper, we propose a solution to problem (2) by improving LentiMark. For this purpose, we use two wavelike slices that change two-tone patterns according to the angle of visual line. The new marker enables stable and robust pose estimation without pose ambiguity. We solve the two biggest problems of visual markers in the framework of small planar markers. We verify the efficiency of our method through experiments.
