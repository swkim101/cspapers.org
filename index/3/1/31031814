The Propel Distributed Services Platform (PDSP) is the core software product of Propel, a new Internet infrastructure software company. The PDSP product was created to enable Java developers to architect, implement, deploy, and maintain Internet applications and services much more quickly and easily than before while still providing all of the RAS (reliability, availability and scalability) that such applications require. In this presentation, we provide a brief overview of PDSP's key features, including its support for reliable and scalable data management, text indexing and searching, and persistent queuing. We also discuss its integrated Java APIs, built-in support for online-deployable data and schema changes, and system administration facilities.
