A new curriculum was designed for the computer science major at the Air Force Academy with the initial majors course being Elements of Programming Languages (CS359). The course consists of four major blocks: detailed concepts of PASCAL; examination of elements of programming languages; examination of FORTRAN77 and COBOL; and student comparative reports on other contemporary languages.
 The initial block about PASCAL in this course is unique in concept and approach; and is the focus of this paper. The underlying basis for the approach taken is that PASCAL is an extremely small language; therefore, very easy to master. Once a student has mastered a programming language it is easy to compare other languages against the 'mastered' language. Also, it is much easier for the student to learn new programming languages once one is mastered. The approach we used in this course is what makes it fairly unique.
