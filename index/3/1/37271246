Bisimulation is the primitive notion of equivalence between concurrent processes in Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS); there is a nontrivial game-like protocol for distinguishing nonbisimular processes. In contrast, process distinguishability in Hoare's theory of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is determined solely on the basis of traces of visible actions. We examine what additional operations are needed to explain bisimulation similarlyâ€”specifically in the case of finitely branching processes without silent moves. We formulate a general notion of Structured Operational Semantics for processes with Guarded recursion (GSOS), and demonstrate that bisimulation does not agree with trace congruence with respect to any set of GSOS-definable contexts. In justifying the generality and significance of GSOS's, we work out some of the basic proof theoretic facts which justify the SOS discipline.
