It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 25th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS 2011) in Tucson, Arizona. ICS brings together researchers from several areas to present ground-breaking research related to supercomputing. 
 
In addition to the technical program of papers, workshops, tutorials, posters, and an ACM Student Research Competition, we are pleased to bring you three illustrious keynote speakers addressing important topics in contemporary parallel computing. Sarita Adve of the University of Illinois will talk about which models parallel programming languages should expose and how hardware should support those models. Steve Hammond of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will talk about renewable energy and energy efficiency. Finally, Bill Gropp of the University of Illinois will talk about developing applications for extreme scale through the use of performance modeling.
