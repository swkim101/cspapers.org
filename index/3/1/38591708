High speed computer and telephone networks carry large amounts of data and signalling traffic. The engineers who build and maintain these networks use a combination of hardware and software tools to monitor the stream of network traffic. Some of these tools operate directly on the live network; others record data on magnetic tape for later offline analysis by software. Most analysis tasks require tens to hundreds of gigabytes of data. Traffic analysis applications include protocol performance analysis, conformance testing, error monitoring and fraud detection.
