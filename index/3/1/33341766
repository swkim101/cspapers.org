Machine learning has seen increasing use for a wide range of practical applications. What are the security implications of relying upon machine learning in these settings? Recent research suggests that modern machine learning methods are fragile and easily attacked, which raises concerns about their use in security-critical settings. This talk will explore several attacks on machine learning and survey directions for making machine learning more robust against attack.
