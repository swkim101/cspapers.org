This panel discusses the granting of credit for AP CS by colleges and universities. Particularly with the change of the AP CS exam from Pascal to C++ last year, this panel is aimed both the collegiate and high school communities who are interested in comments from schools who have experience with AP CS students. Topics will include a short review of the AP curriculum, and some examples of what credit is given, how AP CS students are placed, and how the students perform in those and subsequent courses.
