This paper addresses issues of integration and programming of complex robotics systems. It describes the underlying approach, the design and implementation of the NNS system, an interactive LISP-based environment for the integration and setting up of Flexible Assembly Cells. Programming, debugging, parallelism managing and interaction with decision processes are carried out in the same environment. NNS provides a suitable framework for the design of highly adaptative robotics systems and their use in the experiment of complex manipulation tasks.
