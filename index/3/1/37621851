From the basic concepts, the Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the electrodynamics are very closed, therefore the aim of this paper is to develop all the conventional electrodynamics laws for analysing the effect and electrical charateristics in the MHD. The Lorentz force, Ohm's law, Ampere's law and Faraday's law have been considered and they are closely related to each other, however, the Faraday's law seems to be the most important in MHD. All the essential parameters have been developed and shown their relations and can be used for a deeper study of MHD.
