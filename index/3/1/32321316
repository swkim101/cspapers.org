Novel protocols that can enable ultra-low latency communication in wireless multihop sensor and actuator networks have recently been presented in the literature. These approaches achieve ultra-low latencies in packet delivery notwithstanding the unreliability of the wireless channel. A systematic methodology to analyze and compare the performance of ultra-low latency communication protocols is however still missing. This work presents our first steps towards the definition of such a methodology. Building upon this work, we aim at designing and implementing a comprehensive benchmarking framework for ultra-low latency communication protocols.
