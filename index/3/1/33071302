This paper reports a successful project that modified old technology i.e. Relay control panel based injection molding machine in to more economical, reliable and efficient micro controller based control system. In this paper we discuss electro- hydraulic controlling systems of injection molding machine by using a simple Micro controller based embedded system that provides an effective and easy way to control the sequence of the hydraulic actuators movement and the states of hydraulic system. The project of a specific controller for Injection Molding Machine application join the study of automation design and the control processing of Hydraulic systems with the electronic design based on micro controllers to implement the resources of the controller. The micro controller based embedded system and its associated interfacing peripherals with the machine are described. The software including the control and interactive program is written in BASIC language for the sequence control of the machine and the closed-loop control of the injection speed process.
