In this talk I will discuss some of the lessons I've discovered about network protocol design; how to make protocols self-stabilizing, how to make networks self-configuring, how to provide optional configuration in such a way that misconfiguration does no harm, and how to design within constraints such as backward compatibility and politics. I'll also talk about some of my recent work. It is confusing enough that forwarding is done at both layers 2 and 3. Why am I designing a layer 2 1/2? And having spent most of my life in the world of computer network communication protocol design, I will share my observations about ways in which communication protocols in other areas could be improved.
