This article proposes a new architecture of combined neural networks, which is used to recognize the radar targets from radar range profiles. Combined neural network consists of an invariant neural network and a neural network classifier. The efficiency of these networks is proved by the experimental results. Proposed combined neural networks can be applied to divergent areas of pattern recognition, such as recognition systems of periodic signals, images, numerical series....
