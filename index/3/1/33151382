This paper discusses the motivation for a simple package designed to incorporate user interactivity into a first course in computer science. The package enables novice programmers to build programs with GUI-like interactivity while maintaining good design principles. An advantage of this package is that it is easy to implement using the Swing class. Therefore, it can be used as a case study to illustrate Java features.
