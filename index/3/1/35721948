In Taiwan, because of the Doppler effects and tunnel shading, it is difficult to smoothly receive a live DVB-T channel inside a high-speed train by a laptop equipped with an ordinary DVB-T USB dongle. For providing live TV services inside a high-speed train, we develop a mobile live TV system for Taiwan High-speed Rail (THSR). The proposed system delivers live TV programs to a high-speed train through the mobile WiMAX network deployed along the THSR railway by the WiMAX operator VeeTime. Then, the received live TV programs are delivered to the terminal devices of high-speed rail passengers through Wi-Fi multicast. Using Wi-Fi multicast inside a high-speed train is necessary since there may be several hundreds of concurrent users on the same high-speed train. However, conventionally to provide a scalable Wi-Fi multicast streaming system is difficult because no extra reliability control mechanisms such as ARQ (Automatic Repeat-reQuest) are available for Wi-Fi multicast. Instead we overcome the difficulty of scalable Wi-Fi multicast streaming by using AL-FEC (Application Layer -- Forward Error Correction). Hence, in the demo session of MobiSys 2013, we plan to show the whole mobile live TV system with a live TV input, especially focused on its capability of scalable Wi-Fi multicast streaming over a multi-hop Wi-Fi network that can emulate the real multi-hop Wi-Fi network inside a high-speed train.
