PRC is a systems integrator, a company which builds information{ systems (based on relational databases) for federal, state, and local governments. Our database designers generally use rules of thumb, supplemented by readily available tuning guides, to tune a physical schema. Prudent database designers also perform benchmarks prior to operational turnover to monitor performance and identi~ bottlenecks in the database before the users do it for them. However, performance questions can’t be addressed by benchmarking until after the hardware has been purchased and installed, and testing has begun. Consequently, it is often the case that the new information system can initially suffer serious performance problems when contrasted with the legacy system being replaced. Moreover any denormalization introduced this late in the development cycle will force software applications to be modified and regressiontested as well. This is expensive and timeconsurning, and may require a hardware upgrade — affecting both the program budget and the customer’s satisfaction with the system integrator!
