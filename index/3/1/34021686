The purpose of this presentation is to describe an alternative sociology course that links student computer skills with available social survey data. Students are given access to a file of SPSS programs which they can easily modify to fit their own purposes. Using the General Social Survey they can test hypotheses on current data reflecting their interests. The broad range of data allows beginning students with little or no previous computer experience to investigate a wide variety of topics.
