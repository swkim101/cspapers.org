SRC Computers, Inc. has integrated adaptive computing into its SRC-6 high-end server, incorporating reconfigurable processors as peers to the microprocessors. Performance improvements resulting from reconfigurable computing can provide orders of magnitude speedups for a wide variety of algorithms. Reconfigurable logic in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) has shown great advantage to date in special purpose applications and specialty hardware. SRC Computers is working to bring this technology into the general purpose HPC world via an advanced system interconnect and enhanced compiler technology.
