This paper describes a debugging utility with some tutorial capabilities. It is designed to assist novice programmers in finding logic errors in syntactically correct programs. Flow and use analysis techniques are employed to aid in the recognition of some instances of incorrect code sequence, improper variable use and improper nesting of constructs. The utility is menu driven with built in facilities for displaying user source programs and debugging information in a multiple window format.
