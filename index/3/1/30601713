Much attention developing trusted criteria. Before has recently been focused on computer network evaluation attempting this however, a better understanding of the relationship between individual trusted computers and networks that link them is required. This paper provides an overall system view of the network and trusted and untrusted computers attached to it, and how various ways of protecting data on networks affect which portions of the network must be trusted and what security policy must be enforced. By examining several network models will become apparent where new or additional criteria need to be developed.
