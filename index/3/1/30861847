Information Systems is one of the most dynamic and important professions of the 80's. There are a number of colleges and universities that offer baccalaureate degrees in this field. However, because of Information Systems' dynamic nature, many of these programs are now out of date. In this paper a modern, comprehensive curriculum leading to a baccalaureate degree in Information Systems is presented. This curriculum was developed in response to the needs of the student population and the requirements of industry. The curriculum was designed by first identifying career paths followed by students that graduate with an Information Systems degree from San Diego State University and then analyzing the areas of knowledge required. In addition, an effort was made to anticipate the future directions of the field of information systems in terms of need and technology. Relying on this study, plus feedback from graduates and employers, five major paths were determined. They were Applications Programming, Systems Analysis, Information Systems Management, Automated Administrative Systems, and Graduate Bound (students who would directly pursue further graduate study). To serve these related, but varied, areas, a common core of courses, as well as specific courses for each track, were developed. These core and specialty area courses are described.
