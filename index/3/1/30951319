This paper presents a clinical decision support system based on case-basedretrieval approach to assist physicians in post-operative pain treatment. Here,the cases are formulated by combining regular features and features using anumerical visual analogue scale (NVAS) through a questionnaire. Featureabstraction is done both in problem and outcome description of a case in order toreduce the number of attributes. The system retrieves most similar cases with theiroutcomes. The outcome of each case brings benefits for physicians since it presentsboth severity and fast recovery by the applied treatment in post-operative patients.Therefore, we have introduced a two-layer case structure i.e., solution is the firstlayer and outcome is the second layer that better suits this medical application. Inthe system, the solution presents the treatment and the outcome contains recoveryinformation of a patient, something physicians are interested in, especially the riskof side effects and complications.
