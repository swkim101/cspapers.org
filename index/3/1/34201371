The application area of visual surveillance is an important challenge for computer vision scientists. As in previous years, the large number of high quality submissions reflects the continuing attention it attracts from research groups across the globe. In this Eleventh workshop in the series, some shifts in focus, compared with previous workshops, can be observed. In the previous workshop, for example, approximately half of the papers accepted for publication proposed innovative processes to segment the foreground (moving objects) from the background (residual scene). This year, only four (from forty-one) papers address this issue.
