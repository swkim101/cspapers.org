One problem of robot integration in a flexible manufacturing cell is the efficient programming of the robot. In this paper a robot programming system is proposed which offers the possibility of user oriented, flexible robot programming. The programming system consists of four levels which enable fully automated robot programming with data from a previous planning system, manual editing of application oriented commands, and low level system programming and configuration. We have realised this under the Oberon programming system which offers object oriented programming features. As an example we have realised the charging of a press brake by a robot inside a flexible sheet metal forming cell. The basis for the design of the computer integrated bending cell is a global concept in which human resources, techniques and organisation are simultaneously planned.<<ETX>>
