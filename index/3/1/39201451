In this paper, we propose a winding control technique using a physical index of horizontal constraint force for a 3D snake-like robot, and it is shown that a winding motion of the robot can be realized with small joint torque. If it approaches a target point, it is necessary to raise the head and to work like a manipulator. Therefore, a control method of the head configuration using a criterion function, which can be used in both redundant and insufficient number of link cases is proposed. In order to show the validity of the proposed methods, we constructed a snake like robot called SMA. Using the experimental system, we show that the winding pattern with which the robot can avoid singular postures is generated automatically, and head position and head orientation can be controlled properly.
