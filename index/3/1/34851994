This paper describes ICOTâ€™s research and development activities on knowledge base systems. Our approach is to investigate knowledge base systems from the viewpoint of logic programming. We have defined several models on the bases of which knowledge base systems will be developed step by step. Two types of knowledge base management software system models are discussed. One is a model combining a logic programming system and a database management software system. The other is an integrated model. Pilot, distributed, and parallel-knowledge base machines models are also discussed. Intelligent interface Intelligent programming
