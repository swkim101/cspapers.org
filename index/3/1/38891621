We consider an IR-UWB (Impulse Response Ultra Wide Band) system based on impulse with short duration. The widely used pulses are given by successive derivations of Gaussian impulse. IR-UWB receiver uses classically a RAKE in order to eliminate the effects on the signal due to the multipath channel. In this article, we assume that the channel state information is known at the transmitter. To avoid the utilization of the RAKE at receiver, we propose a technique of pre-equalization based on the knowledge of the channel and the characteristic of the Gaussian derivation. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the proposed methods and to assess their performance.
