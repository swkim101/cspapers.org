Numerous agricultural applications require very accurate guidance of farm vehicles. Current works have established that RTK GPS was a very suitable sensor in order to meet the expected precision: several control laws have been designed for vehicles equipped with such a sensor, and satisfactory results have been achieved as long as vehicles do not slide. Nevertheless, in actual working conditions (sloping fields, entering into curves on a wet land, etc.), sliding inevitably occurs. In this paper, we design a nonlinear adaptive control law in order to preserve guidance precision in presence of sliding: realtime sliding estimation is used to correct vehicle evolution. Field experiments, demonstrating the capabilities of that control scheme are reported and discussed.
