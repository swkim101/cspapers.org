The first pilot Information Systems accreditation visit is occurring in Fall 2001. Many programs will apply for IS accreditation the following year, the 2002-03 accreditation cycle. This session will discuss the process for preparing for an accreditation visit. The discussion will include a planning timeline, preparation of the self-study and arranging details for the on campus visit. Particular attention will be placed on the assessment section of the self-study, the important details of the self-study, and the preparation of the display materials needed for the on-site visit.
