Polymeric insulators being sensitive to environment need study before use in any particular environment. To study their behavior in Pakistan, an insulator was placed in a wooden box in which a UV lamp was fitted. An open cup full with water was also placed to produce humidity that varied between 49 to 71% and the temperature remained between 18 to 30degC.The experiment was continued for six months. Visual observation, FTIR and hydrophobicity analysis techniques were used for material analysis. The maximum degradation found was -7.6%.Hydrophobicity remained HC3 toHC5.
