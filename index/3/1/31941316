In this paper, we describe the bioinformatics track we created to better prepare students for health, medical and life science professions. Our program was motivated by the fact that bioinformatics training is in high demand. Many universities have responded to this demand by creating majors in bioinformatics, while others by creating minors in bioinformatics. Our response was less extreme as we opted for a computer science track in bioinformatics which we describe in this article.
