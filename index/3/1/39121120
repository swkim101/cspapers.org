In this paper; the variants of the much celebrated multimodulus algorithm (MMA) are presented for the blind equalization of higher order QAM signals. In this course, new error functions associated with the existing MMA are proposed to decrease time to convergence (TTC) by bringing the zero error equalization points closer to the final symbol level in the transmitted constellation. The convergence characteristics of the newly proposed schemes is demonstrated by way of simulations for 64-QAM signaling and it is shown that the proposed schemes yield reduced TTC and better steady-state performance compared to the Multimodulus Algorithm.
