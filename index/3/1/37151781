In this work we propose a novel framework for bookmark weighting which allows us to estimate the effectiveness of each of the bookmarks individually. We show that by weighting bookmarks according to their estimated quality we can significantly improve search effectiveness. Using empirical evaluation on real data gathered from two large bookmarking systems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the new framework for search enhancement.
