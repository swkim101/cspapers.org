The Graph Minors project, originated by Robertson and Seymour, was very successful. It resulted in many theoretical advances (e.g., a proof of Wagner's conjecture), but it also has algorithmic applications, and some of the methods have been successfully used in practical computation. It now appears possible to extend part of the project to directed graphs. The speaker will review the basics of the Graph Minors theory, and then will discuss generalizations to directed graphs, algorithmic consequences, and open problems.
