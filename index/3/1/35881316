We discuss a two semester, senior level sequence of courses in large scale software development. The courses are keyed upon the element of realism by having an actual user supply an actual project. In the first course students develop a functional specification of user needs. In the second course students design a system from the specifications and implement at least a portion of the project. We discuss the significant benefits of having a real project and point to some drawbacks. We conclude by discussing possible applicability of our courses to other schools.
