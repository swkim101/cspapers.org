Being able to determine the provenience of statements is a fundamental step in any SW trust modeling. We propose a methodology that allows signing of small groups of RDF statements. Groups of statements signed with this methodology can be safely inserted into any existing triple store without the loss of provenance information since only standard RDF semantics and constructs are used. This methodology has been implemented and is both available as open source library and deployed in a SW P2P project.
