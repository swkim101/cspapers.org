Locally underutilized TV broadcasting spectrum is regarded as white space. Part of the TV frequency band, which is usually referred as 700MHz band, is excellent for radio communications due to its favorable radio propagation characteristic. This spectrum can be used to provide mobile broadband for the rural and mountainous areas effectively. Currently, this 700 MHz band is used exclusively for TV broadcasting. To open up the opportunity to other services, especially mobile broadband service, it is important that the new system should not cause harmful interference to the TV service areas. Strict requirements in terms of interference should be met. This paper evaluated the TV White Space (TVWS) in channel 43 in the Northern Part of Viet Nam by using the detailed terrain data and active TV stations database. Calculation results confirm that it is possible to allow TVWS devices (TWD) to operate in certain areas. The paper also suggested necessary regulation measures to ensure the coexistence of both services.
