C++ is rapidly emerging as the most widely used object oriented language. One major reason is that C++ is derived from the popular C programming language. Because C++ is considered the successor to C, C programmers wanting the benefits of. the object oriented paradigm look to C++ as a logical step toward object oriented programming. This panel will focus on the issues in moving from C to C++ and will try to present different points of view on how the C programmer should make the transition. Simply stated, one view promotes an incremental style in adapting both the language and the paradigm, the other more radical teaching, takes the view that the C programmer must adopt both a, new paradigm and language at the onset.
