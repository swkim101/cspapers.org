An algorithm for constructing dynamic models of single-arm robots is presented in this paper. Motion equations of robots in analytical form are derived applying a fully automated procedure. It is shown that the solution of direct and/or inverse problem based on the analytical model requires considerably fewer floating- -point multiplications/additions that is the case with previously developed numerical methods. The developed method is therefore very suitable for real-time application of the dynamic models of robots. The developed program package is illustrated using the example of Stanford manipulator.
