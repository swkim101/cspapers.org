Embedded systems are often business- or safety-critical, with strict timing requirements that have to be met for the information-processing. Code-level timing analysis (used to analyse software running on some given hardware w.r.t. its timing properties) is an indispensable technique for ascertaining whether or not these requirements are met. However, recent developments in hardware, especially multi-core processors, and in software organisation render analysis increasingly more difficult, thus challenging the evolution of timing analysis techniques. This special session aims to give an overview over the current state of the art and the future challenges w.r.t. code-level timing analysis and introduces TACLe, a recently started EU-funded networking activity targeting these challenges.
