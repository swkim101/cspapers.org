Welcome to the Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC2001 Conference. These proceedings are nearly a direct (albeit more portable) copy of the conference Web site. The final snapshot for this Proceedings CD-ROM was taken on October 8, 2001. All information contained herein was current as of this date.By mirroring our comprehensive Web site in these Proceedings, we hope to provide you with a result which closely follows the numerous activities of this conference, serves as a complete archive of all related technical material, and accurately represents the spirit of SC2001.To view the technical papers you will need to be able to open Portable Document Format (PDF) files. At the time these papers were formatted for this CD-ROM, version 4 of "Acrobat Reader" from Adobe was the most common and effective reader for PDF files. Additionally, much of the material included in these Proceedings requires a JavaScript-capable Web browser to be viewed as intended.On behalf of the SC2001 Conference Committee, it is my sincere hope that you find the contents of these Proceedings useful. I encourage you to send in any comments or suggestions you have regarding this CD-ROM to webmaster@sc2001.org.
