The main aims of the competition were to consolidate the planners in terms of input format; to promote development of multiagent planners both inside and outside of the multiagent research community; and to provide a proof-of-concept of a potential future multiagent planning track of the International Planning Competition (IPC). In this paper we summarize course and highlights of the competition.
