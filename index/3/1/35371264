We are working on a scalable, interactive visualization system, called Carina, for people to explore million-node graphs. By using latest web browser technologies, Carina offers fast graph rendering via WebGL, and works across desktop (via Electron) and mobile platforms. Different from most existing graph visualization tools, Carina does not store the full graph in RAM, enabling it to work with graphs with up to 69M edges. We are working to improve and open-source Carina, to offer researchers and practitioners a new, scalable way to explore and visualize large graph datasets.
