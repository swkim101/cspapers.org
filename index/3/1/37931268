To meet the development of Internet of Things (IoT), IETF has proposed IPv6 standards working under low-power and low-cost constraints. In this paper, we provide insights on RPL (routing protocol for low power and lossy networks) under the condition of multiple RPL instances. For the study, we use the Contiki operating system, together with the COOJA simulator. Our work investigates the use of two distinctive objective functions under multiple RPL instances for differentiating QoS at network layer in WSNs. The metrics evaluated include routing tree convergence, latency and packet delivery ratio. The study can also serves as a basis for future enhancement of the use of multiple RPL instances for a plethora of IoT applications.
