MIT App Inventor is widely used to introduce students to programming and building mobile apps. In this workshop, we will introduce AppVis, an extension to App Inventor that allows users to create apps that publish data to iSENSE (isenseproject.org), a web-based system for collaborating with data and visualizations. Using AppVis, apps can also retrieve data from iSENSE and display visualizations in the app. This workshop will provide a hands-on introduction to App Inventor, AppVis, and iSENSE. You will build our demo apps, including jump counter, survey, and map-marking. We will have conversations about how to introduce AppVis to your non-majors courses, intro-CS courses, and interdisciplinary teaching. Prior experience with App Inventor is helpful, but not necessary.
