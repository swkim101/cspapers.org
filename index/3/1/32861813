A required computer literacy course whose design and implementation were greatly influenced by that of required courses in classics and other liberal arts is described. The course is an instance of the new trend of principles-based courses, but does not take the survey approach. Topics are chosen selectively on the basis of importance to the field, usefulness in demystifying the computer itself, and their ability to be compatible with a hands-on, exercise-oriented pedagogy. Topics include propositional logic, digital circuit design, information representation, a Pascal subset, program hierarchies and software engineering principles. The course has been successfully run in over 30 sections with over 1000 students.
