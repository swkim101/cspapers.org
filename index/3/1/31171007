As additive manufacturing (AM) becomes more pervasive, its supply chains shift towards distributed business models that heavily rely on cloud resources. Despite its countless benefits, this paradigm raises significant concerns about the trustworthiness of the globalized process, as there exist several classes of cybersecurity attacks that can undermine its security guarantees. In this work, we focus on the protection of the intellectual property (IP) of 3D designs, and introduce ObfusCADe, which is a novel protection method against counterfeiting, by embedding special features in CAD models. The introduced features interfere with the integrity of the design, effectively restricting high quality manufacturing to only a unique set of processing settings and conditions; under all other conditions, the printed artifact suffers from poor quality, premature failures and/or malfunctions.
