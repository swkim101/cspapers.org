In Solid-State Drives (SSDs) with tens of flash chips and highly parallel architecture, we can speed up I/O operations by well-utilizing resources during page allocation. Proposals already exist for using static page allocation which does not balance the IO load and its efficiency depends on access address patterns. To our best knowledge, there have been no research thus far to show what happens if one or more internal resources can be freely allocated regardless of the request address. This paper explores the possibility of using different degrees of dynamism in page allocation and identifies key design opportunities that they present to improve SSD's characteristics.
