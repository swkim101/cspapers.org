We introduce a method to give upper estimates for the clique size of intermediately large graphs. The method can be applied when the graph in question is symmetrical to a large degree. Such graphs arise in coding theory (see next section for a coding theoretic application). What does our method use? Instead of doing exhaustive search on the original graph, which would be too time-consuming, we perform exhaustive search on a smaller, but related graph. This smaller graph is then analyzed thoroughly: we determine not only its maximal clique size, but also the way in which its cliques are distributed over a small number of carefully chosen subsets of its nodes. Finally we write down a set of inequalities which relate these distribution lists to the clique size of the startup graph. Notations: Let G = G(V,E) be a finite graph with vertex set V and edge set E. A clique C of G is a subset of V such that every two nodes in C are connected in G. We denote the maximum clique size of G by w(G). When IV) is in the hundreds, depending on the density, we can determine w(G) by exhaustive search. If the graph is larger, we can estimate w(G) from above using linear programming. Since this method can be grossly inaccurate, we are motivated to look for other alternatives. Our Method: Let G(V,E) be a finite graph. Our method assumes another graph G’(V’, E’) such that V’ is partitioned into V{, . . . , V,‘. To be able to use the method the following conditions need to hold:
