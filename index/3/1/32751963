Instead of teaching logic as one more isolated topic of discrete math, logic can be used as the fundamental tool underlying all other topics of the course. In such a course, six to seven weeks are spent learning logic and how to develop formal proofs. The other topics of discrete math are then taught in a more rigorous fashion than usual, using logic as the foundation. This approach, outlined in more detail on the next page, is the basis for the text A Logical Apprwach to Discrete Math (Gries and Schneider, Springer Verlag, 1993). The approach has been employed by all the panelists.
