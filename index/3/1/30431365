This paper describes an experimental design specification language which is “engineer oriented” rather than “programmer oriented.” Computer programs using this language as input will Create a software model of the function description, statically and dynamically check for the completeness of the function described, check the logic implementation of the function for completeness and accuracy and generate a number of documents to provide clear communications.
