This  paper's  purpose  is twofold: 1) To outline  briefly  some of  the  principal considerations  in  achieving  competent  robotic tactile  s nsing,  and 2) to  describe  the beginnings of several new research projects in this area which have been initiated at Case Western Reserve University Touch-sensing  technology for robotics and prosthetics  presently  is  very  primitive.  The need  for obust  multiple-sensor,  gray-scaleresponsive robotic grippers and "hands" has been widely perceived and extensively documentedl. Somewhat  less  of en discussed,  but  of considerable importance, is the need to provide tactile  "pressure"  to a human  operator for telemanipulation. Related to these technological needs  are  the  relatively  unknown  operating principles  of tactile  perception  in living systems  and  the  closely  related omain of replacement touch sensing for limb orthosis and prosthesis. The  pr ssing  requirements for  sensory feedback and control in automata have spurred a great  deal of research  in visual  pattern recognition in recent years. Though there have been some noteworthy and useful achievements, the state-of-the-art really ,is not far advanced. Device and system capabilities are modest and evolve slowly, owing mostly to many difficult problems in information processing and pattern recognition. Unlike vision, tactile sensing for automata has  been  relatively  neglected.  Concentrated study of fundamental issues in touch began only in the last few years. Part of the reason for this may have been the unavailability of useful tactile sensors. Achieving  improved  knowledge  and technological capability in tactile sensing is a problem of many dimensions. This includes need for fundamental research and development in such matters as transduction, three-dimensional object representation of shape, orientation, location, texture,  compliance,  and  the relating of information derived from touch to system-control and manipulation operations.
