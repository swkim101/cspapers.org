The use of computer mediated learning has changed the way of learning. To support the collaboration within small ad hoc learning communities, a mobile learning application was enhanced to provide possibilities to share user-generated content. To link the mobile application with the social offline interaction between the learners, the pedagogical scenario of a mobile application was enhanced to offer more possibilities for verbal communication between the learners. Results of a pilot study indicate interferences between computer mediated and face-to-face communication, which leads to a preference of one of the communication channels by the users.
