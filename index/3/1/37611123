Acceleration technologies have been gaining much attention in the past year and increasingly being integrated in cluster solutions ranging from top500 class installations to production oriented systems such as IBM's System Cluster 1350. Options include games processors such as the Cell processor, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs,) Field Programmable Gate Array's (FPGAs,) and purpose designed coprocessors such as ClearSpeed's technology.So what are the differences between the acceleration technology categories, and how do you know if one of the options is right for you?From this presentation, you will acquire an understanding of how to assess the range of characteristics of accelerators which include single and double precision performance, power consumption, programming models, and how they relate to your application needs.
