In recent years, wikis have gained a prominent position among web-based collaboration platforms. However, special practices and adaptations are necessary when applying wikis to software documentation and other development activities. The Wikis for Software Engineering (Wikis4SE) workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the use of wiki technology in this domain. It serves as a forum for presenting new ideas and tools, and reporting on experiences, best practices, and newly discovered problems. The Wikis4SE'2009 workshop builds on the success of prior events at WikiSym'2008 and WikiSym'2007.
