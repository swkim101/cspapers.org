Medical technology is changing rapidly with devices such as stereo-endoscopes, virtual reality, tele-presence surgery, and robotics for use in colonoscopy. The minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is becoming one of the most important research area in the field of medical engineering. The colonoscope is one typical medical instrument that complies with the requirement of MIS. This paper describes the design of a new type of intelligent tip for the colonoscope. Because of the injuries caused by this surgical tool during the operation, we focus on a new type of bendable tip. The main purpose of this medical tool is to be in accordance with MIS by minimizing the contact between the colonoscope and the interior boundary of the colon, and to make the progression of the colonoscope easier for the surgeon. Our current prototype is twice the size of the final tool. It is electro-pneumatically driven and constituted by three metal bellows disposed 120/spl deg/ apart. Its position in the intestine is driven by three sensors positioned on the superior plate. Some experimental results are presented.
