This panel will discuss two recently completed reports of ACM's Curriculum Committee on Computer Science (C3S) and two reports currently in progress. One of the completed reports presents recommendations for topics appropriate for the freshman and sophomore years of an undergraduate degree program in computer science; the other one contains a post “Curriculum '68” bibliography of literature on computer science education. The reports still in progress address service courses and identify topics appropriate at the intermediate level of a computer science undergraduate degree program. These reports are part of a projected series of reports intended to update “Curriculum '68”.
