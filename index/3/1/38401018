Dynamic preshaping is important especially for a high speed capturing robot to catch a moving object successfully. This paper discusses an issue on dynamic preshaping for a capturing robot driven by a single wire. To control the finger posture while increasing the wire tension, there are three essential factors, wiring, spring distribution among joints, and mass distribution in each finger link. Giving the final link posture of finger, mass distribution, and tension with respect to time, we explore how to determine the spring distribution. We first show how to find it under a quasi-static motion, where all dynamic effects are neglected. We further explore an approach to find it under a dynamic motion where the tension increases fast enough.
