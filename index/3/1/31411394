Buffer pools are created and managed in data base systems in order to reduce the total amount of accesses to the I/O devices. The use of the buffer pool in a virtual storage system may cause an increase in the page fault rate. We examine this phenomenon through the analysis of empirical data gathered in a multifactor experiment. The factors we considered were memory size, buffer size, replacement algorithm for memory and buffer management algorithm.
