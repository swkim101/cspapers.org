PROBLEM STATEMENT In 1984, the University of Wisconsin Green Bay (UWGB) first offered a standard computer literacy class that included an overview of computer concepts and computer use in specified professions, a brief exposure to popular applications packages and some BASIC programming. This class had a broad scope and traditional presentation. The pace was very rapid and the coverage necessarily superficial. Although the students worlced very hard, many left the course thinking that they had not acquired any useful knowledge. Our problem was how to revise this course to provide an enhanced educational experience for the greatest number of students given our limited technical and human resources. Our students needed a course that would allow them to gain introductory level competency with the most common applications packages. But more than that, they needed to acquire a variety of computer problem-solving strategies and develop their capacity to build on their knowledge after the course was finished. We have redesigned the course to provide an effective first-semester computing experience for large numbers of students by utilizing a self-scheduling, self-paced learning environment in which each student can individualize their learning experience by selecting the activities that best suit their own learning style and current level of computer ability.
