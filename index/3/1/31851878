This paper proposes a contention window (CW) allocation scheme for real-time emergency data for vehicle ad hoc networks. The proposed scheme reduces the probability of packet collisions with the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) protocol and provides bandwidth efficiency with a short delay for emergency sporadic data. In the case of high-density traffic, the proposed scheme decreases re-collision probability using dynamic CW adjustments. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can enhance network performance in terms of throughput, end-to-end delays, and network loads in the case of highway traffic.
