In January 2016, US President Barack Obama started an initiative to provide CS for All -- with the goal that all school students should have access to computing education. Computing departments in higher education have a particularly important role to play in this initiative. It's in our best interest to get involved, since the effort can potentially improve the quality of our incoming students. CS Departments have unique insights as subject-matter experts to inform the development of standards. We can provide leadership to inform and influence education policy. In this session, we will present a variety of ways in which departments and faculty can support CS for All and will answer audience questions about the initiative. Our goal is to provide concrete positive actions for faculty.
