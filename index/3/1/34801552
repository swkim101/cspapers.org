In this research, we focus on tracking topics that originate and evolve from a specific event. Intuitively, a few key elements of a target event, such as date, location, and persons involved, would be enough for making a decision on whether a test story is on-topic. Consequently, a profile-based event tracking method is proposed. We attempt to build an event profile from the given on-topic stories by robust information retrieval technologies. A feature selection metric and a recognized event clause are utilized to determine most (if not all) key semantic elements of the target event. Preliminary experiments on the TDT2 mandarin corpus show that this profile-based event tracking method is promising.
