In this paper, the way to design different shapes of miniature antenna for LoRa devices are presented. With dimension of 0.06λ×0.1λ, the proposed antennas are printed on 34×80×0.8 mm3 FR-4 board. The simulation and experiment results show a good agreement with expectations of the electrical small antennas that operate at 868 MHz frequency band. Moreover, the changeable geometry of the designs while keeping a good performance proves that miniature antennas can be created to be more appealing as logos or figures.
