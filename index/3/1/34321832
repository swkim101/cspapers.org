Computer and network security are important topics discussed in many places in the Computer Science curriculum. Security issues are difficult to experiment on in experiential based courses. Attacks on system security cannot be demonstrated on live campus networks. This workshop will demonstrate and experiment with several security attacks in a safe, sandbox-based virtual environment. We will begin two easy demonstrations and allow each participant to choose from six laboratory experiments. We will wrap up with an ethics discussion. Each experiment includes discussion of the area involved and tips on how to protect against the particular exploit under scrutiny. Each participant will be given a DVD with all exercise materials on it as a takeaway. This workshop is designed for instructors from all levels who want to add security experiments to classes. A laptop is mandatory. Each participant will receive copies of all experiments in the series. These experiments include discussion materials -- introduction to the subject area, exploitation methods, and ways to avoid exploitation -- as well as the procedures used to experience each activity
