This paper introduces a distributed architecture, CREGS, for mobile autonomous robots' intelligent system. Multiple expert systems are integrated by a software bus structure and can perform tasks heterogeneously and parallelly. A software component is also designed to interface between the expert systems and external devices for "online" control. The experiments of the simulation system for autonomous mobile robots which ombedded l.he CREGS showed its desirable properties.
