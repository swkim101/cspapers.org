Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) is a well-known problem in optical networks. This problem is generally NP-complete [1]. Many researches have proposed from simple to complex heuristic algorithms for solving RWA problem. The simple heuristics are usually prejudged as inefficient. This paper evaluates the efficiency of some simple algorithms for RWA problem in survivable optical networks. The evaluated RWA algorithms are mainly based on a shortest path algorithm, a shortest pairs of disjoint path algorithm and an simple wavelength assignment algorithm. The challenge is that the optimal solution for the RWA problem is not available in general, especially in medium and large size optical networks. In order to overcome with this challenge, we will find a lower bound of the optimal solution and evaluate the heuristic algorithms against the lower bound instead of the optimal solution. The results show that simple algorithms perform very well.
