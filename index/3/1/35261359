This workshop provides an introduction to three-dimensional (3D) printing. This tutorial will: cover the general background of 3D printing, summarize popular software tools, describe associated challenges and offer suggestions for application within computer science (CS) coursework. Participating CSE educators will get hands-on experience with 3D printing tools and will be able to print a limited number of items during the workshop. Attendees will perform a full lifecycle exercise in the printing workflow, progressing from a concept, to a digital model, to a physical implementation. The workshop will also describe the authors' experience integrating this authentic learning into several IT and CS courses. Experience gained will be useful after the session in both printer and printer-less environments. See http://tinyurl.com/k65jxsm for more information. Laptop required.
