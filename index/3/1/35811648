Jane Street Capital is a successful proprietary trading company that has shifted from developing software in mainstream programming languages to developing software almost entirely in OCaml, a statically typed functional programming language that has only modest industrial use. The scope of the enterprise is small but growing: Jane Street now has over 20 OCaml programmers that have collectively written hundreds of thousands of lines of OCaml code. OCaml is used for building everything from trading systems to research infrastructure to user interfaces to systems administration tools. This talk will discuss the motivations behind Jane Street's adoption of OCaml, and why we think that statically typed functional programming languages are such a good fit for the world of trading and finance.
