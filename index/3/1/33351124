A successful transition to using object technoIogy depends to a large degree on the attention paid to the organizational and cultural issues surrounding the transition. Problems are bound to arise as organizations and people struggle to move from using traditional and familiar methods of software development to a new and different approach required by the object-oriented paradigm These problems often act as barriers to the adoption of object technology. This workshop attempted to identify the cultural and organizational issues, which act as barriers to the successful adoption of object technology by sharing of participantsâ€™ experiences with the task of adopting object technology~ We also tried to identify methods and procedures which have proven successful in avoiding or overcoming these barriers.
