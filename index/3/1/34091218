Introduction Learning to use a text-editor can be difficult for novice users: extensive instruction is typically required and much t r ia l -and-error (e.g., Mack, Lewis & Carroll, 1983; Seybold, 1979). How can we design an editor interface that requires much less training and minimizes user difficulties? This paper discusses the design and initial evaluation of an editor prototype which tries (a) to get novices started doing meaningful work relatively quickly (e.g., in a half hour) with no explicit s tep-by-step instruction, and (b) minimize serious problems as novices master basic text-editing operations. The approach taken to achieve these goals was to try to be t te r accommodate empir ical ly ident i f ied expectations on the part of novices about how editing operations should work, and avoid problematical design features. Two lines of research contributed to identifying expectations and problems, and hence specifying a more intuitive interface design.
