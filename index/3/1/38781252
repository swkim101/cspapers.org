A novel material transport and handling system utilizing simultaneous information and power delivery is proposed. This system provides a convenient and unobtrusive method of sending documents, specimens, and material to multiple locations within a single building. It consists of a fixed track, central controller, central power supply, and multiple 'smart-carriers'. By using a fixed track, the system can be placed out of the way of normal ground level activity. The system allows for horizontal, as well as vertical travel. The 'smart-carriers' carry parcels along the tracks to and from various locations at the user's command. The 'smart-carriers' each have their own onboard micro-modem and controller. The track itself delivers the power and information signals to the smart-carriers. This design allows for a very simple and flexible system. Equation reduction was used to model a generic system with "n" smart carriers. Next, a powerline communication system was built and tested to evaluate the characteristics of the track. Protocols for communicating between the centralized controller and the carriers are introduced. Finally, a preliminary design of the proposed system is presented.
