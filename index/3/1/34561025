A little over five years ago Essex Community College moved from its quarters in churches, former barracks, and a local high school to a campus in northeast Baltimore County, Maryland, and began a period of dynamic growth which saw the faculty double twice in two years and the student enrollment grow from less than 2000 to more than 5000 today. With new staff and facilities, Essex began to develop new career programs and to strengthen the two year transfer programs already in existence. This paper relates the situations and experiences of the Division of Science and Mathematics and the Division of Business and Industrial Management in planning and implementing courses and programs in computer science. Discussed in historical order are: the creation of our first programming courses and the selection of computer hardware, the planning of career programs in data processing and computer technology, and the problems expected in implementing these programs and in establishing transfer programs in computer science.
