Girls and women continue to be underrepresented in technology one of the fastest growing fields in the U.S. economy. This persistent underrepresentation inhibits innovation by ignoring the diverse perspectives and life experiences women bring to invention and problem solving. Furthermore, disregard for girls' and women's participation perpetuates and exacerbates existing economic disparities for women. In the last decade, considerable research into increasing girls' participation in computing has emerged, but an up-to-date, easy-to-access synthesis of this research is lacking. This gap makes it difficult for educators and advocates to easily access the data they need to make compelling arguments about increasing girls' participation or to offer recommendations based on the latest research. To fill this gap, the National Center for Women & IT (NCWIT) has released a new, ground-breaking report that brings together the best available research in gender, technology, and K-12 education in a one-stop, easy-to-access resource, Girls in IT: The Facts. This poster session will provide an overview of the report. Attendees will gain access to the latest information on 1) the current state of affairs for girls in computing and the key barriers to increasing girls' participation in these fields. Most importantly, attendees will also learn about key promising practices and practical resources educators, policymakers, parents, and others can use to address these barriers. The ultimate goal of this session is to enable attendees to more effectively use this research to advocate for more inclusive computing curriculum, practices, and environments in K-12 contexts.
