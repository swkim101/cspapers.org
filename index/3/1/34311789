Many learning-by-example problems can be viewed as infering structured non recursive procedures from sets of their traces knowing the basic functions and predicates, used to write them. The on-line system PAPE does this as follows, an example (data â™¦ trace) is given. PAPE first checks whether the already learned procedure gives the same trace with the given input data. If not, the trace is transformed into a procedure body (in 0(tp) time, where t it is the length of the trace, and, p an integer depending upon the procedure and the basic functions and predicates), and then merges this body with the actual one to get the new procedure body.
