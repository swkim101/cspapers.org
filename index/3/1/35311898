We present a hierarchical control approach that can be used to fulfill autonomous flight, including vertical takeoff, landing, hovering, transition, and level flight, of a quadrotor tail-sitter vertical takeoff and landing unmanned aerial vehicle (VTOL UAV). A unified attitude controller, together with a moment allocation scheme between elevons and motor differential thrust, is developed for all flight modes. A comparison study via real flight tests is performed to verify the effectiveness of using elevons in addition to motor differential thrust. With the well-designed switch scheme proposed in this paper, the aircraft can transit between different flight modes with negligible altitude drop or gain. Intensive flight tests have been performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach in both manual and fully autonomous flight mode.
