Facial expression recognition (FER) is an important task in human- computer interaction systems to include emotion processing. In this work we present the recognition of facial expressions in OFDM systems. The original image is converted to binary code then it is transmitted via OFDM over a multi-path fading channel. The features are then extracted from the reconstructed image at the receiver based on the log Gabor filter. Finally, the features are classified using the naive Bayesian classifier. Simulation results on the Cohn-Kanade database show that the system obtains good results in the presence of noise in the received images.
