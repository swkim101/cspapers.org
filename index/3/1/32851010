Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is emerging as a key tool for data acquisition in many applications, and localization algorithms of the sensors have a vital importance due to the intrinsic characteristics of this type of networks. The objective of this paper is to propose an algorithm of range-free localization for WSNs using a mobile robot equipped with a rotary directional antenna. This algorithm, denominated as the azimuthally defined area localization algorithm (ADAL), is executed in each sensor node and is based only on the analysis of the information received from the mobile robot, therefore is energy efficient and contributes to extend the lifetime of the sensor network. Additionally the proposed algorithm has the advantage of being simple and economical. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is a practical, effective and accurate method to localize sensor nodes in a WSN.
