A data management system for art museums is presented. In additionto providing conventional cataloging functions such as searching,sorting and indexing, the system is shown to be able to modelcomplex relationships between entities relevant to the application.The importance of this capability with regard to representinghigher levels of information (beyond pure physical characteristics)is pointed out. Alternative representations of such relationshipsare discussed and some directions of further work in the area ofautomation of a museum's catalog is cited.
