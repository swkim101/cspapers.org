Current IP network cameras support live video and audio streaming through separate channels so that it is not easy to achieve video/audio synchronization at clients. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of versatile live multimedia streaming for DM36x-based IP network camera which can support not only streaming of existing various video formats (H.264, MPEG4, MJPEG) in many sizes and audio formats (AAC, PCM) but also streaming of MPEG2-TS. In order to support MPPEG2-TS live streaming, we first modify some of the MPEG2-TS related classes of LIVE555 (an open source multimedia streaming framework) and implement some new SW components. Next, we integrate them together flexibly so that the proposed system can support the versatile live multimedia streaming including MPEG2-TS. The proposed implementation of live MPEG2-TS is shown to achieve lip sync reasonably well in real-time by performing a VLC player at a client side.
