Island-driven parsing is of great relevance for speech recognition/understanding and other natural language processing applications. A bidirectional algorithm is presented that efficiently solves this problem, allowing both any possible determination of the starting words in the input sentence and flexible control. In particular, a mixed bottom-to-top and top-down approach is followed, without leading to redundant. partial analyses. The algorithm performance is discussed.
