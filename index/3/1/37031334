Often, family caregivers experience difficulties in coordinating older adults' health care because it requires not only a lot of time but also a diverse set of responsibilities to coordinate care for their loved ones. While many can reduce their individual burden by sharing care tasks with other family members, there are still many challenges to overcome in maintaining the quality of care when they work together. As they increase their informal care network, it becomes more difficult for them to stay informed and coordinated. Coordination breakdowns caused by having multiple caregivers who are cooperating to care for the same care recipient result in reduced quality of care. I explored opportunities for "Internet of Things (IoT)" technologies to help informal caregivers better coordinate and communicate care with each other for their loved ones. Based on identified design opportunities, I propose the concept of CareBot, a smart home platform consisting of interactive tools in support of collective care activities of family caregivers. \
