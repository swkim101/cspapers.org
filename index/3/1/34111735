In this paper, a new digital watermarking scheme that uses human visual system and the quadtree decomposition technique is proposed. The watermark image is split into the insignificant and significant parts respectively according to their importance in the image, then the split watermarks are embedded perceptually into the spatial and frequency domains. The embedding energy relies on the minimally-noticeable-distortion (MND) energy of the embedded position either in the spatial or frequency domain. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can resist the attacks such as image cropping, etc.
