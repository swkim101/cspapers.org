The widespread use of GPS-enabled devices has led to huge amounts of trajectory data. In addition to location and time, trajectories are associated with descriptive attributes representing different aspects of real entities, called multi-attribute trajectories. This comes from the combination of several data sources and enables a range of new applications in which users can find interesting trajectories and discover potential relationships that cannot be determined solely based on GPS data. In this demo, we provide the motivation scenario and introduce a system that is developed to integrate standard trajectories (a sequence of timestamped locations) and attributes into one unified framework. The system is able to answer a range of interesting queries on multi-attribute trajectories that are not handled by standard trajectories. The system supports both standard trajectories and multi-attribute trajectories. We demonstrate how to form queries and animate multi-attribute trajectories in the system. To our knowledge, existing moving objects prototype systems do not support multi-attribute trajectories.
