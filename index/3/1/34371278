This paper describes the design and proposed implementation of a new application program interface to a database management system. Programs which browse through a database making ad-hoc updates are not well served by conventional embedding of DBMS commands in programming languages. a new embedding is suggested which overcomes all deficiencies. This construct, called a portal, allows a program to request a collection Of tuples at once and supports novel concurrency control schemes.
