Huge amounts of search log data have been accumulated in various search engines. Currently, a commercial search engine receives billions of queries and collects tera-bytes of log data on any single day. Other than search log data, browse logs can be collected by client-side browser plug-ins, which record the browse information if users' permissions are granted. Such massive amounts of search/browse log data, on the one hand, provide great opportunities to mine the wisdom of crowds and improve search results as well as online advertisement. On the other hand, designing effective and efficient methods to clean, model, and process large scale log data also presents great challenges. In this tutorial, we focus on mining search and browse log data for Web information retrieval. We consider a Web information retrieval system consisting of four components, namely, query understanding, document understanding, query-document matching, and user understanding. Accordingly, we organize the tutorial materials along these four aspects. For each aspect, we will survey the major tasks, challenges, fundamental principles, and state-of-the-art methods. The goal of this tutorial is to provide a systematic survey on large-scale search/browse log mining to the IR community. It will help IR researchers to get familiar with the core challenges and promising directions in log mining. At the same time, this tutorial may also serve the developers of Web information retrieval systems as a comprehensive and in-depth reference to the advanced log mining techniques.
