This study introduces a novel conservative modulation and coding scheme to minimize and stabilize the delay incurred during the process of electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission over a wireless medium, while maintaining the desired level of the ECG pattern quality required for improving the chance of its interpretation. A machine-type communication system is adopted for the delivery of ECG data to benefit from its inherent reliability, pervasiveness, security, and performance of 4G long-term evolution technologies with reduced cost and enhanced coverage. Extensive evaluations indicate that the proposed system provides a sufficient level of service for medical-grade instantaneous ECG monitoring even under significantly deteriorated channel conditions.
