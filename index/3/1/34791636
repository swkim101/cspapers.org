There have been increasing interests in exploring the sensing capabilities of RFID beyond its basic identification task, to reveal more information of tagged objects and the physical world. Phase is a crucial physical feature for many RFID sensing applications, such as tag localization. Most existing methods rely on a low multipath environment for accurate phase measurement. Unfortunately, practical environments are highly likely to be multipath-revalent, especially for indoors. This paper presents the first work to extract "clean" phase measurement of RFID tags in multipath-prevalent environments. We propose CPEX (Clean Phase EXtraction) based on theoretical modeling, which is also validated via experimental results of our prototype implementation. We studied the performance of CPEX on tag localization. CPEX can achieve median errors of 4.3-6.4cm (in different setups), which is the most accurate 3D tag localization result in multipath-prevalent environments.
