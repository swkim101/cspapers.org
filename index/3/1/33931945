We are demonstrating a comprehensive solution that offers embedded wireless sensor network technology as standard web services. . The Arch Rock solution significantly simplifies the overall application and networking deployment process, as well as sensor data management. A rich set of Web Services APIs, capable of configuring and programming the sensor node tier, are exposed to make software development of wireless sensor networks as easy as standard web applications. The Arch Rock platform supports these abstractions and services in the sensor node tier with our TinyOS 2.0-based system and protocols that achieve great overall robustness, reliability and energy resource efficiency. The demonstration will leave users with a new kind of wireless sensor experience as well as an appreciation of where the technology is headed. The demonstration will consist of an embedded PC host on the Internet, which acts as a server and gateway to a set of wireless sensor motes distributed around the demo area. The motes are equipped with standard 802.15.4 radios. Our sensor node tier and protocols follow the open standard interfaces established by the TinyOS 2.0 working group. A low-power 15.4 radio stack is used to support energy efficient communications among these nodes. Upon it is a set of reliable and adaptive networking services to enable reliable dissemination from, and collection traffic to, the gateway in a multi-hop fashion. An embedded web services TinyOS component is introduced to abstract low-level kernel and networking related services. These services in turn expose high-level abstractions that are highly reusable and greatly simplify sensor net-
