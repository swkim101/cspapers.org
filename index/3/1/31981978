Finite state machines (FSM) have become a standard model for representing object behavior. In particular, UML introduces a FSM notation that is an object-oriented variant of hierarchical statecharts [2]. Development of a variety of software can be automated via code generation from FSM specifications. A FSM is defined by the following: a finite set of states, a finite set of event categories and transitions mapping some state-event pairs to other states and relevant actions.
