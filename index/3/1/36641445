Effect of switch resistance on comparator-based switched-capacitor (CBSC) circuits is investigated. It is shown that the switch size is a critical issue in CBSC circuits due to the uncontinuous nature of their charge transfer phase. The problem that arises from switches with high resistivity is described and a simple circuit-based solution is provided to obviate this problem.
