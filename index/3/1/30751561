The paper gives a review of teaching Computational Linguistics (CL) at the University of Tartu. The current curriculum foresees the possibility of studying CL as an independent 4-year subject in the Faculty of Philosophy on the bachelor stage. In connection with the higher education reform in Estonia, new curricula will be introduced from the next study year where the 3-year bachelor stage will be followed by a 2-year master's stage. It will then be possible to study CL proceeding from two paths: in the Faculty of Philosophy, and additionally also in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science. This way two types of specialists will be trained who will hopefully be able to complement each other in team-work.
