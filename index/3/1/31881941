Turbo Pascal has features which make it a good tool for introducing important concepts in CSl and CS2 classes. These concepts include procedural and data abstraction, informa.tion hiding and data encapsulation. In this paper we discuss abstract data types and those features of Turbo Pascal which can be used to implement abstract data types. We also discuss issues that arise in defining the capabilities of a unit that implements an abstract data type. These issues relate to the efficiency of the implementation and to the boundary separating the responsibilities of the implementor from the responsibilities of the user.
