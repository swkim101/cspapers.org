This paper presents some preliminary test results of a "recognition cone" vision system. (See 1-3 for fuller descriptions). A recognition cone uses a parallel-serial layered architecture that successively reduces the image as each layer processes it. Each layer contains a set of probabilistic "transforms" that combine diverse sources of contextually related information. Each transform looks at specified regions of the array and, if the combined weights of information found exceed the transform's threshold, then the transform implies a set of names and transforms to apply.
