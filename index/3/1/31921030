This paper describes an innovative, hands-on, lab-based, discussion-oriented approach to teaching the introductory course in computer science. Students acquire fundamental computer science concepts by writing code segments, functions, and programs using the very high-level programming language ISETL (Interactive SET Language). After developing the necessary problem solving skills in the supportive ISETL environment students transfer to Modula-2; since ISETLâ€™s syntax is very similar to Pascal/Modula-2, it has been our experience that students have very little difficulty making the transition, In addition to exposing students to both an interpreted and a compiled language, the course provides them with a broader view of computer science by introducing them to basic concepts in operating systems and computer architecture.
