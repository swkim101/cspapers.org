Since the earliest days of the Unix (tm) operating system, it was clear that, being impossible for a system administrator to monitor every single change in the le system, it would be a fertile playground for intruders. Every time intruders get into a Unix system, they tend to install a backdoor, just in case the hole they used to get in is xed. Usually this is accomplished by modifying a system executable to contain code that allows him/her to access the system without authentication. This action is commonly called \\le tampering" or \leaving a Trojan Horse". The program we present has the target to discover whether the integrity of a system has been compromised; in brief, we have developed a tool called ATP (Anti Tampering Program) which performs post-attack analysis.
