With the increase of communication demand and the emergence of new services, various wireless technologies have been deployed recently. To achieve the goal of ubiquitous communication, however, a universal platform is necessary to connect all the network facilities and make them communicate together. The transmission of radio on fiber (RoF) has been realized as an attractive means to reach this target. It can also be extended to radio on free space optics (RoFSO) providing communication means for heterogeneous wireless services where it is not easy or feasible to install optical fiber. In this paper, we introduce a newly developed advanced DWDM RoFSO system capable of transmitting multiple RF signals for ubiquitous wireless services. Initial results from preliminary tests under atmosphere influences will also be presented. The obtained results indicate satisfactory performance and potential of the RoFSO system in transferring RF signals. Long term experiments under actual deployment scenario will be conducted in Waseda University in Tokyo to confirm the suitability of the system.
