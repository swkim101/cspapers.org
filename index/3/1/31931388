A dataset with M items has 2M subsets anyone of which may be the one satisfying our objective. With a good data display and interactivity our fantastic pattern-recognition defeats the combinatorial explosion by extracting insights from the visual patterns. This is the core reason for data visualization. With parallel coordinates, as illustrated here, the search for relations in multivariate data is transformed into a 2-D pattern recognition problem. A geometric classification algorithm yields the classification rule explicitly and visually. The minimal set of variables, features, are found and ordered by their predictive value. A model of a country's economy reveals sensitivities, impact of constraints, trade-offs and economic sectors unknowingly competing for the same resources. A glimpse into this beautiful and powerful multidimensional geometry is shown at the end.
