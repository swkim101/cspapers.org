In this paper the effect of spatial correlation in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) system is investigated. Having some information about the channel of each active user in the transmitter, a linear precoder can be exploited in downlink situation to mitigate the effect of correlation in multiuser system environment which has not been addressed before. Simulation results illustrate that despite the number of interfering users, the anti-correlation precoder could mitigate the performance degradation caused by correlation.
