Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a method founded on sending electromagnetic waves which are transmitted from an antenna and reflect off layers or objects in the earth. GPR is used to detect objects buried in the ground and predict their depths, such as landmines, pipes and cables or any other dielectric material. GPR gives information about the ground infrastructures throughout the scanning of the surface to be examined. In this paper GPR method is used to determine the depth and diameter of the buried tube. The method is based on the analytic signal which is used to extract the signal envelope of GPR data to estimate the depth and the diameter of underground tube. The measurement value is approximately coherent with the real value. This proposed method achieves good result.
