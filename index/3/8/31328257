The Pioneers' Symposium provides a forum in which Software Engineering's next generation of researchers, faculty, and practitioners have the opportunity to interact with and learn from some of the field's pioneering thinkers. The invited speakers are individuals whose works are not only seminal, but have demonstrated enduring value to both the research and development communities. Attendees will have the opportunity to understand and discuss the speakers' views on 1) what software engineering professionals should know, 2) thinking critically about the field, and 2) what it takes to do work of lasting value.
