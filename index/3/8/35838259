We propose a two component fully-convolutional network for heatmap regression to perform multi-person pose estimation from images. The first component of the network predicts all body joints of all persons visible on an image, while the second component groups these body joints based on the position of the head of the person of interest. By applying the second component for all detected heads, the poses of all persons visible on an image are estimated. A subsequent geometric frame-by-frame tracker using distances of body joints tracks the poses of all detected persons throughout video sequences. Results on the PoseTrack challenge test set show good performance of our proposed method with a mean average precision (mAP) of 50.4 and a multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of 29.9.
