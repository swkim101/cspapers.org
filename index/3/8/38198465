Biological snakes' diverse locomotion modes and physiology make them supremely adapted for environment. The special structure of snakes and their unique movement offer them peculiar ability of climbing and moving even in some ill-conditioned environments such as on the marshland or in narrow tubes. In this paper, we first discuss the controllability of a 3-dimensional snake-like robot, and then show the controllability of the robot by computer simulation.
