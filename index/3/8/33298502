In this paper we show that, contrary to what is the case in what concerns contractions by a single sentence, there is not a system of spheres-based construction of multiple contractions which generates each and every transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction.

Furthermore, we propose two system of spheres-based constructions of multiple contractions which generate (only) transitively relational partial meet multiple contractions.
