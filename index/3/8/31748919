Intraquery parallelism has been recognized as a key requirement for DB2 major customers to allow data intensive queries with acceptable response time. DB2 delivers intraquery parallelism in three stages since DB2 Version 3 Release 1 in 1993. DB2 intraquery parallelism requires extensions on many DB2 components, such as optimizer, query executor, buffer manager, . ..etc. We briefly discuss the major issues in DB2 intraquery parallelism and the mechanisms used in our implementation.
