This paper demonstrates DISA, a higher-level writing assistant system, which analyzes the information structure of abstracts, and retrieves the knowledge according to the research goals from the related work. By incorporating the latest neural-network technologies including linguistically-informed neural-network and autoencoder, we construct an intelligent system which extends the scope of computeraided writing.
