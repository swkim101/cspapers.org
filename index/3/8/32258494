We proposed a new teleoperation method using the bilateral control to improve the operability of the laser scanning micromanipulation of the microobject. We propose indirect non-contact manipulation methods of the microbe. It has been reported that direct irradiation of the laser beam to the microbe may give some damage. This phenomenon depends on the target, wavelength, irradiation time and power of the laser. To avoid this problem, we proposed the indirect manipulation of the target by the laser trapped microtools. As a microtool, we tested a micro bead and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (LB) as a micro-chopsticks and a liposome as a micro capsule. Experimental results on indirect manipulation of the microbe are shown.
