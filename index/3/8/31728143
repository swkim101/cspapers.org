Recently proposed Story Cloze Test [Mostafazadeh et al. , 2016] is a commonsense machine comprehension application to deal with natural language understanding problem. This dataset contains a lot of story tests which require commonsense inference ability. Unfortunately, the training data is almost unsupervised where each context document followed with only one positive sentence that can be inferred from the context. However, in the testing period, we must make inference from two candidate sentences. To tackle this problem, we employ the generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate fake sentence. We proposed a C onditional GAN s (CGANs) in which the generator is conditioned by the context. Our experiments show the advantage of the CGANs in discriminating sentence and achieve state-of-the-art results in commonsense story reading comprehension task compared with previous feature engineering and deep learning methods.
