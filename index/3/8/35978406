The Master of Science in Management Systems within the School of Business at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville is an advanced degree designed to combine the professional qualifications and interests of students with study in the field of managerial information systems design and administration. The existing baccalaureate program entailed a specialization in information systems from the Management Science Department and numerous related positions were found in area businesses, but no advanced program was being offered in systems.
