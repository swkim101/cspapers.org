In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a RF-based device-free passive localization strategy using active RFID nodes. Patterns of the measured power on multiple radio links are used to determine the location of a person in a room in a home environment. We develop an adaptive algorithm and training technique to minimize multi-path effects. With experimental deployment in a 5 x 8 meters room, we demonstrate that our system can successfully localize an individual to a 30-inch grid square with an 97.2% accuracy and 0.36 meters average error distance.
