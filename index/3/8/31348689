In Grid computing multiple, incompatible middleware frameworks exist and are widely used in large research and production environments. Standard specifications for such Grid middleware are rarely available, and often still unstable. This hinders the ability of application programmers to write portable Grid application code.The Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA) is an ongoing standardization effort within the Open Grid Forum (OGF). The SAGA API provides a simple, uniform interface for applications which utilize very dynamic and heterogeneous Grid environments. With SAGA, programmers of high-level Grid application do not have to learn about underlying Grid middleware layers and frameworks.Our newly developed SAGA C++ reference implementation makes this API available for real-world applications, providing a flexible, extensible, portable, and generic framework usable in dynamic environments.This poster describes the key features of SAGA, and provides examples of its use from the C++ reference implementation.
