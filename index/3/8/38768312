Smartphones and tablets are now part of our everyday lives, facilitating access to information through intuitive graphical interfaces. They can make great devices to work with robots because they integrate a lot of sensors and reasonable computing power. Using ROS on those devices would facilitate code reuse and integration with existing robotics applications and libraries.
