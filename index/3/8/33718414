This paper describes a programming project used in CS2 classes to introduce trees as an abstract data type. The student is required to manipulate tree structures with a set of primitive functions supplied by the instructor. The student does not have access to the implementation details of these primitive functions, and is initially required to complete a series of exercises in which trees are handled abstractly. After completing this phase of the assignment, the student is required to write his or her own implementation of the primitive functions originally supplied. These are written in two different phases, one using dynamic storage, and the other using static storage. This emphasizes the concept of trees as an abstract data type, as well as the benefits of abstraction and information hiding.
