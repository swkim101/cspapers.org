The paper deals with a time varying intra-vehicle channel measurement in the 60 GHz millimeter wave (MMW) band using a unique time-domain channel sounder built from off-the-shelf components and standard measurement devices. The aim of the presented work is to describe the sounder architecture, the primary data processing technique, and preliminary results of measurements aimed at the effect of vehicle vibrations and twisting, and passengers moving in a car cabin. As the amplitude of the car cabin vibration and twisting had been supposed to be comparable with the MMW wavelength, some effect on the channel impulse response (CIR) and consequently on the delay-Doppler spread (DDS) was expected. Preliminary results confirm the correctness of this assumption and allow us to assess the effect of different above-mentioned phenomena. We tested the effect of driving the car on different types of road (bumpy road, flat road, highway, etc.). For comparison purposes we use DDS and statistics of CIR amplitudes calculated using the correlative technique applied to the pseudorandom binary sequence.
