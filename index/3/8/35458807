Relaxation labeling is a technique used in computer vision which parallels the operation of human vision. Weisstein et al. have developed an experimental method for investigating higher-level processes while maintaining a close tie to the underlying brain structure. Here we demonstrate that because of the close correspondence between relaxation labeling processes and neural network processes, the experimental results provide a basis for the design of relaxation labeling processes for vision.
