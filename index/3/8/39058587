In controlling the locomotion of the walker there appear problems associated with the necessity of constructing coordinated motion of the body and legs which ensures accomodation to irregularities of the terrain being overcome. The paper considers algorithms for selecting supporting points for legs and for gait synthesis at a prescribed curvilinear motion of the walker over the terrain with complex relief.
