In this paper, three peculiar in-pipe microrobots are presented. They are the result of investigations of 3 laboratories involved in the microrobotics workgroup of the French National Centre of the Scientific Research (CNRS). They have been conceived to answer the locomotion problem inside industrial tubes of small diameter. Each of them is specific to a particular set of conditions.
