In this project, we successfully applied iterative prototyping and participatory design to the design of a complex system --- a voice dialog design environment. The success case for this project is really a story about how we got "this far this fast." In less than four months, a mixed team of professional voice dialog designers and academic researchers were able to design and build a substantial core design environment. There were several unique aspects of our approach that contributed to the project's success. These include selection of the right high-level system substrate on which to build our design environment and creation of a participatory context conducive to iterative design methods.
