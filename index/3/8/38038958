A system is presented which makes possible the definition and manipulation of views by users who are not familiar with the overall organization of the database. The method used is interactive "conversation" and the user's view of data is an "abstract form" represented by a set of hierarchically related dataitems. A view is specified only in terms of a set of dataitems and the mappings required to materialize the data are automatically generated as the result of this conversation. The form becomes then the basis for accessing the database. Queries are submmited by specifying selection conditions on the fields of a form. Selected occurrences are retrieved from the database and may be scanned as conventional paper forms.
