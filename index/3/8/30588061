Over the last few years, Oracle has evolved its flagship relational database system into an Object-Relational system by adding an extensible type system, object storage, an object cache, an extensible query and indexing framework, support for multimedia datatypes, a server-based scalable Java virtual machine, as well as enhancing its SQL DDL and DML language. These extensions were done with the practical goal of bringing objects to mainstream use.
