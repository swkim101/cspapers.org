Model update is a formal approach to correct a system model M w.r.t some property not satisfied by M. In this work, we show how this formal approach can be used for plan and planning domain verification and update. While a model checking method can directly be used to perform plan verification, model update techniques can be used to either update an incorrect plan and\or update a planning domain specification. Well known model update approaches are based on CTL â€” a logic which does not take into account the actions. In previous work, we have proposed the alpha-CTL logic, a logic whose semantics is based on actions. Here, we are proposing a model update system based on alpha-CTL which is able to automatically modify a plan M, generating a new plan M' that satisfies phi or, if there is not such a plan, to automatically update the corresponding planning domain.
