We describe a system that can learn new procedure models effectively from one demonstration by the user. Previous work to learn tasks through observing a demonstration (e.g., Lent & Laird, 2001) has required observing many examples of the same task. One-shot learning of tasks presents a significant challenge because the observed sequence is inherently incomplete -- the user only performs the steps required for the current situation. Furthermore, their decision-making processes, which reflect the control structures in the procedure, are not revealed.
