This paper addresses the process of generating examples which meet specified criteria; we call this activity CONSTRAINED EXAMPLE GENERATION (CEG). We present the motivation for and architecture of an existing example generator which solves CEG problems in several domains of mathematics and computer science, e.g., the generation of LISP test data, simple recursive programs, and piecewise linear functions.
