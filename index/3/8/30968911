This paper describes a package of digital computer subprograms which provides control systems engineers at Autonetics with an easy-to-use, comprehensive, and flexible design-aid tool The subprograms are written in FORTRAN IV for the IBM 7094. Most of the subprograms are similar to ones found in almost every company's program files. They provide such standard capabilities as the generation of Bode plots, Root Locus plots, Nyquist plots, Nichols charts, and time and frequency response. The package contains three subprograms, however, which are not standard. These employ dichotomous techniques to generate transfer functions for active networks and continuous control systems. Since these techniques are currently attracting widespread interest, the three subprograms which implement them will be discussed in some detail.
