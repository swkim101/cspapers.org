Program acquisition is the transformation of a program specification into an executable, but not necessarily efficient, program that meets the given specification. This paper presents a solution to one aspect of the program acquisition problem, the incremental construction of program models from informal descriptions [1], in the form of a framework that includes (1) a formal language for expressing program fragments that contain informalities, (2) a control structure for the incremental recognition and assimilation of such fragments, and (3) a knowledge base of rules for acquiring programs specified with informalities.
