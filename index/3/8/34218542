Many feel K-12 computer science requires a large tech budget, a classroom full of laptops, tablets or robots, and an experienced tech teacher. This belief is not unfounded as the majority of online computer science teaching materials require modern technology and Internet connectivity, making these tools inaccessible to the low-tech classroom. As a solution, we developed SASÂ® CodeSnaps, a free tool that provides an engaging coding experience with minimal technology. One iPad and one robot (www.sphero.com) are all that is needed for every student in a classroom to code. With CodeSnaps, students program together using printable coding blocks. When their program is ready, they "snap" a picture using the CodeSnaps app which digitizes their code and executes it on a robot, allowing students to see their program execute in the real world. In this poster we present lesson plans for both a single engagement with students as well as week-long introduction to CS fundamentals centered around the CodeSnaps app. We also discuss results from two pilot studies designed to measure student engagement during these lessons.
