Spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) has been proposed to be an excellent candidate for substituting traditional memory due to its fascinating features such as high density and low power. Memory partitioning is an efficient strategy to overcome the obstacle of memory bandwidth limiting speed of parallel data access. However, the performance is unsatisfactory, while previous memory partitioning methods are applied to STT-RAM, since they have no regard for the problem of read disturbance. In this paper, a disturbance aware memory partitioning (DaMP) method for STT-RAM is proposed. The experimental results show DaMP outperforms state-of-the-art method in terms of bank number, storage overhead, performance and searching speed.
