The number of PhD students researching Computer Science Education worldwide is growing. This is an organized opportunity for all those attending the largest Computer Science Education Conference to meet one another. All attendees will be invited to introduce themselves along with their institution and focus of research. They may also propose the most important question to be answered by the BOF. After introductions the attendees will have the opportunity to discuss research goals, job opportunities and career trajectories, future conference and publication plans, and even compare advisor stories. Undergraduates and masters students interested in a CS Ed PhD are also encouraged to attend and ask questions. Attendees will determine the best way to stay connected and everyone will be given the opportunity to opt-in for future communications.
