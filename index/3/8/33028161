Open Data Kit (ODK) is an open-source, modular toolkit that enables organizations to build application-specific mobile information services in resource-constrained environments. Feedback from users and developers about limitations experienced with the ODK 1.x set of tools led to a redesign of the system architecture and the creation of new tools. This demonstration presents a revised tool suite called ODK 2.0. This expanded ODK toolkit aims to increase an organization's data collection and management capabilities by supporting data synchronization, adaptable workflows, more configurable presentation screens, and increasing the diversity of input types by enabling new data input methods on mobile devices.
