Motivation and Objective: Earlier social studies, e.g., Homophily [Lazarsfeld and Merton (1954)], have shown that people tend to have similarities with others in close proximity. In our demo, coined O’BTW, we exploit the ubiquity of mobile phones and resource-rich users’ social structure to develop opportunistic similarity-based mobile social networking applications. O’BTW exploits these key social insights to define new peer-to-peer networking regimes. O’BTW creates endless possibilities for highly personalized apps based on phone-to-phone communications, e.g., location-based services, targeted ads, dating and social networking apps and establishing trust. System Overview: O’BTW demo hosts three major research components: I. Introducing generalized mobile user profile structures that capture relevant factors in assessing user similarity. In O’BTW, we employ a general profile that incorporates different facets, like digital (e.g. visited websites) and physical footprints (physically visited sites), ratings, tips, etc. Additionally, our profile incorporates a temporal dimension that enriches the profile and improves the similarity assessment. II. Developing novel similarity assessment tools that feature both high accuracy and low complexity. In O’BTW, we introduce Vectorized Cosine similarity metric for temporal profiles. This metric enjoys the computational simplicity of non-temporal similarity assessment for non-temporal profiles, e.g, Cosine similarity chosen for its superior performance and the richness brought in by incorporating the temporal dimension into the user profile, e.g., SVD-based similarity [1]. III. Designing DTN profile dissemination policies that compromise the tradeoff between forwarding overhead and de-
