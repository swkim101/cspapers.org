Computer Science as an academic discipline should be guided not only by the "state of the art", but also by the "state of the practice"[1]. Over the last few years, Internet/Web has been undeniably the most "high profile" practice of computing. Yet, Computer Science curricula across the country have not kept up with this development - not many schools are offering courses, concentrations and/or majors that identify the Internet/Web as the central principle, and address its issues and needs.In this panel, the panelists will share their experience designing courses and concentrations to address this need, and present their vision for what an Internet-related Curriculum should include: the courses, the technologies, and the overarching themes. The viewpoints presented here are quite diverse: arguing in favor of Internet-related coursework for majors versus non-majors, as a course/minor/major, as an across-the-curriculum theme, as an interdisciplinary endeavor, as an introductory course versus a capstone course, and from the points of view of a community college, four-year institutions and a graduate institution. We hope that these diverse viewpoints will foster vigorous discussion at the panel about the place of Internet-Computing in the Computer Science curriculum, and its design.
