The proposed configuration is a natural fit for domain description and learning with hidden subgroups. We first provide generalization risk bound in terms of the Rademacher complexity of the classifier, and then a large margin multi-Î½ learning objective with tunable training error bound is formulated. Seeing that the corresponding optimization is non-convex and existing methods severely suffer from local minima, we establish a new algorithm, namely Parametric Dual Descent Procedure (PDDP) that can approach global optimum with guarantees. The bases of PDDP are two theorems that reveal the global convexity and local explicitness of the parameterized dual optimum, for which a series of new techniques for parametric program have been developed. The proposed method is evaluated on extensive set of experiments, and the results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art approaches.
