The word “innovative” in the title of this paper does not imply that the colleges involved have found or invented some new computer technology to apply to instruction and research. If the word innovative in appropriate at all, it applies to the way we are using the computer or to the fact that for the first time students in a few minority institutions have access to what maybe one of the most valuable tools in education.
 I have long advocated that the motivational effect and other advantages of the instructional uses of computers should be applied where it is needed most. It is my opinion that the culturally and economically advantaged students (for example, those students who can afford to go to college in Hanover, N. H.) would be successful in college and life with or without access to computer based instruction. However, this may not be true for some students who go to college in Itta Bena, Ms. There is a great need to motivate and provide individualized instruction for students who have net been exposed to many of the advantages of our society.
