This paper presents a practical control method for the robot satellite attitude to cope with manipulator reaction on free-floating space robots, developing the computed-momentum based reaction compensation (CMRC) concept. The author proposes versions of the CMRC control schemes based on angular momentum conservation in floating multi-link systems, practical schemes which require far less computation than the computed-torque based methods. The proposed schemes are demonstrated and examined by computer simulations using a realistic 3D model which involves the free-floating dynamics and the structural vibration of solar paddles.<<ETX>>
