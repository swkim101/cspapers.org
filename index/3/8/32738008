The workshop represented a variety of styles for representing business rules. All, except for Lucia Dinoto, somehow related the business rules to the use cases. In most cases a repository, external to the use cases, documented the individual business rules and the use cases referenced the business rules by way of pointers. Lucia Dinoto, in searching for a common way to express rules independent of the use cases, represented business rules as patterns in a class diagram. He did this because “...use cases were a key to linking the system and the users.”
