This paper reports on the development and use of a questionnaire survey instrument to measure student attitudes about computer ethics and academic honesty. Through the use of factor analysis, four subscales have been defined for further research usage. When used in classrooms, only a few items indicated attitude differences between class levels or genders. Further instrument refinement is suggested.
