A novel way of programming an associative processing system, CASSM, and its prospective applications are described Associative programming techniques allow programs to be activated or deactivated in an associative memory based on very high level data conditions. Data can be searched and different segments of instructions can be activated for execution simultaneously by a set of parallel operating processors. Techniques for handling the conventional programming concepts such as addressing modes, branching, loop, loop control, subroutine, etc., are available and are shown to be quite different from those used in conventional processors. Data base problems such as data protection and integrity, management by exception, and search and retrieval can be accommodated nicely by the parallel organization of data and program segments in the data base. The programming techniques described here are useful toward building a stand-alone associative processing system in which complex algorithms can be carried out directly without the control of a conventional processor.
