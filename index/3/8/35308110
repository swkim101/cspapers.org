This paper describes an Automatic Schematic Drawing program developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories. This computer drawing program is written in the Macro Assembly Language. It is designed to permit the automatic generation of schematic drawings for digital equipment. Data—regarding electrical components and connectivity—is extracted from a master design file and processed by the program on either the IBM 7090/94 or IBM 7040/44 computer. Graphic output is provided by the Stromberg-Carlson 4020 High Speed Microfilm Recorder.
 Before discussing the drawing program, an outline of the design procedures employed for digital equipment will be presented. The emphasis will be upon those design procedures where the automatic design capabilities are maximally employed. This outline provides background for the environment in which the drawing program operates, the type of data with which it works, and the role it plays in the design feedback loop.
