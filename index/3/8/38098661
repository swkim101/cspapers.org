Visualization and animation have been used to graphically illustrate various concepts in computer science. This paper describes an animated simulator for packet sniffer. The goal of this tool is to provide users with interactive tutorials and simulations to help them better understand the security concept packet sniffer and related computer networks concepts. This tool can be used in an introductory level computer security course or a computer networks course. It can be used by the instructor in the classroom, and can also be used by the students outside the classroom. This tool will be used in our institute and its effectiveness in teaching and learning will be assessed.
