Robotic systems are used to perform maintenance functions in hazardous environments usually with the fundamental objective of reducing, or eliminating, human worker exposure to dangers. An obvious thought is how might Internet capabilities be used in such operations. This paper considers this general idea in terms of the practical needs, constraints, and concept that are associated with the notion of using the emerging Internet to reduce costs and enhance overall performance in robotic maintenance in hazardous environments.
