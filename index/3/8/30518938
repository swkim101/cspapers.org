As the smartphone has become more widely available, we easily take photos and upload them online to share with others. Photographs are abundant, but they are not used properly, even though they provide meaningful information about the social scenes of our daily lives. To address this issue, Histogram was created as a new interface for displaying and sharing location-related photographs chronologically to trace the changes in a location. The prototype of this system is mobile-optimized to encourage users to easily upload photos with their smartphones, so that the system can be run through social cooperative work.
