The ubiquity of smartphones and mobile and wearable devices allow people to collect information about their health, wellness and lifestyle and share with others. If it is not clear what they need to share to receive benefits, subjects (people whose information is collected) might share too much, thus disclosing unnecessary private information. On the other hand, concerned about disclosing personal information, subjects might share less than what the recipient needs and lose the opportunity to enjoy the benefits. This balance of disclosure and utility is important when the subject wants to receive some benefits, but is concerned about disclosing private information. We address this problem of balancing disclosure and utility of personal information collected by mobile technologies. We believe subjects can decide how best to share their information if they are aware of the benefits and risks of sharing. We developed ShareBuddy, a privacy-aware architecture that allows recipients to request information and specify the benefits the subjects will receive for sharing each piece of requested information; the architecture displays these benefits and warns subjects about the risks of sharing. We describe the ShareBuddy architecture in this poster.
