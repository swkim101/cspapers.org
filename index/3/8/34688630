This paper describes a high-frame-rate (HFR) vision system that can detect multiple objects in an image of 512 Ã— 512 pixels at 12,000 frames per seconds (fps). An optimized algorithm is proposed based on conventional Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptor and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithms for hardware implementation. By implementing the proposed algorithm on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) of a high-speed vision platform, multi-object in an image can be detected at 12,000 fps under complex background. In hardware implementation, 64 pixels were processed in parallel with 80 MHz camera clock. Source image and detection results can be transferred to personal computer (PC) in real-time for recording or post-processing. Our developed HFR multi-object detection system was verified by performing several evaluations.
