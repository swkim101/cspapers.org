The growth of the Web and user bases lead to important performance problems for large-scale Web search engines. The LSDS- IR '11 workshop focuses on research contributions related to the scalability and efficiency of distributed information retrieval (IR) systems. The workshop also encourages contributions that propose different ways of leveraging diversity and multiplicity of resources available in distributed systems. More specifically, we are interested in novel applications, models, and architectures that deal with efficiency and scalability of distributed IR systems.
