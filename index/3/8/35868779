The problem of controlling a prosthetic upper limb with several active degrees of freedom is approached by dividing the learning load between the user and a microprocessor-based controller. The user learns to generate clear command signals and an artificial neural net learns to transform these commands into positions or movement of the artificial limb. A five-degree-of-freedom whole-arm prosthesis has been built and is controlled by sensing electric muscle potentials and movements of the shoulder. >
