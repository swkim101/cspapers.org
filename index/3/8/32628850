Computer vision systems based on general purpose computers often need efficient texture description algorithms. One common method is to calculate two-dimensional discrete Fourier transforms over windowed regions of the light intensity matrix. Although these methods described in the literature are based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm, the computation time is still too high to permit the description of texture for as many windows as are needed for good segmentation. When a set of transforms over a window at every position of the matrix is needed, an efficient method can be used. It saves information computed for previous windows and uses it to reduce the effort expended on the current window. For a window N × N and an image matrix M × M, the time complexity is reduced from O(N2M2logN) to O(N2M2). This complexity cannot be beaten by any nonparallel algorithm.
