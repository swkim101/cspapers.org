Energy saving is the main goal in most building energy monitoring applications. These systems, however, are operated by people. For this reason, an intuitive user interface is an essential element that will affect users' data understandability, thereby determining the system's usability. Traditional energy monitoring generally focuses on getting energy information by utilizing graphs or static text interfaces. However, these approaches are not related to the physical space. With the increase of information in energy monitoring systems, intuitive and efficient ways of displaying information are needed. In this demo, we present iCEnergy, a vision-based mobile information interface that provides power monitoring using augmented reality. Using existing system data, the system overlays an interactive "energy cloud" over corresponding devices in order to illustrate information about the physical environment. This approach aims to provide users with a comfortable interaction experience through its intuitive information display.
