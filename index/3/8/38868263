In many of the challenges faced by the modern world, from overcrowded transportation systems to overstretched healthcare systems, large benefits for society come about from small changes by very many individuals. We survey the problems and the cost they impose on society, and describe a framework for designing "nudge engines"---algorithms, incentives and technology for influencing human behavior. We present a model for analyzing their effectiveness and results from transportation pilots conducted in Bangalore, at Stanford and in Singapore, and a wellness program for the employees of Accenture-USA.
