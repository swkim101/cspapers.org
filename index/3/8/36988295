Building on existent robotics knowledge to model and simulate anthropomorphic kinematics is an appealing approach, because sound knowledge gained in the fields of multi-robot and multi-agent systems can be applied. This provides-with little additional effort-the "new human" with capabilities ranging from natural arm movement up to the coordinated operation of his arms and the cooperation between multiple anthropomorphic kinematics. The same general hierarchical control structure that has successfully been used to control multi-robot systems for space and industrial application has therefore been enhanced to incorporate the newly required capabilities. The enhancements focus on a new approach to on the one hand consider human extremities as articulated robots which are mechanically connected to make up the body-and on the other hand to provide a control strategy to move the full body correctly under equilibrium conditions. We provide an overall control structure that preserves the capabilities of the single robots and introduces "sensible couplings" to move the body as a whole in a naturally looking way. As described in the paper, this work is currently being applied to several application fields in industry up to the simulation of astronauts' work on the International Space Station.
