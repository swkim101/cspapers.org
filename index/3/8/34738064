This paper presents a comprehensive cross-layer analysis framework on the performance of transmission control protocol (TCP) over free-space optical (FSO) links, which employ the automatic repeat request (ARQ) and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) schemes. From the framework, we quantify the impacts of different parameters/settings of ARQ, AMC and FSO links on TCP throughput performance. We also discuss several optimization aspects for TCP performance.
