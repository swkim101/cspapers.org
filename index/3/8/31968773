Despite significant recent progress on approximating graph spanners (subgraphs which approximately preserve distances), there are still several large gaps in our understanding. We give new results for two of them: approximating basic k-spanner (particularly for small k), and the dependence on f when approximating f-fault tolerant spanners. We first design an O(n1/3)-approximation for 4-spanner (both basic and directed). This was the last value of k for which only an O([EQUATION])-approximation was known for basic k-spanner, and thus implies that for any k the approximation ratio is at most O(n1/3). For basic k-spanner, we also show an integrality gap for the natural flow-based LP (the main tool in almost all nontrivial spanner approximations) which nearly matches the trivial approximation of n [EQUATION]. For f-fault tolerant spanners, we show that in the small-stretch setting (k âˆˆ {3, 4}) it is possible to entirely remove the dependence on f from the approximation ratio, at the cost of moving to bicriteria guarantees. The previous best dependence on f was either almost-linear (in the undirected setting) or exponential (in the directed setting for stretch 4).
