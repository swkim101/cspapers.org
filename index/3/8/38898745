A differential output is provided from a single-ended input by a switched-capacitor stage having a through-switched capacitor coupled via an amplifier to one output terminal and a diagonally-switched capacitor coupled via an amplifier to another output terminal. Each amplifier is provided with a through-switched negative feedback capacitor. A delay inherent in the switching of the diagonally-switched capacitor provides an interpolation effect in the differential output.
