The object-oriented model is very successful to represent various phenomena in our real world from an entity-category point of view. However, it is not sufficient to model the dynamic actions of autonomous entities under this paradigm. This model is in short of representing the relationships between entities and the environments. In this paper, we propose an experimental object-oriented programming language to manage the relationships together.
