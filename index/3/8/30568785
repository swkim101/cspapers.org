To address the alarming decrease in students in Rhode Island computer science programs and the under-representation of women and minorities, we have devised a program to introduce students to research in computer graphics, art and new media. This program integrates good mentoring practice and pedagogy, including problem-based learning. Special attention is paid to creating a cohort of students who come together every week to learn about the research process, and ethical and societal issues related to it. Each student takes a small project from the proposal stage, through design and implementation, to publication and presentation. We report on the first two years of the program.
