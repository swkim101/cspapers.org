The print head of a serial printer includes a protruding plug which is seated and locked into a receptacle on a translating carriage. An endless belt has teeth engaged in a correspondingly contoured groove of the carriage for positive connection between carriage and belt, whereby the head traverses the printing medium for printing thereon. The platen is positively and simply held and includes a resin surface for impact of print wires. The gap between the head and platen is readily adjusted in steps by motion of a lever.
