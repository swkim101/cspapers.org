The first course in Computer Science at the University of Scranton has evolved over a number of years as a course in problem solving utilizing the computer. Bearing in mind that such a course should provide relatively standard programming tools, the course uses a structured derivative of FORTRAN promoting top-down stepwise refinement in programming methodology as well as encourages the utilization of “packaged programs”. We now have a course that provides a solid foundation for computer science majors as well as offers an excellent introduction to computing to those students for whom the course has a service purpose. This has been accomplished with a minimal faculty at a small university.
