The workshop is examining several approaches that leverage the social side of the search process on two main contexts: (a) using social data for improving search and recommendations, and (b) search as a social process, collaborative IR (e.g., [1, 4, 3, 2]). On the first context, we expect to attract contributions that use the social dimension in different methods for personalization and search, such as data from online social networks, social tagging systems, online forums and communitybased Q&A.
