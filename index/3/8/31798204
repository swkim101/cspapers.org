Many of us who teach introductory computing courses to nonmajors have seen instances where former students in such courses return to campus some years later exclaiming that now they see the light â€“ where computers were once uninteresting to them, the machines are so much used and useful on the job that now these alumni are fascinated with them. In an attempt to capture at least a portion of that element of the job environment that stimulates interest in computing and computers, we have designed a course that immerses the student in a fairly sophisticated computing environment wherein students use computers not only for exercises outside class, but for virtually everything related to the class. They use it for note-taking, for in-class demonstrations, for class discussions, for handing in and returning homework and tests, and for outside projects. In short, the student, like the employee on the job, is forced to become comfortable with the computer as an everyday necessity.
