This paper introduces a Web site structure model called UriGraph and, using the model, describes several important patterns of site structure. Web site structure is defined as the collective information about the identity, identifier, position and composition of every resource constituting the Web site. UriGraph models the site's resource identifiers and through them the resource identity and composition, and indirectly the resource position. UriGraph is designed specifically for the Web and it is compatible with the current practice. It can be represented graphically and as an XML document.
