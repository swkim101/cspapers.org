Quantitative studies of learning using block-based programming languages in informal environments have relied on identifying the presence or absence of individual visual blocks in learners' projects. Many important programming concepts (e.g., initializing a variable) involve the combination of several blocks. In this poster, we present a technique that uses a statistical method from epidemiology called "survival analysis" to model the rate at which programmers begin to use new code patterns. By analyzing data drawn from the trajectories of over 90,000 users from the Scratch online community, we demonstrate the potential of our approach. In particular, we model when users are at higher and lower levels of "risk" of demonstrating two particular code patterns -- variable initialization and counting collisions. We show that learning of these patterns is associated with behaviors like viewing the source code of other projects, remixing, and commenting. We explain how our method can be extended to help understand predictors of skill acquisition in informal environments more generally and how it can inform the design of more effective learning support structures.
