Hosts are under EMCON condition, short for Emission Control, when they are prohibited from transmitting any data. Under such condition, hosts can only receive data passively and can not acknowledge any data reception. This unidirectionality of the communication channel breaks down all currently defined transport protocols. In this paper, we present architectural alternatives that would support limited communication service under such condition and also discuss other open issues.
