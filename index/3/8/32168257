Extreme programming is the latest rage, everyone is talking extreme, but who is doing it? XP is in the words of one proponent, is a “lightweight, efficient, low-risk, predictable, scientific, and fun way to develop software”. XP bundles much conventional software engineering wisdom into a practice with a high degree of appeal as a cool technology. Questions for inquiring minds include: Will XP deliver? Will XP scale? How will products based on software developed by XP practices age? What are the elements of XP that can be effectively adopted by organizations outside the XP envelop, e.g. large teams, real-time systems, etc. Is XP the next “silver bullet”?
