Designers of AI educational systems have largely ignored the problem of choosing what information to present and how to present it because systems to date have not been faced with a large space of possible presentations. This paper explains how a student model can provide the knowledge needed to make presentation decisions. Systems that use a student model for this purpose can make problems more interesting, challenging, and hand-tailored to students. We describe DECIDER: a program that improves student's decision-making abilities by constructing an environment where they can confront problems and decide on a plan of action. DECIDER chooses from a database of decision-making problems and varies how it presents those problems based on a model of the student's knowledge of goals, plans, and priorities.
