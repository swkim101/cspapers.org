Rotary-Wing Air Vehicles (RW-UAVs), also referred to as drones, have gained in popularity over the last few years. Intrusions over secured areas have become common and authorities are actively looking for solutions to detect and localize undesired drones. The sound generated by the propellers of the RW-UAVs is powerful enough to be perceived by a human observer nearby. In this paper, we examine the use of particle filtering to detect and localize in 3D the position of a RW-UAV based on sound source localization (SSL) over distributed microphone arrays (MAs). Results show that the proposed method is able to detect and track a drone with precision, as long as the noise emitted by the RW-UAVs dominates the background noise.
