In this paper, we present exact analytical expressions for the outage probability of cooperative diversity wireless relay networks operating in various decode-and-forward (DF) protocols (fixed, adaptive, and incremental relaying) under Rayleigh fading conditions. Current works only analyze the asymptotic behavior of these protocols, either under high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) or under low SNR-low rate conditions. Our analytical results are presented in such a way that they can be used for both asymptotic conditions.
