Production systems have been used for representing domain-specific knowledge in a number of successful AI projects. In this short paper, we present a general concept of hierarchical production system (HPS). The HPS is an extended version of the current production system, in which two hierarchical structures of rules are employed. In one hierarchical structure, heuristic rules for conflict resolution are embedded and in another one, domain-specific rules are represented. The introduction of the hierarchical rule structures makes the HPS to be a useful framework for constructing knowledge-based systems.
