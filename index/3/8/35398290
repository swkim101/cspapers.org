First, we construct an argument embedding and then develop a indicator vector of the suffix such as a Josa. And, we construct an argument tuple by concatenating above two vectors. The role induction is performed by clustering the argument tuples.These method which achieves up to a 70.16% of F1-score and 75.85% of accuracy.
