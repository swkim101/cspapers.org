A high-speed, floating-point array processor 150AP is described in this paper. It is designed to interface to the host computer 150, a general-purpose computer made in China. The internal organization of 150AP is well suited to perform huge numbers of multiplications and additions required in seismic data processing. The maximum speed is 14M flops. An experimental model has been set up to check the hardware design and is able to run at 20 million operations per second. The 150AP processor is intended to be used in Chinese petroleum exploration.
