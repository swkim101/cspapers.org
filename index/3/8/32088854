We propose "SmileWave", the first selfie social networking service to reveal the existence of emotional cognation through smiling selfies on the social network. We conducted multiple rounds of in-the-wild user studies with 86 cumulative total users for total duration of 5 weeks. Throughout the entire study, we confirmed the occurrence of smile-based emotional contagion over social network, not only in the momentary duration but in longer term period.
