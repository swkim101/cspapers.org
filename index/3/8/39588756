This paper proposes potential field techniques for control of a link mechanism based on a decentralized management and an approach to describing a mathematical model of autonomous machines. To control the group of machines, there are two categories of method, one was based on central control and the other on parallel distributed control. A popular method for control machines is the so-called potential method, which has been applied to navigation for automatically guided vehicles in a stable working space. Since the potential function of the working space must be determined at every instant for an unstable working space, an efficiency of the potential method becomes low. To modify the potential function local, an approach called the vibrating potential method (VPM) is introduced. With this method, there are many cases where high-performance information processing can be attained without supervision. This paper proposes a new control method based on VPM and discusses its application to the grasping problem of free form objects.
