Since 1956 the academic program in Computer Science at Michigan State University has grown from a single course offering to the stature of a regular academic department offering bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees and serving over 1700 students in a single term. The development of this program from its beginnings through its growth to its present size and stature is traced in this paper. Included are descriptions of the current undergraduate and graduate programs and a compilation of the resource allocations to the department over the several years. Growth of the Computer Laboratory facilities is also indicated along with a listing of courses offered to non-majors and a summary of interactions with other units of the university.
