There is an increasing interest in the area of Learning in Computer Vision and Image Understanding, both from researchers in the learning community and from researchers involved with the computer vision world. The field is characterized by a shift away from the classical, purely model-based, computer vision techniques, towards data-driven learning paradigms for solving real-world vision problems.
