Recent work in machine learning and NLP has developed spectral algorithms for many learning tasks involving latent variables. Spectral algorithms rely on singular value decomposition as a basic operation, usually followed by some simple estimation method based on the method of moments. From a theoretical point of view, these methods are appealing in that they offer consistent estimators (and PAC-style guarantees of sample complexity) for several important latent-variable models. This is in contrast to the EM algorithm, which is an extremely successful approach, but which only has guarantees of reaching a local maximum of the likelihood function. From a practical point of view, the methods (unlike EM) have no need for careful initialization, and have recently been shown to be highly efficient (as one example, in work under submission by the authors on learning of latent-variable PCFGs, a spectral algorithm performs at identical accuracy to EM, but is around 20 times faster).
