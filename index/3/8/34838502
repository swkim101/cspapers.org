This paper is concerned with the Optimal Sliding Mode Control (OSMC) for trajectory tracking of Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. Integrating the first-order sliding mode control (SMC) with Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR) is employed to design an optimal sliding manifold and a global robust control law for asymptotically stabilizing the system to a desired trajectory. The applicability and the efficiency of our approach are illustrated by simulation results for 2-link robot manipulators to show its effectiveness.
