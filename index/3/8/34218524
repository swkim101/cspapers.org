In this paper, we first describe some "goal-unreachable" problems found in fuzzy logic-based algorithms for mobile robot navigation systems. Then, a new algorithm is developed to solve one of the problems, i.e., a problem with nearby obstacles. The resulting navigation system has been implemented on a real mobile robot, Koala, and tested in various environments. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness and improvement of the resulting fuzzy navigation system over conventional fuzzy-logic navigation algorithms.
