The task understanding is examined for a popular task of the crank turning by a robot manipulator. A mathematical task model embedded uncertain factors as unknown parameters is constructed, and by analyzing the model, a robust task strategy to revolute the crank is contrived. It is shown how to design a robot controller to execute the task strategy. A controller is designed as an example and the validity of the controller is investigated by simulation.<<ETX>>
