Recent developments in both information and communication security have heightened interest in enhancing the embedding capacity for data handling techniques. Although many steganographic techniques, in the literature, have been developed for this purpose, most of them distort the quality of the host-signal during data embedding and the changes will be become visible to the human eye especially for those signals distributed via the Internet which must be processed by a low bit rate compression due to bandwidth limitations. Therefore, the challenge is to create a steganographic technique that is able to hide acceptable amount of data without altering the quality of the host-signal. In this paper, pixel-value differencing (PVD) steganographic scheme and its two modified versions, namely, enhanced pixel-value differencing (EPVD) and tri-way pixel-value differencing (TPVD) were implemented, analyzed and compared in terms of invisibility, fidelity and impact of data hiding on the compression efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the EPVD scheme is capable of providing better performance than other compared schemes.
