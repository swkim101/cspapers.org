One of the fundamental problems still to be solved in database management systems (DBMS) is the automatic management and self-tuning of data statistics which are used by the query optimizer as well as by the execution engines for runtime optimization. After decades of research, there is universal agreement that the absence of data statistics results in poor performance of a DBMS [3]. Data statistics can be very expensive to create and maintain when data changes [4], hence careful consideration must be given to the selection of the set of data statistics which are the most useful given the current physical design, the current data, and the current database workload. In this paper, we present the DataStatistics Adviser project which addresses the problems related to dynamic selection, self-tuning, and self-management of data statistics that adapt to the current characteristics of the database (e.g., physical design, base data), current workload, and the current implementation of the query optimizer and execution engines. We consider data statistics which need to be explicitly created in the database (e.g., using CREATE STATISTICS DDL) as opposed to runtime statistics which are easily obtained from other database objects. For example, dictionaries of a non partitioned column store table provide a precise number of distinct values for each column without of overhead of maintaining statistics objects. The main goal of the project is to automatically predict and determine the most useful data statistics set which should currently be defined in the database by creating and dropping data statistics as characteristics of the system and
