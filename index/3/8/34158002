A complete design and specification of a database application must include both structural and behavioural properties. Structure deals with states and static properties while behaviour concerns state transitions and dynamic properties. Most approaches to database design emphasize the importance of behaviour but provide few concepts or tools for behaviour modelling and integrating behaviour and structure. This paper presents forms of abstraction for behaviour modelling in the context of a well-known semantic data model. Behaviour schemes are presented as aids for behaviour modelling at a gross level of detail. Behaviour specifications are introduced for the precise definition of behavioural properties.
