Nowhere is the lag between database theory and database practice more apparent than with respect to the issue of time. Beg inning long before the advent of database management systems, econometr ic ians, industrial applications programmers and systems staff have been building programs and procedures for handling time-series data. It is one of the failures of the "three great data models‚Äù that none has addressed this issue. With the promise of several new technologies that will make feasible the storage of orders of magnitude more data on a single type of storage medium, it behooves us in the database research community to address the issue of databases and time. We have the opportunity to explore theoretical issues of time and its database properties and to develop d isc ipl ined models for its use, so as to guide and enhance practical attempts to deal with these issues, and to avoid merely ad hoc -solutions to the growing danand for more time-oriented data and information.
