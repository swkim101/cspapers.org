Supervised machine learning methods which learn from labelled (or annotated) data are now widely used in many different areas of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. There are widespread data annotation endeavours but they face problems: there are a large number of languages and annotation is expensive, while at the same time raw text data is plentiful. Semi-supervised learning methods aim to close this gap.
