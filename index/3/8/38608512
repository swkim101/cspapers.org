The state of development of computer science, the views of the computer professionals regarding educational objectives, and the extent and types of post-school employment opportunities constitute the meta-environment for our educational efforts. In addition, an educational program must be conceived, born, grow and live (or die) in the immediate environment of its host educational institution. The goals, the priorities, the financial exigencies, and the academic politics of the university are as important to the program as are the students, the faculty, the curriculum, and the meta-environment. The host institution for the computer science program discussed in this paper is Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI &amp SU/Virginia Tech). It is an aspiring, growing, southern border-state, non-urban, land-grant institution [9,11].
