This work presents a method of 3D printing hair-like structures on both flat and curved surfaces. It allows a user to design and fabricate hair geometry that is smaller than 100 micron. We built a software platform to let one quickly define a hair's angle, thickness, density, and height. The ability to fabricate customized hair-like structures expands the library of 3D-printable shape. We then present several applications to show how the 3D-printed hair can be used for designing toy objects.
