Data description or metadata presents a significant database management challenge, particularly for scientific and statistical databases. Ideally, we would llke to access and manipulate data and metadata using the same DBMS tools, but there are few systems that even begin to provide such integrated capabilities. This paper outlines a framework for more integrated metadata management by synthesizing ideas from statistical analysis, bibliographic retrieval, data dictionary, and database management systems. Drawing on experience and examples from a large statistical database project, the paper discusses and analyzes: d general types and uses of data about data * special types of metadata for statistical databases * metadata structure and characteristics * principles and requirements for metadata management
