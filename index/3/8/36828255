In today's era of digital information, protection of intellectual property rights is of great concern. Watermarking is one technique which is used to protect against illicit copy and distribution of digital information. In this paper we propose a novel technique for embedding watermarks in digital images that takes inspiration from the Bee Algorithm. The Bee Algorithm is a fairly new evolutionary algorithm that exploits the food foraging behavior of honey bees which enables them to search for best quality flower patches over large distances. Our Algorithm mimics this behavior of bees to embed watermark in the wavelet domain such that the resultant image is highly imperceptible as well as robust. Simulation results show that our proposed technique consumes far less time in comparison to other classical evolutionary algorithms.
