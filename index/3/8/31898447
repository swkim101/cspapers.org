With the diversity of high-level programming languages available, selecting the “right” one for a computer science curriculum or course can be a befuddling process. For a multitude of reasons, such as the manner in which students approach problems to the utilization of scarce computing resources, the ramifications of a decision on the choice of a programming language are significant throughout a computer science curriculum. The purpose of this paper is to provide information relevant to the selection process. Particular attention is given to COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, PL-1, and Snobol; both qualitative and quantitative factors are considered. The quantitative results were obtained from processing a binary tree insertion and retrieval algorithm in each language. The machine resources used for this algorithm are given for both interpreter and compiler versions of translators for each language.
