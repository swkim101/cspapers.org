This paper addresses the use of Open Data business licence records in the course of local web search. It assesses the feasibility of increasing the search ranking of authorised service providers and rank reduction or removal of providers with an invalid licence status. A case study was conducted to identify usable results returned with a local search across multiple providers. Result records were then analysed against an applicable Open Data set to determine the usability of the search results for end-users seeking service. A model for adjusting search result ranking is proposed for further analysis. Finally, findings based on the analysis lead to additional proposed research efforts in this space.
