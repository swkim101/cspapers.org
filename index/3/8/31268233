There has been recognition that the writers' workshop process is beneficial for the production of high quality papers ever since the first patterns conference or PLoP was held in 1994. In this OOP-SLA workshop, attendees will participate in a writers' workshop of their paper as well as writers' workshops for papers of other attendees in their group. Participants who do not have a paper to workshop are also invited. Everyone will be expected to read all the papers in their groups in advance. The organizers of this workshop were all involved in PLoP '06 and would like to con-tinue a close association between this important patterns activity and OOPSLA. Our hope is that the relationship will benefit both OOPSLA, by attracting authors of papers that are works-in-progress, and PLoP, by allowing authors who might not be able to attend PLoP to participate in the writers' workshop process.
