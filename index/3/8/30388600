In this paper, a compact antenna for broadband operation is depicted. A C-shaped patch that based on Chuo University's logo is used to design a monopole radiator. Transmission line theory and the resonator model are adopted to analyze the operating frequencies of the proposed antenna. The bandwidth was enhanced by using the curve of C-shaped patch and CPW feeding method. The proposed antenna was designed and simulated successfully by using HFSS 14. The simulation results show that the antenna has compact size 18.6Ã—17.2 mm2, a good impedance band with range from 3.9 to 7.6 GHz for return loss S11 less than -10 dB. The simulated bandwidth reaches 3.7 GHz which is about 72.5% with respect to the center frequency of 5.1 GHz. The antenna can be integrated into wireless communication products such as HIPERLAN/2, IEEE 802.11 a/h/j/n, and WiMAX (4.9-5.85GHz).
