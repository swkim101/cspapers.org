The optimization algorithms which are inspired from intelligent behavior of honey bees are among the most recently introduced techniques. In this paper, a novel algorithm called bee swarm optimization, or BSO, is presented. The BSO is a population based optimization technique which is inspired from foraging behavior of honey bees. The proposed approach provides different patterns which are used by the bees to adjust their flying trajectories. The BSO algorithm is compared with existing bee algorithms on a set of well known numerical test functions. The experimental results show that the BSO algorithm is effective and robust; produce excellent results, and outperform other algorithms investigated in this consideration.
