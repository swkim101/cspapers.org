Many tools create new user interfaces by compositing them out of smaller pieces. This usually leads to variations on the dialog box to edit a single composite object. Workspaces are a model for compositing together various editors to manipulate sets of objects and their attributes. The workspace components communicate in terms of a selected set and the attributes possessed by objects in that set. This model has been implemented as part of the Sushi UIMS.
