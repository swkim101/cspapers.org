This paper presents four dicerent visual strategies for use in docking operations for a mobile robot in a manufacturing environment. The algorithms developed include temporal activity (motion) detection, Hough transform-based recognition, adaptive fast region segmentation, and edge-based texture niethods. These algorithms are to be sequenced in a manner that is consistent wit11 our robotâ€™s motor behavior (schema) for docking, exploiting aspects of ballistic and controlled motion a8 the robot moves towards a workstation.
