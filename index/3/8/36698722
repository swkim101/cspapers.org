In any classroom, students vary in their background and aptitudes. It has long been recognized [6] that, ideally, each student should receive instruction and assignments geared to his own particular ability to perform: Weaker students should receive additional instruction and less demanding assignments; stronger students should be challenged by more complex or thought-provoking problems. In practice, however, many classes, especially in the introductory courses, have too many students for the instructor to provide such individualized attention. The slower students must struggle, often without much success, to keep up with the others, while some of the brighter ones become bored by it all.
