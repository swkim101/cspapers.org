In this paper, we develop the on-line design method and the hierarchical design method of dynamics based information processing system for the robot intelligence. By using the forgetting parameter, dynamics memorizes a new robot motion forgetting an old motion, which means the plasticity of the system. The hierarchical structure enables information processing for complex and continuous environment. We implement the proposed method to a humanoid robot and realize the motion generation and transition.
