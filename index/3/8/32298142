This paper describes a bus router that is part of a custom IC mask layout system called CIPAR. CIPAR works with rectangular building blocks of arbitrary dimensions. The router is designed specifically to handle power and ground buses. It can route these nets completely on one metal layer. The router also automatically calculates and tapers the bus path width based on current requirements specified in the input circuit description.
