This article proposes a slider stereo matching method, which employs a coarse-to-fine control strategy to overcome the false targets problem. At first, a stereo pair is taken at a short baseline, and a match is assigned to it. The resulting disparity map is then used to restrict search range and to predict occlusion for efficiently and reliably matching the succeeding stereo pair taken at a longer baseline. The system iterates the sliding and matching to obtain an enough disparity range.
