The EPILOG language and model of computation are briefly described, together with four multiprocessor architectures on which it is proposed to run the model: a form of chordal network and a slight variant of Wu and Feng's Baseline and Reverse Baseline networks. Results are reported for the simulated execution of some EPILOG programs on these architectures. Finally, some tentative conclusions are drawn and some possible avenues for future research are indicated.
