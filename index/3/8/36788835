This paper answers a question posed by Nils Nilsson in his paper [9] on Probabilistic Logic: When is the maximum entropy solution to the entailment problem equal to the solution obtained by the projection method? Conditions are given for the relevant matrices and vectors which can be tested without actually computing the two solutions and comparing them. Examples are discussed and some comments made concerning the use and computational problems of probabilistic logic.
