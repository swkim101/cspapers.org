In this paper, we bring modelling techniques from robotics to enable biologists perform an in silico study of mid-air collision avoidance strategies of ying animals. This in silico system is distinct from ying animal dynamics and trajectory simulation, as the focus is on the strategy behind the observed motions, rather than the specic motions in space. Our in silico system consists of a model and a simulator. To handle limited data and various variations in the ight dynamics and sensing parameters of the animals, we employ a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework |a general and principled approach for making decisions under uncertainty. Here, the solution to the POMDP problem is an optimal motion strategy to avoid mid-air collision with another animal. The system simulates the motion strategies in various head-on encounter scenarios. Preliminary results on comparing the simulated behaviours with 100 encounters from real honeybees are promising; the collision rate diers by less than 1%, while the dierence in the minimum encounter distance between two bees in 100 head-on encounters is on average around 12mm, which is roughly equivalent to the average wing span of the honeybees used to generate the data.
