Art and architecture literature presents indexing difficulties due to the absence of a recognized controlled vocabulary. A recent investigation showed a number of independent partial efforts targeted to local needs. The Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) group is building on the experience of others to create a unified, hierarchical thesaurus for these fields. Although the thesaurus itself will be in machine "readable form, the real value of automation will be the ability to search hierarchically the literature indexed with the AAT.
