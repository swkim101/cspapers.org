Logic simulation programs have become a standard part1 of digital design aid systems. This paper describes a Synchronous Logic Simulator which is part of the design aid system presently being used by the BOEING Aerospace Division in Seattle, Washington. This program is currently running on an SRU 1108 computer system and is used, primarily, to aid in the development and debugging of new designs and to provide error free data for component selection and wiring programs. The first part of the paper contains a general discussion of the Synchronous Logic Simulator with emphasis on the program's capabilities and the type of data provided by the logic designer. The remaining sections describe how the simulator is organized and explain the principle algorithms utilized by the program.
