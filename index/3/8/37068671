1. MOTIVATION This paper considers wireless sensor nodes with multiple sensing units and addresses the redundant data problem attributed to the overlapping sensing areas and correlated sensor measurements among neighboring nodes. To reduce the amount of redundant data, scheduling [1] and distributed source coding [2] algorithms are presented in the literature, each with its own drawbacks. The existing scheduling algorithms depend on the assumption that the locations of the sensor nodes are known. However, the use of localization protocols and GPS (Global Positioning System) for determining positions of sensor nodes may not be practical in some applications. On the other hand, the existing distributed source coding algorithms do not consider the impact of scheduling on source coding, even though the efficiency of source coding depends on which set of sensor nodes gather data for an event type. Furthermore, these algorithms usually do not address the overhead for the application of source coding on simple sensor nodes with limited storage and computational capabilities. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces a protocol called COMET for COllaborative scheduling of Multiple Event Types and allocation of rates to the sensor nodes within a cluster. COMET is the first of its kind to address the data redundancy problem by enabling scheduling and source coding algorithms to collaborate with each other. Hence, COMET includes an event type scheduling algorithm and a coding rate allocation algorithm. The event type scheduling algorithm minimizes the number of event types to be sensed by each node and provides statistical coverage assurances for each event type without requiring node locations to be known. On the other hand, the coding rate
