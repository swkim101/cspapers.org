The shortage of computer scientists in higher education has been widely documented. One method of alleviating this deficiency is to provide programs in which faculty from other disciplines can be retrained into the area of computer science. The panelists, having participated in different retraining programs, will describe what their respective programs attempted to do; their advantages and disadvantages; the effects of retraining on their careers; and the impact of these studies on the individuals' institutions. STATEMENTS FROM PARTICIPANTS Georgianna Tonne Klein I attended the first class of the Institute for Retraining in Computer Science at Clarkson University under the auspices of the Joint ACM/MAA Committee on Retraining for Computer Science. The training takes place during two consecutive summers. During the intervening year, each participant teaches at least one computer science course and completes a major programming project. The faculty are drawn from the top institutions and are chosen on the basis of being active researchers as well as outstanding teachers. The courses are supplemented by seminars and colloquia. The training has prepared me directly to teach six courses in our curriculum and, since I know COBOL, several of the information systems courses as well. The value of my training to the institdtion perhaps can best be judged by the fact that after only the first summer of training, I went from being a full time adjunct instructor to being an assistant professor in a tenure track position.
