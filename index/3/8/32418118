The importance of providing integration architectures in every field of application is beyond controversy these days. Unfortunately existing solutions are focusing mainly on functionality. But for the success of systems integration in the long run, the quality of developed architectures is of substantial interest. Therefore a framework for quality-driven creation of architectures is proposed in this paper. Besides these quality-oriented characteristic, the usage of semantic knowledge and structured process descriptions enable an automatic procedure. Especially the combination of both is a promising approach.
