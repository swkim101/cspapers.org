Our purpose is the realization of a system able to access objects located at remote places, by integrating Internet technologies and robotic engineering developments such as mobile robots. As an example, in this research, we are developing a system for browsing books from remote places through the Internet with a robot. In order to do browsing operations, the robot has to recognize the alignment state of a bookshelf itself and to pick up a book correctly. This paper also describes the developed sensor for recognizing the posture of a book and the plan for extractional operation in the environment of a general library. In addition, we conducted experiments by the developed system, and summarize the consideration about this system.
