For establishing a communicative atmosphere, each person's "Ba" should be integrated, so that "Maai" (spatial distance) can be created. In this research, the Kendo (Japanese fencing) match system using a Kendo robot (a video character) was employed to investigate the method for integrating each person's "Ba" in a telecommunication which utilizes a robot as an agent of self. Specifically, a dual expression of embodiment method was investigated to support the generation of "Ba" between remote places. The method is intended to position yourself in your own "Ba" and to establish a proper relationship between a remote partner and yourself therein. As an experimental result, it was proved that a non-separable relationship between yourself and your own avatar (Kendo robot) can be created by expressing a rhythmic robot-control signal ahead of the movement of the robot. Furthermore, it was found that a transmission of the rhythmic robot-control signal (an interval between zero-cross points) and representations of phase relationship (coherency) between each rhythmic robot control signal can support to generate "Maai" with a remote partner. It was found also that the 1/f fluctuation can be related to "Maai" generation. These findings provide us a design guideline for the telecommunication system using a robot as communication media.
