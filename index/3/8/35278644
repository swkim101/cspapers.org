Modern programming practice advocates the use of abstract data types to aid in design, coding, and maintenance of programs [1].

Therefore, it is important to expose those students who will take only one or two programming courses to the idea of abstract data types. The paper below illustrates how this was done in one of our beginning Pascal classes.
