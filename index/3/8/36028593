In this work, delay profiles of indoor multipath characteristics at 60 GHz were measured using a pulse compression method based on M-sequences. Packets included preamble of two M-sequences were generated by a software modulator and a 4 GSample/s dual channel arbitrary waveform generator. Baseband signal was converted to 60 GHz band by transmitter. At receiver, a 4 GSample/s sliding correlator was built into a demodulation software, resulting in 0.25 ns delay time resolution. Arrival angels of multipaths were measured by rotating a narrow beam received antenna with angle resolution of 5 degrees. From measurement results, the multipaths were found to be separable. The multipaths can be combined by using a rake receiver.
