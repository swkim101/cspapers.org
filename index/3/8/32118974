Software engineering education is currently being taught in many universities with a hands-on approach, where students have to learn to develop software in teams, intending to simulate industry, to minimize the gap between what universities teach and what industry needs. The industry "simulation" that a university performs in software engineering courses is a good approach but it is normally undermined by student bad behaviors (free-riding, social loafing and student syndrome), which leads to lower team performance and lower team motivation. In this work I propose the use of reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM) to mitigate these students' bad behaviors that can disrupt team results. The use of the RWM in the past two semesters in a software engineering course, has improved teams' results in terms of both, project and final grades.
