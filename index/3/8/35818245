Introduction Information retr ieval (IR) systems may, in general, be considered as consisting of a user, an interactive mechanism, and a knowledge resource, integrated about the common goal of helping the user successfully to manage the problem that has induced her/him to ini t iate the system. In these terms, what are called "on-line IR systems" can be seen as an information interaction mechanism (consisting usually of a human intermediary, some interaction capabilities between intermediary and data base, a retrieval language and a retrieval strategy), and a knowledge resource (meaning the data base i t s e l f ) . A major goal of IR research at the moment is to allow the user direct access to the data base, without recourse to a human intermediary. Marcus & Reintjes(1981), Doszcocs & Rapp(1979), Meadow et al (1982), Boguraev & Sparck Jones (1982) and Williams(1980) each provide examples of different approaches toward achieving the goal of allowing direct end-user access to data bases, each dealing with different aspects of the interface between the user and the data
