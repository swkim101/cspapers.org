The safety of college campuses is neither an unexpected nor new phenomenon. High school students and their parents consider a variety of factors, like academic quality, cost of attendance, campus appearance, and campus safety, before making the final decision of their choice of college [2]. “Campus safety” has been the factor with the steadiest increase across generations. In a 1997 conducted poll by the Art & Science Group [1], 64% of parents and 57% of students rated having a safe campus as “very important” in their choice of college. This rating paralleled the rating for academic reputation and prestige. The study was repeated over the years, and in 2016, 72% of students indicated that campus safety was very important to them in college consideration and choice, and 86% of them reported that it was very important to their parents [2]. In this project, we have two main goals: (1) collect data in real-time from the web sites of these institutions and (2) create a visual and intuitive tool that projects crimes within and around a college campus area. Campus crime data is publicly available at most U.S. postsecondary institutions. While there are such tools available, they present static pictures or graphs. Our goal is to give animated temporalspatial heat maps that show animations of the evolution of crime density in and around a college campus. Figure 1 illustrates one of the heat maps produced with our tool. Such a tool can: • help students and parents make informed decisions (often, decisions are made based on word-of-mouth or“onceupon-a-time”stories instead of up-to-date factual data), • help various university and city departments coordinate and devise common safety programs, • protect students, faculty, and administration by pinpointing areas and times to exercise caution.
