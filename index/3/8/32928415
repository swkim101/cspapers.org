This paper describes an experiment to incorporate the new Desktop Publishing technology into our traditional Systems Analysis and Design course. The experiment was first conducted during the Fall 1987 semester and is being repeated and expanded in the Spring 1988 term. The course is considered to be a Junior level Computer Science course. Desktop Publishing systems are sometimes hard to learn and use but are very powerful and flexible tools for developing system reference manuals that contain text, graphics, line art and images. It was difficult to determine the amount of time to spend on this topic and to place this material in its proper place in the course curriculum. Some of our experiences, both positive and negative, are reported for those responsible for conducting similar courses and may be interested in implementing this new technology.
