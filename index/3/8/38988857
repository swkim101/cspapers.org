Exposing students early to computer science may influence their choice of career, and there is increasing recognition that even for students who do not pursue computer science careers, computational literacy is important. This poster reports on a project targeting the development of a new middle school computer science curriculum. This research aims to highlight the role of computation in Big Data in the context of middle school computer science education, which serves as a catalyst to keep students engaged in computer science through middle school via the ENGAGE narrative game-based learning environment. This poster discusses steps taken to validate one activity meant to highlight the role of computation in the context of Big Data: skip list manipulation. While we found that most of the middle school students performed poorly in assessments after the skip list activities, several students showed they were capable of completing the activity successfully, implying that a repetition of the revised skip list study and additional pilot studies for other Big Data activities are needed to pave the way for the development of this Big Data curriculum. This activity will be just one part of a broader curriculum designed to showcase the social relevance and power of Big Data.
