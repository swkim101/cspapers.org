The INFER query language allows users to express queries without referencing relations or specifying joins. Since the INFER syntax is similar to but less restrictive than SQL, users can easily write highly expressive queries that are automatically completed by INFER's inference engine. INFER's SQL-based syntax is familiar to current database users, and its improved ranking and query explanation system makes it easier to use.
