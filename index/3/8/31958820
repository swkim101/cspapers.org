If the future Web will be able to fully leverage the scale and quality of online media, a Web scale layer of structured, interlinked media annotations is needed, which we will call Linked Media, inspired by the Linked Data movement for making structured, interlinked descriptions of resources better available online. Mobile and tablet devices, as well as connected TVs, introduce novel application domains that will benefit from broad understanding and acceptance of Linked Media standards. In the keynote, I will provide an overview of current practices and specification efforts in the domain of video and Web content integration, drawing from the LinkedTV1 and MediaMixer2 projects. From this, I will present a vision for a Linked Media layer on the future Web will can empower new media-centric applications in a world of ubiquitous online multimedia.
