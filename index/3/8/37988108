Landmines represent a clear threat to the civilian population in war-ravaged countries, and hamper peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts. The seriousness of this issue demands immediate automation of the mine detection and removal tasks, but until now only partial mechanization has been available. This paper proposes a versatile and feasible automated system based on mobile platforms to improve humanitarian demining, taking into account field requirements. Details of the development of the mobile platforms are presented, as well as experimental results. Special tools and components, also briefly described, are under development in order to maximize the range of applications of this system.
