This project deals with the design, analysis and fabrication of an haptic interface device for use in training for laparoscopic surgery. An apparatus has been designed for physically exchanging forces with users in an alien environment. The apparatus is a three degree of freedom interface, where all the three degrees of freedom are actuated and are also tracked using encoders. The structure of the haptic interface are described and the control algorithm and the haptic rendering algorithm are enunciated.
