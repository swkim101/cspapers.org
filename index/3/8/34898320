It is vital to construct an effective model to evaluate and predict the public security. In this work, we establish a Situation-Aware Public Security Evaluation (SAPE) platform. Based on conventional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), we develop a new variant of RNN to handle temporal contexts in public security event datasets. The proposed model can achieve better performance than the compared state-of-the-art methods. On SAPE, There are two parts of demonstrations, i.e., global public security evaluation and China public security evaluation. In the global part, based on Global Terrorism Database from UMD, for each country, SAPE can predict risk level and top-n potential terrorist organizations which might attack the country. The users can also view the actual attacking organizations and predicted results. For each province in China, SAPE can predict the risk level and the probability scores of different types of events in the next month. The users can also view the actual numbers of events and predicted risk levels of the past one year.
