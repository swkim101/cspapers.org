Data trustworthiness is a crucial issue in real-world participatory sensing applications. Without considering this issue, different types of worker misbehavior, especially the challenging collusion attacks, can result in biased and inaccurate estimation and decision making. We propose a novel trust-based mixture of Gaussian processes (GP) model for spatial regression to jointly detect such misbehavior and accurately estimate the spatial field. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based algorithm to efficiently perform Bayesian inference of the model. Experiments using two real-world datasets show the superior robustness of our model compared with existing approaches.
