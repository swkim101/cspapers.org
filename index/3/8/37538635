The ninth workshop on Linked Data (LDOW2016) on the Web is held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on April 12, 2016 and co-located with the 25rd International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2016). The Web is developing from a medium for publishing textual documents into a medium for sharing structured data. This trend is fueled on the one hand by the adoption of the Linked Data principles by a growing number of data providers. On the other hand, large numbers of websites have started to semantically mark up the content of their HTML pages and thus also contribute to the wealth of structured data available on the Web. The 9th Workshop on Linked Data on the Web aims to stimulate discussion and further research into the challenges of publishing, consuming, and integrating structured data from the Web as well as mining knowledge from the global Web of Data.
