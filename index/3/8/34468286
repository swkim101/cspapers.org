This paper describes the use of a logic simulation computer program to generate stimulus/response tables for a computer controlled functional logic tester. The approach has proven very successful, allowing 100 percent functional testing of complex units which were only partially tested manually. A typical unit tested required 20,000 entries to be generated for the 100 percent functional test. Approximately two man weeks were required to generate these tables by hand, the generation of the tables by computer simulation required four man days of engineering time plus 10 minutes of 1108 computer time. The simulation is now done as part of the design cycle, resulting in an even greater time saving.
