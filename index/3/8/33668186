This paper mainly discusses the characteristics of free sliding motion in releasing manipulation. Releasing manipulation is such a manipulation, in which an object is given initial velocities by striking and slides on a surface to stop at the pre-assigned destination under the action of friction. After the properties of releasing manipulation are given out based on our previous work, the trajectory, the relationship of the sliding motion and the object shape, and the motion monotonicity of any one object with arbitrary shape are intensively discussed. Several important results are originally obtained. Finally, a simple and effectual approach of determining the necessary initial velocity of the object is presented with the above obtained results.
