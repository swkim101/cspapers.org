As the web platform continues to mature, we see an increasing number of amazing technologies that take DSS (Decision Support Systems) to new levels of power and usability. By integrating new powerful technologies into DSS, we get higher performance results with additional functionalities. The most recent development capturing the attention of the browser based application developers are Web Service, Struts and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). In this paper we present a generic and performance efficient architeture for integrating Web Services, Struts and AJAX models into the Web-based DSS.
