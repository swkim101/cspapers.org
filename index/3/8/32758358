Robust covariant local feature detectors are important for detecting local features that are (1) discriminative of the image content and (2) can be repeatably detected at consistent locations when the image undergoes diverse transformations. Such detectors are critical for applications such as image search and scene reconstruction. Many learning-based local feature detectors address one of these two problems while overlooking the other. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method to simultaneously address both issues. Specifically, we extend the covariant constraint proposed by Lenc and Vedaldi [8] by defining the concepts of standard patch and canonical feature and leverage these to train a novel robust covariant detector. We show that the introduction of these concepts greatly simplifies the learning stage of the covariant detector, and also makes the detector much more robust. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms previous hand-crafted and learning-based detectors by large margins in terms of repeatability.
