This paper proposes a quadruped-walking robot that performs "humanitarian demining" tasks. We have already proposed the basic concept of the humanitarian demining robot system, and have several experiments of the operation using the first prototype robot system, VK-I. To accomplish the tasks, we develop several end effecters that can be attached to the working leg. After these basic experiments, we consider to modify the concept, phases of the tasks and to develop the next prototype robot system that will have better performance. The robot will be given a "foot-end-effector changing system" on its back so by utilizing the legs as manipulation arms and connecting various tools (foot-end-effectors) to the foot of the working leg, it can perform all of the procedure of the demining tasks. We discuss the advance of our study and introduce next concept called VK-II.
