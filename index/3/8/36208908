This paper describes briefly three new Defense data networks, AUTODIN II, SATIN IV and PWIN which employ packet switching technology. It then discusses Defense policy concerning common-user networks and in what circumstances special purpose networks are permitted. Finally it addresses the issue of whether the three new data networks under discussion are common-user or dedicated networks.
