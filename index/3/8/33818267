We study the following general on-line scheduling problem. Paralleljobs arrive on a parallel machine dynamically according to thedependencies between them. Each job requests a certain number ofprocessors in a specific communication configuration, but its runningtime is not known until it is completed. We present optimal on-linealgorithms for PRAMs and one-dimensional meshes, and efficientalgorithms for hypercubes and general meshes. For PRAMs we obtainoptimal tradeoffs between the competitive ratio and the largestnumber of processors requested by any job.
