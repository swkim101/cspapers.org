A program and underlying algorithms are described which quasi-optimally partition a set of logic equations into subsets which represent physical packaging entities. The criterion for partitioning is the signal communication between equations. Several different methods of measuring and evaluating the criterion are built into the program as optional strategies. The effectiveness of these and other strategies are compared, based on accumulated experience with the program. The important characteristics of the program and its data structures which allow very efficient computer execution time are described. The plans and techniques for further development of the program are also presented.
