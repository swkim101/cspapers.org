This paper proposes the implementation of data analysis of the depth of scoring Kinect users' camera movements in grading Vietnamese traditional martial arts movements. The data analysis was conducted from 36 samples of 3D martial movements being currently used for teaching at schools and grading software static movements This is the first step of the implementation of self-training and evaluation of Vietnamese traditional martial arts, contributing to the preservation and development of ethnic elites. Given that the system works effectively with low computational complexity and strong resistance to interference, the program promises to have expansive implementations in the area when it integrates with online assessment. Statistics show that the program initially assessed martial arts movements fairly accurately.
