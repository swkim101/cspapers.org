To overcome the difficulty of demonstrating the principles of concurrency with limited parallel computing resources, a concurrent programming language has been designed and implemented which uses the Linda parallel programming paradigm. The language executes under the UNIX operating system and is supported by an X-windows based viewer of programs undergoing concurrent execution. This paper describes the language, its compiler and execution environment and experiences gained in using the language in a third year undergraduate course over the last two years.
