The World Wide Web (and the ease with which it can now be accessed through graphical browsers) represents one of the most significant developments in the 15 years that I have been using computers. Graphical browsers are now bringing the power of the Internet to the general public and the general public is responding with enthusiasm. In the near future, many aspects of society will be impacted and changed by the web. The topic of this paper is to discuss how the web can be used to more effectively teach a particular computer science course in the curriculum of Montana State University that is to be offered in the fall of 1995. This junior level course is the fourth in a four semester sequence of courses that present students with a breadth-first, unified approach to the field of computer science [Paxton, Ross, Starkey 19941, [Tucker 1994]. Many of the ideas that I discuss in this paper can be ~eadily adapted to other courses (computer science or otherwise) [Team Web 1995\ [Morris 1995] and so the potential application of ideas in this paper is wide. The following four sections of this paper are organized as follows. First, a strategy to teach students the skills they will need to effectively use the web is presented. The next section is devoted towards showing how the web can be used as a learning tool to find out about ‘imeatier” computer science topics such as personal computers. The next section discusses both challenges and opportunities of using the web in a classroom setting. Finally, the paper con~ludes by setting out future directions.
