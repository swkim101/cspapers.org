In this paper we suggest how, focusing on the concept of property, one can use a very small number of operators (functions) to organize a factual data base whose information structures are constructed as simple association lists. The approach was used to design and implement a data base management system, operating in a small-core/slow-secondary-storage environnment, as a part of a low cost multimicroprocessor robot system.
