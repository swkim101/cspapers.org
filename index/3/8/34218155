I'm going to talk about one phase of the design automation problem, that of the geometric computer processor, using as an example North American's AUTOLOFT system.
 Any design automation system requires a modicum of geometric ability, both in the analytic definition and manipulation areas. In the APT (Automatic Programmed Tool) system, both areas are well-developed, with many automatic features provided such as the continuous guiding of the tool - a geometric object - along the part and driving surfaces in response to a single initiating command, suitably interpreted. In common with other interpretive systems, the effective on-going program of such a processor is, so-to- speak, “thrown together” at execution time while the affective or meta-program consists of special command-and-control instructions never required to be organized into a complete, closed, or unified body at input time.
