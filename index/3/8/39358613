We present MIPSUnit, a unit test framework for MIPS assembly. MIPSUnit's primary benefit is that it reduces the time needed to grade assembly language assignments. It also provides a time-efficient means for providing students additional testing experience. (We believe that students should be exposed to testing throughout the curriculum --- including their Computer Organization and/or Assembly Language courses.) MIPSUnit is a suite of two tools: MUnit, which allows users to test their assembly code with JUnit tests, and MSpec, which uses RSpec-style unit tests
