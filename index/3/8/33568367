Robotic surgical systems have dramatically overcome laparoscopic surgery limitation, which show great touch on the scope of minimum invasive surgery. Robotic surgery has great influence on the surgeon performance and comfort during surgery, in which can handle the procedure with lesser extent of fatigability. Implantation of three-dimension magnified stable camera, articulated instruments, and ability to omit physiologic tremors help to extent scope of dexterity and ergonomics. Therefore, robotic platforms could potentially assist to improve overall patient outcome with highly sophisticated technique. However, the success of Robotic oncological outcome has not addressed well in the literature with on-going controversies. In order to weight and balance the advantages and the cost of robotic surgery, further resources are required to validate the true value of Robotic surgery in colorectal field. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence of robotic surgery in clinical and oncological outcomes in colorectal cancer.
