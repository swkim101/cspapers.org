dimensional 
classification. It introduces a novel 
classifier, the class bridge decomposable multidimensional 
Gaussian classifier (CB-MGC) within 
the application of multiple state-of-the-art machine 
learning techniques to the Neuromorpho 
dataset. We formulate a supervised classification 
problem for predicting specie, gender, level one 
cell type, level two cell type, development stage 
and area of the neocortex based of a set of morphological 
features extracted from a neuron. Additionally, 
we show a performance comparative 
between the different classifiers and discuss its 
results.
