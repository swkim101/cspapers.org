Web Intelligence is a multidisciplinary area dealing with utilizing data and services over the Web, to create new data and services using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Intelligent techniques. The link to Networking and Web Communities (WCs) is apparent: the Web is a set of nodes, providing and consuming data and services; the permanent or temporary ties and exchanges in-between these nodes build the virtual communities; and the ICT and intelligent techniques influence the modeling and the processes, and it automates (or semi-automate) communication and cooperation. In this paper, we will explore one aspect of (Web) intelligence pertinent to the Web Communities. The "intelligent" features may emerge in a Web community from interactions and knowledge-transmissions between the community members. We will also introduce the WI&C'14 workshop's goal and structure.
