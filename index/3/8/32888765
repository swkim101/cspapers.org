This paper is concerned with a new instructional method to teach computer programming techniques to students in Computer Science as well as other scientific and non-scientific disciplines. Several courses in the Computer Science curriculum could be substantially enhanced if the instructional gap between the classroom lecture and the computer programming excercises could be eliminated. Rochester Institute of Technology has experimented to achieve this objective by means of an on-line large screen display system which will permit the instructors to perform classroom demonstrations to emphasize the key point of concepts or example of applications to a class of students through a keyboard with a computer. This new instructional method will eliminate deficiencies in conventional chalkboard approaches which result in material being covered too fast to be digested by the students or the course content to be diluted to match the pace of the class.
