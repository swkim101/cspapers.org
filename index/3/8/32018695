Figure 1. (a) [Left] We introduce cross domain image matching into our system, (b) [Middle] allowing camera parameters of artworks to be obtained and reconstructed together with photographs. Once reconstruction is done, we calculate the key viewing score additionally (the score values are encoded by intensity from low to high). This will then be completed by a navigation system (c) [Right] together, to direct users to these viewpoints.
