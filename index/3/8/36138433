Over the past several years a great deal has been written, and even more said, regarding the crisis in employment of faculty in computer science departments (1,2,3,4,5). In order to obtain data regarding the magnitude of the problem, and reasons for it, the National Science Foundation, in the 1980-81 academic year conducted a survey of Ph.D. granting departments of computer science in the United States. This paper will present a summary of the results of the survey. Data obtained regarding the departments were consistent with that reported earlier by Hamblen (6,7), and Taulbee and Conte (8). Results of the survey regarding motivation for professional mobility were consistent with those reported by Eisenberg and Galanti (9) regarding the engineering disciplines.
