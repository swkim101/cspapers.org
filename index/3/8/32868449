To choose their actions, reasoning programs must be able to draw conclusions from limited information and subsequently revise their beliefs when discoveries invalidate previous assumptions. In the Truth Maintenance System (TMS) I introduce a new notion of "reason for belief which permits the mechanization of these abilities as a problem solver subsystem The TMS records and maintains the reasons for program beliefs. These recorded reasons are useful in constructing explanations of program beliefs and actions, and in guiding the course of action of a problem solver. This paper outlines some of the structure and applications of the TMS.
