We present an exoskeletal haptic device called SKK Hand Master. The device is semi-directly driven by linkages with ultrasonic motors, which has characteristic features close to cybernetic actuators. In the control of the device, we propose a method of measuring the joint positions and joint torques of the finger and a control method called PWM/PS is presented to overcome the intrinsic disadvantages of ultrasonic motors such as hysteresis. Construction of the device is addressed and several results of experiments for performance evaluation are included.
