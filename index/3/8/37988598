Wearable devices, such as smart watches, offer exciting new opportunities for users to interact with their applications. The current state of the art for wearable devices is for a developer to write a custom {\em companion app}, which is a variant of the smartphone app, tailored to the wearable form factor. A developer puts a non-trivial amount of effort to write these companion apps and the programming model does not scale to an increasing diversity of form factors. In this demo, we show a working prototype of our system UIWear that allows a developer to easily extend a smartphone application to other wearable interfaces. Our system, UIWear, extracts the application GUI as a UI tree, which preserves the semantics of the GUI. The developer (or the user) only writes a {\em metaprogram} to encode the GUI design for the wearable device; no effort is needed beyond the design phase. UIWear executes the metaprogram by performing all the underlying tasks to virtualize the application GUI, adapt it, and recreate it on the wearable. A metaprogram can create the same functionality as existing companion apps with an order-of-magnitude less programming effort.
