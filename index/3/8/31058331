PCM (Phase Change Memory) as a new kind of non-volatile memory has received much attention from both academia and industry. While PCM has a number of new features, how to use PCM at memory hierarchy still remains a problem. In addition, at present PCM chips and storage devices are not available. This makes it hard to evaluate PCM-related algorithms. Thus, we design a flexible simulator named DPHSim to provide a test bed for PCM-related studies. DPHSim can simulate various configurations on DRAM and PCM. In addition, it utilizes a clock-based timing model to simulate the characteristics of PCM and offers user-friendly APIs for users to simulate memory hierarchy and evaluate performance on DPHSim.
