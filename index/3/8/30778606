We say that an authorization scheme exhibits synergistic effects if it allowes for the power provided by the union of two privileges to be larger than the union of the powers of the individual privileges. This phenomenon where the whole is larger than the sum of its parts is shown to be essential for the support of some important classes of authorization policies, and useful for the optimization of the enforcement of authorization-based rules. An authorization scheme which exhibits synergistic effects is introduced and some of its applications are discussed.
