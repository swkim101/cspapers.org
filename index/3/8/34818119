In this paper we present a system for tracking objects' 3D motions by using sampling algorithm. The system consists of three cameras and 1 PC. We modified the condensation algorithm [M.A. Isard et al., 1998] to track objects' 3D positions. The condensation algorithm is a kind of "factored sampling" and it can easily cope with multi-modal probability density of objects' positions. We track objects not in images but in 3D space. We use a condensation particle-set as a tracker and represent a position of a moving object by a center of tracker. Since we don't track directly in images, a great advantage of this method is not to need to deal with occlusions or objects' mutual interferences which happen in images.
