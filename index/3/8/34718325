The split decomposition of a graph, which is also known as the join decomposition [GHS], ms], was developed by Cunningham [Cu] . Originally, the decomposition was seen primarily as a tool for dealing with directed graphs. Recently, however, the undirected version of this decomposition has been used as part of efficient algorithms for dealing with a number of different classes of graphs. The distance hereditary graphs IBM], [HM] are equivalent to graphs which are “totally decomposable” with respect to the split decomposition. Hsu [Hs] uses the split decomposition as a part of efficient algorithms for recognition and isomorphism of circular-arc graphs. All known algorithms for circle graph recognition use the split decomposition [Bo], [GHS]; in a future paper, the authors will show that the algorithm described here can be used to reduce the time complexity of circle graph recognition from O(nm) to O(n *).
