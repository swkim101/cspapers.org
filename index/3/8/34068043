Formulating models which use axioms can sometimes result in problems with much smaller search spaces than the original model. We propose a method for automatically extracting a particular class of axioms from standard STRIPS PDDL models. More specifically, we identify operators whose effects become irrelevant given some other operator, and generate axioms that capture this relationship. We show that this algorithm can be used to successfully extract axioms from standard IPC benchmark instances, and show that the extracted axioms can be used to significantly improve the performance of an IP-based planner.
