We study the representation of space over the Web. Web’sspatiality is described by (hyper)links, and thus the webspace is given by a set of pages and links between them. Thecomplexity of this structure derives not only from the quan-tity, but also from the extreme dynamics that it presents.This structure is greatly inﬂuenced by its dynamics; newdocuments appear together with their links and disappear,cutting oﬀ all the corresponding arcs in the graph. We intro-duce and study some topologies over web, providing a suit-able formal framework to express web connectivity, density,how the whole web space can be generated by a certain sub-set of pages, and web separation. Following previous papersdevoted to time [1] and space [3], we develop a high-level de-scription of spatio-temporal relations to catch the dynamicsof the Web documents and the links between them.
