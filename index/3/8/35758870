In this paper, we adopt a fuzzy rule-based inference system to improve format conversion algorithms. We explain three main issues of image enhancement, and they are system consideration, image quality assessment, and parameter adjustment. By using membership hedge, we can bring additional effects for membership function. Simulation results are obtained by using two forma conversion methods: line average method and edge direction based method.
