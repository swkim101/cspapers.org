Traditional supervised learning approaches for document classification ask human labelers to provide labels for documents. Humans know more than just the labels and can provide extra information such as domain knowledge, feature annotations, rules, and rationales for classification. Researchers indeed tried to utilize this extra information for labeling of features and documents in tandem, and more recently for incorporating rationales for the provided labels. We extend this approach further by allowing the human to provide explanations, in the form of domain-specific features that support and oppose the classification of documents, and present an approach to incorporate explanations into the training of any off-the-shelf classifier to speed-up the learning process.
