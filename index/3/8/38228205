In this poster, we describe our experience of designing and executing two different weeklong programs for 10th -- 12th grade students. The goal of our program is to attract students to the field of computing, increase their computing confidence and familiarize them with ways that computing impacts our community. Student groups consist of 32 students for each week with a 1:0.8 male-to-female ratio. No prerequisite knowledge is required to attend. We compare the different facets of the curriculums by evaluating the impact of each week both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our evaluation implies the attraction of cyber security topics to this age group, particularly male students, and presents a curriculum that may help increase confidence in computing concepts, particularly for female students. We solicit feedback and welcome input on our curriculum and evaluation method.
