The Smart Health and Wellbeing workshop is organized to develop a platform for authors to discuss fundamental principles, algorithms or applications of intelligent data acquisition, processing and analysis of healthcare data. We are particularly interested in information and knowledge management papers, in which the approaches are accompanied by an in-depth experimental evaluation with real world data. This paper provides an overview of the workshop and the accepted contributions.
