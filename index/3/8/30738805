Based on experiences using the ISO standard for dialogue act annotation (ISO 24617-2:2012), this paper proposes to correct certain deﬁciencies in the standard, and discusses some extensions that would increase the standard usefulness and usability. More speciﬁcally, it is suggested to add the annotation of non-functional segments that are relevant for the accurate annotation of some feedback acts and speech editing acts, and to import devices from the newly established ISO standard for the annotation of discourse relations (ISO DR-Core) in order to improve the annotation of rhetorical relations between dialogue acts. The latter kind of extension is argued to be interesting for also joint annotation of different kinds of semantic information by combining different annotation schemes.
