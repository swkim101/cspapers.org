Recently several changes have occurred in accreditation. This panel will address four major changes: the new guidelines for accreditation on Computer Science programs, the integration of the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board (CSAB) and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), the developments in software engineering accreditation, and the developments in accreditation of programs in computer information sciences/information systems science.This panel will discuss these recent and their potential impacts. These areas may see considerable change from the submission of the proposal for a panel and the time that panel convenes in San Antonio.
