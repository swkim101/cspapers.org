CGRAs are promising as accelerators due to their improved energy-efficiency compared to FPGAs. Existing CGRAs support reconfigurability for operations, but not communications because of the static neighbor-to-neighbor interconnect, leading to both performance loss and increased complexity of the compiler. In this paper, we introduce HyCUBE, a novel CGRA architecture with a reconfigurable interconnect providing single-cycle communications between distant FUs, resulting in a new formulation of the application mapping problem that leads to the design of an efficient compiler. HyCUBE achieves 1.5× and 3× better performance-per-watt compared to a CGRA with standard NoC and a CGRA with neighbor-to-neighbor connectivity, respectively.
