In this paper, we present high-speed photoreceivers and related technologies for frequency compensation techniques, including InA quantum dots photoabsorption technology and an RF interface. A newly developed high-conversion-gain analog photoreceiver was fabricated by using the above techniques and was demonstrated with 16-QAM optical signals.
