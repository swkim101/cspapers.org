This paper presents task description language (TDL) for underwater robots. General primitives of TDL were designed by considering common primitives of conventional computer languages, and underwater robot-specific command primitives were designed by modifying the turtle graphic commands in Lego. An alias and procedure commands make the TDL intuitive and modular. Concurrent processing and sensor-based event handling commands are also available with TDL. An example of survey task with lawnmower pattern shows feasibility and easiness of TDL.
