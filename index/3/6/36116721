Multi-tier infrastructures have become common practice for implementing high volume web sites. Such infrastructures typically contain TCP load balancers, HTTP servers, application servers, transaction-processing monitors, and databases. Caching has been widely used at different layers of the infrastructure stack to improve scalability and response time of e-business applications. The majority of existing caching mechanisms target only static HTML pages or page fragments. However, as web applications become more dynamic through increased personalization, these caching techniques turn out to be less useful. Consequently, as more application requests result in increased querying and updating of backend database servers, scalability limits are often reached.
