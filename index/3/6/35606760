Demands for high performance computing are getting heavier every day. To meet these demands, Fujitsu continues to conduct ongoing research and development of new and more powerful servers, software, and solutions. Last July, Fujitsu launched a new HPC server model, the PRIMEQUEST 500 Series, which utilizes dual-core Intel® Itanium® 2 processors with Fujitsu's original chipset. The PRIMEQUEST 500 Series is a 64-way true SMP server with up to 2TBytes of memory. The largest configuration of the PRIMEQUEST 500 Series can consist of up to 256 nodes connected by high speed interconnect.Towards PetaScale Computing, Fujitsu is carrying out a feasibility study to deliver petascale computing in the 2010s. Fujitsu is also performing joint fundamental R&D activities with Kyushu University for petascale interconnect and system evaluation methodology as part of the next generation supercomputer national project of Japan.
