This paper presents a planning architecture that can perform both planning and recovery planning in the complex and dynamic flight domain. The key to such a robust planner is the vertical decomposition of the domain knowledge where the flight domain is decomposed into four minidomains, each a model of the flight domain along some degree of global viewpoint. The decomposition of the flight domain into four nearly independent minidomains and the explicit modeling of the different degrees of global viewpoint reduce the domain complexity geometrically. The vertical decomposition of the domain knowledge results in shallow planning and shallow recovery planning.
