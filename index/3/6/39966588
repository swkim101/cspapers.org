This paper provided a unified geometric framework for kinematic analysis and synthesis of parallel manipulators. We gave a strict definition on motion types of a mechanism based on distributions on a Lie group. We derived conditions for parallel manipulators with Lie subgroup motions using the intersection of the permissible velocity spaces, or the direct sum of the constraint force spaces of each subchain, and the integration theory on a Lie group. Several practical examples were studied in detail to verify our approach.
