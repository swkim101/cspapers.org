It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 18th ACM International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing. This year's symposium continues its tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on latest research findings on the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for high end computing, collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative applications. This installment takes place in Garching near Munich, Germany, June 11-13, 2009. 
 
Topics of interest include HPDC architectures, high end communications, data management and transport, software environments, operating system technologies, grid middleware, applications and algorithms, as well as fault tolerance. 
 
Co-located with HPDC 09 are six workshops. We welcome the Workshop on Challenges for Large Applications in Distributed Environments (CLADE 09), the Second International Workshop on Data-Aware Distributed Computing (DADC 09), the Workshop on Large-Scale System and Application Performance (LSAP 09), the Workshop on Monitoring, Logging and Accounting in Production Grids (MLA 09), the Workshop on Resiliency in High-Performance Computing (Resilience 09), and the 4th UPGRADE-CN Workshop on Content Management and Delivery in Large-Scale Networks (UPGRADE-CN 09). 
 
The call for papers attracted 68 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe, Africa, and the United States. The program committee accepted 20 papers that cover a variety of topics, including Grid middleware and distributed algorithms, resource management and scheduling, data management, parallel algorithms and applications, workflow and dataflow applications, I/O and parallel computing. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers.
