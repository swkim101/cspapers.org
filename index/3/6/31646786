The third approach, proposed by John Long and his colleagues at the Ergonomics Unit, University College, London, proposes the development of prescriptive engineering design principles, both substantive and methodological, which in the long term would support practices seeking solutions to the general design problem of HCI. The principles would derive from an engineering conception of HCI, which in the short term supports the development of techniques and methods for effective design. The proponents will discuss how their approaches can support design practice and the ways in which theories are made available to the designer, either as artifact-products, predictive models, prescriptive guidelines and methods, or simply as designers’ “tools for thought”.
