In this paper, the redundancy resolution methods for elastic joint redundant robots are researched. First, a redundancy resolution method called MD method is proposed by using joint elastic deflection as a performance index. And then, the influence of robots’ initial configuration on this method is discussed. Finally, simulations for a planar 3R redundant robot with elastic joints are conducted. Research results show that by optimizing robots’ initial configuration this method can effectively reduce joint elastic deflection from a global point of view.
