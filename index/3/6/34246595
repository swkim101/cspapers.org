The purpose of this note is to promote the idea of teaching structured programming techniques righ t from the beginning in introductory COBOL programming courses . In the past year a number of reasonabl e textbooks dealing with structured programming techniques in conjunction with introductory COBOL have appeared and thereby made practical the teaching of structured COBOL in introductory courses on programming . Experience in teaching structured COBOL programming to students in a business school an d using one of the newly available texts has shown that there are no real problems and a number o f advantages to teaching the structured design and programming techniques right from the beginning , especially with the aid of a textbook specifically geared for teaching structured techniques . An additional point to be made is that the above is especially effective when a small and easily understoo d set of programming standards for structured programs is established and enforced for all laborator y assignments for the course . The programming standards should, ideally, be also in close harmony wit h the textbook chosen . The performance of the students in the new course was completely satisfactory, as evidenced b y their performance on departmental mid-term and final examinations which were also taken by student s in the traditional course not employing structured techniques . Most notable was the improvement in the readability of the programs, thereby easing the task of grading several hundred programs in a ten week term . The set of programming standards will be presented along with a bibliography of textbook s currently available that deal with teaching structured programming in introductory COBOL courses .
