In this paper we describe the data gathering work done within a large research project, CompMusic, which emphasizes a culture specific approach in the automatic description of several world music repertoires. Currently we are focusing on the Hindustani (North India), Carnatic (South India) and Turkish-makam (Turkey) music traditions. The selection and organization of the data to be processed for the characterization of each of these traditions is of the utmost importance.
