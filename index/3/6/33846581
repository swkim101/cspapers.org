Due to the prevalence of personal health tracking, cases of self-logged data being utilized in the clinic are gradually increasing. However, obstacles to clinicians' ability to further adopt such data-driven medical consultations in the existing workflow remain, such as lack of time and poor interoperability. In this paper, we conducted a workshop to design a clinician interface supporting the integration of data-driven consultation into the existing workflow and investigate the role of the interface in situ. After implementing the clinician interface designed based on the workshop results, we observed 32 cases of actual use within the clinical context. We found that our interface, DataMD, helped the clinician construct a new workflow, enhanced the clinician's counseling skills, and facilitated more in-depth conversation. This paper contributes to empirically identifying the role of a clinician interface through a user-centered design approach.
