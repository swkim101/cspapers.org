The feasibility of derivational analogy as a mechanism for improving problem-solving behavior has been shown for a variety of problem domains by several researchers. However, most of the implemented systems have been empirically evaluated in the restricted context of an already supplied base analog, or on a few isolated examples. In this paper, we address the utility of a derivational analogy based approach when the cost of retriE(ving analogs from a sizable case library, and the cost of retrieving inappropriate analogs is factored in.
