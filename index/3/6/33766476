Nebras Classifier is a distributed model-view component developed to perform one type of information handling -namely classification- using both COM and CORBA communication facilities. In this component, model has a hierarchical structure capable of storing multiple instances of domain CORBA objects in its nodes and has facilities to perform special queries on this structure. The view is a graphical representation for this model. A third party named Semantic Engine that is domain dependent, may be used in interaction with these two parts using proxy design pattern to perform required feasibility checks or domain dependent actions on the classifier.
