We describe a Computer Science General Education course offered at Hope College. This course stresses problem-solving. It uses traditional concepts of programming, but does it with new methods and materials. Graphics is used throughout the course, with programming done in Java applets. All course materials are delivered on the web. All class sessions are combinations of lecture and laboratory modes of instruction. We describe a new interactive environment for student program development in Java. Finally we show how we utilize the World Wide Web as a substitute for a textbook and for course administration.
