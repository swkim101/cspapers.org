This paper proposes a bare hand grasp observation system named Wrap & Sense. We built a band type sensing equipment composed of infrared distance sensors placed in an array. The sensor band is attached to a target object with all sensors directed along the object surface and detects the hand side edge with respect to the object. Assuming type of grasp as 'power grasp', the whole hand posture can be determined according to the 3D shape of the object. Three types of application are shown as proof-of-concept.
