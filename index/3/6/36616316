DNA is a long biopolymer that is found in the nucleus of every living cell. The DNA of a cell contains the genetic information that determines every physical aspect of an individual. This information is encoded in the sequence pattern of four different heterocyclic molecules called nucleotides, which are the building blocks of the DNA polymer. Such traits as sex, physical appearance, and details of metabolic function are determined by the sequence of these four nucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymidine) in an individualâ€™s DNA.
