As a fundamental study of a broadband or multi-resonance antenna, we have studied a folded dipole antenna (FDA) and a combined folded dipole antenna (CFDA-1). Now, a new model of CFDA (CFDA-2) is designed. First, we analyze the characteristics of the antennas. Next, we compare the characteristics between the antennas. It is founded that two types of CFDA have similar characteristics.
