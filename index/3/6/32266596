This is a report describing an undergraduate junior level and introductory graduate course on computer systems and some of our experiences in teaching it. The course has been taught since 1971 at Georgia Institute of Technology to graduates and undergraduates as well as at Appalachian State University to undergraduates only. It provides a link between programming courses and systems implementation courses.
