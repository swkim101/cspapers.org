Undergraduate and master's students enrolled in a programming language paradigms class are given the assignment to design a new programming language paradigm. The students are asked to develop a paradigm concept, demonstrate the utility of the paradigm for programmed solutions, and outline a sample programming language. Resulting student-designed paradigms from this class fall into three loosely defined categories: connection with a physical item, modeling a process, and representing program structure. The resulting class experience demonstrates that students can think and create beyond existing paradigms and features of languages to the level of abstraction that defines a new paradigm.
