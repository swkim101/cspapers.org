With the advent of large memory, fast digital computers with convenient input-output devices and for which high-level problem-oriented languages are available in a time-shared enviromment, it is becoming increasingly desirable to develop digital computer programs for the design of complex control systems. For some time the analog computer has been used for this purpose. In this paper a large digital computer program, called OLDS (On Line dynamic system Design System), useful for the interactive design of nonlinear control systems in the time domain, is described. The program is the preliminary result of a research project with broader objectives.
