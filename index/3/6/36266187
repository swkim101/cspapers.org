We present a novel probabilistic framework for 
a hierarchical extension of independent component 
analysis (ICA), with a particular motivation 
in neuroscientific data analysis and modeling. 
The framework incorporates a general subspace 
pooling with linear ICA-like layers stacked 
recursively. Unlike related previous models, our 
generative model is fully tractable: both the likelihood 
and the posterior estimates of latent variables 
can readily be computed with analytically 
simple formulae. The model is particularly simple 
in the case of complex-valued data since 
the pooling can be reduced to taking the modulus 
of complex numbers. Experiments on electroencephalography 
(EEG) and natural images 
demonstrate the validity of the method.
