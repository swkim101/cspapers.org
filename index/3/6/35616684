It is critical to accelerate the protein crystallization process with improved accuracy for understanding cancer and designing drugs. Systematic high-throughput approaches in protein crystallization have been widely applied, generating a large number of protein crystallization-trial images. Therefore, an efficient and effective automatic analysis for these images is a top priority. In this paper, we present a novel system, CrystalNet, for automatically labeling outcomes of protein crystallization-trial images. CrystalNet is a deep convolutional neural network that automatically extracts features from X-ray protein crystallization images for classification. We show that (1) CrystalNet can provide real-time labels for crystallization images effectively, requiring approximately 2 seconds to provide labels for all 1536 images of crystallization microassay on each plate; (2) compared with the state-of-the-art classification systems in crystallization image analysis, our technique demonstrates an improvement of 8% in accuracy, and achieve 90.8% accuracy in classification. As a part of the high-throughput pipeline which generates millions of images a year, CrystalNet can lead to a substantial reduction of labor-intensive screening.
