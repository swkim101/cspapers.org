We give an automatic prover for verifying logical properties of parallel processes. The prover bases on a subsystem of the system given in [8]. We mechanize it so that a proof-tree is automatically constructed. The prover reduces a parallel program into possible serial ones by applying rules of inference 'interruption' etc.. This paper includes some examples processed by the prover.
