DISIMA (Distributed Image Database Management System) is a research project under development at the University of Alberta. DISIMA implements a database approach to developing an image database system. Image contents are modeled using objectoriented paradigms while a declarative query language and a corresponding visual query language allow queries over syntactic and semantic features of images. The distributed and interoperable architecture is designed using common facilities as defined in the Object Management Architecture (OMA).
