Body area network(BAN) technology, as an emerging technology, has a very short history. Initial applications of BANs are expected to appear primarily in the healthcare domain, especially for continuous monitoring and logging vital parameters of patients suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma and heart attacks. However, many hospitals acquire electronic patient records systems in these years, with Electronic health record (EHR), which is a systematic collection of electronic health information about an individual patient. While the BAN technology is still in its primitive stage it is being widely researched and once adopted. Considering the incomplete utilization of electronic health record lost in most BAN systems, we propose a technique to Semi-automatic monitor human body using wearable biosensors, with the help of ontology model for EHR knowledge. The system MobiEHR has some distinctive features different from the existing systems [1, 2]: The continuously information will be transmitted wirelessly to users’ mobile phone first. Then this phone will instantly transmit all information in real or delayed time to the backend system. In the backend system, every user’s health status is monitored and computed by EHR ontology model. If an emergency is detected, the system will immediately inform the patients’ family and paramedic through the computer system by sending appropriate messages or alarms.
