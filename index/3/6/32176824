Max-margin and kernel methods are dominant approaches to solve many tasks in machine learning. However, the paramount question is how to solve model selection problem in these methods. It becomes urgent in online learning context. Grid search is a common approach, but it turns out to be highly problematic in real-world applications. Our approach is to view max-margin and kernel methods under a Bayesian setting, then use Bayesian inference tools to learn model parameters and infer hyper-parameters in principle ways for both batch and online setting.
