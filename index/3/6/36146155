As software scalability lags behind hardware parallelism, understanding scaling behavior is more important than ever. This paper demonstrates how to use Parallel Block Vector (PBV) profiles to measure the scaling properties of multithreaded programs from a new perspective: the basic block's view. Through this lens, we guide users through quick and simple methods to produce high-resolution application scaling analyses. This method requires no manual program modification, new hardware, or lengthy simulations, and captures the impact of architecture, operating systems, threading models, and inputs. We apply these techniques to a set of parallel benchmarks, and, as an example, demonstrate that when it comes to scaling, functions in an application do not behave monolithically.
