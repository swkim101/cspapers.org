The software engineering community has taken a great interest in using domain-specific languages (DSLs) [1] to improve the productivity of software development. We demonstrate the design of a DSL as a variant of object-oriented development by applying UML [2] via the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) [3] [4], exposing significant software functionality to the non-programmer domain experts.
