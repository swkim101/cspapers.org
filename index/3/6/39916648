A scientific workflow combines data and processes into a configurable, structured set of steps that implement semi-automated computational solutions of a scientific data management or analysis problem. Scientific workflow systems provide graphical user interfaces to combine different technologies along with efficient methods for using them with the goal to increase the efficiency of the scientists. This tutorial provides an introduction to scientific workflow construction and management (Part I) and includes a detailed hands-on session (Part II) using the Kepler system. It is intended for an audience with a computational science background. It will cover principles and foundations of scientific workflows, Kepler environment installation, workflow construction using Kepler library components, and workflow execution management that uses Kepler facilities to provide process and data monitoring and provenance information, as well as high speed data movement solutions. This tutorial also incorporates hands-on exercises and application examples from different scientific disciplines.
