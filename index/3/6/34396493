Three-axis force sensors based on the principle of the pressure pick-up device are characterized by their manufacturability, simple structure, and miniature size. Their use, however, has not been explored due to the insufficient force information they provide. To make the most of the three-axis force sensor, the authors have proposed a new six-axis force sensors composed of two three-axis force sensors and a connector [twin-head (TH) six-axis force sensor] and examined the possibility of realization for sensors using two identical three-axis force sensors. This paper discusses TH force sensors constructed from two different types of three-axis sensors. While fifteen types of combinations are theoretically conceivable, it is proved that nine types can result in a characteristic matrix with full rank.
