This paper evaluates undergraduate students' knowledge, interests and experiences with 20 topics from the TREC Robust Track collection. The goal is to characterize these topics along several dimensions to help researchers make more informed decisions about which topics are most appropriate to use in experimental IIR evaluations with undergraduate student subjects.
