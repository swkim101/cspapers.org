In industry, many people regard advanced testing techniques and formal analysis methods as, at best, prohibitively expensive and time consuming, and, at worst, ineffective and inefficient. This panel was convened to discuss how and why these methods have received this reputation and whether this perception is justified, and to share experiences with and ideas for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of software testing and analysis. Additionally, the panel was asked to consider steps that can help reverse the perception among practitioners that such methods are not cost effective.
