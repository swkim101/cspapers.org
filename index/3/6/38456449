The goal of the NLG project is to enhance person-computer interaction by using more than one mode of communication. The project uses a combination of natural language and graphics for both input and output. This allows development of practical, habitable systems suitable for users who are naive about programming, and encourages productive use of computers by more people. Mixed graphical and linguistic interaction could be an important tool in a variety of application areas.
