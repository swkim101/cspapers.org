SNA is both an architecture and a set of products built in conformance with the architecture (1,2,3). The architecture is layered and precisely defined; it is both evolutionary and cost effective for implementing products. Perhaps the largest component of cost effectiveness is performance: transaction throughput and response times. For SNA, this involves data link control protocols (for SDLC and S/370 channel DLC's), routing algorithms, protocols used on the sessions that connect logical units (LU-LU session protocols), and interactions among them.
 SNA's DLC and routing protocols have been discussed elsewhere (4,5,6); this talk examines protocols on sessions between logical units (LU-LU session protocols) and illustrates the results of design choices by comparing the performance of various configurations.
