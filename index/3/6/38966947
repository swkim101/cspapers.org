Recently, construction grammar has emerged as a linguistic theory for representing these complex and often idiomatic linguistic forms. Furthermore, analogical generalization has been proposed as a learning mechanism for extracting linguistic constructions from input. I propose an account that uses a computational model of analogy to learn and generalize argument structure constructions.
