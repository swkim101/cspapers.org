Resource reclaiming refers to the problem of utilizing the resources left unused by a task when it executes in less than its worst-case computation time, or when a task is deleted from the current schedule. In dynamic real-time multiprocessor environments, resource reclaiming can be used to improve the average performance. Dynamic resource reclaiming algorithms must be effective in reclaiming unused time and also avoiding any anomalies. The authors present resource reclaiming algorithms with these properties. These algorithms are designed to have time complexity independent of the number of tasks in a schedule. The effectiveness of the algorithms is demonstrated through simulation studies. The algorithms have also been implemented in the Spring Kernel. >
