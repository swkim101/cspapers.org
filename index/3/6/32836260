This paper describes a low-cost architecture for uncompressed wireless system for HD/SD-SDI, using UWB technology in the range of 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. It has been broken down into three separate devices the first one being the UWB transmitter, the second one being an antenna coin disc type and the third one being the receiver. An Audio-Video transmission test has been done for a transmission distance up to 5 meters and the result has proved successful. The experimental results comply with the indoor FCC rules.
