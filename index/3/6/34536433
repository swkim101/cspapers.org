The second Workshop on Optimizing Stencil Computations is held in Portland, Oregon, USA on October 20, 2014, as part of the 2014 ACM SIGPLAN conference on Systems, Programming Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH). The workshop's objective is to bring together users of stencil computations and building systems, languages, and frameworks that optimize such computations, which appear in a large variety of domains. Because of their ubiquity, importance, and relative simplicity, stencils are a rich and varied area of research for a number of systems communities, and we have constructed the workshop to emphasize cross-project discussion. In addition to submitted papers, we are inviting keynote speakers from important stakeholders who use stencils in their applications. Proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library.
