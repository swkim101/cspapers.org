The number of available Linked Data datasets has been increasing over time. Despite this, their use to recognise entities in unstructured plain text (Entity Linking task) is still limited to a small number of datasets. In this paper we propose a framework adaptable to the structure of generic Linked Data datasets. This adaptability allows a broader use of Linked Data datasets for the Entity Linking task.
