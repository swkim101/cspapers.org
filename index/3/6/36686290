In this paper we describe the interface of the application support system ASS which will be integrated as a top level interface into the distributed DBMS POREL. We introduce the application description language ADL, which can be used for the description of applications and of the input/output data of application operators, and we describe the interface which is available for specifying these ADL descriptions. A dialog support is presented for the specification of the input data of an operator. Thus ASS can support a wide range of interactions between the user and a data base system. In addition we investigate the generation of operator occurrences from operator skeletons which provide a flexible connection of application operators to the data base system.
