This paper presents a mono-camera based simultaneous obstacle recognition and distance estimation method for power transmission lines(PTLs) inspection robot to avoid obstacles on or around them. The proposed robot inspects the PTLs while moving along them between power transmission towers. For autonomous navigation, our robot recognizes obstacles and avoids a collision with them. In addition, it can stop at the ends of the PTLs by recognizing its structures, such as insulators, installed at the ends of them. In order to recognize obstacles or insulators efficiently, initially, a robust PTLs detection method based on vanishing point estimation is proposed since they are installed on or around the PTLs. Then, obstacle models with various scales are built, and multiple regions-of-interest(ROIs) according to the scales of the model are constructed along the detected PTLs. Finally, obstacles are recognized within the multiple ROIs. Because each ROI represents a corresponding scale of the obstacle model to be matched, the proposed approach can efficiently deal with scale changes and also estimate distance between the robot and the obstacle simultaneously with obstacle recognition. Experimental results not only show that the proposed method correctly recognizes obstacles but also that the distance between the robot and the obstacles is estimated efficiently.
