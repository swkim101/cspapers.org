Deep learning has rapidly moved from a marginal approach in the machine learning community less than ten years ago to one that has strong industrial impact, in particular for high-dimensional perceptual data such as speech and images, but also natural language. The demand for experts in deep learning is growing very fast (faster than we can graduate PhDs), thereby considerably increasing their market value. Deep learning is based on the idea of learning multiple levels of representation, with higher levels computed as a function of lower levels, and corresponding to more abstract concepts automatically discovered by the learner. Deep learning arose out of research on artificial neural networks and graphical models and the literature on that subject has considerably grown in recent years, culminating in the creation of a dedicated conference (ICLR). The tutorial will introduce some of the basic algorithms, both on the supervised and unsupervised sides, as well as discuss some of the guidelines for successfully using them in practice. Finally, it will introduce current research questions regarding the challenge of scaling up deep learning to much larger models that can successfully extract information from huge datasets.
