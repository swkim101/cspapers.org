This workshop will focus on projects and technologies that are adopting scientific portals and gateways. These technologies are characterized by delivering well-established mechanisms for providing familiar interfaces to secure Grid resources, services, applications, tools, and collaboration services for communities of scientists. In most cases access is enabled through a web browser without the need to download or install any specialized software or worry about networks and ports. As a result, the science application user is isolated from the complex details and infrastructure needed to operate an application on the Grid.
