This article aims at updating the domains belonging to the parameters of the model resulting from the decomposition of the linear system on the Meixner-like basis. The robust identification is performed after applying the minimization of the Normalized Mean Square Error to estimate the optimal Meixner-like pole. In the context of set membership identification, the feasible parameter set is defined as the set of plant parameters which are consistent with the model structure, the assumptions on disturbances (unknown but bounded) and all available measurements.
