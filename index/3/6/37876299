1. SUMMARY Scratch [9, 10] is a media-rich programming environment originally designed to introduce and motivate programming in after-school settings such as the Computer Clubhouse [11, 12]. Programs are constructed by assembling stacks of colorful command blocks that eliminate syntax issues, and encourage exploration. Scratch makes it easy to program projects that users find motivating and empowering, such as animated stories, interactive presentations, and games. Yet since Scratch includes repetition constructs, conditionals, threads, communications, user input, and variables, it also introduces many key computer science ideas. Concepts that are often difficult for novices are easier to understand in Scratch because less is hidden. For example, variables can be made visible, helping the user to immediately understand the effect of operations such as clearing or incrementing that variable. Scratch is also a social computing network via the Scratch web site [9]. This community of programmers encourages a dramatic alternative to traditional lecture, lab-based programming pedagogy [1, 4, 6, 7, 8].
