The design of complex mixed-signal system-on-a-chip (SOC) designer poses challenging requirements on the simulation design environment. The simulation platform has to include simulations at the behavioral, gate and transistor-level which have traditionally been done in separate environments. As the scaling trend continues, the designer needs additional accuracy and capacity, new capabilities such as efficient statistical simulation that takes into account layout dependent effects. In this panel we have representatives from the CAD and design community discussing the challenges and current solutions available to the mixed-signal simulation challenge.
