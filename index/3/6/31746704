We develop representations for locative and path specifying prepositions emphasizing the implementability of the underlying semantic primitives. Our primitives pertain to mechanical characteristics such as geometric relationships among objects, kinematic or motional characteristics implied by prepositions. The representation along with representation for action verbs along similar lines, have been used to successfully animate the performance of tasks underlying natural language imperatives by "human" agents.
