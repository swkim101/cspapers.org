In the first part of this presentation, I would like to spend a few minutes on background information on NWL and on the goals and history of the project of which DISPLAYTRAN is a part so as to put the work which will be described in its proper perspective. I will also describe briefly several other parts of this project which are of interest. The second part of the presentation will discuss DISPLAYTRAN at some length.
