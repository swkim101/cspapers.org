It has been nearly four years since the first MOOCs (massive open online courses) were offered by Stanford University. MOOCs are now offered to tens of millions of learners worldwide, by hundreds of top universities. MOOCs are no longer an experiment - the learning, reach, and value they offer are now a reality. I will show how MOOCs provide opportunities for open-ended projects, intercultural learner interactions, and collaborative learning. I will discuss some of data that we are collecting from MOOCs, and what we are learning from these data about both courses and learners. Finally, I will discuss both data and examples of the kind of transformative impact that can be derived from providing millions of people with access to the world's best education.
