The ANSI/SPARC proposal provides a framework for multiple view support in future Database Management Systems. In this paper some of the issues and problems are outlined through our example, which follows the ANSI/SPARC framework. Features for the conceptual model are discussed. Three external models corresponding to the hierarchical, network and relational approach are mapped onto the conceptual model. Mappings and transforms are outlined. The facilities of the internal model are sketched.
