This paper presents a novel control method for a human-robot cooperative task. There is a problem that a cooperative fitting task, i.e., peg-in-hole task, could not be performed precisely using a conventional impedance control. A proposed controller changes a control mode according to the task. An impedance control based on a position control is used in a carrying task and a torque control with compensation for its dead weight and friction is used in the fitting task. In order to confirm the usefulness of the proposed control, a human-robot cooperative carrying and peg-in-hole task was performed. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed control is effective for the human-robot cooperative task.
