This paper focuses on routing algorithm with two quality of service constraints: bandwidth and delay. The former is a concave constraint while the later is additive. The goal of algorithm is to accept as many routing requests as possible. Therefore, the proposed algorithm reactively calculates link weights based on link bandwidths. Then, a heuristic idea is applied to Dijkstra in order to find a path satisfying delay constraint and having as little weight as possible. Simulated experiments demonstrate that our proposal have better performance than existing solutions in term of both acceptance ratio and computing time.
