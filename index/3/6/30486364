Recent technological progress in integrated low power CMOS based imaging devices has led to new type of sensors such as Cyclops. Cyclops is a CMOS image sensor, with reduced complexity and power that allows it to mate with typical sensor network nodes such as Motes. This motivates a new class of sensor networks which exploit vision.In this demonstration we introduce a network of Motes that carry Cyclops sensors. In this network, each individual node can be programmed to perform specific operation on the image. These operations include detecting objects in the scene, detecting edges, reporting histogram of the image, getting the image across the network or getting only particular region of interest.The demonstration showcases the functionality of our network to detect objects. Each node in the network is programmed to detect presence of the objects in its field of view. In addition, users can request the whole image or particular region of interest which the presence of the object has been detected. Performance studies as well as architectural choices will be presented along with outstanding challenges and opportunities.
