Chip interfaces, including standards like PCI Express, are increasingly relying on high-speed serial technology. This move from MHz to GHz brings with it a myriad of chip design challenges that many designers have never faced before. This diverse panel of experts in chip and IP mixed-signal design will describe not only why you SHOULD be afraid (very afraid), but also what's being done to make this transition practical, including new design techniques and standards.
