The authors describe a motion planning system for sliding operations with a parallel two-fingered gripper used to escape from a situation where an object cannot be grasped. First they describe the problems of escaping from a situation where an object cannot be grasped and the actions to solve them. Then they propose a new method for planning manipulator motions for these actions using sliding operations based on geometrical information about the environments. The results of the method and its validity are shown.
