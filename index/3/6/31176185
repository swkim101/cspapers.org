The tutorial presents the state-of-the-art in methodologies and tools for round-trip-engineering of object-oriented software systems. This covers not only (UML) class diagrams but also behavior diagrams like message sequence charts, collaboration diagrams, state charts, and activity diagrams. In addition, round-trip engineering with standard design patterns is addressed. This covers design by combining design patterns, implementation of design patterns, including code generation, and the recognition of standard design patterns in code fragments.
