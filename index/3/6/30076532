Higher education has the opportunity (and often the mandate) to provide STEM outreach to their communities. Summer camp programs are one mechanism for providing quality CS learning experiences to a wide audience. This BOF will provide a platform for discussing strategies to make summer camps fun and sustainable. What are camp topics have been successful? How is funding obtained and sustained? Nationally, technology camps run the gamut from small, one-week programs to large camps that serve hundreds. The proposer will share his experience developing the University of Utah GREAT camps (www.cs.utah.edu/~dejohnso/GREAT), which have over 700 students attend one-week camps and hopes the BOF will attract others with their own experiences.
