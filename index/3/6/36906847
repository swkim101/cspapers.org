The Task Force defined a new knowledge area, Discrete Structures, as part of the core body of knowledge that every computer science major must learn, identified a 43-hour block of discrete mathematics material and recommended that this material be taught early in a studentâ€™s four-year program so that these concepts can be applied, where appropriate, in later computer science courses. The Task Force presented three models for covering the essential knowledge units in Discrete Structures: a one-semester course, a full-year sequence or an integration of the mathematics topics within an introductory computer science sequence. The Task Force further recommended that additional mathematics in other areas (such as calculus or linear algebra) should also be included in a computer science program, although guidelines for the specific areas or the number of hours that additional mathematics might encompass were not included.
