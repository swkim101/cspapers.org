pH level plays a vital role in the maintenance of human metabolic activity. pH levels of different bodily fluids i.e. blood, serum, urine etc are important parameters in diagnosing any condition, as unbalanced pH levels can interrupt all cellular activities and corrodes body tissues. In this paper a concept of implementing pH parameters in HL7v3 that is XML based is presented. The study includes a design of a temperature compensated digital pH meter interfaced through serial port with computer, XML schema is used to centralize the computerized data so as the patients and medical specialists around the world can access pH values of different bodily fluids through a unique identification (UID) code that assist them in diagnosing or treatment of a patient more effectively.
