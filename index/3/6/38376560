Recent investigations into the psychological factors underlying computer programming have focused on the effects of internal documentation and statement indentation on programmer performance [1, 5, 7]. Using memory recall approaches several studies have concentrated on the relationship between logic segments of a program's algorithm and the memory organization of the programmer.
 Since memory organization appears to be a functional psychological process, it seems reasonable to assume that indentation and documentation function as aids to comprehension rather than as organizers for memory [4]. The purpose of this study was to examine experimentally the relationship between documentation, indentation and the comprehension of computer programs.
