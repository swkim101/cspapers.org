his study investigates the cognitive processes involved in program comprehension based on eye gaze tracking. Thirty-eight participants were asked to comprehend the test programs. Eye-movement analysis was employed to track the students' gaze paths while they traced the programs for comprehension. Cognitive processes were then obtained by sequential analysis of the gaze data to investigate the significant sequences of attention areas. The mined cognitive processes were compared between high and low comprehenders. The experiment results show that most subjects focused on major part of the program to comprehend the program. However, high comprehenders traced the program in a more logical manner. In addition, low comprehenders needed more manual calculation and also needed to trace back to prior statements for recalling required information, which might be because they had limited working memory capacities for computing and memorizing. Subjects performed better on cognitive processes involved in the working memory (short-term memory, mental arithmetic, and logical thinking) also performed better on program comprehension. Working memory seems to play an important role in program comprehension. These results can provide suggestions for researchers/instructors to develop adaptive instructional strategies for students of different characteristics.
