In the 1956 Darmouth College conference two aspects of the definition of AI were emphasized: a) the separation between the knowledge and the procedures using it and b) the equivalence of the different knowledge representation (KR) formalisms. Taking the last concept as an origin, an idea arose in Knowledge Engineering: Building generic KR's that could allow to represent any Knowledge Base (KB) developed using any formalism, to work with it without worrying about the actual formalism used in the construction of the KB.
