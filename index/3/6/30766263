Automatic image aesthetics rating has received a growing interest with the recent breakthrough in deep learning. Although many studies exist for learning a generic or universal aesthetics model, investigation of aesthetics models incorporating individual user’s preference is quite limited. We address this personalized aesthetics problem by showing that individual’s aesthetic preferences exhibit strong correlations with content and aesthetic attributes, and hence the deviation of individual’s perception from generic image aesthetics is predictable. To accommodate our study, we first collect two distinct datasets, a large image dataset from Flickr and annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk, and a small dataset of real personal albums rated by owners. We then propose a new approach to personalized aesthetics learning that can be trained even with a small set of annotated images from a user. The approach is based on a residual-based model adaptation scheme which learns an offset to compensate for the generic aesthetics score. Finally, we introduce an active learning algorithm to optimize personalized aesthetics prediction for real-world application scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively learn personalized aesthetics preferences, and outperforms existing methods on quantitative comparisons.
