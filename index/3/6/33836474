Rubber compounds are readily bonded to nylon or polyamides, particularly tire cords of polyamides in which a high proportion of the amide linkages are attached directly to aromatic rings, using a two-step dip process in which the first dip comprises a liquid dispersion or solution of an epoxide having an average of from about two to four epoxide groups per molecule and a molecular weight up to about 600 and the second dip comprises an aqueous dispersion of a mixture of a major amount of a rubbery vinyl pyridine copolymer and a minor amount of a heat reactable 2,6-bis(2,4-dihydroxy phenylmethyl)-4-chlorophenol composition. High H-adhesions are obtained with this process. It is particularly useful for the bonding to rubber compounds of crystalline polyamides having a large number of aromatic groups in the polymeric structure, e.g., "Fiber B".
