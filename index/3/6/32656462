Jackson State University is the lead institution in a Cooperative Regional Educational Computing Network. The network is funded by the National Science Foundation. When it began operating in January, 1974, it involved eleven (11) other participating institutions. Now there are seventeen (17).
 The purpose of the network is to provide appropriate equipment, with an accompanying massive educational effort, so as to allow each of the participating institutions to become more aware of the academic implications of computers. The ultimate goal is to profoundly affect basic curricula.
 The results have been positive. Some faculty at participating institutions have reconstructed course content so as to include the use of the computer at appropriate points in their courses. More positive is the fact that a large number of students from disadvantaged educational and cultural backgrounds now have access to interactive computing.
