This paper reviews the major characteristics of existing programs for automatically solving space planning problems. It outlines general features of this class of problem and introduces a set of heuristic decision rules called Constraint Structured Planning, which in preliminary tests have efficiently solved a variety of problems. Developments allowing even greater efficiencies are also outlined.
