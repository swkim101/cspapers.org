This paper presents a method of extracting prescribed items from a summary or an abstract of technical papers. An experimental system is now under development. The internal expression of an input sentence is transformed into a standard form which has the standard case-labels for extraction of items. The part of remaining sentences is combined with the adjacent sentence into an item section every main item. [1] And the prescribed items are extracted efficiently.
