This work addresses the problem of encoding cognitive agents that are capable of complex reasoning beyond simple rules, within agent-based models (ABM). This is particularly important for social simulation where agents represent people. We provide a general solution to this problem through infrastructure that allows the integration of stateof-the-art Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) and ABM systems. In this paper, we demonstrate how this infrastructure is being used to help emergency services in Australia plan for community evacuations.
