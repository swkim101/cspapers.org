The SRC is supported by 29 member companies and sponsors basic and applied research in semiconductor devices, processes, and design at U.S. universities. There are two centers of excellence and fourteen research projects in the SRC Design Sciences research program. The center of excellence in CAD at the University of California at Berkeley considers all phases of the design process but emphasizes most heavily the device, layout and circuit levels. The Carnegie-Mellon University Center of Excellence In CAD is likewise broadly based but tends to concentrate on the functional levels of the design process. The 14 university research projects address all levels of the design process.
