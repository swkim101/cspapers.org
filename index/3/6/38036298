A view is a derived relation defined in terms of base (stored) relations. A view can be materialized by storing the tuples of the view in the database. A materialized view provides fast access to data; the speed difference is critical in applications where the query rate is high and the views are complex or over data in remote databases, so that it is not feasible to recompute the view for every query.
