The most difficult task when using simulation tools for communication networks and protocols is usually represented by the modeling of applications and their protocols for different networkspsila technologies. For this reason, the need for simulation tools appeared, which could connect real communication applications and networks with simulated networks. This paper presents some simulation results regarding real-time simulations, which were done in the context of a military project about the modeling of Command and Control Information Systems. A new OPNET Modeler module System-in-the-Loop was used, which allows for communication between real and simulated devices and networks, and represents a new simulation approach. The test network we built using these tools, where we connected computer equipment producing real-time video stream with a simulated mobile wireless 802.11g network on a virtual terrain.
