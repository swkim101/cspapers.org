Following news about a specific event can be a difficult task as new information is often scattered across web pages. An up-to-date summary of the event would help to inform users and allow them to navigate to articles that are likely to contain relevant and novel details. We demonstrate an approach that is feasible for online tracking of news that is relevant to a user's ad-hoc query.
