The computer keyboard is a widely used input device to operate computers, such as text entry and command execution. Typically, keystrokes are detected as binary states (e.g. "pressed" vs. "not pressed"). Due to this, more complex input commands need multiple key presses that could go up to pressing four keys at the same time, such as pressing "Cmd + Shift + Opt + 4" to take a screenshot to the clipboard on macOS. We present GestAKey, a technique to enable multifunctional keystrokes on a single key, providing new interaction possibilities on the familiar keyboards. The system consists of touch sensitive keycaps and a software backend that recognizes micro-gestures performed on individual keys to perform system commands or input special characters. In this demo, attendees will get the chance to interact with several GestAKey-enabled proof-of-concept applications.
