A user friendly database query system should provide more than an easy to use query syntax. Other conventions of dialogue apply as well. In particular, we note that a failing query (one that returns no data) is contrary to usual expectations and that a more informative response than the typical 'NULL' is warranted. Recommendations are given and computational procedures in the context of high level access to a Network database are described. An example implementation and extensibility to other data models and query languages are also discussed.
