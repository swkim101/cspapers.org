In this paper, we describe the design of a profile generator toolkit, which aims to automatically create realistic user profiles for a mobile personalized portal service. These profiles simulate actual user behavior and are utilized to experiment with a personalized crawling system, called eRACE. With the help of this tool, we will assess the performance and scalability of the eRACE system by creating appropriate models.
