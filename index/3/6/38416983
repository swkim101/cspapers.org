The paper deals with an application of fuzzy control in joint servo control of a five-axis electric driven articulated robot arm. The same fuzzy control algorithm is used in all joint servo loops, requiring only multiplexing and proper scaling of the fuzzy controller inputs and outputs. The nonlinear character of the proposed fuzzy controller has provided for highly effective trajectory tracking. Trajectory tracking appears satisfactory also in the presence of external disturbances.<<ETX>>
