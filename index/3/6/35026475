The authors discuss educational strategies involving computational science at the secondary school level including scientific visualization using OpenGL graphics and parallel computing using PVM. They share curriculum ideas from a course called Supercomputer Applications including details from a unit on missile trajectory that progresses from a simple computer model to a computationally intensive supercomputer application.
