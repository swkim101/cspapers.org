Indiana University's 20.48 Teraflop IBM e1350 BladeCenter supercomputer system ("Big Red") has been made available to researchers throughout the U.S. via the NSF-funded TeraGrid. The Big Red system finished 23rd on the June 2006 Top500 list, making it at that time the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by a U.S. university and also the fastest computer to be made available through the TeraGrid to date.Big Red is a distributed shared-memory cluster, consisting of 512 IBM BladeCenter JS21s, each with two dual-core PowerPC 970 MP processors (2.5GHz), 8GB of ECC PC3200 SDRAM, 72GB local SATA disk for scratch space, 360 TB GPFS parallel filesystem and a PCI-X Myrinet 2000 adapter for high-bandwidth, low-latency MPI applications.A significant portion of Big Red will be allocated to TeraGrid utilization. The TeraGrid is the National Science Foundation's flagship effort to create a national cyberinfrastructure to support academic research and promote scientific discovery.
