This paper describes the general characteristics and architecture of RPCNET, a distributed computer network for use in the Education and Research area which is being developed in Italy. This project is a joint undertaking of the National Research Council, IBM Scientific Center and a number of Universities and Research Institutes.
 In order to match the variety of needs and contraints inherent in the environment in which the network must be developed and made operational, a functional rather than a system approach has been followed in the designing of the Network. The present architecture includes some modifications to the original design which were necessary in order to establish a more definite boundary between applications, interface and communication subnetwork.
 The mapping of these functions into physical components is also presented as well as some types of applications.
