Course syllabi, exercises, assignments, and project specifications are creative acts of design. But there are no conventions for citing such works, as one would cite a research paper or patent. There are several potentially important reasons for establishing conventions for citing educational content, and thus tracking their diffusion and influence. (1) Design of courseware is at least as important to teaching as is delivering lectures and grading assessments. If citation conventions were established, then the degree of adoption by others could be part of a teaching-faculty member's professional evaluation. (2) Research grants often include education and outreach plans, and being able to track the influence of materials under such plans would be valuable for funding agencies and principal investigators. (3) Establishing citation conventions may raise consciousness about citing any and all creative works that an instructor uses, particularly when we want our students to embrace citation best practices. After all, what most undergraduates will see of the scholarship modeled by faculty will be through teaching. (4) Conferences like SIGCSE are increasingly competitive, and publishing a paper that reports on educational material, thereby enabling "conventional citation" may be difficult. But we still want to cite and track uptake of the educational material. This lightning talk argues that citation conventions be adapted for educational materials, and describes a sample convention. The goal of the lightening talk is to gauge interest and solicit collaborators.
