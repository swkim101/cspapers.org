This paper proposes an alternative control algorithm for the mechanical system which interferes with both an environment and a human operator (man-machine system). The algorithm is designed so as to control the dynamics of the mechanical system to imitate passive tool dynamics. The proposed control algorithm specifies the human force augmentation ratio and the maneuverability of the system. The stability of the system is guaranteed for the passive environment and the passive human dynamics; the stability of the proposed control system is verified using Popov's hyperstability theorem.
