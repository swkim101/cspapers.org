The paper offers a systematic way of regrouping constraints into hierarchical structures capable of supporting information retrieval without backtracking. The method involves the formation and preprocessing of an acyclic database that permits a large variety of queries and local perturbations to be processed swiftly, either by sequential backtrack-free procedures, or by distributed constraint-propagation processes.
