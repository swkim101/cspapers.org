An electronic digital processor system including an internal memory for the storage of data and commands, an arithmetic and logic unit, a register set, data paths and control/timing circuitry together with peripheral control circuitry which provides a number of memory configurations and also provides offset addressing capability to access the interrupt control circuitry, interval timing circuitry and input/output ports. The several memory configurations include configurations that allow for the storage of commands and the storage of data in external devices interfaced to the processor system through the input/output port circuitries.
