The validity of what is taught in a computer science /information systems program is sometimes challenged when a student enters a “real world” environment. More often than we would like, we hear:“That won’t work here. This is the REAL world!“.After an experience as a faculty member working in the real world, WC are reassured that the things we teach do have validity. Some things that we teach, admittedly, could stand a little polishing. There are also things which are difficult to teach or learn without having experienced them. The purpose of this paper is to present some observations from a summer faculty internship and their implications for teaching.
