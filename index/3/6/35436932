1. MOTIVATION Companies are using the Web for information dissemination, sparking interest in models and efficient mechanisms for controlled access to information. In this context, securing XML documents is important. Much of the work on XML access control to date has studied models for the specification of XML access control policies, focusing on issues such as granularity of access and conflict resolution. However, there has been little work on enforcement of access control policies for queries. A naive two-step solution to secure query evaluation is to first compute query results, and then use access control policies to filter the results. Consider the XML database of an online-seller, which has information on books and customers. Assume that a specific user is allowed access to books and not to customer information. If only query results are filtered for accessibility, the XPath query:
