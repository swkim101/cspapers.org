This paper describes a programming exercise developed and used in CS2 classes to help introduce recursive programming. Providing a set of primitives which comprise a graphics system allows the students to focus on top down design and the nature of recursion, rather than on implementation details. The exercise entails drawing approximations of fractals by using the graphics primitives which are provided. The exercise was positively received by the students and provided a basis on which to discuss top down design and the desirability of hiding implementation details.
