A simple unification algorithm for infinite trees has been developed. The algorithm is designed to work efficiently under structure sharing implementations of logic programming languages, e.g., Prolog (Warren [3]). A relation, called "is covered with", between two terms is introduced to terminate the algorithm. The fundamental operations are to compute the frontier set of two given terms and to test the relation between them. A termination proof is shown.
