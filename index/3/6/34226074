Simulation with DEVS-CLOSSuleyman Sevinc, University of Sydney , Australia
This tutorial has two purposes: to show how the features of CLOSaffect a design and to describe the design of a general-purposesimulation system. The tutorial is designed for those who want tounderstand the practical importance of the unique features of CLOSand also those who would like to learn how to use or buildobject-oriented simulation systems.
The tutorial emphasizes the underlying model of object-orientedprogramming in CLOS and distinguishes it from other models. It alsodescribes the requirements of a simulation system and the design ofDEVS-CLOS, a publicly available simulation system. DEVS-CLOS is anextension to CLOS that supports modeling and simulation. Itsupports visualization, supports hierarchical design ofsimulations, allows first-order logic in models, and supportsadaptive system simulation. The tutorial shows how a system likeDEVS-CLOS can be used to solve typical simulation problems, and howCLOS concepts like multimethods, multiple inheritance, pre- andpost-methods and dispatching algorithms were used in the design ofDEVS-CLOS.
