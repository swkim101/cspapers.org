During the development of a new program for teaching the subject of computer communication at high school, we examined different ways of teaching the algorithmic aspect of communication protocols. Upon trying the "standard" frontal lecture-type presentation, only a minority of the students comprehended the protocols.In looking for an alternative way of teaching, we developed a simulation game in which the students act as the protocol components. After playing the game, they discuss the characteristics of the protocol as experienced through playing.We found the simulation game method to be far more effective than the lecture-type presentation. The simulation game method had significantly improved the level of understanding and the motivation of the students.In this paper we describe the simulation game and its didactic method and discuss the results of applying it in high school classes in Israel during the past year.
