In this paper, relative azimuth audio localization is investigated using two microphones and an asymmetric mask. The Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral method is employed to obtain information on ITD (Interaural Time Differences) and IID (Interaural Intensity Differences) which are two important cues for sound localization. It is proved that the proposed system can locate a sound source with relative azimuth in nearly 360 degrees.
