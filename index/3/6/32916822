Users perceive consistency and inconsistency in syntax, and family resemblances among syntactic constructions. These factors are not captured in conventional BNF-like grammars. We argue that a generalised form of a two-level grammar is a better model of the user's perceptions, and show how the model relates to current psychological notions of organisation in recall and language learning. The model provides a unified interpretation of many previous results in HCI: we analyse here findings by Reisner (1981) and Barnard et al. (1981). Two preliminary experimental tests supporting the model are described.
