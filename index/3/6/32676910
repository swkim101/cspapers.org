The involvement of the computer in architectural design is aimed, to a large extent, at the generation of conceptual layouts - topologies - for arrangement problems. (“Topology”, according to encyclopedia Britannica: a geometry in which the shape and size of configurations are umimportant, the object of the study being rather the connectivity of the figure.) The computer generated topology will serve as a basis for further planning efforts leading to an architectural plan solution.
 An attempt to derive from the computer a more mature architectural solution, by the inclusion of a wider range of objectives into the optimization procedures, will face problems.
 An alternative approach would be to treat sequentially, rather than simultaneously, the consideration of additional objectives. This may not improve the objectivity of the approach but it would certainly make the built-in assumptions more transparent to the user of the programs. Some of the interdependencies which exist in the finding of solutions for individual objectives would have to be sacrificed, but despite these disadvantages, the sequential approach appears to be a more manageable one and such a procedure is described in this paper.
