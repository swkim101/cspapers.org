In this paper, we describe an anthropomorphic flutist robot that it's expected to have human-like organs from the mechanical hardware and control functions. We developed a "General Position" searching algorithm, which is based on the relative distance between the robot's mouth and the flute mouthpiece. It is possible for the robot, using the General Position, to blow a whole tone. Thereafter, we developed an autonomous searching algorithm for the lip part parameters after setting the General Position, and an algorithm for evaluating the blowing sound. The robot could stably play a flute using these algorithms.
