The author propose an approach that leads progressively towards a symbolic description by relying on the componential model. They also provide an approach that allows them to construct and to bring to the fore minimal descriptions for the different operations to be carried out by the robot by emphasizing the functional model. In robotics, elaborating a representation of information amounts to outlining tools which will allow this information to be memorized and exactly used by the decision-making system of the robot. It is shown that this can be done by relying jointly on two models for representation and structuration of the information, componential and functional, both of which are presented here.
