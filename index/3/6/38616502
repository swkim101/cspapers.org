One of the primary problems with using information retrieval systems are problems of access. The access problems for IR can be categorized into: problems of physically accessing the IR system, problems of using the correct retrieval syntax to access the stored information, and problems of using the correct keywords to access the stored information. The goals for this project were to develop a simple retrieval system that would contain much of the functionality of existing retrieval systems, while minimizing the problems of access. Thus, it serves as a system that can be easily accessed and used with minimal effort or instruction. This poster provides a brief description of the motivation for, and implementation of IRMail, and then describes how HCI researchers may perform searches on the HCIBIB archives with IRMail.
