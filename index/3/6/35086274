One should look closely at problem specifications before attempting solutions: we may find that the specifier has only a vague or even erroneous notion of what is required, that the solution of a more general or more specific problem may be of more use, or simply that the problem as given is misstated. Using software development as an example, we present a knowledge-based system for critiquing one form of problem specification, that of a formal software specification.
