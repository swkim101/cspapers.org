The control problem of the spatial tentacle manipulator with SMA control is presented. The difficulties determined by the complexity of the nonlinear integral-differential equations are avoided by using a very basic energy relationship of this system. A PD controller is discussed and a control coefficient selection procedure is introduced. Numerical simulations for planar and spatial tentacle models are presented and an experimental model is discussed.
