We characterize the information flow features of an information system in a state machine model, which emphasizes on the subject properties of information flows. We ague that the legality of a flow mainly depends on the subjects exploit it rather than the variables it passes through. Within the model, security policies and access control are studied in terms of information flow. We also discuss information flow security analysis. The motivation of this work comes from our experience in covert channel analysis.
