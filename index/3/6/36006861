This video summarizes a breakthrough in the emerging field of transmission line inspection and maintenance robots. Collaboration between electric utilities recently led to a robotic inspection of a large ocean inlet crossing transmission line, performed by LineScout Technology. Key challenges associated with the live line inspection and crossing of the suspension clamp are presented. Some of the findings revealed along the spans are shown. The accompanying paper also discusses some of the features of the robotic system that were found essentials for the success of the task.
