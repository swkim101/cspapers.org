A storage and retrieval scheme which places items to be stored at the nodes of a binary tree is discussed. The tree is always balanced in a certain sense thus insuring that no excessively long search paths can exist. In addition to presenting the storage and retrieval algorithms, the deletion problem is also solved. The programming approaches involved yield a non-trivial case study of list-processing techniques. Finally, a cost analysis is given.
