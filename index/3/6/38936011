The semantic Interpretation system of VISIONS receives a segmentation containing symbolically encoded regions, boundaries and endpoints. The model-builder consists of four major components: 1) multiple levels of representation for both the image-specific model and long-term general know ledge, 2) a set of modular knowledge sources, 3) a hierarchical modular strategy to control application of the knowledge sources, and 4) a tree representing the current state of search through the space of possible models.
