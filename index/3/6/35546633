Parameterized strings were introduced by Baker to solve the problem of identifying blocks of code that get duplicated in a large software system. Parameter symbols capture the notion of code identity while permitting renaming of variables. The code duplication problem was solved by first constructing a generalized suffix tree for the corresponding parameterized strings. The fastest known generalized suffix tree algorithm has an O(n.
