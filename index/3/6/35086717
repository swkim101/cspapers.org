We describe a new annual awards program, the Rising Renaissance Engineer Spectrum Awards, which recognizes a diverse body of students across all engineering departments at our institution for their initiatives and achievements in educational, research, and professional development activities. This award is unique at our institution because it is inclusively for students from all six engineering departments and specifically promotes underrepresented groups. This awards program complements existing engineering awards honoring faculty, staff, and alumni for their research, teaching, and service. It is modeled after the NCWIT (National Center for Women in Information Technology) Aspirations in Computing Award, which has successfully encouraged many female high school students to persist in computing careers. With the Computer Science Department spearheading the effort, this project is a collaborative partnership among representatives from all engineering departments.
