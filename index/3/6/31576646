Today, undergraduate Computer Science Education teaches mechanics without teaching problem solving. Typical curricula include courses in assembler languages, compiler theory, list processing, and automata theory. Every MS degree holder, and most BS degree holders, know Polish notation and have written parts of compilers. However, few of them have ever learned to write a program that can be easily enhanced or respond to changes as new management (instructor) requirements are set forth. Even fewer can read a program and describe what it does or debug a system consisting of ten or more modules.
