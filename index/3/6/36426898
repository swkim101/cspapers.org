The role of medical scans is vital in diagnosis and treatment. There is every possibility of distortion during the image acquisition process, which may badly affect the diagnosis based on these images. Thus, image processing has become an essential exercise to extract the exact information from the medical images or scans. In recent times, researchers made various attempts to enhance the biomedical images using various signal processing methods. Several techniques have been explored and reported for improving the quality of the medical images. Still, there is a scope of improvement in the area of quality enhancement of the medical scans. In this paper, we investigated an aura based technique for enhancing the quality of medical ultrasound images. An algorithm has been developed using aura transformation whose performance has been evaluated on a series of diseased and normal ultrasound images.
