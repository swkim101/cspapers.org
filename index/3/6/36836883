As a flexible and robust intelligent robot system, we have been developing an autonomous and decentralized robot system called ACTRESS, which is composed of multiple robotic agents. In this paper, introducing an idea of cooperative action with group organization and a strategy for cooperative task processing using communication, a method for team organization by efficient negotiation is presented. The efficient negotiation is realized by a newly developed communication functionality called groupcast and a learning mechanism utilizing historical records on past negotiation. The negotiation procedures for team organization are implemented, and as a result of simulation experiments, the efficiency of the learning mechanism is verified.<<ETX>>
