In the Fall of 1991 the University of Arizona installed GroupSystems, a group decision support system (GDSS), in a new facility in Sofia, Bulgaria. Fall 1991 marked two years since Bulgaria separated from the (then) USSR and was synchronous with the installation of a democratic government. The GDSS facility in Sophia is located at the University of National and World Economics. The facility contains eight user stations, a facilitator station, and a network server. A large monitor is available at the front of the room to allow individual screens to be publicly projected. The facility's GroupSystems software features modules for: brainstorming, stakeholder identification, voting. questionnaire design and administration, group editing. and topic discussion. The software can be run using either the Latin or Cyrillic alphabets. Anonymity is available in all modules and subgroups of participants can be created. Initial group experiences in the facility indicate that Bulgarians are receptive to GDSS technology, particularly modules allowing anonymous discussion. The current research proposes to compare the implementation of a GDSS technology for Bulgarian business people government officials with the implementation of the same technology for American foreign service officers serving in Bulgaria.
