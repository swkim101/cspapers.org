Specifically,low-rank embedding is employed under the multitaskframework, where each subject can be naturallyconsidered as one task. Then, two novel terms are incorporatedto align multiple tasks to pursue a better posedependentembedding. One is the cross-task alignmentterm, aiming to constrain each low-rank coefficient toshare the similar structure. The other is pose-dependentgraph regularizer, which is developed to capture manifoldstructure of same pose cross different subjects. Experimentson databases CMU-PIE, MIT-CBCL, and extendedYaleB with different levels of random noise areconducted and six embedding model based baselinesare compared. The consistent superior results demonstratethe effectiveness of our proposed method.
