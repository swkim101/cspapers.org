Proteome Analyst (PA) is a publicly available, high-throughput, web-based system for automatically predicting the function and properties of proteins. Biologists can use PA to predict, for example, the Gene Ontology (GO) molecular function and subcellular localization of a protein based on sequence information. Using sequence analysis tools and machine learning, PA gives high accuracy and broad coverage for both molecular function and subcellular localization predictions.
