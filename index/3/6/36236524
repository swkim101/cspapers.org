PhiMDP attempts to reduce the general RL problem, where the environment's states and dynamics are both unknown, toan MDP, while MC-AIXI-CTW incrementally learns a mixture of contexttrees as its environment model. The main idea of PhiMDP is toconnect generic reinforcement learning with classical reinforcementlearning. The first implementation of PhiMDP relies on astochastic search procedure for finding a tree that minimizes acertain cost function. This does not guarantee finding theminimizing tree, or even a good one, given limited search time. As aconsequence it appears that the approach has difficulties with largedomains. MC-AIXI-CTW is attractive in that it can incrementally andanalytically compute the internal model through interactions withthe environment. Unfortunately, it is computationally demanding dueto requiring heavy planning simulations at every single time step.We devise a novel approach called CTMRL, which analytically andefficiently finds the cost-minimizing tree. Instead of thecontext-tree weighting method that MC-AIXI-CTW is based on, we usethe closely related context-tree maximizing algorithm that selectsjust one single tree. This approach falls under the PhiMDPframework, which allows the replacement of the costly planningcomponent of MC-AIXI-CTW with simple Q-Learning. Our empiricalinvestigation show that CTMRL finds policies of quality as good as MC-AIXI-CTW's on sixdomains including a challenging Pacman domain, but in an order ofmagnitude less time.
