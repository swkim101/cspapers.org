Classical computer graphics textbooks (e.g. [1-4]) introduce the field by covering the details of raster-level algorithms. Many computer graphics educators have long recognized that depending on students’ backgrounds and needs (e.g. major vs non-major) [5,6] alternate approaches may be more appropriate [7-8]. With the recent advances in the field, advent of powerful hardware, and sophisticated APIs, the field of computer graphics has become much larger and richer. As educators, we must make tough decisions about what to include in a one semester/quarter class. This panel presents three distinct approaches to teaching introductory Computer Graphics without covering raster-level algorithms. These approaches are suitable for a wide-range of students with different backgrounds and needs. To ensure neutrality and balanced of viewpoints, the panel also discusses the merits of teaching raster-level algorithms and situations where the classical approach better aligns with and serves students’ needs.
