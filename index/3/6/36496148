In this paper, we introduce a fast, secure and robust scheme for digital image encryption using chaotic system of Lorenz, 4D hyper-chaotic system and the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-1. The encryption process consists of three layers: sub-vectors confusion and two-diffusion process. In the first layer we divide the plainimage into sub-vectors then, the position of each one is changed using the chaotic index sequence generated with chaotic attractor of Lorenz, while the diffusion layers use hyper-chaotic system to modify the values of pixels using an XOR operation. The results of security analysis such as statistical tests, differential attacks, key space, key sensitivity, entropy information and the running time are illustrated and compared to recent encryption schemes where the highest security level and speed are improved.
