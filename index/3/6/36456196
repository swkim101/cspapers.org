OpenDSA is an open-source, community-based effort to create a complete active-eBook for Data Structures and Algorithms courses at the undergraduate level. Active-eBooks go beyond hypertextbooks, being a close integration of text and images with interactive visualizations and assessment activities. They solve two major problems: The difficulty of conveying dynamic process with static media, and the need by students to have many practice exercises and immediate feedback. Development in HTML5/JavaScript allows maximum portability. OpenDSA will proceed with broad participation from the algorithm visualization community. Focusing on reuse of materials, instructors can pick and choose content and modify as desired.
