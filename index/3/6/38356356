In this paper, we present Twitcident, a framework and Web-based system for filtering, searching and analyzing information about real-world incidents or crises. Twitcident connects to emergency broadcasting services and automatically starts tracking and filtering information from Social Web streams (Twitter) when a new incident occurs. It enriches the semantics of streamed Twitter messages to profile incidents and to continuously improve and adapt the information filtering to the current temporal context. Faceted search and analytical tools allow users to retrieve particular information fragments and overview and analyze the current situation as reported on the Social Web.
