It has become abundantly clear to all that during the last two decades of the twentieth century and long into the twenty first, software will be both the heart and the binding force of all our large technological developments. Two decades ago large software systems began to be born. Within the last decade, leaders in industry, government, and the universities have realized that software can represent up to 90% of the cost of large computer projects. During this time period, the term Software Engineering has emerged, which can be defined as:
 Software Engineering: The collection of analysis, design, test, documentation, and management techniques needed to produce timely software within budgeted cost.
 One of the major challenges facing computer science departments is how to teach software engineering to the large number of B.S. and M.S. students who are now studying Computer Science.
