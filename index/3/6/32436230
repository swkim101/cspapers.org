Despite the progress made in planning androbotics, autonomous plan execution on a robot remainschallenging. One of the problems is that (classical) plannersuse abstract models which are disconnected from the sensorand actuation information available during execution. Thisconnection is typically created in a non-systematic way by somesystem-specific execution software. In this paper we proposeto explicitly represent Execution Knowledge that encodes theconnection between planning models and the actual actionsand observations for a given physical system. We present anexecution monitoring framework in which Execution Knowl-edge captures the expectations about physical plan execution.A violation of these expectations indicates an execution failure.
