THE GROUP The Human Interface (HI) group is part of product development in the Boston Development Center of Sun Microsystems, and was formed when we developed the Sun386i system. We are now responsible for designing and testing the User Interface (UI) for a range of software products. We also work closely with the HI group on the West coast (managed by Lin Brown) to promote UI standards and innovations.
