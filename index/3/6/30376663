The MultiView Project is an on-going 5-year NFS-ftrnded effort at the University of Michigan to develop and apply object-oriented view technology to address the needs of recently emerging applications such as data warehousing and workflow management systems that require the sharing, virtual restructuring, and caching of data [5]. Through MultiView, users can dynamically create and modify virtual classes and schemata at any time (Figure 1). MultiView, which is fully implemented on top of the GemStone OODB, is one of the first systems to provide updatable and incrementally maintained materialized object-oriented views [1, 5].
