The Adaptive Solutions CN APS architecture chip is a general purpose neurocomputer chip. It has 64 processors, each with 4 K bytes of local memory, running at 25 megahertz. It is capable of implementing most current neural network algorithms with on chip learning. This paper discusses the implementation of the Back Propagation algorithm on an array of these chips and shows performance figures from a clock accurate hardware simulator. An eight chip configuration on one board can update 2.3 billion connections per second in learning mode and process 9.6 billion connections per second in feed forward mode.
