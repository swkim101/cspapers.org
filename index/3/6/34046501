In this paper we present OfCourse, a vertical search engine for online course materials. These materials have the following characteristics: they are scattered very sparsely in the university Web sites; and are generated by the teachers with totally different HMTL templates and layouts. These characteristics impose some challenges for Web Classification (to identify the course materials) and Web Information Extraction (to extract course metadata, such as course title, time and ID) from the identified course homepages. Here, we describe our proposed method to tackle these challenges, and the features of this system. OfCourse, containing over 60,000 courses from the top 50 universities in the US, is currently available for public access at http://fusion.hpl.hp.com/OfCourse/.
