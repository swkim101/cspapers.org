Since the segmentation performance highly depends on the graph, most of existing methods focus on obtaining a precise similarity graph or on designing efficient cutting/merging strategies. However, these two components are often conducted in two separated steps, and thus the obtained graph similarity may not be the optimal one for segmentation and this may lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Graph-Without-Cut (GWC), for learning the similarity graph and image segmentations simultaneously. GWC learns the similarity graph by assigning adaptive and optimal neighbors to each vertex based on the spatial and visual information. Meanwhile, the new rank constraint is imposed to the Laplacian matrix of the similarity graph, such that the connected components in the resulted similarity graph are exactly equal to the region number. Extensive empirical results on three public data sets (i.e, BSDS300, BSDS500 and MSRC) show that our unsupervised GWC achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with supervised and unsupervised image segmentation approaches.
