In this work we present a co-located task space sensing and control system designed to control the end-effector motion of a mobile manipulator in the presence of dynamic and unknown base motion. We present a method for generating end-effector motion estimates at 1 kilohertz for use in real time control through visual-inertial sensor fusion. We show that a Moving Horizon Estimator outperforms Kalman filter-based methods in generating accurate predictive estimates for use in real time. We use this estimator to close a task space control loop directly at the end-effector, assuming no prior knowledge of the base pose and motion. We demonstrate the performance of this system on a hydraulically actuated arm which performs task-space tracking tasks in the presence of significant unknown base motion.
