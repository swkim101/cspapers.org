Most methods concentrate on learning representations with knowledge triples indicating relations between entities. In fact, in most knowledge graphs there are usually concise descriptions for entities, which cannot be well utilized by existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel RL method for knowledge graphs taking advantages of entity descriptions. More specifically, we explore two encoders, including continuous bag-of-words and deep convolutional neural models to encode semantics of entity descriptions. We further learn knowledge representations with both triples and descriptions. We evaluate our method on two tasks, including knowledge graph completion and entity classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, our method outperforms other baselines on the two tasks, especially under the zero-shot setting, which indicates that our method is capable of building representations for novel entities according to their descriptions.
