Panel abstract Majority of current Business Intelligence Data (BID) is spread out between incompatible tools like RDBMSs, OLAP engines, and spreadsheets. Bridges between them allow interchange of data and metadata thus providing a small degree of BID sharing, but due to lack of metadata standards, this sharing is limited to speci(cid:12)c installations. This creates an unacceptable situation where an analyst cannot get a complete picture of a business. A solution is needed, the Collaborative Analytical Processing (CAP) solution, which imposes a very tight integration between the tools so (meta) data interchange, change management, scalability and data availability is as good as in RDBMSs, and performance of OLAP queries is as good as in the specialized OLAP engines. Any CAP solution must assist business tools through simpli(cid:12)cation and integration so they can focus on business models, relationship management, fact discovery and presentation than on availability, performance and scalability. This panel will discuss feasibility of such solution and its place in the spectrum between RDBMS and specialized OLAP engines.
