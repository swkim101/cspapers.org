Near Field Communication (NFC) on mobile phones presents new opportunities and threats. While NFC is radically changing how we pay for merchandise, it opens a pandora's box of ways in which it may be misused by unscrupulous individuals. This could include malicious NFC tags that seek to compromise a mobile phone, malicious readers that try to generate fake mobile payment transactions or steal valuable financial information, and others. In this demo, we show the capabilities of our hardware solution, EnGarde, that protects a mobile phone from these vulnerabilities.
