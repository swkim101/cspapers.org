For decades, the computer architecture research community has focused mostly on fundamental infrastructure, providing innovations and breakthroughs that improved the performance and efficiency of computer systems, permitting application developers to produce progressively more exciting applications and capabilities. That paradigm is under increasing stress as we race to the end of Mooreâ€™s Law. I will argue that as our field diversifies with an unavoidable and increasing focus on specialization and applications, we should include novel sensors and actuators as part of our system designs, and ultimately humans as well.
