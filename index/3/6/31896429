A selector switch for musical instruments such as electric guitars is provided with a palm switch that can be manually actuated so that any of the various pick-ups of the guitar can be actuated, so that there is a convenient method of switching to either one or both of the electric pick-ups for treble sounds, bassy sounds and the like. The selector switch includes a construction that does not require use of the fingers or excess movement of the playing hand in order to actuate the pick-up selector switch. A rocker switch is provided with three positions that can be actuated with the heel of the players hand.
