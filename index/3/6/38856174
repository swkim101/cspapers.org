In order to meet the increasing need for quality conscience crops and to utilize the resources 
efficiently, the concept of Greenhouse was introduced. It assists in accurate monitoring and controlling of 
various parameters, in order to nurture healthy crops. In this paper efforts are made to acknowledge the 
problems associated with maintaining precise environmental conditions, and to implement a sophisticated 
system to supervise the real-time monitoring and controlling operation inside the Greenhouse. The necessity 
for an Automated System deploying wireless communication and remote sensing is considered. This paper 
illustrates the implementation of a WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) based embedded system supported by 
ZigBee network (over IEEE 802.15.4) for organizing Greenhouse parameters. The establishment of various 
topologies supported by ZigBee network viz. Star topology & Mesh Topology are illustrated. It also 
demonstrates the real time supervision of parameters such as temperature, humidity as well as the total 
power consumption of the system, along with appropriate sensors. With the help of a PC based GUI 
application developed on Java platform graphs are plotted to evaluate the system performance.
