Describes a method of representing volume data with haptical sensation. Recently, volume visualization has been used to analyze a large amount of data. However, volume-visualized images use the color or intensity of the pixels; thus it is hard to display high-dimensional volume data. The authors proposed to give force feedback to the volume model in several ways. They construct a test virtual volume model with force feedback provided by a force display system. The performance of the model is exemplified for a volume classification task.
