With the large component count of coming PetaFLOPS systems, component failures will be frequent. The success of those systems will therefore depend on their ability to avoid, cope and recover from failures. Unfortunately, research in this area is hampered by the limited understanding of what failures in real, large-scale systems look like, due to lack of publicly available failure data. This paper introduces the Computer Failure Data Repository (CFDR), an effort being undertaken at CMU to collect, share, and analyze failure data. The CFDR has been stimulated by the recent public release of a large set of failure data that has been collected over the past 9 years at Los Alamos National Laboratory and includes 23000 failures on more than 20 different systems, mostly large clusters. We present a high-level overview of some of our results from analyzing this data and describe the ongoing efforts and long-term plans of the CFDR.
