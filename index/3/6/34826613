Self-driving vehicles seem to have become quite the rage in popular culture over the past 3 years or so. Jumpstarted by the DARPA Grand Challenges, the promise of self-driving vehicles does have the potential to revolutionize modern transportation. This talk will provide some insights on many basic questions that, however, still remain unanswered. What are the technological barriers? What can or cannot be sensed? Can vehicles recognize and comprehend as good as (or better than) humans? What role does connectivity play (if any)? Will the technology be affordable for the masses? How do issues like liability, insurance, regulations and societal acceptance impact deployment? The talk will be based on road experiences interspersed with some speculation.
