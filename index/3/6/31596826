The emergence of the Internet as a global platform for computation and communication has sparked the development and deployment of many large-scale distributed systems. Often, these systems involve multiple stakeholders with divergent or even competing interests. Unmitigated selfish behavior in these systems can lead to high inefficiency or even complete collapse. There has been an increasing interest in applying economic and game-theoretic principles to help analyze and design such systems. The NetEcon+IBC workshop is a forum for researchers from different research areas– including networking, artificial intelligence, theory, and economics– to present and discuss novel approaches and results in the area of incentives in computing and communication systems. The workshop combines two workshops from previous years: the Workshop on the Economics of Networked Systems (NetEcon) and the Workshop on Incentive-Based Computing (IBC). These workshops were both individually successful in attracting exciting research in this area; by holding a joint workshop at ACM EC’07, we hope to build on these successes.
