We are interested in constructing solutions to time-dependent planning problems: problems in which time spent planning affects the utility of the system''s performance. In a previous paper, we define a fraomework for constructing solutions to time-dependent planning problems called expectation-driven iterative refinement. In this paper, we analyze and solve a moderately complex time-dependent planning problem involving path planning for a mobile robot, as a way of exploring a methodology for applying expectation-driven iterative refinement.
