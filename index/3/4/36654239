A fuzzy adaptive controller which is able to solve the problems of classical adaptive controllers and conventional fuzzy adaptive controller is suggested. The architecture of a fuzzy adaptive controller using the robust property of a fuzzy controller is explained. A design procedure which can be carried out mathematically and systematically from the model of an objective system is suggested, and related mathematical theorems and their proofs are also given. The performance of the proposed adaptive control algorithm is analyzed through a DC motor control simulation and experiments on a compliant robot system.
