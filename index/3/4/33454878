Most previous work in analytic generalization of plans dealt with totally ordered plans. These methods cannot be directly applied to generalizing partially ordered plans, since they do not capture all interactions among plan operators for all total orders of such plans. In this paper we introduce a new method for generalizing. partially ordered plans. This method is based on providing EBG with explanations which systematically capture the interactions among plan operators for all the total orders of a partially-ordered plan. The explanations are based on the Modal Truth Criterion [2], which states the necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring the truth of a proposition at any point in a plan (for a class of partially ordered plans). The generalizations obtained by this method guarantee successful and ineraction-free execution of any total order of the generalized plan. In addition the systematic derivation of the generalization algorithms from the Modal Truth Criterion obviates the need for carrying out a separate formal proof of correctness of the EBG algorithms.
