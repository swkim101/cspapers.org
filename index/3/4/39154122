It all began in Colossus, with a code-breaking machine that was one of the first known examples of a shift register. During the ages, the shift registers demonstrated their capacity to be the heart of any digital system. Now the applications are well-known as well in cryptography (Rijndael Algorithm) as in error correcting and in wireless communication systems. 
 
This paper contains an analysis of functioning for Linear Feedback Shift Register and Multiple Input-output Shift Register using grade 4 irreducible polynomials. Three kinds of scheme for implementation of a LFSR were analyzed and a formula that linked the results was verified.
