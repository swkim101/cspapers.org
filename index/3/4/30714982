The standard method for outdoor localization is GPS, because it is globally available, relatively accurate and receivers are inexpensive. However, GPS does not work well indoors due to low signal strength. We explore a new localization approach, which uses the same principle as GPS localization, but employs signals transmitted by aircraft. Compared to GPS, aircraft signals are strong and can be received indoors. Our prototype implementation achieves a user localization accuracy of approximately 25 meters.
