The purpose of this interactive poster is to encourage the exchange of information about techniques for gathering and analyzing data relevant to the evaluation of software used by a group. As more software is created for the use of group meetings, we must be able to evaluate that software, its interface and its effects within the meeting. Experimental evaluation of group software is more complex than that of single-user software. To evaluate the changes caused by the meeting software, it is necessary to collect data on the group process and its outcome.
