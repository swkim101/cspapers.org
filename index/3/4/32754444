First, a brief overview of the contents of this volume, the proceedings of the thirty-first ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2012). The proceedings includes an overview of the keynote address by Surajit Chaudhuri along with two papers based on invited tutorials, one by Michael Mahoney and one by Benjamin Pierce. There are 26 research papers that were selected by the Program Committee, out of 101 submissions with authors from over 25 countries across the world. Out of the 26 accepted papers, the program committee selected the paper Worst Case Optimal Join Algorithms by Hung Q. Ngo, Ely Porat, Christopher Re and Atri Rudra for the PODS 2012 Best Paper Award. In addition, the announcement of the 2012 ACM PODS Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award appears in the proceedings, given to Containment and Equivalence for an XPath Fragment by Gerome Miklau and Dan Suciu. The latter paper originally appeared in the proceedings of PODS 2002. Congratulations to the authors of these papers. 
 
The review process was grueling, and involved enormous effort from a large group of researchers. This year PODS experimented with the use of an External Review Committee, consisting of distinguished experts in areas of particular interest to PODS, in addition to our core Program Committee. We relied heavily on the Easychair system for management of all aspects of the review process, and we are extremely grateful to Andrei Voronkov for his help in adding and modifying new features to support the External Review Committee. All members of the Program Committee, External Review Committee, and the additional external referees deserve thanks for their work -- both for producing the selection of papers that appear here in the proceedings, and for providing high-quality feedback to all authors of submitted papers.
