This paper presents a study of optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) simulation models in agreement with an experimental system. The experimental oscillator is based on an optical fiber of 1 km length and operates at 8 GHz. Modelling references are the theoretical study introduced by Yao & Maleki in 1996, and the computational method of Levy et al introduced in 2009. From the comparison between the experimental data and the theoretical formula of the phase noise, we can determine the power spectral density of noise at the output of the photodetector. This value is then applied as a physical parameter of the computational model with those already known. From that point, it is possible to improve the simulation for a good agreement with the experimental data.
