Multi-touch operations are sometimes difficult to perform due to musculoskeletal constraints. We propose FingerSkate, a variation to the current multi-touch operations to make them less constrained and more continuous. With FingerSkate, once one starts a multi-touch operation, one can continue the operation without having to maintain both fingers on the screen. In a pilot study, we observe that participants could learn to FingerSkate easily and were utilizing the new technique actively.
