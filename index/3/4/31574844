We introduce participants to Peer Instruction (PI): an active learning technique shown to be effective across the CS curriculum. In PI, Students work together to exchange perspectives and answer challenging conceptual questions, and are supported by short teaching segments. We will introduce and motivate PI, demonstrate its use in combination with a clicker system, and describe ways to encourage student preparation for PI classes. Pre-lecture preparation may include reading quizzes or exploratory homeworks, two topics of recent interest in the computing research literature. We will explore this literature as part of our tour of a complete PI course: from pre-lecture, to lecture, to the course at large.
 Participants will work in groups to develop new PI questions addressing challenges to their students' learning, and discuss numerous pedagogical benefits conferred through PI.
 Instructors interested in increasing engagement in any CS course may attend. Participants are encouraged to bring current lecture materials. Laptop optional.
