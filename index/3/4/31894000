Today more and more patient journals are stored electronically but they are rarely used for more than statistical purpose. In this paper we present an approach where clinical patient journals are used for improved clinical decision making on an individual level. The underlying assumption is that medical staff benefit from comparing a specific patient with similar patient. By comparing symptoms, diagnosis, medication and outcome in an individual level they are able to make more informed decisions at the point of care. This paper presents some parts of our more than ten years research efforts in the area and some of the projects and their underlying hybrid approaches. As a foundation for all our projects we use case-based reasoning (CBR) research in combination with techniques from artificial intelligence, data mining, statistics and search techniques. Three systems are presented in two medical domains 1) decision support for stress diagnosis 2) decision support for stress treatment and 3) decision support for post-operative pain treatment and discuss results and lessons learned.
