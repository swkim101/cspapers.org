Every school day for the last six years, two classes of grade five and six public elementary school students have been using OISE's Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environment (CSILE) as a tool to support deep understanding of their usual curriculum. The design of this innovative collaborative educational hypermedia system, the first that we know of to be in daily classroom use, is driven by cognitive science research into expert learning and knowledge organization. A cornerstone of the CSILE approach is that students construct the contents of their database from scratch. They use CSILE's tools to construct linked textual and graphical database "notes" which are available to all members of the classroom community. They are browsed (via keywords, links, and other means of navigation), read, evaluated, built upon, and, commented on. A note's author is informed of all comments and all comments are available to all users of the database. This work, pioneered by Scardamalia and Bereiter [2], was the subject of two previous CHI posters.
