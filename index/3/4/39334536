Based on their previous theoretical studies on the retinal neural network, in this paper, the authors modify the model, and propose a method for a location task to be implemented into an active vision system. In the proposed method, a camera-taken image is processed with high resolution near the optical axis of the camera, and with low resolution in the periphery. Using such an inhomogeneously blurred image, in the experiment, the authors have shown that the system is able to emulate fixation with simple calculations, and its localization ability is precise enough to fixate each object without knowledge-based processes.<<ETX>>
