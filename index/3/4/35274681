Statistical Spoken Dialogue Systems have been around for many years. However, access to these systems has always been dif-ﬁcult as there is still no publicly available end-to-end system implementation. To alleviate this, we present PyDial, an open-source end-to-end statistical spoken dialogue system toolkit which provides implementations of statistical approaches for all dialogue system modules. Moreover, it has been extended to provide multi-domain conversational functionality. It offers easy conﬁguration, easy extensibility, and domain-independent implementations of the respective dialogue system modules. The toolkit is available for download under the Apache 2.0 license.
