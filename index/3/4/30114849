This workshop presents an award-winning, NSF-funded, project-based curriculum for algorithm design that includes algorithmic strategies for intractable problems. This curriculum is a sequence of laboratory projects comprising increasingly sophisticated solvers for a single intractable problem, designed to integrate into existing, one-term, undergraduate courses that teach algorithm design and/or intractability without sacrificing traditional course content. The presenters have used the curriculum in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course at their institution to help students tackle and appreciate intractability. This workshop presents versions of the curriculum centered on TSP, SAT and Sudoku. Attendees will receive adoption materials and access to an adopters' forum. NSF is funding the development, evaluation, dissemination and adoption of the curriculum. Potential adopters are encouraged to apply for funding to attend this workshop and SIGCSE 2014 at http://www.rowan.edu/~lobo/AlgosCurriculum. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1140753. Laptop optional.
