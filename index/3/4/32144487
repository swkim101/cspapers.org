A family of neuromorphic networks specifically designed for communications and optical signal processing applications is presented. The information is encoded utilizing sparse Optical Orthogonal Code sequences on the basis of unipolar, binary (0,1) signals. The generalized synaptic connectivity matrix is also unipolar, and clipped to binary (0,1) values. In addition to high-capacity associative memory, the resulting neural networks can be used to implement general functions, such as code filtering, code mapping, code joining, code shifting and code projecting.
