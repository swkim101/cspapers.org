Direct and indirect design techniques are discussed using a model with hierarchical abstraction strata. EPOS is defined as an indirect technique to support the specification, design, operation and maintenance of both hardware and software systems, to provide description means for real-time properties, to be implemented on a mini-computer and to be oriented to process engineers as users. The main parts of EPOS, its basic description model and its application are explained.
