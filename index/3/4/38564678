The COMMEND (Computer-Aided Mechanical Engineering Design) System is being developed in the Advanced Technology Department at the IBM Development Laboratory in Rochester, Minnesota. This design system is intended for internal use and is not available to other persons or companies at this time. The COMMEND System is a problem-oriened system as opposed to systems for “customized” design or product-oriented design. It works equally well whether one is designing a card punch, a printer, a document transport, or any such machine.
 The primary objective of COMMEND is to enable our mechanical design engineers to augment their capabilities with high speed computation and the large memory capacities of the present day digital computers. This union of engineers and computer into an effective design team is not a natural one. Both the engineer and the conventional mode of computer operation has to change. The engineer must take a more analytical design approach instead of the graphical and experimental approaches he presently uses on some design problems. The mode of computer operation must be such that the engineer can have rapid access to the computer when the need arises. Long “turn around” time from the submission of a design problem to the receipt of results nullifies the advantage of high speed computation and may extend design time rather than shorten it.
