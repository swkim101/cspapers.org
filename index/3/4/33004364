A tactile sensor with both very high resolution and high compliance is presented. The sensor utilizes the properties of optical reflection and mechanical compliance of clear rubber, and has a compact structure. A gripper with two tactile sensors linked to a tactile image processing system has been designed. It can be used to acquire binary tactile image sequences. The contact shape recovery and the gripping force estimate, based on the image sequences, are also discussed.
