MAGIK demonstrates how to use meta-information about the completeness of a database to assess the quality of the answers returned by a query. The system holds so-called table-completeness (TC) statements, by which one can express that a table is partially complete, that is, it contains all facts about some aspect of the domain. Given a query, MAGIK determines from such meta-information whether the database contains sufficient data for the query answer to be complete. If, according to the TC statements, the database content is not sufficient for a complete answer, MAGIK explains which further TC statements are needed to guarantee completeness. MAGIK extends and complements theoretical work on modeling and reasoning about data completeness by providing the first implementation of a reasoner. The reasoner operates by translating completeness reasoning tasks into logic programs, which are executed by an answer set engine.
