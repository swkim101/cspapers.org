Engaging in exertion activities ‐ these are activities that require intense physical effort from users ‐ is beneficial for physical health. Unfortunately, many exertion activities are often considered not very engaging, and turning them into a game ‐ by means of gamification - has been suggested as an approach to make them more compelling. We discuss design strategies particularly suitable for exertion activities that can facilitate this process and highlight the role of technology based on our experience of designing exertion games. By identifying such strategies, we believe better exertion games can be designed that ultimately results in people profiting more from the associated benefits of exertion.
