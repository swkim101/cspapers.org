Concurrent transfer is a feasible solution to enhance the efficiency and reliability of data transmission. In this paper, we propose a new transmission control scheme, the concurrent multi-path transmission control scheme (CMTCS). Our CMTCS effectively minimizes the impact of packet reordering at the receiver under concurrent transfers. Experimental results show that with our proposed scheme, we reduce packet reordering delays under varying drop and delay conditions caused by the underlying network.
