The Internet recently passed an historic inflection point, with the number of broadband mobile devices surpassing the number of wired PCs and servers connected to the Internet. Mobility now profoundly affects the architecture, services and applications in both the wireless and wired domains. In this "bottom up" talk, we begin by discussing several specific mobility-related challenges and recent results in areas including mobility measurement (including privacy considerations) and modeling, and context-sensitive services. We then take a broader look at current and future challenges, and conclude by discussing several NSF investments in programs and projects in area of mobile networking.
