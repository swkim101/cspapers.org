In this paper, the robot force control scheme is suggested for open robot controller, which combines the force control and collision avoidance algorithms. The adaptive fuzzy control approach is selected to realize force tracking when the environment parameters are unknown and vary considerably. We design the RobForce class derived from the open robot class with C++ language. In this robot force class, we cite the virtual force approach and transform collision avoidance into the force control problem and unite it with the force control in the RobForce class. Based on the robot class library, the user can develop his/hers own robot force control system. In addition we design a software to verify the scheme and the simulation demonstrates that the robot force control scheme is simple, universal for position based robot, and is capable of force tracking regardless of wide parameter variations.
