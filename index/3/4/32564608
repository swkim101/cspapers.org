TALE-SPIN, the last major AI attempt at story generation, approached the problem of making up atoriea primarily from the perspective of an impartial world simulator. AUTHOR is a program (under development) which generates atoriea as a creative reasoner in pursuit of her own narrative goals. It is thus intended to simulate an author's mind as ahe makes up a story, rather than the world as things happen in it. The four major forces driving the story generation process, according to the AUTHOR model, are (1) author intentionality, (2) conceptual reformulation, (3) reminding, and (4) the opportunity enhancement metagoal.
