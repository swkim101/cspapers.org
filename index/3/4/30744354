Modern software-intensive systems are developed in a world where only constant thing is change. This results in continuously changing requirements. Failure to manage these changing requirements properly may result in failure of system. To manage these requirements, many requirements change management (RCM) process model has been proposed in the literature. Process models facilitate human understating and communication, support process improvement and process management. Coverage of process elements like activities, artifacts and roles has an affect on process model and its usage. This paper reports the current requirements change management process models in the literature on the basis of activities, artifacts and roles. Our survey highlights that there is lack of consensus on RCM process and it has not been described in sufficient detail for use of requirements engineers in the real world.
