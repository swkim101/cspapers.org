The downward migration of computer science courses from university to secondary and even junior high school level is accelerated by the increasing computer usage in schools and the increasing demands of both parents and students for quality computer education. Teacher training is a major vehicle to the success of this migration. However, at this time, there is no consensus concerning how the secondary school computer science teacher should be certified and what should be included in the study of a computer science teacher certification program. This paper collects data from various computer expert groups through the use of Delphi technique to provide valuable guidelines for establishing a computer science teacher certification program as well as a model curriculum based on the minimum competency required of a successful secondary school computer science teacher.
