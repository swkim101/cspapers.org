This paper describes ofxEpilog which enable people to control a laser cutter of Epilog in real time. ofxEpilog is an add on of open Frameworks, an open source C++ toolkit for creative coding. With the add on, people could directly send their image object to a laser cutter through Ethernet. By alternating the generation and transmission of the command of cutting, the add on could sequentially control a laser cutter in real time. This paper introduces our initial trials of ofxEpilog with a real time operation (A), dynamic focus (z-axis) control with a given 3D object (B), and a scanned 3D object (C). Technical limitations and our upcoming challenges are also discussed.
