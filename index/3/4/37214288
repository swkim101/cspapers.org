Members of the Merit staff first met Robert Parnes in the fall of 1975 and began participating in his experimental CONFERence shortly thereafter. It soon became evident that CONFER could help us provide consultation to our users, who were distributed over a large part of southeastern Michigan, and in January of 1976 Merit started what we believe to be the first CONFERence open to the general public, MNET: CAUCUS.Five years later CAUCUS is still alive and well, and we still use it to provide help to a widely-dispersed user community--in fact, with the advent of Telenet service later that same year, and with Telenet's subsequent expansion of service to Canadian and overseas networks, our users are spread all over the world. But we have learned over the years that computer conferencing is good for much more than simply facilitating the user-consultant relationship. As we gained experience with CONFER we found that it gave us a solution to problems that were so basic we had simply taken them as part of the environment. CONFER also provided a medium for communication among consultants--the Merit staff--and among users.
