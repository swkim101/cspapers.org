Testing configurable systems is important and challenging due to the enormous space of configurations where errors can hide. Existing approaches to test these systems are often costly or unreliable. This paper proposes S-SPLat, a technique that combines heuristic sampling with symbolic search to obtain both breadth and depth in the exploration of the configuration space. S-SPLat builds on SPLat, our previously developed technique, that explores all reachable configurations from tests. In contrast to its predecessor, S-SPLat sacrifices soundness in favor of efficiency. We evaluated our technique on eight software product lines of various sizes and on a large configurable system â€“ GCC. Considering the results for GCC, S-SPLat was able to reproduce all five bugs that we previously found in a previous study with SPLat but much faster and it was able to find two new bugs in a recent release of GCC. Results suggest that it is preferable to use a combination of simple heuristics to drive the symbolic search as opposed to a single heuristic. S-SPLat and our experimental infrastructure are publicly available.
