The concepts of inspection are presented, organized around the three Ms of inspection (Management, Mechanics and Metrics). Fundamentally, inspection provides a way of observing and quantifying software processes while improving software quality. It can be used as a statistical quality control technique for software production. The tutorial addresses variations in inspection processes and techniques, and presents recent research results that investigate which variations are more effective than others. This is done with recognition of the need to adapt inspection approaches to fit local circumstances.
