This paper concerns the velocity field control in operational space of robot manipulators. Velocity field control is a recent control formulation in robotics. A velocity field defines the desired robot velocity in the operational space as a function of its current position, thus the robot performs the desired motions. In this paper, a controller is proposed for operational space velocity field control. The proposed controller is based on a hierarchical structure that result of using the kinematic control concept and a joint velocity controller. Experimental results on a two degrees-of-freedom direct-drive robot arm illustrate the viability of the proposed scheme.
