FAST (Fortran Analysis System) implements a powerful set of analysis capabilities on Fortran source language programs. Its implementation was accomplished through the integration of existing software systems and by the use of modern language system development tools. The result is an order of magnitude reduction in effort of implementation coupled with a sizable increase in system capabilities. The use of a general purpose, commercially available data management system as a data handler and data correlator was a dominant factor in both reduction in effort of implementation and generation of additional power and flexibility in the analysis capabilities offered by FAST. FAST implements a capability for systematically qualified program analyses which is unique among existing program analyzers. This capability should be particularly useful in the program maintenance environment.
