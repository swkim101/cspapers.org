The commonplace observation that agents—human and artificial alike—are subject to resource bounds makes salient the possibility that an agent might have the capability to control its own reasoning and decision making abilities, to tune itself so that it has a better chance of spending time thinking about the right things at the right times. The general study of metareasoning aims to understand this “reasoning about reasoning” in the context of an agent that needs to budget its time and resources in the optimal way, to achieve the best possible expected outcome.
