Materialized views defined over distributed data sources are a well recognized technology for modern applications. State-of the-art incremental view maintenance requires O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) or more maintenance queries to remote data sources with <i>n</i> being the number of data sources in the view definition. In this poster, we illustrate basic ideas of novel view maintenance strategies that dramatically reduce the number of maintenance queries. Such reduction brings the tradeoff between the number of maintenance queries and the complexity of each query. These algorithms have been implemented in a working prototype system. Experimental studies illustrate major performance improvement in terms of total processing time compared with existing batch algorithms.
