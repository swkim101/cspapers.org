Slightly modified major/minor loop bubble chips can accommodate storage and access for relational data base quite well. With the addition of dynamic indexing loops, very efficient data retrieval and manipulation can be accomplished. This paper specifies a set of relationally complete instructions. A variety of queries are executed to demonstrate the versatility of the instructions as well as understand the nature of our hardware and software operations. 
 
Since the bubble hardware is intrinsically similar to the data model, and adapted to the access requirements. we believe the overall system is simpler both in operation and in programming. The present work is also examined in the persepctive of data base trends, bubble technology development, and other hardware approaches to data base (viz. logic per track associative processing).
