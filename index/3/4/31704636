This paper reviews the entire PSI program synthesis system, summarizing progress made during the past two years. PSI synthesizes efficient programs from several types of abstract specifications. The paper presents a brief summary of PSI, an example dialogue demonstrating its performance, and a discussion of Its present capabilities. Explanation of the detailed operation of the system is omitted in this short paper. For an overview of prior work, see [Green-76]; for more details see [Ginsparg-78], [Steinberg-79], [Barstow-79], and [Kant-79] [Biermann-76] surveys related work in the automatic programming field.
