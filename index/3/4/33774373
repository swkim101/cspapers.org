The goal has been to construct a supervised artificial neural network that learns incrementally an unknown mapping. As a result a network consisting of a combination of ART2 and backpropagation is proposed and is called an "ART2/BP" network. The ART2 network is used to build and focus a supervised backpropagation network. The ART2/BP network has the advantage of being able to dynamically expand itself in response to input patterns containing new information. Simulation results show that the ART2/BP network outperforms a classical maximum likelihood method for the estimation of a discrete dynamic and nonlinear transfer function.
