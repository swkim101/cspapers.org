Considerable attention has been given to creating hypotheses which cover a set of instances. However, todate the related problem of generating a task to refine the hypothesis set has so far received very little attention. A task-generator has been implemented for a rule-based modelling system. LMS, Leeds Modelling System. Here we discuss how an analogous task-generator could be used with systems which do not constrain their hypothesis-space as strongly as LMS.
