Data access latency can be reduced for databases by using caching. Semantic caching enhances the performance of normal caching by locally answering the fully as well as partially overlapped queries. Efficient query processing and cache management are major challenges for semantic caching. Semantic caching demands efficient, correct and complete algorithms to process incoming queries. Query processing over semantic cache has been extensively studied by the researchers. In this paper, we have presented the survey of the existing techniques on query processing over semantic cache. We have defined a criterion to evaluate and analyze the query processing techniques. On the basis of defined criterion, analysis matrix is provided for quick insights on prominent features and limitations of query processing techniques. We have concluded that evaluated techniques are not capable of zero level query rejection and have large runtime complexity for handling queries. These deficiencies are the basic factors to decline the efficiency of query processing. The performance comparison of two techniques is also represented.
