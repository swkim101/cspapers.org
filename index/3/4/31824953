This paper addresses recent developments in terabit-level laser archival memory storage technology. The laser memory employs a 500 milliwatt 514.5 nanometer wavelength argon-ion optical laser source to melt permanent bit patterns into a rhodium-coated flexible plastic data storage strip. The same laser, operated at an order of magnitude less power output, is used to read the stored binary data. Information densities of 2.5 × 107 bits per square inch are achieved as limited by tracking and beam spot size. Because each data record is permanent, truly archival storage (∼25 years) is only limited by dust build-up. Extensive error correction codes enable performance at the 10-10 bit error rate level. The system is supported by extensive software that provides call-by-name file access. Operating at peak data rates of 5 megabits/second, the system behaves as an on-line direct-access file, with an on-line capacity equivalent to several thousand 1600 BP1 2400-foot rolls of magnetic tape. Worst case access time to any record is of the order of seconds. Average user-data transfer rates can be as high as 2.86 megabits per second with full data redundancy.
