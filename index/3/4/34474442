We have developed the diagnostic system, consisting of highly automated test generator, fast fault simulator and automatic fault locator. Several techniques, employed in the system, are as follows: 9-value D-Algorithm for sequential circuits., 6-value concurrent fault simulator., Functional Modeling of RAM'S, ROM'S, counters, and etc., Iterative processing of generator and simulator. This system has contributed to testing cards, and LSI'S used in Hitachi computer M-200H and others.
