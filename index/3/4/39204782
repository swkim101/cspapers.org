This document specifies Mobile IPv6, a protocol which allows nodes to
remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet. Each mobile
node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its
current point of attachment to the Internet. While situated away from
its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address,
which provides information about the mobile node's current
location. IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address
are transparently routed to its care-of address. The protocol enables
IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address
with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for
the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address. To support
this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new
destination option. All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can
communicate with mobile nodes. This document obsoletes RFC 3775.
