The introductory course in computer science usually covers a mixture of topics. It generally includes an introduction to algorithms and problem solving, use of a particular programming language, basic concepts about computer systems, and use of the local computer system. This paper describes an organization of the introductory course, suitable for an interactive environment, which locates the control language coverage, which is dependent on the local computer system, in a separate course.
 The separation has two major advantages. It eases the transition for students entering with some previous course work or experience using a different computer system. And it enables the control language to be covered in enough detail so that students can become proficient in the basic commands even under the time pressures of a quarter system.
