Every December, Code.org provides a set of Hour of Code exercises as part of CS Education week. However, motorically challenged students may be unable to participate because they cannot use the mouse and/or keyboard to interact with the Blockly-based Graphical User Interface and drag-and-drop programming environment. Programming by Voice (PBV) allows users to interact with block-oriented programming environments by speaking their program, rather than using a keyboard and mouse. The Myna tool, a PBV tool that was originally designed for the Scratch programming language, has been modified to work with the Code.org programming environment. Children with a mobility disability can use this tool to experience Code.org's educational opportunities.
