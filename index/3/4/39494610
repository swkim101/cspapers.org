Since the elderly population is increasing all over the world, health care market keeps growing and there is a need for monitoring of health issues. Body Area Network consists of wireless sensors attached on or inside human body for monitoring vital Health related problems, i.e, Electro Cardiogram (ECG), ElectroEncephalogram (EEG), Electronystagmogram(ENG) etc. Data is recorded by each sensor and sent toward coordinator through other sensors meaning multiple hop sensors WBAN system. The multiple hop system is being researched in many fields of wireless system, i.e, ad hod, mobile, ITS and so on. However, in these systems, the relay node just services as forwarding the data even in the multiple sources to multiple receivers system. Whereas, in wireless body area network (WBAN) system, almost the sensors forward the vital data of the other sensors while recording and sending the data of itself to the neighbor one. Therefore, due to the number of packets that is generated at all sensors, the probability of successful transmission and the packet loss are changed. It means that the vital data is lost and the transmit power is wasted. Main aim of this paper is to analyze the successful transmission probability and to optimize the packet rate of all sensors to obtain the highest efficiency in utilization.
