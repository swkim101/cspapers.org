Every June, over fifty Computer Scientists meet to grade Advanced Placement Examinations in Computer Science. The techniques used to read over fifty thousand questions consistently and fairly by multiple readers have proven successful. Readers have informally discussed how the techniques at the examination reading can be used in the context of grading course examinations at their home institutions. Adapting the techniques from the reading seems to allow faster, fairer, and more consistent marking of student papers. This panel will focus on how the examination reading techniques can be adapted for use in universities and schools. This discussion will be from the perspective of how grading algorithms are designed, how they are refined, how they are validated, and how they are applied.
