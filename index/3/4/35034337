The fourth ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD) is held in Dallas, Texas, USA on October 30, 2017, co-located with the 24th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The main objective of the workshop is to discuss novel randomization, diversification, and dynamism techniques for computer systems and networks, new metric and analysis frameworks to assess and quantify the effectiveness of MTD, and discuss challenges and opportunities that such defenses provide. We have constructed an exciting and diverse program of nine refereed papers and two invited keynote talks that will provide the participant with a vibrant and thought-provoking set of ideas and insights.
