This paper presents, PID and Fuzzy-PID (FPID) controller to control frequency of Permanent Magnet Tubular Linear Direct Current Motor (PMTLDCM). In the study firstly, a PMTLDCM's velocity is released by motor frequency can be controlled using PID and FPID controller. There are 27 fuzzy rules for FPID of each parameter of PID controller. FPID controller has two inputs as error and change of error and has output signal. After all, the control program is loaded to LPC1768FBD100 ARM microcontroller, the rotor frequency regulation system PID controller and FPID controller is applied and experimental results have been transferred to PC by MATLAB. Consequently, PID and FPID control based simulation and experimental results examine and the simulation demonstrate that the FPID controller has a better behavior of the PMTLDCM motor, an excellent frequency tracking with minimum overshoot and minimum steady state error and give better performance compared to conventional PID controller.
