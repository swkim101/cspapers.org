This demo presents an extension of a declarative language for specifying data-intensive Web applications. We demonstrate a scenario extracted from a real-life application, the Web portal of a computer manufacturer, including interactions with third-party service providers and enabling distributors to participate in well-defined business processes. The crucial advantage of our framework is the high-level modeling of a complex Web application, extended with Web service and workflow capabilities. The application is automatically verified for correctness and the code is automatically generated and deployed.
