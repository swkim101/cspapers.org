As a great many of new devices with diverse capabilities are making a population boom on the Internet mobile clients, their limited display sizes become a serious obstacle to information accessing. In this paper, we introduce a Document REpresentation for Scalable Structure (DRESS) to help information providers to make composite documents, typically Web pages, scalable in both logic and layout structure to support effective information acquisition in heterogeneous environments. Through this novel document representation structure based on binary slicing trees, the document can dynamically adapt its presentation according to display sizes by maximizing the information throughput to users. We discuss the details of this structure with its key attributes. A branch-and-bound algorithm and a capacity ratio based slicing method are proposed to select proper content representation and aesthetic document layouts respectively. Experiments show satisfactory results with high efficiency.
