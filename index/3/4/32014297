This paper describes an environment for coupling industrial simulation codes across the grid. Our environment is built on top of the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) [5] from the OMG (Object Management Group). It aims at simplifying the collaboration of distributed teams working on multi-physics problems through the extensive use of visual tools. It also addresses some of the confidentiality problems raised by the interconnection of computing resources via the Internet.
