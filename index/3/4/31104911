We describe a learning paradigm designed to improve the performance of a robot in a partially unpredictable environment. The paradigm was suggested by phenomena observed in animal behavior and it models aspects of that behavior. (See FI for details.) An implementation as a working program is under way, intended for incorporation in the now operational JPL robot. Rieger's CSA system is the implementation language and includes a plan synthesizer (RI). A brief overview of the robot's existing system organization is given in Thompson's paper on robot navigation in these proceedings (TI).
