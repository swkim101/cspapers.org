This paper investigates the robust control of an underactuated brachiating robot. Inspired by the pendulumlike movements in gibbons' arboreal locomotion, the controllers are designed to synchronize the brachiator with a virtual oscillator. Two schemes are proposed: a model-dependent feedback linearization scheme and a sliding-mode scheme that is independent of the system model. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed schemes are robust to the arbitrary initial configurations of the brachiator and the limitation in the motor torque at the elbow joint. Furthermore, both controllers enable the underactuated robot to brachiate along a structural member with an upward slope.
