CDLI is a formal language for describing hardware and software computing systems in various stages of design. As a formal language to talk about systems of this kind, CDLI provides a linguistic basis to consider machine aided solutions to a variety of design problems. In the context of CDLI, we are envisioning at present systems for design documentation, data retrieval, editing, design analysis, simulation and eventually automatic synthesis. The creation of a powerful and flexible descriptive data base is the key conceptual and technical problem that we must solve to implement these systems. The features introduced in the description language, CDLI, and the kinds of processors that are being developed for the documentation system are intended as solutions for this problem. The system so created will give us a point of departure for further explorations in this area through experimentation.
 CDLI is a complex language. The appropriateness and the quality of our proposed solutions can receive a definitive assessment only after they are built and used in conjunction with various systems for computer design. Construction and experimentation are therefore crucial parts of our research in this area. Presently, we are in the process of implementing a Design Documentation System based on the description language CDLI.
