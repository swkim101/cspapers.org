The growth of the Web and other Big Data sources lead to important performance problems for large-scale and distributed information retrieval systems. The scalability and efficiency of such information retrieval systems have an impact on their effectiveness, eventually affecting the experience of their users and monetization as well. The LSDS-IR'15 workshop will provide space for researchers to discuss the existing performance problems in the context of large-scale and distributed information retrieval systems and define new research directions in the modern Big Data era. The workshop expects to bring together information retrieval practitioners from the industry, as well as academic researchers concerned with any aspect of large-scale and distributed information retrieval systems.
