Electronic Commerce (eCommeree) is conceived as one of the major channels for performing commerce on a global scale, and the area is rapidly evolving. Electronic commerce is based on electronic transfer of data as a main vehicle of "doing business," while the usage of conventional methods (paper, telephone, etc.) is dramatically reduced in such an environment. In particular, electronic exchange of data becomes the most cost-effective channel of performing low-cost transactions. Enabling the transfer of data, in and by itself, is hardly sufficient to support efficient and correct processing of transaction in an eCommeree environment. Especially in B2B, enterprises have evolved independently, creating different data ontologies, and thus giving rise to semantic heterogeneity. This problem, which has been investigated for a few decades now, have received a new vigour in a computerized environment that is constantly changing. This tutorial is aimed a t introducing the data integration problem in eCommerce and to discuss three types of solutions to it, namely the good, the bad, and the ugly. We start by reviewing the problem of data integration for distributed heterogeneous information sources. Next, we identify the bad and the ug].y that is currently used in eCommerce. Finally, we identify the good, or rather, discuss the research role in this field. Proceeding in a reverse order, we classify the use of glue code to connect ECommerce tools with enterprise databases (e.g., EDI-aware COTS) to be the ugly. The bad category includes half-baked, communicationbased solutions (e.g., EDI and XML), deployed indiscriminately across the enterprise. Finally, we define the good to be well-integrated data management sys-
