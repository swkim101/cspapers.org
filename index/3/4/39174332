This paper reports on one such effort. The senior author was invited by the First Ministry of Machine Building to review a Computer Science program which had been established along the lines of the IEEE Model Curriculum [4]. The work of the two other authors and their colleagues forms the bulk of the reminder of the presentation. This discussion of a particular program presents one of the ways in which the PRC is “catching up”. A more complete review is provided in another document [5].
