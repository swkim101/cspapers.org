Cross-talk mitigation in WDM-PON using re-modulation approach is presented in this paper. Utilizing optical NOT and OR subsystems, the proposed method has been able to significantly improve system performance in term of bit error rate (BER). Moreover, the proposed method could be used for both two-level and multi-level line codes.
