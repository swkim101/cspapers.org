This paper presents a project that investigates to what extent computational linguistic methods and tools used at GETA for machine translation can be used to implement novel functionalities in intelligent computer assisted language learning. Our intelligent tutoring system project is still in its early phases. The learner module is based on an empirical study of French as used by Acadian elementary students living in New-Brunswick, Canada. Additionally, we are studying the state of the art of systems using Artificial Intelligence techniques as well as NLP resources and/or methodologies for teaching language, especially for bilingual and minority groups.
