This paper presents a supervised bayesian approach to model expertise in online forums with application to question routing. The proposed method extends the well-known sLDA model to the multi-task case, accounting for a supervised stage with multiple outputs per document corresponding to the users of the system. A study of the characteristics of real world data revealed a number of challenges in the practical application of this model, relevant to the research community.
