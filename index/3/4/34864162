Restructuring of arithmetic expressions in which the allowable operations are addition and multiplication is considered. It is shown that any such expression of size n can be restructured into an equivalent expression of depth 2 log n. For expressions with the additional constraint that at least one operand of every multiplication is a constant, the corresponding depth bound is log n + 2/log n + 0(i) . For the class of polynomials a lower bound of log n+/2 log n o(/~-g n),which essentially matches the known upper bound, is established.
