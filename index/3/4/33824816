The next generation of services will not be restricted to the boundaries of a given network. This is called convergence! Land-line telephony, wireless telephony, instant messaging, Web, etc. now form a converged network where applications can be deployed. An example of such an application is the Selective Reach Me (SRM) which makes it possible for me (resp. other people) to reach people (resp. me) wherever they are (resp. I am). On the caller side, instead of calling a specific device, I call a person and I let the application figure out the best way to contact her. On the callee side, I want to specify who can contact me, on which device, when and for what purpose, etc.
