We introduce certain conventions and notations that will be used throughout this paper. For any graph G = (V, E) and any subset C ⊆ E of edges, let G\C denote the graph G = (V, E − C). (u → v)G denotes that there is a path from the vertex u to the vertex v in the graph G; ¬(u → v)G denotes that there is no such path. Let α(G, C) = {(u,v) | (u → v)G and ¬(u → v)G\C }. dG(u, v) represents the shortest path distance between u and v in G; we will drop the subscript when the graph G being referred to is clear. All graphs that we deal with are directed with unit edge costs unless otherwise specified. The main result of this paper is the following theorem:
