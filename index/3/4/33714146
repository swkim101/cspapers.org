This presentation will discuss the emerging cluster challenge, the growing imbalance between computational and disk drive performance. This presentation will present data showing the growing imbalance and its true impact to application performance; plus what is needed to bridge this growing gap enabling low cost, easy to use high-performance compute clusters, and the role high-performance storage plays.The presentation will look ahead to models allowing aggregation of very large storage pools to optimize reliability, cost, and bandwidth. The presentation will cover innovations to lower latencies and deliver higher bandwidths to maximize computational capabilities of cluster applications; the need for aggregate storage to provide bandwidths that enable filesystem performance in excess of 1TB/second; the innovation required to scale and manage huge LUNs with multiple simultaneous access points enabling large, high-performance name space with efficient metadata; the role RDMA plays to reduce copies and perform direct transfers from system memory to RAID cache. The presentation will conclude with implementation examples and data.
