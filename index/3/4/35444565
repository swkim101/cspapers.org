Ontology matching enables applications, such as automated data transformation or query rewriting. As it requires domain knowledge, it needs to be carried out by expert users, whose time is scarce and, therefore, should be used efficiently. To this end, the RepMine system presented in this paper does not treat ontology matching as a task of its own, but integrates it into a semi-automated query translation process. By that, users perform a task with immediate benefit for them and simultaneously contribute to alignments between ontologies. Furthermore, the overall task of matching two ontologies is split on a per-query basis and, thus, can be performed incrementally by all system users
