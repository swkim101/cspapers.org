The talk extends the Laws of Programming [1] by four laws governing concurrent composition of programs. This operator is associative and commutative and distributive through union; and it has the same unit (do nothing) as sequential composition. Furthermore, sequential and concurrent composition distribute through each other, in accordance with an exchange law; this permits an implementation of concurrency by partial interleaving.
