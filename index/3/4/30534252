The linear approximation relating mean time between page transfers between levels of memory, as reported by Saltzer for Multics, is examined. It is tentatively concluded that this approximation is untenable for main memory, especially under working set policies; and that the linearity of the data for the drum reflects the behavior of the Multics scheduler for background jobs, not the behavior of programs.
