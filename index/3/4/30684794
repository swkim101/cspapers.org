This paper deals with the software architecture of a rescue robot, named FDNet. This architecture provides the rescue robot with intelligence and flexibility. When this architecture is used, the robot system is described using networks. These networks are composed by data and processing units. The data, referred to as "data", is a distributed component. The processing units, referred to as "relation", are a distributed and parallel-processing component, which can refer to any existing Data. We consider nodes that can formally connect to any other node, and relations that can be organized according to human's or any other network's pattern. This architecture was called FDNet (flat-distributed networks for rescue robots). We describe proposition of the architecture and its implementation for a robot. Then, we report some experimental results. We provide this architecture for any intelligent rescue system.
