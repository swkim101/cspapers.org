In this paper we propose an algorithm based upon Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm called Distributed LSB. This algorithm has better performance both in capacity and the amount of degradation which takes place in the cover image during secret data hiding. The embedding method is distributed amongst pixel based upon their intensity levels and not sequential as in case of the conventional LSB algorithm. Both algorithms are tested on various intensity images and results are presented in the form of absolute entropy curves. Obtain results show that Distributed LSB has better hiding capacity than conventional LSB technique.
