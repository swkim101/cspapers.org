The Computer Science programs and environment at the University of Western Ontario are described. The courses have recently been revised in the light of Curriculum '78. We compare the new offerings with Curriculum '78, discussing especially the mathematics requirements and courses we have introduced, and showing how a variety of three- and four-year programs is organized coherently. The Department has also moved to virtually total interactive, time-sharing computer environment, even in introductory mass-enrollment courses. We discuss the impact of this, and of the increasing enrollments, on the education we offer and on our academic standards.
