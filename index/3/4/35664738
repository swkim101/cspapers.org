Most of the existing computer science and data-processing programs are either vocationally-oriented aiming at entry-level positions, or theoretical programs with no direct career orientation. By contrast, this program aims at a synthesis of theoretical, “design-strategy” and practical approaches. By design strategy approach we mean emphasizing a particular type of system, i.e. real-time data-base management or a particular application, i.e. payroll, registration and how that will affect the design constraints from analysis to implementation.
