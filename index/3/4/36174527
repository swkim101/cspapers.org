The stereo correspondence problem is still a highly active topic of research with many applications in the robotic domain. Still many state of the art algorithms proposed to date are unable to reasonably handle high resolution images due to their run time complexities or memory requirements. In this work we propose a novel stereo correspondence estimation algorithm that employs binary locality sensitive hashing and is well suited to implementation on the GPU. Our proposed method is capable of processing very high-resolution stereo images at near real-time rates. An evaluation on the new Middlebury and Disney high-resolution stereo benchmarks demonstrates that our proposed method performs well compared to existing state of the art algorithms.
