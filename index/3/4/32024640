Most colleges and universities teach at least two introductory computer science courses. They offer some variant of CS1 for their majors and one or more service courses for the rest of the college community. In this paper we will be discussing the nature of these service courses for non-majors: how they are currently being taught and why we feel they are in need of revision. We conclude with a proposal for a new service course that we feel represents a significant improvement over what is currently being offered.
