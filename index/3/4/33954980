This paper presents a novel passive robot system with 6 DOF force/torque sensor for measuring spacesuit joint damping parameters. Based on its special mechanical structure, a 3 DOF model of flexible IVA (intra vehicular activity) spacesuit joint has been built. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the measuring principle. Potential application of the measuring system is discussed.
