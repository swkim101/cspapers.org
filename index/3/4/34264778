The advent of the microcomputer has caused a profound change in our thinking about the teaching of programming. Up to now we have been assuming that a computer is necessarily expensive and must be shared by all students. With the appearance of time-sharing systems, many universities, including The George Washington University, purchased large numbers of terminals for student use; but students were still using a single large or mid-size computer, albeit through several terminals. It is now possible, however, to purchase an entire computer for the price of a terminal. Such a computer is necessarily limited in scope; but it can serve admirably for the teaching of programming at an elementary level, as well as handling certain more advanced tasks. About a year and a half ago, the Computer Committee of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, of which I was the chairman, made a decision to purchase sixteen microcomputer systems for student use, primarily for the teaching of BASIC, and secondarily for assembly language and PASCAL.
