A 80 Ã— 78 pixel general purpose vision chip for spatial focal plane processing is presented. The size and configuration of the processing receptive field are programmable. The chip's architecture allows the photoreceptor cells to be small and densely packed by performing all computation on the read-out, away from the array. In addition to the raw intensity image, the chip outputs four processed images in parallel. Also presented is an application of the chip to line segment orientation detection, as found in the retinal receptive fields of toads.
