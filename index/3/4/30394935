In this paper we propose QoS based distributed multipath routing algorithm for IPv6 (QoS-MPR). The algorithm is able to work alongside traditional routing algorithms and it can construct label switched paths in order to provide rigorous QoS guarantees. QoS-MPR is developed to work with differentiated services architecture and its capability to establish label switched paths allows us to inject more QoS sensitive traffic into the network hence, network utilization increases as shown in the simulation results. Our simulation results show that QoS-MPR provides splendid packet delivery ratio, it utilizes resources present on multiple paths to the destination, network utilization increases as a function of number of paths exits to a network, QoS flows established using QoSMPR experience less delay and each admitted flow shows compliance with its service level agreement (SLA).
