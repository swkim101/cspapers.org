As optimizing compilers become more sophisticated, the problem of debugging the source code of an application becomes more difficult. In order to investigate this problem, we implemented DOC, a prototype solution for Debugging Optimized Code. DOC is a modification of the existing C compiler and source-level symbolic debugger for the HP9000 Series 800. This paper describes our experiences in this effort. We show in an actual implementation that source-level debugging of globally optimized code is viable.
