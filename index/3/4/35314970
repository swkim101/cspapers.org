Several hundred Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are available for students of Computer Science (CS) across the Internet. Yet, it has been observed that students exhibit a short attention span while watching MOOC videos. At the same time, as a viewer, they are likely to watch much longer movies and even educational films. In this poster, we propose that production of MOOCs needs to borrow certain affective features from more professionally produced educational films. To support this argument, we first present the results of a limited survey indicating an affective preference of users towards educational films over video lectures from MOOCs. Taking a cue from films in general, we present an analysis of certain affective audio-visual features of educational films vis-Ã -vis MOOC videos. These features include visual features related to the variety of color, number of scenes and movement, and audio features related to liveliness of speech. We then use these features to classify two groups of educational videos, and conclude that MOOC-like videos often tend to lack such affective audio-visual features. We also indicate possible directions of research in educational videos based on our initial findings.
