Examples are often used along with textual descriptions to help convey particular ideas - especially in instructional or explanatory contexts. These accompanying examples reflect information in the surrounding text, and in turn, also influence the text. Sometimes, examples replace possible (textual) elaborations in the description. It is thus clear that if object descriptions are to be generated, the system must incorporate strategies to handle examples. In this work, we shall investigate some of these issues in the generation of object descriptions.
