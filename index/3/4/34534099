Admittance control is a widely used approach for guaranteeing a compliant behavior of the robot in physical human-robot interaction. When an admittance-controlled robot is coupled with a human, the dynamics of the human can cause deviations from the desired behavior of the robot, mainly due to a stiffening of the human arm, and thus generate high-frequency unsafe oscillations of the robot. In this paper we present a novel methodology for detecting the rising oscillations in the human-robot interaction. Furthermore, we propose a passivity-preserving strategy to adapt the parameter of the admittance control in order to get rid of the high-frequency oscillations and, when possible, to restore the desired interaction model. A thorough experimental validation of the proposed strategy is performed on a group of 26 users performing a cooperative task.
