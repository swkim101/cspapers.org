Non-volatile memory and remote direct memory access (RDMA) provide extremely high performance in storage and network hardware. However, existing distributed file systems strictly isolate file system and network layers, and the heavy layered software designs leave high-speed hardware under-exploited.
 
 In this article, we propose an RDMA-enabled distributed persistent memory file system,
 
 Octopus
 +
 
 , to redesign file system internal mechanisms by closely coupling non-volatile memory and RDMA features. For data operations,
 
 Octopus
 +
 
 directly accesses a shared persistent memory pool to reduce memory copying overhead, and actively fetches and pushes data all in clients to rebalance the load between the server and network. For metadata operations,
 
 Octopus
 +
 
 introduces self-identified remote procedure calls for immediate notification between file systems and networking, and an efficient distributed transaction mechanism for consistency.
 
 Octopus
 +
 
 is enabled with replication feature to provide better availability. Evaluations on Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Modules show that
 
 Octopus
 +
 
 achieves nearly the raw bandwidth for large I/Os and orders of magnitude better performance than existing distributed file systems.
