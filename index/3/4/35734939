A recent focus in CS education has been at the K-12 level, developing CS and computational thinking skills. Oftentimes CS programs find it difficult to get into schools. At St. Scholastica a unique partnership exists between CS and Education. Together they sponsor workshops, write grants, conduct research and support a CSTA chapter. Activities have credibility with K-12 educators and involve subject matter experts. CS programs are able to reach their target audience, encouraging more teachers to include CS in their curriculum and to support their students in pursuing technical careers. Education programs have another way to partner with teachers and provide continuing education. The poster will share benefits for each program, collaborative activities, logistics and results.
