This paper describes an approach for developing a robot soccer framework for students. It provides the necessary framework for allowing undergraduate level students to use their programming skills for algorithm development and strategic planning. The robotic kit used is the LEGO Mindstorm, and we have developed the necessary image processing algorithms for the vision component of the framework. The system provides a very practical and fun way of exercising the programming skills and developing algorithms, which in turn can motivate students further to focus on solving real world problems.
