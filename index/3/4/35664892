The paper presents a novel control method for the arm exoskeletons that takes into account the muscular force manipulability of the human arm. In contrast to classical controllers that provide assistance without considering the biomechanical properties of the human arm, we propose a control method that takes into account the configuration of the arm and the direction of the motion to effectively compensate the anisotropic property of the muscular manipulability of the human arm. Consequently, the proposed control method effectively maintains a spherical endpoint manipulability in the entire workspace of the arm. As a result, the proposed method allows the human using the exoskeleton to efficiently perform tasks in arm configurations that are normally unsuitable due to the low manipulability. We evaluated the proposed approach by a preliminary experimental study where a subject wearing a 2 DOF arm-exoskeleton had to move a 4 kg weight between several locations. The results of our study demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively augments the ability of human motor control to perform tasks equally well in the whole arm workspace that include configurations with low intrinsic manipulability.
