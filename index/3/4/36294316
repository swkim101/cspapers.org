One very frustrating problem that students often have while working on computers is the lack of ability to do productive work. They often find themselves either not being able to do something or doing it in a very complex way when there is a simpler or shorter way to accomplish the task. This is a common experience because most students do not have a structured time of learning the operating system(s) on which they work. This often occurs because the use of an operating system is not considered an academic pursuit so that a course teaching the computer science majors how to use the operating system(s) is not offered. However, the benefits of such a course can be great. The students can find the rest of their work on computers much more productive than if they had to pick up almost everything on their own.
