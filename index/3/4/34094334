I am going to give some factual data about the well- researched year 1999, based on projections from current data. The figures: there are roughly 10, one quintillion bits of information in the world data base, split between the humans and the machines. Now when you talk about the implications of a quintillion bit you have to briefly mention size, cost, use, speed, the limits of quantum mechanics, the possibilities of industrial growth that make these figures possible.
