This paper describes a non-major introductory course in computer science, specifically for students at a liberal arts institution. College-wide writing and speaking requirements across the curriculum are supported through a variety of assignments. The computer science department has experienced many benefits as a result of offering this course, including improved performance by students in introduction to programming and greater enrollment numbers across departmental courses. Suggestions for improving future offerings of the class are also proposed in the paper.
