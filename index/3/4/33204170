With the increasing penetration of parallelism into computing, programmers of all stripes need to acquire competencies in con-current programming. This workshop will concentrate on discussing and disseminating resources for gently introducing parallelism into programmers' skill sets. It will provide a venue for the developers and vendors of programming languages to showcase their facilities and training materials. It will seek short "killer" parallel application examples that can be used in academic or training environments. Another focus will be on short modules that can be used in short courses for practicing programmers, or dropped into academic courses dealing with some aspect of programming. Finally, it will provide a forum for showcasing tools for visualizing and/or teaching parallelism in programming.
