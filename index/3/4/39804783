This paper introduces TimeSlider, a user interface technique that allows the user to specify time points. TimeSlider is a kind of slider whose time scale is nonlinear and which moves as a user operation. The nonlinearly enables it to display a long time range in a small space, and the movement as a user operation helps the user to specify time points quickly. An example application, in which TimeSlider enabled the user to restore past WWW pages, demonstrated the effectiveness of our technique.
