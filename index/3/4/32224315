Introduction This Special Session is a direct result of the summer working group at ITICSE 2002. At that meeting the Lego Robot Working group first outlined how the Robots can be used to teach CS1 using Java. The group also provided two extended examples. It was decided that a special session at SIGCSE 2003 designed to collect “best assignments” would simplify highlighting the benefit of using Robots to teach CS1. It was suggested that holding a session at SIGCSE where “best assignments” were submitted ahead of time and selected assignments were then presented to the group, would go a long way toward making these clever toys, so appropriate for teaching CS1, more readily available to other teachers of CS1. The assignments created in anticipation of the session would then be available on a CD to anyone who would be interested. Assignments would be collected prior to the meeting, selected assignment creators would then be asked to present their assignment ideas to the whole group. This will, of course, will require a call for assignments that must go out before the conference and some initial judging done by members of the group prior to SIGCSE 2003. The creator of the assignment judged to be best would then be awarded a LEGO MINDSTORMS: Robotics Invention System 2.0 that will be provided by Sun Microsystems. Prizes for other entry categories will also be sought.
