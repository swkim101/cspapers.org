In this paper, preliminary design has been developed to control a joint system for an autonomous humanoid robot. Motors controlling the various movements of the robot track prespecified joint trajectories by using new controller, called quasi-linear minimal order controller to achieve accurate trajectory tracking. The controller is minimal order and is able to produce desirable results. The key factor limiting the controller performance is the tradeoff between rate of convergence of tracking error. The system is feedback linearized and the resultant dynamics of the feedback linearized system correspond to a certain class of linear systems, which makes it attractive for the application of a simpler order feedback control designed on the basis of quasi-linear feedback theory. Under this design, the pole of the lead-lag compensator depends on the gain of open loop system. A simulink model is developed to model single joint in the body. The designed controller not only guarantees asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectories, but also ensures the safety. The simulation results show that the new strategy yields valid results.
