In this extended abstract , we construct algorithms tha t decide for a graph with n vertices whether there exists a 4-, 5or 6-colouring of the vertices running in t ime O(1.7504n), O(2.1592 n) and O(2.3289n), respectively, using polynomial space. For 6or 7-colouring we construct algorithms running in t ime (9(2.2680 n) and O(2.4023n), respectively, using exponential space. To do this, we prove tha t the number of maximal independent sets of size at most k (k-MIS's) in a graph is at most ( d 1)dk-nd n-(d-1)k for any d > 4. [Epp01b] shows the same bound for d = 4. Earlier results on graph colouring include: [Epp01b] uses the bound on the number of k-MIS's to give an algorithm finding the chromatic number of a graph in t ime O(2.4151n). For the easier problem of deciding 3-colourability there has been a handful of papers ending with [Epp01a] which describes an algorithm running in t ime O(1.3289n). There only exists a few references for 4-colouring. [Law76] solves this problem in t ime o(2n) . [Epp01a] solves (k, 2)-CSP, which has k-colouring as a special case, by a randomised algorithm yielding running times of O(1.8072 ~) and O(2.2590 n) for 4and 5-colouring, respectively. The algorithm for finding the chromatic number uses exponential space, whereas the other algorithms use only polynomial space.
