This paper discusses a set of tools supporting the rapid development of voice and telephony applications. The tools allow interfaces to be rapidly prototyped, tested and installed without impacting the underlying system. Used directly by behavioral specialists, they have played a key role in the building of two production systems. We review several essential features of this facility and then outline its role in the rapid development of a voice messaging system for the athletes and officials at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
