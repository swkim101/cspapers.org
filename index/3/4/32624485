Experience has demonstrated clearly the need for a functional data system for collecting, processing, managing, and distributing Earth science data, particularly satellite remote sensing data. The start of NASAâ€™s Earth Observing System (EOS) has created a new need for a comprehensive data system to handle the large amount of remotely sensed data anticipated from the EOS instruments, the related in situ observations, measurements from other satellites, and scientific data products. The estimated data volume at the end of the century exceeds 1 TB/day. The information system (EOSDIS) to store, manage, and provide access to these data is as critical to the success of the mission as the measurements from the satellites. EOSDIS has evolved through several stages, establishing a precedent for continued evolution of a system whose goal is to provide useful data and information to working Earth scientists.
