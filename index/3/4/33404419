Petascale computing is now a realizable goal that will impact all scientific and engineering applications. Reaching the full potential of petascale science demands that we tackle challenging problems of both hardware and software as we develop and deploy new computing systems and scale science and engineering applications to use them to their full advantage.Vendors, centers and labs that will tackle the deployment of emerging petascale systems, and researchers with applications that will need to reach the petascale are invited to discuss the technical challenges that surround building petascale systems, as well as the hurdles that will face the researchers who use them.
