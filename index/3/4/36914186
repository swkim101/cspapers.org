In the event of a vehicular accident, there are many scenarios in which the occupants become incapacitated and unable to call for assistance. Currently, there exist systems such as OnStar [1] that provides accident detection and roadside assistance services. However, the cost of these proprietary systems and their availability for all vehicular models limit their use. We propose an inexpensive and robust system that provides accurate accident detection and emergency responder notification as our senior capstone project at Texas Christian University. The proposed system contains three primary components: a smartphone, a single-on-board computer (the Raspberry Pi [2]), and Texas Instruments SensorTags [3] as shown in Figure 1.
