Many computer science educators are actively developing laboratory materials in support of their courses because the lab activities provide a rich learning environment. Some instructors are hesitant to pursue this type of pedagogy because of the time commitment required or because of a lack of materials to use as a starting point. This paper describes the development of a repository of computer science laboratories to encourage development and use of labs.The project described is an on-line repository, a database developed for the WEB using HTML forms to help tailor user requests for information. The backbone of the repository is currently CGI scripts written in PERL. The features of the prototype include lab submission, searching by keyword or topic, and an annotation capability for each lab.We also describe the plans for a SIGCSE sponsored peer reviewed on-line repository of lab materials which will create a recognized avenue for the dissemination of labs. The peer review process will help insure a level of quality, and grant developers recognition for their scholarly work in support of teaching.
