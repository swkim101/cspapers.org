"SKYWASH" is the name of a robot system washing the outer surface of aircraft. Aircraft have to be washed in regular cycles for appearance and surface corrosion reasons. With two "SKYWASH" systems in parallel operation a reduction of ground time per washing event by factor 3 for wide body aircraft and factor 2 for narrow body can be achieved. All programmes are generated off-line. The system was tested successfully during a six months period of intensive operation. No damage has happened to any aircraft during the whole period. An adequate ROI period can be achieved based on the experience made. The system is in operation at Lufthansa, Frankfurt Airport.<<ETX>>
