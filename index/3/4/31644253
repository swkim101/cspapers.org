Laboratory-based courses--the corner stone of Computer Science programs in our community college--have been difficult to manage due to the shortage of lab space, available equipment, and basic infrastructures. This has meant that for the past few years, we have not been able to offer certain courses that allow students administrative privileges in order to complete their assignments, such as Web Server Administration course. We wanted to be able to offer a number of courses requiring various systems, levels of functionality, and networking set up in one laboratory. We researched and experimented with different virtualized systems. Specifically, we looked at the use of VMs in CS courses and laboratories. Through use of virtualization technology we implemented multiple VMs (one for each course) on each computer in a laboratory. Each VM was set up for specific course requirement; hence, multiple courses were offered simultaneously in one laboratory. In designing the laboratory, we were also careful not to adversely affect the security of college's computer network. Therefore, the virtualized laboratory was separated from the college's computer network. This approach not only provided the capabilities that we were looking for, but can also be used in future to provide easier access to students, even from outside the school network.
