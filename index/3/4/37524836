Mechanical friction and more generally adhesion forces are some problems, which can severely limit the performances of micromechanical devices. One way to avoid friction problem, is to use levitation methods. Levitation in static magnetic field is very easy to achieve by the use of diamagnetic materials. Thus, it is possible to freely suspend a light magnet and let it in a stable equilibrium state. We have developed a prototype of a micro-nano force sensor using a passive levitation approach. This paper explains diamagnetic levitation in the simple case of a small cylindrical magnet with a mass and volume of 11 mg and 1.65 mm/sup 3/ respectively. The forces applied to the suspended magnet are presented and the natural stability of the diamagnetic levitation is explained. Finally, we present the design of our micro-nano force sensor using diamagnetic levitation.
