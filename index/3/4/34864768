Sponsored by the Department of Defense, Ada is a programming language that embodies and enforces many modern software methodologies. Thus, the introduction of the language gives the opportunity for improvements in software reliability, maintainability, and clarity. Ada also offers some unique educational challenges and opportunities, so this panel will focus on some of the requirements for industrial, graduate, and undergraduate Ada education. In particular, the panel will explore different teaching methodologies, and will share their experiences in teaching the language.
 Each panelist is actively involved in the Ada program, and has contributed to the development of an educational strategy for the Ada Joint Program Office.
