Inspired by natural earthworm locomotion behavior and segmental muscle motion mechanism, this paper presents our recently developed compliant modular earthwormlike robot with the novel segmental muscle-mimetic design unit that is capable of efficiently mimicking earthworms' segmental muscle contraction and extension functions. The new class of segmental muscle-mimetic design unit relies on the curvature of scissor mechanisms that can be extended and contracted smoothly through controlled servo motors. The paper starts reviewing natural earthworm locomotion behavior, details the bio-inspired concept and design of both the segmental muscle-mimetic unit and the multi-segment earthworm-like robot prototype, and then presents the robot's locomotion models and analysis of the locomotion efficiency of the robot. Simulation and experimental results validate that both the design and the prototyped multi-segment earthworm-like robot have the excellent performance such as its muscle-like contractions behavior, peristaltic locomotion behavior, and highly competitive moving speed.
