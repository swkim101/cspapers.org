V2 = E - (M): Increased Velocity results directly from subtracting rotating Mass of storage devices from your application's Energywww.ViON.com/HyperStor - application of advanced memory devices to dramatically enhance cluster systems response.Exchange milliseconds for microseconds (1,000 fold improvement) to gain depth, breadth or simply reduce your response time. Pinpoint application of ViON's new HyperStor memory devices to HPC infrastructure will result in performance improvements ranging from 100% to 1500%, depending on your system's architecture. By employing the latest technology against the "weakest link" in your architecture, you can realize any of the above referenced benefits, or in many cases, a mix of them all.
