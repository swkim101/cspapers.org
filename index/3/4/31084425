Moore’s law is not dead. This means, if you are designing computers, that the complexi of your competitor’s constant? % rice machine will go up by a factor of four every two and a alf years, and Itss eed will doub e. Whether the machine design con~ists of one chip, some custom E chips, or a co ectlon of merchant serruconductor-supphed devices, to sta m the game, you i? have to shoot for competitive speed and com lexity targets. Because o the growth In the \ complexity of what you need to s ecifi, when uildln a competitive com uter, the sizes of { i f design teams have tended to dou le every two and a alf years as well. n addition, as the industry matures, the need to design for testability, reliability, backward compatibihty, and standards are adding to the complexity of our designs.
