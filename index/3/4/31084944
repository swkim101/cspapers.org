This paper presents the implementation of the CU VOCAL Web service, one of the first Chinese text-to-speech synthesis Web services. The CU VOCAL Web service can be easily integrated with other Web services to develop innovative Web-mediated applications. We have developed a novel automatic voice alert system in the stocks domain by integrating CU VOCAL and several other Web services. This system can monitor a real-time financial information feed for alert conditions pre-specified in the userâ€™s personalized profile, and trigger synthesized spoken messages to alert the user via the (mobile) telephone.
