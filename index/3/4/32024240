A High-rate Spatial Modulation (HR-SM) scheme, whose maximum spectral efficiency is in proportional to the number of transmit antennas nT, was proposed in [1]. However, the complexity of its maximum likelihood detector grows exponentially with nT, making it impractical as nT increases. Based on the codeword structure of the HR-SM scheme and on the conventional successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) detectors, this paper proposes low-complexity suboptimal detectors for the HR-SM scheme. These detectors can feasibly be utilized in the HR-SM scheme with large number of transmit antennas and high-order QAM/PSK modulations. In addition, simulation results and complexity analysis are presented to verify performances and complexities of the proposed decoders.
