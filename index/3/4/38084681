The issues to be faced by those wishing to integrate design data from different Design Automation systems are what concepts to send and receive, and how to automatically recognize what has been sent without ambiguity. The goal is to achieve Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) of Electrical/Electronic Products. One of the major obstacles is communication barriers between various systems and applications. Fortunately, work is being done to overcome these barriers. The Working Group on Electronic Modeling has begun modeling the information content and structure needed for much of the design portion of the total Engineering/Manufacturing job. All who share this concern for the ability to integrate the engineering and manufacturing information needed for CIM are invited to participate in and avail themselves of the work being done by the WGEM.
