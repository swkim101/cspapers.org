We present a demonstration of an annotation tool designed to annotate texts into a semantic network formalism called Multi-Net. The tool is based on a Java Swing GUI and allows the annotators to edit nodes and relations in the network, as well as links between the nodes in the network and the nodes from the previous layer of annotation. The data processed by the tool in this presentation are from the English version of the Wall Street Journal.
