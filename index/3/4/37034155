For the past five years, the Flight Dynamics Division (FDD) at NASAâ€™s Goddard Space Flight Center has been carrying out a detailed domain analysis effort and is now beginning to implement Generalized Support Software (GSS) based on this analysis GSS is part of the larger Flight Dynamics Distributed System (FDDS), and is designed to run under the FDDS User Interface / Executive (UIX). The FDD is transitioning from a mainframe based environment to FDDS based systems running on engineering workstations The GSS will be a library of highly reusable components that may be conjigured within the standard FDDS architecture to quickly produce low-cost satellite ground support systems. The estimates for the first release is that this library will contain approximately 200,000 lines of code. The main driver for developing generalized software is development cost and schedule improvement. The goal is to ultimately have at least 80 percent of all software required for a spacecraft mission (within the domain supported by the GSS) to be configured from the generalized components.
