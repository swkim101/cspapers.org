Web search engines have brought IR to the masses. It now affects the lives of hundreds of millions of people, and growing, as Internet search companies launch ever more products based on techniques developed in IR research.The real world poses unique challenges for search algorithms. They operate at unprecedented scales, and over a wide diversity of information. In addition, we have entered an unprecedented world of "Adversarial Information Retrieval". The lure of billions of dollars of commerce, guided by search engines, motivates all kinds of people to try all kinds of tricks to get their sites to the top of the search results.What techniques do people use to defeat IR algorithms? What are the evaluation challenges for a web search engine? How much impact has IR had on search engines? How does Google serve over 250 Million queries a day, often with sub-second response times? This talk will show that the world of algorithm and system design for commercial search engines can be described by two of Murphy's Laws: a) If anything can go wrong, it will, and b) If anything cannot go wrong, it will anyway.
