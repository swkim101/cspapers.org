COMPUTER-TUTOR is a software package that presents interactively a self-paced, competency-based course in elementary FORTRAN programming. It developed from a project in a course where students design and implement a large-scale programming application. A COMPUTER-TUTOR course, presented on a PDP11/45, consists of nine modules-each module having a lesson, quiz, and programming assignment. A student must pass the quiz in a course-module before going on to the next module. The course grade depends on the number of modules completed. The student-commands LESSON, QUIZ, PROGRAM, OUTLINE, REVIEW, and INFORMATION bring the instructional material (CAI). The instructor uses eight support commands to monitor student progress and course material. COMPUTER-TUTOR will next be expanded to include courses in BASIC and COBOL.
