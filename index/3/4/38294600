In this paper a compression technique is presented which allows a high degree of compression but requires only logarithmic access time. The technique is a constant suppression scheme, and is most applicable to stable databases whose distribution of constants is fairly clustered. Furthermore, the repeated use of the technique permits the supression of a multiple number of different constants. 
 
Of particular interest is the applicaticn of the constant suppression technique to databases whose composite key is made up of an incomplete cross product of several attribute domains. The scheme for compressing the full cross product composite key is well known. In this paper, harever, the general, incomplete case is also handled by applying the constant suppression technique in conjunction with a composite key suppression scheme.
