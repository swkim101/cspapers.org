This paper presents a stochastic computing implementation 
of a Bayesian sensorimotor system that performs 
obstacle avoidance for an autonomous robot. In a previous 
work we have shown that we are able to automatically design a 
probabilistic machine which computes inferences on a Bayesian 
model using stochastic arithmetic. We start from a high level 
Bayesian model description, then our compiler generates an 
electronic circuit, corresponding to the probabilistic inference, 
operating on stochastic bit streams. Our goal in this paper is 
to show that our compilation toolchain and simulation device 
work on a classic robotic application, sensor fusion for obstacle 
avoidance. The novelty is in the way the computations are implemented, 
opening the way for future low power autonomous 
robots using such circuits to perform Bayesian Inference.
