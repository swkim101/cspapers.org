A new method is proposed in this paper to solve the motion planning problem of redundant manipulators for execution of specified operational trajectories. The critical case is considered in which the use of singularities is essential to accede to the complete desired path. The main idea of the method is that one minor of the Jacobian matrix would be controlled in such a way that the manipulator changes its posture by smooth crossing through one singularity. A case of study is presented which allows appreciate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
