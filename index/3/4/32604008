This session will highlight programs in the National Science Foundation’s (NSF’s) Education and Human Resources (EHR) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) directorates. The focus will be on providing descriptions of several programs of interest to college faculty, and discussing the requirements and guidelines for programs in these areas. It will include a description of the proposal and review processes. Participants will be encouraged to discuss procedural issues with the presenters. This session is meant to be similar to a previously held, successful special session in 2004 [1].
