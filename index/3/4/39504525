Super-resolution is a very well-studied topic in image enhancement. However, traditional super-resolution techniques are limited by global motion assumption and the accuracy of displacement estimation. In this paper, we are interested in the problem of constructing super-resolution images from high-speed camera sequences with the presence of moving objects. The objective of our research is finding a suitable method for this problem. We have experimented with several super-resolution methods on simulated and real high frame rate sequences in order to compare the performance of these methods. Experimental results and discussion will be reported.
