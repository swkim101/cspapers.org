A system is being implemented to analyse sequences of TV-frames from real world scenes like a street intersection with cars. A monocular black/white TV-camera will record - without changing its position or viewing direction - a scene in realtime on an AKPEX analog disk . The analysis system must not manipulate objects and their environment by mechanical devices. Changes in color or direction of the illumination as well as laser ranging or slit illumination will be excluded.
