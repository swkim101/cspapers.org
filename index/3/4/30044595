The mission of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Information Sharing and Collaborative Security is to advance the scientific foundations for sharing threat and security-related data among organizations. The call for better information sharing continues to be an important theme in the computer security community and with policy makers. The expectation is that sharing will significantly improve the ability of defenders to detect and mitigate attacks on their networks and systems. Several commercial offerings by security vendors that enable automated sharing have gone live and existing communities have begun to use them. Sharing of security and threat data at scale raises a number of interesting research questions, including on how to best collect, analyze and make use of these data to address important security concerns. In addition sharing raises privacy and other policy issues that need to be addressed. The 2nd ACM Workshop on Information Sharing and Collaborative Security (WISCS'15) aims to bring together experts and practitioners from academia, industry and government to present innovative research, case studies, and legal and policy issues. WISCS'15 is held in Denver, Colorado, USA on October 12, 2015 in conjunction with the 22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2015).
