In this paper, we report an initial design of humanoid head platform for RoboCup humanoid challenge. While many researches in RoboCup humanoid challenge naturally focus on walking and running behaviors, we focus on perception and high-level behavior issues using an upper-torso humanoid. We have designed a head/neck part of the humanoid with aesthetically designed appearance, and various processing for early perception and associated reflex. The goal of this paper is to illustrate issues in designing humanoid head platform for high-level cognition research, and provide some of initial insights obtained during the early stage of implementations. With regards to perception, the emphasis will be placed on how interaction between different perception channel and motor control can complement each other to improve processing.
