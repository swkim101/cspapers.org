Variability and diverseness among incoming requests to a service hosted on a finite capacity resource necessitates sophisticated request admission control techniques for providing guaranteed quality of service (QoS). We propose in this paper a service time based online admission control methodology for maximizing profits of a service provider. The proposed methodology chooses a subset of incoming requests such that the revenue of the provider is maximized. Admission control decision in our proposed system is based upon an estimate of the service time of the request, QoS bounds, prediction of arrivals and service times of requests to come in the short-term future, and rewards associated with servicing a request within its QoS bounds. Effectiveness of the proposed admission control methodology is demonstrated using experiments with a content-based messaging middleware service.
