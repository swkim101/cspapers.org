Nitrogen-heterocyclic phosphonic acids and derivatives thereof characterized by aminomethyl (or substituted methyl) phosphonic acids or derivatives thereof bonded directly or indirectly, i.e., through a N-side chain to the nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring, for example those containing in the molecule at least one of the following units: XO ¦ PARALLEL N-(R'NH)-- C-P(OM)2 ¦ Y 1-2 where N represents a heterocyclic ring having a nitrogen atom on the ring; -R'N- represents an amino-terminated side chain attached directly to the ring nitrogen (which side chain may or may not be present); and XO ¦ PARALLEL -C-P(OM)2 ¦ Y represents a methyl (or substituted methyl) phosphonic acid group where M is hydrogen, an alcohol or a salt moiety, and X and Y are hydrogen or a substituted group such as alkyl, aryl, etc., of which one or two units may be present depending on the available nitrogen bonded hydrogens, and to uses for these compounds, for example, as scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, etc.
