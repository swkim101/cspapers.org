The use of micro-blogging in classrooms is a recently trending concept in computer-aided education. Micro-blogs offer an effective way of communication in large classrooms, and engage students in meaningful discussions. However, existing micro-blogging systems in education setting suffer from a few drawbacks. First, relevant content might be overwhelmed by irrelevant posts to the lecture which could jeopardize effective learning. Second, students might generate redundant content by posting similar questions to each other and create substantial information overload. Third, posts covering different aspects of the class might be left undiscovered due to real-time characteristics of micro-blogs. To address these issues, we present a principled approach for picking a set of posts that promotes relevant and diverse content while effectively turning down the noise created by redundant posts. We formulate this task as a submodular optimization problem for which we provide an efficient and near-optimal solution. We evaluate our framework on real micro-blog based classroom datasets and our empirical results demonstrate that our framework is effectively able to cover the most important and diverse content that is being discussed in classrooms.
