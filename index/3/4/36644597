This paper describes current work at the University of Pennsylvania centered around providing intelligent help raid advice to users of interactive task oriented systems. This work focuses on three general themes: (1) Help systems should be active rather than passive; (J) help systems should contain explicit models of the user, the task and the system utility being used and (3) the help system shoulJ engage in an interactive dialogue with the user in order to identify the information he really needs. An experimental UV, system, WIZARD, has been implemented for the VAX/VMS' operating system to explore some of these issues.
