For over 40 years, the ACM and IEEE-Computer Society have sponsored international curricular guidelines for undergraduate programs in computing. The rapid evolution and expansion of the computing field and the growing number of topics in computer science have made regular revision of curricular recommendations necessary. Thus, the Computing Curricula volumes are updated on an approximately 10-year cycle, with the aim of keeping curricula modern and relevant. The latest volume in the series, Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013), is due for release in the Fall of 2013. This panel seeks to inform the SIGCSE community about the final version of the report, provide insight on interpreting the CS2013 guidelines, and give guidance regarding how the guidelines may be implemented at different institutions.
