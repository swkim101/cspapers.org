In this paper, we introduce MyCampus, a Semantic Web environment for context-aware mobile services, which we are in the process of developing and validating on Carnegie Mellon University's campus. The environment revolves around a growing collection of customizable agents capable of (semi-) automatically discovering and accessing user personal resources (e.g. calendar, location tracking functionality, food preferences) and Web services as they assist their users in carrying out different tasks such as planning an evening out, organizing a study group or filtering incoming messages. The openness of the MyCampus architecture directly derives from a set of ontologies for describing personal resources, contextual attributes, user preferences and web services. Contextual information and other personal details about a user are accessed via a Semantic e-Wallet, subject to access privileges set by the user.
