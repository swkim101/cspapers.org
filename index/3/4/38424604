This paper presents methods of trajectory planning for a mobile manipulator with stability considerations. The proposed trajectory planning method is to generate a trajectory for the mobile manipulator from a given path of the end-effector considering stability. Then, we derive a dynamics model of the mobile manipulator considering it as the combined system of the manipulator and the mobile platform. ZMP criterion is used as an index for the system stability. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with some constraints. To solve the problem, we use a hierarchical gradient method which synthesizes the gradient function in a hierarchical manner based on the order of priority. The simulation results of the 2-link planar nonholonomic mobile manipulator are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
