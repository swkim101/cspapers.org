A successful deployment of biometric-based recognition systems in real-life applications depends on crucial issues such as data security and privacy, which have to be specifically addressed. Besides, cryptographic key protection can represent the main weakness of a secured transmission. In this demonstration a system for encryption and digital signature of generic digital documents (SAES, standing for Signature-based Assymetric Encryption System) is presented, where cryptographic keys are protected by the hand-written signature of the user. Furthermore, a demonstration of a the handwritten online signature verification system (SVS) based on non-protected templates will also be performed.
