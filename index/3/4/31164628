LINQ is a declarative language that provides a uniform paradigm for querying relations, objects, and XML. LINQ has from-where-select clauses, similar to SQL, but the clause order is based on its underlying formalism of functional programming. This workshop introduces LINQ from a database perspective with hands-on exercises over relational and XML data using a lightweight IDE for formative feedback. Participants will learn LINQ by experiencing sample exercises for incorporating LINQ into the database curriculum. The intended audience includes anyone with the knowledge of SQL who wants to learn LINQ. After learning LINQ to query relational data, participants will be introduced to XML and how LINQ can also be used to return, query, and transform XML data. Laptop recommended.
