The 2005 school year marked the 2 year that the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Exam has been given in Java. With some features of Java 5.0 (Tiger) becoming part of the AP subset, test takers for the 2007 AP CS Exam are expected to be able to implement interfaces, design and implement class hierarchies using inheritance, analyze the tradeoffs between alternative designs and their associated efficiencies, and make use of Java Collection classes where appropriate, which include the use of Generics. This special session is intended to inform both high school and college teachers of the extent of the changes and how they will affect the development of future AP CS exams. Also the structure of the new case study will be shown. The AP CS Development Committee’s charge is not only to provide a comprehensive testing mechanism, but also to recommend a direction that high school teachers should take in preparing a foundation for more advanced student studies during college. This special session will bring together two college and two high school members of the AP CS Development Committee to share some of their insights into the AP program. AP teachers will learn valuable information regarding the new features of Java and about the exam for which they are preparing their students. College teachers will learn more about the AP CS curriculum and test development process, which may aid them in similar course redesigns and in the placement of students with AP credit. Time will be provided to discuss participant’s questions.
