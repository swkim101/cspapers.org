This paper presents a method for characterizing the retina skeleton images in order to avoid its major disadvantage, which is represented in the obtained non-smoothness skeletons. The method comprises three steps: A treatment step for the purpose of digitizing the human retina image, a segmentation step for the extraction of the vascular network and their attributes, thereafter, a step for location identification of characteristic points aiming to improve the quality of the curvature of the blood vessels obtained.
