Large scale simulations of complex physics phenomena have long run times and generate massive amounts of data. Saving this data to external storage systems or transferring it to remote locations for analysis is a costly operation that quickly becomes a performance bottleneck. In this paper, we present DART (Decoupled and Asynchronous Remote Transfers), an efficient data transfer substrate that effectively minimizes the data I/O overhead on the running simulations. DART is a thin software layer built on RDMA technology to enable fast, low-overhead and asynchronous access to data from a running simulation, and support high-throughput, low-latency data transfers.
