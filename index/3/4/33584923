Enrollments in CS have been climbing dramatically in recent years at large schools, especially those in the top-tier for CS. This type of growth is part of the normal cycle for CS and is expected anytime that the public perceives that the job market for computing related fields is strong. It is unclear how much of this growth is currently seen on other campuses. The purpose of this BoF session is to discuss what educators at smaller campuses, and particularly liberal arts schools, are currently seeing in regards to enrollment in CS. This information could be of particular interest for those at schools considering cutting programs for economic reasons or those adjusting the number of faculty lines.
