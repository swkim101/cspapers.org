It is well understood that the key for successful Semantic Web applications depends on the availability of machine understandable meta-data. We describe the Information Grid, a practical approach to the Semantic Web, and show a prototype implementation. Information grid resources span all the data in the organization and all the metadata required to make it meaningful. The final goal is to let organizations view their assets in a smooth continuum from the Internet to the Intranet, with uniform semantically rich access.
