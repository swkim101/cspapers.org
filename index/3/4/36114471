Various schemes for over-the-air programming of sensor networks have been proposed, e.g., Deluge [1], MNP [2], and MOAP [3]. When node density increases, the performance of these schemes often degrades because of increasing traffic contention on the shared channel. While a number of mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this problem, such as advertisement suppression [1] and selective sender selection [2], they do not solve it completely. In fact, the results of [1] as well as our experiments show that the completion time of Deluge, one of the most popular over-the-air programming schemes, considerably increases with node density.
