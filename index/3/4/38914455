This paper proposes a dynamic acoustic field generation system for a spot audio towards particular person indoors. Spot audio techniques have been explored by generating the ultrasound beams toward the target person in certain area however everyone in this area can hear the sound. Our system recognizes the positions of each person indoor using motion capture and 3D model data of the room. After that we control direction of parametric speaker in real-time so that sound reach only particular person by calculating the reflection of sound on surfaces such as wall and ceiling. We calculate direction of parametric speaker using a beam tracing method. We present generating methods of dynamic acoustic field in our system and conducted the experiments on human factor to evaluate performance of proposed system.
