The quality of any design can be expressed by certain numbers called merit factors. These merit factors are functions of other numbers called variables. The computer is used to manipulate these variables to obtain optimum merit factors. This manipulation process, called Design Optimization has been applied to a special optics problem that presents itself in the Norden Head-Up Display System.
