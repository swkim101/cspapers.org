Recently, in the fall of 1974, San Jose State University (SJSU) launched a new master's program in Computer and Information Science (CIS). The main function of this paper is to describe the program—detailing its origins, content, administration, present status and potential future. A secondary purpose is to present material about one of the program's options—Management Information Systems.(MIS). In order to accomplish the above goals, the paper is divided into five sections as follows: Background, Program Description, Current Results, MIS Option, and Summary.
