The Workshop Digital Identity Management has evolved during the last decade as one of the most interesting events on identity management issues. Starting from a community with a background mainly in computer science, it has developed towards an interdisciplinary workshop where a lively interactive community discusses identity topics from technical, sociological, economical, legal, psychological and many more angles. The goal of this workshop is to share the latest findings, identify key challenges, inspire debates, and foster collaboration between industries and academia towards interoperable identity service infrastructures.
