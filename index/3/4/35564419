In this paper the author presents an efficient algorithm for the coordinated manipulation of polygonal objects with independent robot agents and an efficient decision procedure for whether a polygonal object can undergo any desired reorientation. This algorithm has good stability properties, in that it is not sensitive to small errors in the initial data and it relies on a simple control scheme. The result is a contribution towards realistic task-level planning for robots.
