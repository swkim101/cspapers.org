Most new wireless research protocols and applications are evaluated using simulation, and such evaluations sparsely consider real-world radio signal propagation effects or device mobility. Current simulators do not describe these detailed RF characteristics very well. Researchers have found that multipath effects and other sources of radio irregularity can degrade effectiveness of routing protocols [4]. Consequently, in order to fully evaluate new wireless protocols, study of their interaction with real-world environments is necessary. Unfortunately, control and space issues create a barrier to mobilization of wireless devices in the real world. We have extended the highly-used Emulab testbed [3] to provide a remotely-accessible mobile wireless network testbed for use by the research community. The mobile testbed is currently deployed in a temporary area measuring 60 square meters in which remote users can dynamically position several robots. Dozens of sensor network motes, some with environmental sensors, are mounted on walls and ceilings. The robots carry an Intel Stargate with an X-Scale 400MHz CPU running Linux, a wireless Ethernet card, and a Mica2 sensor network mote with a 900MHz radio. Users can script robot motion using the ns language [2] or dynamically issue commands from a Java applet in the standard Emulab
