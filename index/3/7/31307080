ER fluid has rheological characteristics which can be controlled by the electric field. Using particle-type ER fluid, we developed a brake device. In this study, this ER brake was used in an isokinetic exercise system for rehabilitation training under restriction of constant rotational speed of a joint during exercise. Such a passive system using a brake is basically safe for human use.
