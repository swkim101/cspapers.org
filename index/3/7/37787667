This paper describes a octo-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with one degree of freedom (DoF) manipulator for bridge inspection. The UAV has an ability to contact bridge pier to conduct hammering test. To control contact force applied by the UAV to the bridge pier, one DoF is enough for the manipulator implemented on the UAV. A preliminary experiment shows that the force is proportional to the pitch angle of the UAV when it contacts the bridge pier. A bridge pier contact experiment shows that our developed UAV can control contact force between its end-effector and the bridge pier; mean error of the contact force is 4.27 Â± 3.64 [N] against 20[N] desired force.
