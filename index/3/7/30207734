In this paper, we address a generalization of the Orienteering Problem (OP) for curvature-constrained vehicles and to problems where it is allowed to collect a reward associated to each target location within a specified distance from the target. The addressed problem combines challenges of the combinatorial optimization of the OP (to select the most rewarding targets and find the optimal sequence to visit them) with the continuous optimization related to the determination of the waypoint locations and suitable headings at the waypoints for the considered Dubins vehicle such that the curvature-constrained path does not exceed the given travel budget and the sum of the collected rewards is maximized. The proposed generalization is called the Close Enough Dubins Orienteering Problem (CEDOP) and novel unsupervised learning approach is proposed to address computational requirements of this challenging planning problem. Based on the presented results, the proposed approach is feasible and provides a bit worse solution of CEDOP than the existing combinatorial approach but with significantly lower computational requirements.
