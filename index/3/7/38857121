This paper describes two prototype systems which facilitate the production of teaching films containing animated representations of the execution of computer programs. With such systems, it is possible for an instructor to produce short quick-and-dirty single-concept film clips with only hours of effort, and more polished material with only slightly more effort. Demonstration clips produced in this way will be shown at the Symposium.
