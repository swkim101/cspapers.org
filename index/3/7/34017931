We present a robust algorithm for personalizing a spheremesh tracking model to a user from a collection of depth measurements. Our core contribution is to demonstrate how simple geometric reasoning can be exploited to build a shape-space, and how its performance is comparable to shape-spaces constructed from datasets of carefully calibrated models. We achieve this goal by first reparameterizing the geometry of the tracking template, and introducing a multi-stage calibration optimization. Our novel parameterization decouples the degrees of freedom for pose and shape, resulting in improved convergence properties. Our analytically differentiable multi-stage calibration pipeline optimizes for the model in the natural low-dimensional space of local anisotropic scalings, leading to an effective solution that can be easily embedded in other tracking/calibration algorithms. Compared to existing sphere-mesh calibration algorithms, quantitative experiments assess our algorithm possesses a larger convergence basin, and our personalized models allows to perform motion tracking with superior accuracy.
