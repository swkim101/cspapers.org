Silicon yield once was dominated by contaminants and particulates, making yield a process issue. But with today's electronics supply chain, multiple suspects may be indicted on manufacturability issues. Who is responsible for preventative actions in manufacturability and yield? The AUTHORs, representing a foundry, a fabless company, an IP provider, two EDA vendors, and an IC design team, will discuss the problems and the solutions for achieving manufacturability and yield goals.
