In this paper, we implement Bose-Chaudhuri- Hocquenghen (BCH) coding to study the performance of Power Line Channel (PLC) impaired by impulsive noise and AWGN. Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is employed and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is used as a transmission scheme. Block truncation coding (BTC) is used for the compression of the image. A comparison is made between uncoded system and BCH coding system. The performance of the system is assessed by the quality of the image for different sizes of BCH encoder, in three different environments. Simulation results showed that with BCH coding, the performance of the PLC system has improved dramatically in all three impulsive scenarios.
