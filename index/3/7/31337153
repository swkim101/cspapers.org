Why would anyone want to includ e history as a to p ic in an Introductor y Computer course? This, of course, is a rhetorical q uestion, which I wish t o withdraw and chance to : What benefits t o students and instructors should one ex p ec t from includin g history as a topic in a n Introductory Computer course? The questio n in this form is easier to address, and th e rest of my pacer will try to answer it. Even if we restrict our definition o f "history" to nothin g more than facts (suc h as inventions, inventors and dates), mos t people would agree that knowin g som e history is better than knowing none ; tha t if, in addition to the topics covered in a n introductory course, the student learn s some computer history, he is, to tha t extent, better educated. Apparently authors and publishers o f textbooks intended for introductor y computer courses subscribe to the abov e view, because most such textbooks includ e some historical material. In May of 1977 I examined ten introductory texts, and foun d that nine included some historica l material. The examination revealed furthe r that : (1) the historical material consist s almost entirely of facts (inventions , inventors and dates), arranaed rou g hly i n chronolo g ical order ; (2) the history par t stands in complete isolation from the res t of the book ; and (3) the number of item s included by the authors ran g ed from 5 t o 13, with the mean at 9. 1 submit that more than jus t historical facts can, and should, be taugh t in introductory com p uter courses. Th e student should; acquire a conceptua l framework which allows him to grou p fact s together, and to relate the groups to eac h other. Looker; at this way, there is n o p oint in the students learnin g Particula r inventions, inventors and dates were it no t for their essential role as examples o f aeneral categories. Computer history shoul d be taught because it makes other topics i n the course clearer ; it should hel p relat e disparate p arts of the course, and i t should put computers in perspective by clarifying their relationships to othe â€¦
