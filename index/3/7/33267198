This paper deals with the design of measurement-based simulation models for wideband single-input single-output (SISO) mobile radio channels. We present an improved version of the iterative nonlinear least square approximation (INLSA) method for computing the parameters of measurement-based simulation models. The proposed method aims to fit the temporal-frequency correlation function (TFCF) of the simulation model to that of the measured channel. Unlike the original INLSA method, the proposed approach provides a unique optimal set of estimated model parameters. The proposed iterative procedure involves numerical optimization techniques to determine a set of parameters that minimizes the Euclidian norm of the fitting error. Our investigations show that the proposed method performs well in terms of the goodness of fit to the measured data. The new method is relatively simple and can be used for the design of measurement-based wideband channel simulators, which are important for the performance analysis of mobile communication systems under real-world propagation conditions.
