Many problems in natural language processing involve building outputs that are structured. The predominant approach to structured prediction is “global models” (such as conditional random fields), which have the advantage of clean underlying semantics at the cost of computational burdens and extreme difficulty in implementation. An alternative strategy is the “learning to search” (L2S) paradigm, in which the structured prediction task is cast as a sequential decision making process. One can then devise training-time algorithms that learn to make near optimal collective decisions. This paradigm has been gaining increasing traction over the past five years: most notably in dependency parsing (e.g., MaltParser, ClearNLP, etc.), but also much more broadly in less “sequential” tasks like entity/relation classification and even graph prediction problems found in social network analysis and computer vision. This tutorial has precisely one goal: an attendee should leave the tutorial with hands on experience writing small programs to perform structured prediction for a variety of tasks, like sequence labeling, dependency parsing and, time-permitting, more.
