This paper describes a method for constructing a decision rule providing the isolation of the most preferable solutions in multi objective decision problems. The method is based on the iterative procedure for constructing decision rules. Criteria of meaning-fulness and consistency of received information are formulated. The results are given of applying the method to solution of the most preferable alternatives search problems concerning the mineshaft layout.
