During the past ten years, several model curricula for technical academic disciplines have been developed and published by professional societies. Among the recommendations for computer science are those of '68 and '78 by ACM. This paper presents a quantitative scheme for evaluating a computer science curriculum as compared to ACM '68 and '78 guidelines. To demonstrate the evaluation scheme, curricula from three (3) universities are compared to the ACM guidelines. The results of those numeric comparisons are tabulated and discussed. Other areas that affect a computer science program; textbooks, computer facilities, and faculty are also discussed.
