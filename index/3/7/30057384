The recent emergence of digital fabrication allows everyday designers to make, deploy, and enjoy their creation. However, the excitement over digital fabrication presumes that users have sufficient domain knowledge to create complex models by understanding the underlying principles, can be self-creative without computational supports. This paper presents a new fabrication framework that lowers the boundary of solving everyday issues with fabrication. A formalism and accompanying finite state machine (FSM) model that help assign a fabrication machine intelligence to appreciate humans' design actions was proposed, with a view towards a new fabrication framework empowering collaborative, incremental fabrication. Empowered by the novel framework, this paper envisions a future of fabrication that pushes the ceiling, a collaborative fabrication, processing intermittent, unpredictable events as live input and reflect them in the emerging outcomes by co-design process between a designer and a machine.
