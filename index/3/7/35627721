Precisely recommending relevant items from massive candidates to a large number of users is an indispensable yet computationally expensive task in many online platforms (e.g., Amazon.com and Netflix.com). A promising way is to project users and items into a Hamming space and then recommend items via Hamming distance. However, previous studies didn't address the cold-start challenges and couldn't make the best use of preference data like implicit feedback. To fill this gap, we propose a Discrete Content-aware Matrix Factorization (DCMF) model, 1) to derive compact yet informative binary codes at the presence of user/item content information; 2) to support the classification task based on a local upper bound of logit loss; 3) to introduce an interaction regularization for dealing with the sparsity issue. We further develop an efficient discrete optimization algorithm for parameter learning. Based on extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we show that DCFM outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both regression and classification tasks.
