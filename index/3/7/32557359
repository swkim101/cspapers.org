The parallel processing array consists of an n√ón array of processors to which a cn2 node directed graph can be input by placing c nodes at every point of the array. It is shown that every one of the following properties of the graph can be computed in order of n steps: (1) to test whether the graph is strongly connected, (2) to mark a node in every strongly connected component, (3) to mark a strong connected component that contains a given node, (4) to mark a simple directed path between a given pair of nodes, and (5) to compute the interconnectivity of the c nodes within every point. As a consequence, several open problems can be solved. For example, any language recognized by a 2-dimensional finite state automaton with 1 pebble can be recognized in order of n steps by a parallel processing array. (It was not even known whether the languages recognized by 2-dimensional finite state automata without pebbles can be recognized in order of n steps by a parallel processing array). Note that a 1 pebble automaton can run for order of n4 steps before accepting an input.
