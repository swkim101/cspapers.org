Despite the growing focus on the design of compliant mechanisms for robotics actuators that manifest several advantages in terms of robustness and interaction-related characteristics, the incorporation of elasticity in the actuation drive renders under-damped vibration modes and reduces the bandwidth of the system. The addition of damping principles into compliant systems can address such impediments to accuracy and stability, and enhance the passivity characteristics of the controlled compliant actuator. However, passive damping mechanisms integrated into compliant systems to exhibit user-defined passive dissipation profiles have not been realized. This paper proposes a non-linear stiffness compliant module, and introduces a novel non-linear damper which complements the elastic element. The cam-follower mechanism was employed for rendering the user-defined non-linear behaviour. While the passive compliance of the module is replicated using a curved leaf spring, the passive damping is generated by rolling/sliding motion of a rigid cylinder on an elastomer. The design of the module is described, the theoretical modelling is presented, and experimental results validating the functionality of the proposed design in dissipating under-damped oscillations are demonstrated.
