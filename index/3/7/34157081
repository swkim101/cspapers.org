This special session will recap qualitative research design and analysis as discussed during an NSF-sponsored two-part workshop for computer science education researchers held in 2009-2010. Several workshop participants will illustrate the use of qualitative methods by describing their research projects. They will briefly present their methodologies, analyses and findings. Attendees will be encouraged to ask questions about how qualitative methods can be used in their own research projects.
