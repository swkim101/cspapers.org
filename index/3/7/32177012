In this paper, we describe the details of an interactive online web-based degree program in the area of Computer Science with specialization in Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) that has been successfully running for two years in a leading technological university in India. The subjects taught as well as the tools and platforms used in delivering the course are exclusively FOSS and put together by the university team, as described here. We also describe the details of the program, its goals and purpose, the manner of its implementation, the learnings we have had and the challenges being faced in going forward.
