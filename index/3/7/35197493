Programming an application which uses interactive devices located on different terminals is not easy. Programming such applications with standard Web technologies (HTTP, Javascript, Web browser) is even more difficult. However, Web applications have interesting properties like running on very different terminals, the lack of a specific installation step, the ability to evolve the application code at runtime. Our demonstration presents a support for designing multi-devices Web applications. After introducing the context of this work, we briefly describe some problems related to the design of multi-devices web application. Then, we present the toolkit we have implemented to help the development of applications based upon distant interactive devices.
