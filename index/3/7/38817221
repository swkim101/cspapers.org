This panel will bring together the surviving authors (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, and Ralph Johnson) of the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Addison-Wesley) and it is dedicated to the memory of the fourth author John Vlissides. The discussion will focus on the beginnings of their collaboration that led to the book and a look forward to the future.
