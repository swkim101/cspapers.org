The normal mode helical antenna becomes an efficient radiator in the condition of the self resonance. When the antenna size is less than 0.03 wavelengths, the antenna input resistance becomes very small such as about 1 ohm. Therefore, the impedance matching structure is inevitable and its usefulness is required as well.
