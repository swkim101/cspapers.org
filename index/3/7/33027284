A control strategy is introduced. The tasks in the agenda are organized hierarchically, such that, in general, only tasks in the same level are allowed to compete with each other. KEY tasks with highest priority are also introduced to maintain the flexibility of control. This concept has been applied to a medical diagnosis expert system MDM, and it is implemented on UNIVAC 1100/10. The result is satisfactory.
