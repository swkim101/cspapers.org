A hypothetical ALU that can be used for teaching a course in Computer Organization is presented. The proposed ALU is composed of circuits normally discussed in a course of this type and is designed using a minimum number of MSI circuit components. This hypothetical ALU should be useful in bridging the gap between the simplicity of AND and OR gates and the functional complexity of the circuits of the ALU. The timing constraints of the ALU and the ALU control word structure are also discussed.
