An Information understanding System Of Basic weather Report(ISOBAR) is introduced first. It can adapt to both linguistic and pictorial input, and produce each output. The central part of this system is semantic processing, but ISOBAR's world is limited to weather report of Japan and Far East Asian area in terms of Japanese and corresponding weather charts. According to experimental results, the performance of the system proved to be satisfactory, except the computing time of picture processing procedures. Finally, the problems for the future research are pointed out.
