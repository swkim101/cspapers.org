Current trends in microprocessor design are fundamentally changing the way that performance is extracted from computer systems. The previous programming model for sequential uniprocessor execution is being replaced quickly with a need to write software for tightly-coupled shared memory multiprocessor systems. Both academicians and business leaders have challenged programmers to update their skill sets and their tools to effectively tackle software development for these newer platforms [1].
