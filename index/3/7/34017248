DAGSI Whegs is the latest generation of full size Whegs robots. The robot is designed for collaborative work with the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) in SLAM with active feature recognition. Whegs vehicles use abstracted biological principles to navigate over irregular and varied terrain with little or no low level control. Torsionally compliant devices in the drive train of each wheel-leg allow its gait to passively adapt when climbing large obstacles or steep inclines. Whegs is similar to the RHex line of robots that preceded Whegs in that the foot motion of all 6 legs is circular, but it differs in many aspects: 3 leg-spokes versus 1, 1 drive motor vs. 6, leg rotation for steering instead of skid steering, passive gait adaptation vs. active gait control, and Whegs has a body joint.
