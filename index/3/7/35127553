This paper compares the major features of several digital computer programs for nonlinear transient circuit analysis. The features of the programs are presented from the user's viewpoint and include discussions of the capabilities, limitations, and availability of each program. There are in existence a number of transient circuit analysis computer programs. Most of these programs can be applied to Transient Radiation Effects on Electronics (TREE) problems. Since there is no current, comparative documentation on the capability, limitations, and availability of these programs, the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA) requested the Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL) review the programs in existence.
