This is done by formulating opinion target extraction (OTE) as a shallow semantic parsing problem with the opinion expression as the predicate and the corresponding targets as its arguments. In principle, our parsing approach to OTE differs from the state-of-the-art sequence labeling one in two aspects. First, we model OTE from parse tree level, where abundant structured syntactic information is available for use, instead of word sequence level, where only lexical information is available. Second, we focus on determining whether a constituent, rather than a word, is an opinion target or not, via a simplified shallow semantic parsing framework. Evaluation on two datasets shows that structured syntactic information plays a critical role in capturing the domination relationship between an opinion expression and its targets. It also shows that our parsing approach much outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence labeling one.
