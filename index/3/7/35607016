Stronger engagement and greater participation is often crucial to reach a goal or to solve an issue. Issues like the emerging employee engagement crisis, insufficient knowledge sharing, and chronic procrastination. In many cases we need and search for tools to beat procrastination or to change people's habits. Gamification is the approach to learn from often fun, creative and engaging games. In principle, it is about understanding games and applying game design elements in a non-gaming environments. This offers possibilities for wide area improvements. For example more accurate work, better retention rates and more cost effective solutions by relating motivations for participating as more intrinsic than conventional methods. In the context of Information Retrieval (IR) it is not hard to imagine that many tasks could benefit from gamification techniques. Besides several manual annotation tasks of data sets for IR research, user participation is important in order to gather implicit or even explicit feedback to feed the algorithms. Gamification, however, comes with its own challenges and its adoption in IR is still in its infancy. Given the enormous response to the first and second GamifIR workshops that were both co-located with ECIR, and the broad range of topics discussed, we now organized the third workshop at SIGIR 2016 to address a range of emerging challenges and opportunities.
