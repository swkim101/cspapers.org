A railroad side frame test machine for loading side frames used on the trucks or carriages for railway cars to simulate the in-use loads utilizing a compact linkage that provides for direct loading of the specimen in the various load directions. The forces are applied to the specimen to insure that certain reactions are grounded, while other applied forces are basically ungrounded to effectively eliminate "cross talk" between the various input loads or forces.
