We propose a paradigm for shape and motion reconstruction based on dynamic energy constraints. Objects are modeled as deformable elastic bodies and constraints derived from image data are modeled as eztemal forces applied to these bodies. The eztemal constraint forces are designed to mold a deformable body into a configuration tent satisfies the constraints, making the model consistent with the images. We present a particular shape model whose internal forces induce a preference for surface continuity and axial symmetry. We develop a constraint force for dynamic stereo images and present results for the recovery of shape and non-rigid motion from natural imagery.
