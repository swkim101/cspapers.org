In this paper, the Intelligent Space concept is applied for helping disabled or blind persons in crowded environments such as train stations, or airports. The main contribution of this paper is a general mathematical (fuzzy-neuro) description of obstacle avoidance method (walking habit) of moving objects (human beings) in a limited area scanned by the Intelligent Space. A mobile robot with extended functions is introduced as a mobile haptic interface, which is assisted by the Intelligent Space. The mobile haptic interface can guide and protect a blind person in a crowded environment with the help of the Intelligent Space. The Intelligent Space learns the obstacle avoidance method (walking habit) of dynamic objects (human beings) by tracing their movements and helps to the blind person to avoid the collision. The prototype of the mobile haptic interface and simulations of some basic types of obstacle avoidance method (walking habit) are presented.
