An approach based on versatile nanomanipulation and assembly has been taken to investigate the fundamental properties of nanomaterials of various types for their potential applications in sensing and actuation. A nanomanipulation system with many degrees of freedom was developed for use inside a field emission scanning electron microscope. This system is capable of nanometer resolution motion, and free-space manipulation/characterization of nanostructures by the multiple probes controlled by the high precision manipulators. Specifically, the manipulation and basic construction capabilities in free space were demonstrated with nanomaterials, such as nanotubes and nanowires having diameters around tens of nanometers and length around a few microns; mechanical and electrical characterization of such individual nanoscale objects were realized with the introduction of new techniques and methods; and finally, mechanical resonance and high order parametric resonances in a nanowire mechanical system were realized using oscillating electric field induced oscillation.
