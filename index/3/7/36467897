In this paper, we present BitDrones, a platform for the construction of interactive 3D displays that utilize nano quadcopters as self-levitating tangible building blocks. Our prototype is a first step towards supporting interactive mid-air, tangible experiences with physical interaction techniques through multiple building blocks capable of physically representing interactive 3D data.
