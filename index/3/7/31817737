This paper addresses the problem of program conversion in the context of converting to a database management system. This conversion may be from a conventional file oriented system, from one database management system to another, or from restructuring of databases within an existing system. Substantial progress has been made in the data conversion area, however, it is widely acknowledged that major cost of application conversion is in the program conversion task. This paper presents a model for program conversion in which the data conversion mappings are used to dictate the necessary transformations required for rewriting the source programs. The model consists of four steps: 1) "decompiling" the source program to an abstract representation, 2) substituting the inverse of the source to target mappings for the program's source data, 3) simplification, and 4) recompilation. A language is given for specifying the program abstraction, and examples are used to illustrate some transformation rules used in the rewriting process.
