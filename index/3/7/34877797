The Common High Order Language effort began in January 1975 as part of a DoD wide program to reduce the cost and to improve the quality of its software. The effort is an attempt to create a situation in which software for new embedded computer systems are developed and maintained using a minimal number of general-purpose programming languages, and that those languages be suited to the applications, be widely used in DoD, and be well supported.
