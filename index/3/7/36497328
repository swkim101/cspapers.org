Ideally, an evaluation technique should describe an algorithm that an evaluator could use that would result in a score or a vector of scores that depict the level of performance of the natural language system under test. The scores should mirror the subjective evaluation of the system that a qualified judge would make. The evaluation technique should yield consistent scores for multiple tests of one system, and the scores for several systems should serve as a means for comparison among systems. Unfortunately, there is no such evaluation technique for natural language understanding systems. In the following sections, I will attempt to highlight some of the difficulties
