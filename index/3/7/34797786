Neurophysiological studies show that humans possess the capability of generating appropriate motor behaviors to different uncertain environmental conditions by combining a forward action, produced by the internal forward dynamic model, and a feedback control, realising the transformation from sensory information to motor commands. To this regard, a control system based on the combination of a feedforward and a feedback control loop has been developed in order to provide a robot arm with human-like adaptation capabilities. The work analyses the role of biological coactivation in the mechanism of adjustable visco-elastic arm properties and proposes a function for the evaluation of the robot arm coactivation based on the measure of the position error and the interaction force. The coactivation function is used to update the proportional and derivative parameters of the feedback controller and, consequently, the arm visco-elasticity in unpredictable environmental conditions. Finally, experimental results on the evolution of the coactivation in the adaptation and de-adaptation phases are provided in the last section of the paper.
