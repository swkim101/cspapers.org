In this paper we show a low cost and environmentally friendly fabrication for an agricultural sensing application. An antenna, a soil moisture sensor, and a leaf wetness sensor are inkjet-printed on paper substrate. A microprocessor attached to the paper substrate is capable of detecting the capacitance change on the surface of the sensor, and report the data over the wireless communication interface. This sensing system is useful to optimize irrigation systems.
