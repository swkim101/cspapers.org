In Komagome Hospital, we undertook the systematization of information processing by introducing a large computer based on the idea of the total system. This total system is intended to modernize hospital management and to improve medical services for patients. 
 
In the future, this total system will be applied to the medical care and be reinforced as a total hospital information system. 
 
Real-time system in Komagome hospital will be explained below with an emphasis on data base developed in total hospital information system.
