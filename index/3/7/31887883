Th is note very b r i e f l y desc r i bes a data base system w i t h p r o v i s i o n f o r Na tu ra l Language I n p u t . No a t tempt is made here to j u s t i f y the s t r a t e g i e s adop ted . Those i n t e r e s t e d I n j u s t i f i c a t i o n are r e f e r r e d to ( D e l l , 0 r c o / K ing , Spadavecchia 1977) . The system has been d e l i b e r a t e l y des igned to be very modular . The data base i t s e l f Is a r e l a t i o n a l model based on Codd (Codd 1970).Two sample data bases are cons ide red in the present system p r o t o t y p e : the f i r s t i s about e n e r g e t i c resources and the second is about a depar tment s t o r e . Th is l a s t c o n t a i n s i n f o r m a t i o n about i tems so ld and s u p p l i e d , employees, d e p a r t m e n t s , e t c . . . ( d e t a i 1 s in (Chamber l in 197 4 ) ) . The data base Is i n t e r r o g a t e d by means of a fo rmal query language (AQL) which is i n t e r p r e t e d i n t o a se t of APL p rocedures . A user exper ienced in computer usage would be ab le to use AQL d i r e c t l y i f he chose, thus a v o i d i n g n a t u r a l language i npu t and economis ing on p rocess ing t i m e . AQL and the data base Imp lementa t ion form two of the main modules of the system. D e t a i l s of AQL, of i t s imp lementa t ion and o f t h a t o f the data base management system can be found in (An tonacc i ,De l 1 'O reo , Spadavecchia 1976) . Obv ious ly the most i n t e r e s t i n g f e a t u r e of the system f rom an Al view p o i n t is the n a t u r a l language i n p u t . A c r i t i c a l t h e o r i c a l d e c i s i o n has been made h e r e . I t Is by now g e n e r a l l y agreed t ha t any adeguate n a t u r a l language p rocess ing system must make use of genera l w o r l d knowledge. In a data base system the w o r l d knowledge i nvo l ved seems to us to break down I n t o two p a r t s : the genera l knowledge of the w o r l d encapusu la ted in language use , and the much more r e s t r i c t e d knowledge of the data base w o r l d . Thus words and phrases q u i t e l e g i t e m a t e l y used in the n a t u r a l language f o r m u l a t i o n of a q u e s t i o n In a c e r t a i n sense may have no meaning w i t h i n the data base w o r l d . Before such a meaning can be a t t r i b u t e d to them a correspondence must be set up between them and the formal o b j e c t s of the data base. In o rde r to accompl ish t h i s two s e m a n t l c a l l y d r i v e n modules deal w i t h n a t u r a l language a n a l y s i s . The f i r s t is a genera l n a t u r a l language ana l yse r in tended to a l l o w as wide a subset of n a t u r a l language as p o s s i b l e . I t Is Independent of any p a r t i c u l a r data base, be ing based on the semant ic s t r u c t u r e s of the n a t u r a l language. This module is a development of a pa r t of W i l ks * Pre ference Semantics System (Wi lks 1975) , and e s t a b l i s h e s an i n t e r m e d i a t e semantic r e p r e s e n t a t i o n very s i m i l a r to t ha t used by Wi l ks as Input to the g e n e r a t i o n s e c t i o n o f h i s system (see Herskowi tz 1973) . However, some d i f f i c u l t i e s o f re fe rence and o f d i samb igua t i on w h i c h , f o r W i l k s , would be reso lved by common sense i n f e r e n c e r u l e s , remain in our r e p r e s e n t a t i o n to be d e a l t w i t h by the next module. This i n t e r m e d i a t e r e p r e s e n t a t i o n serves as Input to the second s e m a n t l c a l l y d r i v e n component. But now the semant ics i nvo l ved is the semant ics of the data base, not the semant ics o f the n a t u r a l language. Connect ions between the elements of the i n t e r m e d i a t e r e p r e s e n t a t i o n and the names of r e l a t i o n s and domains of the data base are e s t a b l i s h e d . For example, In a q u e s t i o n about departments which s e l l shoes, the word " shoe" has a t t ached an I n f o r m a t i o n s p e c i f y i n g t ha t i t i s an i tem which can be so ld or s u p p l i e d . The verb " t o s e l l " , connected t o " s h o e " , he lps t o choose the r i g h t data base reference f o r " s h o e " . A T rans fo rma t i on a l g o r i t h m then recodes the q u e s t i o n In terms of the formal query language ment ioned e a r l i e r . Thus, when the data base is changed, un less the vocabu la ry d e a l t w i t h by the f i r s t semant ic module needs to be e n l a r g e d , a l l t h a t needs to be changed are the connec t ions between the elements of the n a t u r a l language and the data base.
