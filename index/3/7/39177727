Three key factors often determine the success or failure of a software project: the management of the project, the selection of personnel, and the development methodology that is used. This paper discusses the important considerations that should be addressed in each of these areas and examines the results of a typical project that paid attention to these factors. In particular, it was concluded that a good development methodology can help ensure the reliability, maintainability and timeliness of any software project.
