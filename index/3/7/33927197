The authors investigate the issue of information interdependence in multisensor systems. A consensus group approach which accounts for interdependence between group sensors is presented. The approach is based on an information theory formulation. An algorithm for computing a weighting scheme for the group sensors is developed. The algorithm rewards each sensor for the quality of its measurements and penalizes it for its interdependence with other sensors in the group.
