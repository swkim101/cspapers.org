: Language­independent Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has proven to be very challenging. The diversity of languages makes high accuracy difficult and requires substantial parallel corpus as well as linguistic resources (parsers, morph analyzers, etc.). An interesting observation is that a large chunk of machine translation (MT) requirements involve related languages. They are either : (i) between related languages, or (ii) between a lingua franca (like English) and a set of related languages. For instance, India, the European Union and South­East Asia have such translation requirements due to government, business and socio­cultural communication needs. Related languages share a lot of linguistic features and the divergences among them are at a lower level of the NLP pipeline. The objective of the tutorial is to discuss how the relatedness among languages can be leveraged to bridge this language divergence thereby achieving some/all of these goals: (i) improving translation quality, (ii) achieving better generalization, (iii) sharing linguistic resources, and (iv) reducing resource requirements. We will look at the existing research in SMT from the perspective of related languages, with the goal to build a toolbox of methods that are useful for translation between related languages. This tutorial would be relevant to Machine Translation researchers and developers, especially those interested in translation between low­resource languages which have resource­rich related languages. It will also be relevant for researchers interested in multilingual computation. We start with a
