In large-scale sensor networks serving mission-critical applications, one possible denial-of-service attack is false data reports injected by attackers. Such false reports could lead to false alarms, exhaustion of the en-route sensors’ limited battery energy, and congestion of wireless channels with limited bandwidth. Although recent work on sensor message authentication [2, 1] can effectively block out false data injections from external nodes, they are rendered ineffective by compromised nodes which can authenticate themselves to neighbors and correctly encrypt false messages. Such attacks through compromised nodes are possible because sensor networks are usually un-attended. An attacker can physically capture a sensor and obtain the security information stored in it without being detected. We propose Statistical En-route Filtering (SEF) that can filter out such false reports en-route as they are forwarded toward the data collection point (called “sink”). SEF leverages the scale of the sensor network and high density level in sensor node deployment. In order to differentiate false data reports injected by compromised nodes, SEF relies on the collective efforts of both the sensors surrounding the report generation locations, and the sensors along data delivery paths. Specifically, when an actual sensing target (called “stimulus”) occurs in the field, SEF lets multiple surrounding sensors collectively generate a legitimate report that carries multiple keyed message authentication codes (MACs). These MACs are the “passport” for the report as it traverses ∗This work is supported by DARPA under contract DABT63-99-1-0010
