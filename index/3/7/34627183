Can students contribute to HFOSS projects as part of their computing curriculum? How and at what level can HFOSS be integrated? What are the success stories and challenges? This BOF will be led by a diverse group of faculty who have incorporated HFOSS into their classes. They will lead a discussion on the various approaches, successes and challenges they have encountered. Their experiences will provide a backdrop for this BOF session, which should lead to a lively discussion of how and why to use HFOSS in computing courses. Faculty who are interested in HFOSS, but who are novices, will learn about potential projects and classroom materials as well as make connections with more experienced faculty in this area.
