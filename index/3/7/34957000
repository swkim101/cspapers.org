The robots operating in hazardous environments such as nuclear plant decommissioning or terrorist bomb disposal need to show off-road capabilities due to the uneven terrain including stairs and ditches. The hazardous environment operation typically requires the use of a remotely operated robot. In this paper we propose an improved articulated track mechanism. A sensing system for haptic operation with a joystick is proposed considering the robot contacts to the stair. Additionally, we present the algorithm for the proposed robot to climb the stairs. Torque analysis is made to design electrical motors, which produce torque enough to drive the track lifting motor and track rotating motor.
