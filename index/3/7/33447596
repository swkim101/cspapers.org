Let V be a set of n points in k -dimensional space. It is shown how the closest pair in V can be maintained under insertions in O (log n log log n ) amortized time, using O ( n ) amortized time, using O ( n ) space. Distances are measured in the L t -metric, where 1 ≤ ∞. This gives an O ( n log n log log n 0 time on-line algorithm or computing the closest pair. The algorithm is based on Bentley's logarithmic method for decomposable searching problems. It uses a non-trivial extension of fractional cascading to k -dimensional space.
