This paper presents the design and evaluation of a new sensorized underactuated self-adaptive finger. Our design incorporates a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) parallel based underactuated mechanism with an embedded load cell for contact force measurement and a trimmer potentiometer to acquire the joint variables. Integration of the sensors leads to tactile feedback fidelity without compromising the finger size and complexity which results in efficient and robust functionality. The particular rounded shape of the distal phalanx and high equilibrium position enable the finger to deliver both precision and power grasps. The effectiveness of our design is verified theoretically and through experimental results demonstrating its shape adaptability, and tactile capability.
