The integration of voice and data transmission on a CSMA/CD LAN with message priority and deterministic collision resolution is studied. As a result an efficient Stream Traffic Protocol using hybrid switching and implicit token passing is designed. The performance of the protocol both for voice and data is analysed using a discrete event simulation model. The protocol increases the system capacity for voice while the strict real-time constraints for its transmission are still met. It supports a number of subscribers comparable with the equivalent to the capacity of a small PABX, with a good performance for data. The work is part of an overall project of an integrated services LAN offering ISDN S-interfaces.
