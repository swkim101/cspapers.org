System in which the dynamical behavior evolves based on the interaction between the continuous and discrete dynamics, present in the system, are called hybrid systems. For these systems, maintenance and repair are an increasing part of the total cost of final product. Efficient diagnosis and prognosis techniques have to be adopted to detect, isolate and anticipate faults. This paper presents a novel integrated framework for diagnosis and prognosis in a hybrid dynamic system. The formalism used for hybrid diagnosis is enriched in order to be able to follow the evolution of an aging law for each faults of the system.
