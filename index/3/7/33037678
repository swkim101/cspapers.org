In this paper, the authors intruduce a control method for dynamic biped walking stabilized with trunk and waist motion. The main algorithm of this method is basad m canputing optimal time trajectories of the trunk and waist by arbitrarily giving trajectories of the foot and the ZMp(Zer0Mcment Point)tll, and an external force pattern before the mbt begins walking. To detennine the optimal tim trajectories of the trunkandwaist, theauthorsuseda performance index including the relative position of the trunk and the waist multiplied by weight coefficients. In 1987 , a bi@ walking robot -1 ZR (Was& Leg - 12 Refined) realized various gaits under rectangular external force in dynamic canplete walking stabilized with trunk and waist motion on a flat floor. 'Ihe maxb force strength duringtheseexperiments was lO[kgfl. The time spent walking was 2.6[s/stepl and the maxi." step length was 0.3tmI.
