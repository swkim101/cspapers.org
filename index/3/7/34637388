The tutorial "Software as a Service: ASP and ASP aggregation" will give an introduction and overview of the concept of "renting" access to software to customers (subscribers). Application service providers (ASPs) are enterprises hosting one or more applications and provide access to subscribers over the Internet by means of browser technology. Furthermore, the underlying technologies are discussed to enable application hosting. The concept of ASP aggregation is introduced to provide a single access point and a single sign-on capability to subscribers sub-scribing to more than one hosted application in more than one ASP.
