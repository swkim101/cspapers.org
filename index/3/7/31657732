Various typologies of technical and scientifical texts have already been proposed by authors involved in multilingual transfer problems. They were usually aimed at a better knowledge of the criteria for deciding if a document has to be or can be machine translated. Such a typology could also lead to a better knowledge of the typical errors occuring, and so lead to more appropriate post-editing, as well as to improvements in the system.Raw translations being usable, as they are quite often for rapid information needs, it is important to draw the limits between a style adequate for rapid information, and an elegant, high quality style such as required for information large dissemination. Style could be given a new definition through a linguistic analysis based on machine translation, on communication situations and on the users' requirements and satisfaction.
