The knowledge engineering bottleneck is a central problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This work addresses this problem in the context of planning systems. It automatically learns planning operators by observing expert agents and by subsequent knowledge refinement in a learning-by-doing paradigm. Our learning method is implemented on top of the PRODIGY architecture(Carbonel1
