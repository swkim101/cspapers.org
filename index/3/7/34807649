Computer history tours are a new way to educate people about our discipline and its history. We describe the introduction of such tours and their use in curriculum enrichment, outreach, and academic community-building. These tours give historical and social context to the development of topics in the curriculum, and demonstrate to students the universality of some of the principles they learn. The city of Melbourne, Australia, serves as an illustration, but computer history tours can be run in many cities of various sizes, and we give advice on how to do this.
