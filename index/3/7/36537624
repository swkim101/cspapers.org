Hydraulic, pneumatic and electrical systems form the principle power sources that have been used to operate robots in industrial environments. However, when considering the needs of advanced robotics, one of the most fundamental requirements and problems is the provision of a suitable energy source to power the robot in a nonindustrial, often remote site. This work is aimed at designing a portable power supply that will operate efficiently and effectively in an untethered environment using a chemical fuel. Initially a feasibility study was undertaken to identify the different energy sources that are most widely used in the field of industrial robots, noting their relative advantages and disadvantages. Subsequently, the report focuses on the design, implementation and testing of an internal combustion based system that will be used to provide the drive source to a compressor which in turn will produce a constant air supply via a clutch and a series of gear mechanisms. Development and application of the mobile power supply is detailed. The silencing of the system is also analysed to reduce the noise level and allow operation in an enclosed/restricted environment as well as in the open atmosphere. This chemo-pneumatic power source is subsequently shown in operation driving pneumatic muscle actuators used in the construction of a high power/weight dexterous (3 finger 1 thumb) hand.<<ETX>>
