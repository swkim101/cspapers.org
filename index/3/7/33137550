Enabling entity search and ranking at Web-scale is fraught with many challenges: annotating the corpus with entities and types, query language design, index design, query processing logic, and answer consolidation. We describe a Web-scale entity search engine we are building to handle over a billion Web pages, over 200,000 types, over 1,500,000 entities, and hundreds of entity annotations per page. We describe the design of compressed, token span oriented indices for entity and type annotations. Our prototype demonstrates the practicality of Web-scale entity-relation search.
