Although various ubicomp technologies have been proposed for home environments, few people are enjoying such technologies in their daily life, due to the lack of powerful software framework for building flexible applications for home. We are developing simple and powerful ubicomp frameworks which can be used for building furniture-embedded networked devices which fit to home environments. Using our frameworks, many devices can communicate with each other by exchanging data shared on the Web server using standard HTTP. In this paper, we describe the concepts and implementations of the frameworks, and show how sparsely-connected devices can cooperatively be used for various tasks needed in home environments.
