The last few years has seen renewed interest in teaching programming-in-the-large (PIL) and programming-in-context of a larger existing program (PIC) throughout the computer science curriculum. Although these skills have been a focus of software engineering courses and capstone projects, there is an emphasis to teach these skills in other courses across the curriculum. This paper addresses incorporation of PIL and PIC in the programming language course, and presents specific PIC and PIL projects using an interpreter for SLic, a simple logic (declarative) language. SLic itself is part of a family of interpreters in MuLE, a software environment designed to support interpreter-based projects in the programming languages course. MuLE is written in DrScheme (from Rice's PLT software project distributed under the GNU Library General Public License) and runs under Windows 95/98/NT/2000, MacOS, and Unix/X.
