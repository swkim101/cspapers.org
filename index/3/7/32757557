Smartphones are currently being used to develop diverse range of applications (apps) involving sensors. These apps generally acquire and analyze sensor data and are usually implemented as background services. The importance values of Android processes are in a hierarchy of foreground, visible, background etc. in decreasing order of importance. Whenever a new process arrives, it may necessitate removal of old and less important processes for reclaiming memory. Current smartphones do not provide any options through which user's idea of priority can override that of the system defaults. In this work we present an implementation that enables the user to obtain alerts on system load and recommendations to proactively kill a set of processes to reclaim system memory. This enables user selected background process to be spared from the standard android policy of process termination, in lieu of foreground apps, relatively unimportant from user perspective, during that period. We show that manual reclaiming of memory based on recommendations from our app, reduces the automatic killing and measurement lag experienced by a sensor analytics app under test. This work is redundant if processing power and main memory of a smartphone is always surplus than required for its normal usage.
