This paper shows experimental validation of a reflectarray element structure based on C-patch coupling through annular slot to circular patch connecting to line of variable length. The range of reflection phase is greater than 360Â° with a quasi-linear phase curve obtained by adjusting the length of line. The element configuration to work at Ku band, specifically 12 GHz, has brought out dominant results in reflection phase characteristics with acceptable reflection loss. To verify the working principle carried out in simulation, a number of reflectarray element prototypes are fabricated and measured by using waveguide simulator technique.
