The paper studies the primitivity of the eleven basic operators used in the SPARQL 1.1 query language. This paper shows that the six operators BIND, FILTER, GRAPH, property path, SELECT, and VALUES are primitive while the left five operators AND, EXISTS, MINUS, OPT, and UNION, are not primitive. It is surprised that OPT and UNION which are primitive in SPARQL 1.0 become no longer primitive in SPARQL 1.1.
