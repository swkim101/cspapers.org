This special session implements the first goal of the SIGCSE Committee on Computing and Music. It provides a venue in which the committee conveners can present their work to SIGCSE attendees and in return acquire information from others who are using music to promote learning of deep computing concepts. By describing four diverse approaches, the audience will understand the breadth of the topic and will be inspired to contribute to the effort.
