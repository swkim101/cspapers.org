● There are strong arguments to believe that objectoriented programming is easier to learn and use in creating more correct programs Kosson & Alpert, 1990]. ● Students do learn object-oriented programming environments, though the depth of that learning has been questioned and few problems that students encounter have been identified Eome & GirardoL 1991 ;Fenton & Beck, 1989;Nielsen, Frehr, et al., 1991;Pugh, LaLonde, et ai., 1987]. “ One of these problems is that programmers have difficulty learning object-oriented programming if they have learned another paradigm previously CDetienne, 1990]. . A specific problem that students encounter is creating collaborative objects – students have diftlcnlty creating and understanding connections between objects [Carroll, Rosson, et ai., 1993].
