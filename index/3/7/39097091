In this paper we describe a problem solving system with a learning mechanism (Learning Arithmetic Problem Solver, LAPS), which can solve arithmetic problems written in natural languages. Since LAPS has knowledge about arithmetic problems in the form of rules, it can solve many different problems without alteration of the program. When LAPS cannot solve a given problem because of a shortage of knowledge, it asks the user how to solve the problem. According to the user's advice LAPS acquires knowledge and rules. Using these rules, LAPS can solve problems. Furthermore, LAPS can improve its performance at problem solving by synthesizing rules that are applied.
