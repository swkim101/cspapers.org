We are actively seeking to increase both the number and competitiveness of proposals to NSF's Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program. Funding for computer science education programs at NSF responds directly to the total proposal pressure, so increasing both the number of proposals and the competitiveness of those proposals increases the amount of funding NSF targets for computer science education.
