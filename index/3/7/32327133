The National Science Foundation wants STEM faculty to be able to develop projects that will succeed in attracting funding from NSF programs. For the SIGCSE Symposium audience, this probably means being successful in being funded from the CCLI program. This special session gives attendees the opportunity to learn from those who have built successful CCLI-funded projects.
