This paper describes a method of cutting off reasoning when all of the answers to a problem have been found. Briefly, the method involves keeping and maintaining information about the sizes of important sets, and using this information to determine when all of the answers to a problem have been found. We show how this information can be dynamically calculated and kept accurate in a changing world. Additional complexity is encountered when this maintenance is mixed with independent meta-level reasoning for pruning search spaces.
