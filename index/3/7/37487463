This paper proposes several vectorial operators for processing XML twig queries, which are easy to be performed and inherently efficient for both Ancestor-Descendant (A-D) and Parent-Child (P-C) relationships. We develop optimizations on the vectorial operators to improve the efficiency of answering twig queries in holistic. We propose an algorithm to answer GTP queries based on our vectorial operators.
