It is widely believed that Time Warp is prone to two potential problems: an excessive amount of wasted, rolled back computation resulting from “rollback thrashing” behaviors, and inefficient use of memory, leading to poor performance of virtual memory and/or multiprocessor cache systems. An adaptive mechanism is proposed based on the Cancelback memory management protocol that dynamically controls the amount of memory used in the simulation in order to maximize performance. The proposed mechanism is adaptive in the sense that it monitors the execution of the Time Warp program, automatically adjusts the amount of memory used to reduce Time Warp overheads (fossil collection, Cancelback, the amount of rolled back computation, etc.) to a manageable level. The mechanism is based on a model that characterizes the behavior of Time Warp programs in terms of the flow of memory buffers among different buffer pools. We demonstrate that an implementation of the adaptive mechanism on a Kendall Square Research KSR-1 multiprocessor is effective in automatically maximizing performance while minimizing memory utilization of Time Warp programs, even for dynamically changing simulation models.
