Path planning is an important issue in mobile robots. When the environment consists of obstacles, path planning is to find a collision free path for mobile robot to move from starting position to the target location. This path planning should be optimal or must be near-optimal with respect to time, distance or energy. But distance is the most commonly adopted criterion. In this paper a new approach for the representation of dynamic environment has been presented. The integration of stationary and moving obstacles is the new work presented in this paper. Uncertainty in environment estimation has been taken into account by the probabilistic reasoning technique. Occupancy or risk of the probabilistic grid representation has been estimated for each cell using sensor data.
