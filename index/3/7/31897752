Establishing and maintaining traceability links and consistency between software artifacts produced or modified in the software life-cycle are costly and tedious activities that are crucial but frequently neglected in practice. Traceability between the free text documentation associated with the development and maintenance cycle of a software system and its source code are crucial in a number of tasks such as program comprehension, software maintenance, and software verification & validation. Finally, maintaining traceability links between subsequent releases of a software system is important for evaluating relative source code deltas, highlighting effort/code variation inconsistencies, and assessing the change history. The main theme of the workshop is focused on understanding and defining the foundations for consistency and change management of software systems within the scope of artifact-to-artifact (model-to-model) traceability.The workshop will address the following issues: A formal definition of model to model traceability Traceability between artifacts and processes The semantics of traceability links Recovery of traceability links Visualization of traceability links Interoperable approaches to support traceability Traceability in emerging forms of software engineering including production lines, frameworks, components, etc..The goals of the workshop are to: Broaden awareness within the software engineering community of the potential for the application of traceability Facilitate the exchange of ideas and interaction between international researchers Define open research problems faced in realizing usable approaches for traceability Construct a foundation of materials for future research on traceability .For more information please visit the workshop web site is: http://re.cs.depaul.edu/tefse05/.
