In this paper we review the recent results on the impact of concurrency control (CC) on distributed database system (DDBS). Then we introduce a classification for CC mechanisms. Finally we qualitatively analyse the dependencies among DDBS system, CC and workload (or application) parameters and their impact on DDBS performance. The purpose of such analysis is to provide an understanding of DDBS design problems and to explain recent and seemingly contradictory results on the effect of CC on DDBS performance.
