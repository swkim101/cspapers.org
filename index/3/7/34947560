Highly interconnected networks with amazingly complex topology describe systems as diverse as the World Wide Web, our cells, social systems or the economy. Recent studies indicate that these networks are the result of self-organizing processes governed by simple but generic laws, resulting in architectural features that makes them much more similar to each other than one would have expected by chance. I will discuss the amazing order characterizing our interconnected world and its implications to network robustness and spreading processes. Finally, most of these networks are driven by the temporal patterns characterizing human activity. I will use communication and web browsing data to show that there is deep order in the temporal domain of human dynamics, and discuss the different ways to understand and model the emerging patterns.
