Localization of small wireless sensor devices, with the deployment of the minimal infrastructure or hardware, has been the topic of significant research over the past few years. We have developed the Robust Extended Kalman Filter (REKF) localization system [1], which enables a mobile, data gathering robot to localize static sensor devices, by combining the RSSI data received from the motes, with estimates of its trajectory. The REKF localization system is particularly well suited to delay-tolerant sensor networks, where node positions need not be known in real time. We have observed accuracies ranging from approximately 30cm to 1m in practice.
