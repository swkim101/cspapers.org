The development of Grid infrastructure within High Energy Physics is a highly collaborative, highly distributed and dynamic enterprise. Developing the LCG (Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid) at CERN involves coordinating the actions of a huge range of people of different culture, education and skill, all working within different institutions around the globe. Vital in this enterprise are the ability to share knowledge about the project, and to support innovating new technology and new work practices. In part, this is achieved by careful attention to developing a sense of community among participants, and through constructing a range of repositories of information about the project, the people, the grid itself and its performance.
