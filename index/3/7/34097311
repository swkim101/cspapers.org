Conduct of scientific and engineering research is becoming critically dependent on effective management of scientific and engineering data and technical information. The rapid advances in scientific instrumentation, computer and communication technologies enable the scientists to collect, generate, process, and share unprecedented volumes of data. For example, the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) has the task to manage the data from NASAâ€™s Earth science research satellites and field measurement programs, and other data essential for the interpretation of these measurements in support of global change research. Apart from being able to handle a stream of 1 terabyte of data daily by the year 2000, EOSDIS will also need to provide transparent access to heterogeneous data held in the archives of several US government agencies, organizations and countries. A single graphical user interface employing the Global Change Master Directory needs to help users locate data sets of interest among massive and diverse data sets, or find the appropriate data analysis tools, regardless of their location. Another major international effort in the area of human genome research faces some similar, as well as unique issues due to the complexity of the genome data, special querying requirements and much more heterogeneous collections of data. Scientific databases can be viewed as critical repositories of knowledge, both existing and yet to be dis-
