In this paper, we propose an abstracted and simplified model for the famous game StarCraft, and design a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the building order problem, which takes minimal time to achieve a specific target. In addition, Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used to find an optimal target for the opening stage.
