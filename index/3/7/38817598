The goal of the Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE) Project at OISE is to build (a) an instructional theory driven by cognitive science research into collaborative learning processes and expert knowledge organization and (b) a collaborative educational hypermedia system. The design of the system is based on the theory, and in turn provides support for classroom experiments to test its predictions. Every school day for the last six years, two classes of grade five and six public elementary school students have been using the CSILE System prototype as a tool to support deep understanding of their usual curriculum. In the last three years, we have also introduced the system in classrooms with students from grades one to four and seven to thirteen.
