We describe the MIZAR Computer Assisted Reasoning system. Several versions of MIZAR are currently implemented with varying powers of expressiveness and proof analysis. The main use of MIZAR has thus far been in mathematics education. Evolving versions of MIZAR have been under development for the past decade; consequently the system has been subjected to extensive testing. Several experiments connected with the preparation of mathematics research papers have also been carried out. The naturalness and readability of MIZAR texts is demonstrated by example. A proof scanning facility that modularly splits into a proof structure analyzer and inference checker is described. We discuss our use of the facility in teaching undergraduate discrete mathematics for computer science.
