This paper presents an approach for decentralized motion planning for multiple mobile robots operating in a common 2D environment with unknown stationary obstacles. Each robot is capable of translatory motion and is equipped with range sensors which allow it to sense surrounding objects. Each robot knows its current position, is able to distinguish a robot from an obstacle, and can assess the instantaneous motion of any robot it can sense. Other than this, the robot has no knowledge about the scene, or of the paths or objectives of other robots; there is no mutual communication among the robots. No constraints are imposed on the paths or shapes of robots and obstacles. Each robot plans its path toward its target dynamically, based on its current position and sensory feedback. Given the assumptions of incomplete information and decentralized planning, the suggested heuristic algorithm demonstrates a remarkable robustness and ability for successful decentralized real-time motion planning in an unknown complex environment.<<ETX>>
