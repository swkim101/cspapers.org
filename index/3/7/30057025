A task force of the Pre-College Committee of the Education Board of the ACM has been working on a proposal for a high school course in computer science since 1989. Three drafts have been distributed to reviewem throughout the country and the world. The task force identified seven areas to be included in such a course. The seven areas are: Algorithms Programming Languages Operating Systems and User Support Computer Architecture Social, Etilcal, and Professional Context Computer Applications Advanced Applications A list of topics is given for each area. These are divided into those essential for all coutxes, those recommended for inclusion but not essential, and optional topics. In addition, the task force recognized a spectrum of delivery methods, ranging from a concentration on applications to a concentration on intensive programming. The models include Applications based Breadth approach using applications and programming modules Breadth approach intenveaving applications, computer science topics, and programming Project development approach using a programming language Apprenticeship model Advanced placement (AP) computer science. Course descriptions and syllabi are included as appendices to the report. From the comments received from reviewers and those expressed at previous panels and workshops, the need for such a course seems clear. High school teachers in particular welcomed thk effort. However, the task force recognizes the barriers that may hinder the implementation of such a course and continues to work on solutions.
