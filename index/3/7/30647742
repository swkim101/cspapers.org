In this demonstration, we implement and deploy a solar-powered wireless sensor network in an outdoor carpark to provide parking guidance to motorists. Combining energy harvesting, multi-hop opportunistic routing and adaptive duty-cycling technologies, the system provides low-cost, real-time, sustainable and eco-friendly operation. We make use of solar energy harvesting sources to power our wireless vehicle detection sensor nodes. Upon detecting the presence of a car, this information is transmitted via a multi-hop wireless network to a base station, before being forwarded to the central server for information dissemination to motorists. We will display, in real-time, the variance in the duty cycle and energy level according to the time of day throughout the conference period. For similar demos we typically provide both a live video stream and real-time sensor data from the carpark, displayed on desktop web browsers and mobile devices, so that visitors can see parking lot occupancy data in real-time and compare it with a live video feed, but due to the time difference between Singapore and Seattle, we will be showing a video recording instead.
