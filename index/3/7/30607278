It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 42nd ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, POPL 2015, held in Mumbai, India, at the beautiful Tata Institute for Fundamental Research. This year's program consists of 52 papers drawn from the 227 papers originally submitted at the July 2014 paper deadline. These papers cover a wide range of topics stretching from theoretical foundations concerning the lambda calculus, type theory and verification to applications in security, networking, and web programming. The program also features invited talks from Peter Buneman, Sumit Gulwani and Peter Lee.
