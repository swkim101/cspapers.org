Force and tactile feedback greatly enhance the interaction of virtual environment applications. A simple haptic display that has very high frequency response of the force feedback was developed. The simple haptic display presents force feedback and also vibrotactile information. In the design over view, we propose the categorization of the object presentation data and the data format. We calculated some of these patterns, including tactile and temperature data. The frequency response of the haptic display was examined. Then the experiments of the vibrotactile presentation at contact with wood and aluminum were presented. A method of surface roughness presentation was also investigated. Results showed that the simple haptics display provide sufficient frequency response for presenting the vibrotactile information at contact and perceiving a surface roughness of virtual objects.
