This paper provides a utility to find out the LTI model of an aircraft at any given operating point. The previous work provides only the spot linear models. The linear models obtained through the numerical approach does not provide real dynamics of this sort of nonlinear models. The core of this paper is about analytical approach based on perturbation theory for linear model .The validity of the model is realized by the linear viz non-linear behavior about the operating point over which the perturbations were applied. The spot model verification strengthens the validity of the linearization framework which can be further used for determining the structure of the parametric uncertainty for an aircraft model.
