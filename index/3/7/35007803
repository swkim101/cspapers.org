The foundations of a class of logic programming systems with the expressive power of full first-order logic and a non-monotonic component is addressed. The underlying refutation method is an extended version of weak model elimination. The first question addressed is how to compute answers with weak model elimination when queries and programs are sets of arbitrary clauses, which is completely settled by a soundness and completeness result. The question of computing only definite answers is also settled. Then, the problem of computing answers is rediscussed when the logic programs also include a finite set of defaults.
