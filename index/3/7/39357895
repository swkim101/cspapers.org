Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) consists of, given a sentence, detecting basic event structures such as "who" did "what" to "whom", "when" and "where". From a linguistic point of view, a key component of the task corresponds to identifying the semantic arguments filling the roles of the sentence predicates. Typical predicate semantic arguments include Agent, Patient, and Instrument, but semantic roles may also be found as adjuncts (e.g., Locative, Temporal, Manner, and Cause). The identification of such event frames holds potential for significant impact in many NLP applications, such as Information Extraction, Question Answering, Summarization and Machine Translation.
