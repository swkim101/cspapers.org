Recent years have seen extensive diversification of the "underground economy" associated with malware and the subversion of Internet-connected systems. This trend towards specialization has compelling forces driving it: miscreants readily apprehend that tackling the entire value-chain from malware creation to monetization in the presence of ever-evolving countermeasures poses a daunting task requiring highly developed skills and resources. As a result, entrepreneurial-minded miscreants have formed pay-per-install (PPI) services--specialized organizations that focus on the infection of victims' systems. 
 
In this work we perform a measurement study of the PPI market by infiltrating four PPI services. We develop infrastructure that enables us to interact with PPI services and gather and classify the resulting malware executables distributed by the services. Using our infrastructure, we harvested over a million client executables using vantage points spread across 15 countries. We find that of the world's top 20 most prevalent families of malware, 12 employ PPI services to buy infections. In addition we analyze the targeting of specific countries by PPI clients, the repacking of executables to evade detection, and the duration of malware distribution.
