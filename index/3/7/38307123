The MESA subsystem provides a wide variety of services to remotely located users of the computing facilities of the Purdue University Computing Center. This paper presents the preliminary steps of an in-depth study into the behavior of MESA. The study uses a software data-gathering facility to analyze the usage and queueing aspects of this behavior and to provide values for parameters used by two models of the subsystem. These models, a network-of-queues model and a simulation model, are designed to project subsystem behavior in different operating environments. The paper includes a number of tables and figures which highlight the results, so far, of the study.
