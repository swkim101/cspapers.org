Recently, the Ultra-Wideband Multi-Input Multi-Output technique has draw the intention of many researchers as it is very promising for high data rate wireless communication systems. In this paper, a new ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna with the size of 15 mm × 26 mm × 1.6 mm is proposed. The antenna works as a magnetic dipole and has the working bandwidth from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz with VSWR ≤ 2. The antenna parameters such as radiation pattern, maximal gain are also investigated.
