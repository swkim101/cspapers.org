This paper presents and discusses a modified approach to teaching an algorithms and data structures course (CS4). The approach relies on frequent evaluation of student understanding of course content and enables the instructor to experiment with various exercises to facilitate peer-instruction and cooperative learning. It uses a web application called MessageGrid which enables instructor and students, each of whom has a laptop computer with wireless access to the web, to interact in a variety of ways both in and out of class.
