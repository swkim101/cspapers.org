Open educational resources - assignments, labs, course notes, and other types of materials made available for anyone interested in using them - have the potential to have a significant positive impact on courses and students at many institutions. Distribution and use of course materials is also an important factor in encouraging the adoption and use of innovative teaching practices. However, the use of open resources is still somewhat uncommon, with most instructors preferring to use their own materials. This BoF will bring together providers and users of open educational resources to pose the following questions: Who is using open resources? Who isn't using open resources? How could open resources, and the repositories where they are made available, better meet the needs of potential users? What is necessary to make sharing of educational resources easier and more effective? Are there inherent barriers to sharing and reuse, and how can they be overcome?
