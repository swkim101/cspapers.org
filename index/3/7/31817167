Solar energy is slated to be an important energy source for reducing dependence in fossil fuels. Past few years have seen unprecedented deployments of solar energy in many countries of the developed world. However, solar energy uptake in developing countries is rather slow. This is particularly true for solar energy installations on buildings. Since buildings consume more than 40% of energy, it is important that greener buildings are encouraged through on-site production of renewable energy [2]. However, limited possibility of energy buyback programs in developing countries is one of the reason for less solar deployments. Also, in some countries the electricity infrastructure is so fragile that energy buyback programs at smaller scale are not feasible. Therefore, if the building owners like to go green then huge battery banks are needed to make the best use of solar energy. But battery banks add quite a bit of cost to the overall solar energy infrastructure in buildings. This extra upfont and maintenance cost is one of the reasons that hampers the growth of solar on buildings. Hybrid solar energy systems are used when energy buyback programs are available [1]. In this work we make a case that traditional hybrid solar energy deployments are not feasible for places without energy buyback programs. Instead we propose an idea of a solar energy system for buildings
