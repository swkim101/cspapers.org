Digital Equipment Corporation has recently developed a new PDP-11 operating system called IASâ€”Interactive Application System. Since the system was to be significantly different from existing PDP-11 systems, customers and DEC field personnel had little information about the kinds of load it would handle or what level of performance could be expected. The work reported in this paper had the objective of producing such information prior to the release of the product. The major goal was to produce a set of guidelines indicating the kinds of loads that could be handled within limits of acceptable performance by various IAS configurations. The guidelines had to be in terms understandable to salesmen and customers. At the same time they had to be based on technically sound performance measurements that could be precisely explained and repeated.
 Our approach to this problem was to characterize each hardware configuration in terms of the users that it could support while meeting specific response time criteria.
