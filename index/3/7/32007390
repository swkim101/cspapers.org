In this paper we present a system for cross-lingual information retrieval, which can handle tens of languages and millions of documents. Functioning of the system is demonstrated on corpus of European Legislation (22 languages, more than 400,000 documents per language). The system uses an interactive web-interface, which can take advantage of a predefined thesaurus allowing the user to dynamically re-rank the retrieval results based on the mapping onto a predefined thesaurus.
