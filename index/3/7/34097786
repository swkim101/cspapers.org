This paper proposed a road map production system model using bidirectional search algorithm. The model enable a mobile robot to navigate an environment effectively and be able to execute a high level command such as "go from station I (STI) to station 2 (ST2)". The search algorithm yields the shortest path solution. In the event of unexepeted occurrences such as obstruction of the shortest path, the model would enable the robot to quickly search for the shortest alternative path from its current position to its destination. The system can readily adapt to a dynamically changing road map.
