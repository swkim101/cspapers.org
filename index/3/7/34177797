In order to support access for people who are blind to modes of transportation in the city, it is necessary to design technological tools that allow them to carry out activities safely, autonomously, and functionally. In this context, three mobile orientation and mobility support systems were designed for people who are blind to aid in their effective navigation using various modes of transportation in the city of Santiago, Chile. This work presents the most significant implications of the use of these systems.
