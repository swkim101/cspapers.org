Ontology like any other source of knowledge need to be updated for a bid to adapt the new requirements. Thus, the need for an evolution through temporal versioning is lend itself. This requires a mechanism to implement version management and to identify the links between them. The approach developed in this work allows the management of temporal versioning by preserving the traceability of changes and by applying relevance criteria to the various versions. The relevance is computed based on four criteria: conceptualization, usage frequency, abstraction and completeness. This approach is implemented in a tool dubbed Consistology, which has been developed to assist users in expressing adaptation requirements and managing ontology versions.
