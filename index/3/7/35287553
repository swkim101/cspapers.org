Since the first public release in 2001, there have been well over 160,000 downloads of the Open Source Cluster Application Resources (OSCAR) software stack. OSCAR is a self-extracting cluster configuration, installation, maintenance, and operation suite consisting of "best known practices" for cluster computing. This BoF will be a focal point for the OSCAR community at SC06 where both developers and users may gather to discuss the "current state" as well as future directions for the OSCAR software stack.
