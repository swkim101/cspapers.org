This paper describes the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), which has been suggested as an alternative to the Turing Test and as a means of measuring progress in commonsense reasoning. A competition based on the WSC has been organized and announced to the AI research community. The WSC is of special interest to the AI applications community and we encourage its members to participate.
