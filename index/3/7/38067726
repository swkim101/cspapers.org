Although many formalisms have been developed for reasoning about normative behaviour, most of these have been somewhat divorced from real systems. That is, while they allow the specification of what is obligatory or permissible, there is often no direct mapping to concrete computational systems, and so no way of really being able to tell (for example) whether a system respects or violates some system of norms. In this paper, we introduce the Simple Normative Systems Language, a concrete computational language for defining normative systems that has a concrete interpretation with respect to Reactive Modules, a well-known and widely used language for defining multi-agent systems. We introduce and formally define the language, briefly investigate some of its properties, and illustrate its use by means of an example.
