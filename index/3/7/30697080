The purpose of this panel is to discuss the creation and implementation of a data science degree program at the undergraduate level. The panel includes representatives from three different universities that each offers an undergraduate degree in Data Science as of fall 2013. We plan to share information on the logistics of how the data science programs came to exist at each of our schools as well as encourage a robust interactive discussion about the future of data science education at the undergraduate level.
