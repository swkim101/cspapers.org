This paper describes those MP features that Bull and IBM together introduced into the AIX operating system to support the Symmetric Multiprocessor machine marketed by Bull under the Escala name and by IBM under the RS/6000 Models G30, J30 and R30 names. The PowerPC architecture and the AIX operating system present some specific challenges. We present the major problems encountered and how they were solved.
