The 7th ACM International Workshop on Cyber Security Analytics, Intelligence and Automation (SafeConfig) is held as part of ACM Computer and Communications Security CCS 2014. SafeConfig 14, following many successful preceding workshops, is concerned with developing new security techniques and approaches that offer proactive, intelligent and a holistic security analytics based on analyzing the system artifacts including system traces, configurations, logs, incident reports, alarms and network traffic. Scalable analytics techniques are essential to handle large volumes of data and to normalize, model, integrate, analyze and respond to threats in real time.
