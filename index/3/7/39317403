Interactive information visualization is an emerging and powerful research technique that can be used to understand models of language and their abstract representations. Much of what computational linguists fall back upon to improve NLP applications and to model language "understanding" is structure that has, at best, only an indirect attestation in observable data. An important part of our research progress thus depends on our ability to fully investigate, explain, and explore these structures, both empirically and relative to accepted linguistic theory. The sheer complexity of these abstract structures, and the observable patterns on which they are based, usually limits their accessibility --- often even to the researchers creating or attempting to learn them.
