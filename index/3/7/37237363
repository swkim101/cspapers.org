This tutorial consists of four parts. Part I starts with a brief introduction to different bases for discourse structuring, properties of discourse structure that are relevant to LT, and accessible evidence for discourse structure. For discourse structure to be useful for language technologies, one must be able to automatically recognize or generate with it. Hence, Part II surveys computational approaches to recognizing and generating discourse structure, both manuallyauthored approaches and ones developed through Machine Learning. Part III of the tutorial describes applications of discourse structure recognition and generation in LT, as well as discourse-related resources being made available in English, German, Turkish, Hindi, Czech, Arabic and Chinese. Part IV concludes with a list of future possibilities.
