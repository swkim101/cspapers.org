The U. S. Bureau of the Census is currently addressing a three-part data management problem. The first aspect of the problem is size. We have multiple data bases that come both from our censuses and from our recurring surveys. Our data bases now comprise a tape library of over 200,000 magnetic tape reels which represent over 900 billion characters of data. The activity against the data bases is such that over 5000 tape reels (ten tons of tape) are mounted each day.
