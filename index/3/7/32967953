A multiple vehicle robot system for cooperative object manipulation is described. This system consists of a host and several distributed behavior-based vehicle robot agents. A strategy on cooperatively organizing the behavior-based robots which only have limited ability in manipulation is discussed. An extended subsumption architecture, which has some layers for manipulation and cooperation, is built for each vehicle robot. A simulator and some simulation results are also shown.<<ETX>>
