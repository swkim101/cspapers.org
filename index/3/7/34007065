The system on a chip (SoC) market segment is driven by rapid TTM (time to market), OS scalability, and efficiency. This requires the SW stack to be designed with TTM, scalability and efficiency as first order design constraints. In this paper we propose a layered modular architecture for SoC drivers to enable aggressive driver code reuse between OSes and platforms. This cuts SW development, validation, integration, and maintenance effort. We then discuss the implementation of such an architecture in a media driver that is highly reusable across SoCs in different market segments and operating systems.
