Let me begin by saying how honored I am to receive the Gerard Salton Award from SIGIR. His pioneering work, including the vector space model, term weightings, relevance feedback, and the development and evaluation of automatic text retrieval systems, defined and shaped the field in important ways. I did not have many opportunities to interact directly with Gerry Salton, although our paths did cross in interesting ways. Shortly after I started working at Bell Labs, I was introduced to the field of information retrieval by Michael Lesk, who had worked with Gerry at Harvard in the mid-1960s to develop the original SMART system. The last conference at which I interacted with Gerry was not SIGIR or TREC, as one might expect, but rather CHI 1995, where he spoke at panel entitled, Browsing vs. search: Can we find a synergy? ’, a theme to which I return. Following the tradition of previous recipients of the Salton Award (Gerard Salton (1983), Karen Spärck Jones (1988), Cyril Cleverdon (1991), William Cooper (1994), Tefko Saracevic (1997), Stephen Robertson (2000), W. Bruce Croft (2003), and C. J. “Keith” van Rijsbergen (2006)), I present a personal reflection on information retrieval. I begin with some remarks on the problems that have motivated my research in the area for almost three decades, and the approaches that I have taken to address them. I conclude by identifying, what I believe to be, some important opportunities to continue to extend and improve information retrieval moving forward.
