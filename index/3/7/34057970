ISKODOR integrates personal collections, peer search, and centralized search services. User modeling in ISKODOR fills three roles: discovery of sites with suitable information stores, context-based query interpretation, and automatic profile-based filtering of new information. Explanation and control are achieved through graphical depiction of sources, explicit feedback regard ingutility, and explicit control over peer association behavior and information sharing.
