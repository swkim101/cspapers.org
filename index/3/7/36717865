The ability to accurately profile energy consumption is of great importance for energy management in low-power devices. This work presents a novel energy profiling architecture by combining the high-speed CPLD bus signaling capability of mPlatform with the smart TwinStar power board. By running mPlatform under different modes, we are able to utilize an MMSE estimator to analyze per-component energy consumption rates with sufficient accuracy. In our experiment, we use the profiling results to determine the working condition of individual components, as well as the hardware configuration of the sensor node.
