Recently, there has been significant research interest in homogeneous modular robots that can transform (i.e. reconfigure their overall shape). However, many of the proposed transformation mechanisms are too expensive and complex to be practical. The transformation process is also normally slow, and therefore the mechanisms are not suitable for situations where frequent, quick reconfiguration is required. To solve these problems, we have studied a transformable mobile robot composed of multiple homogeneous gear-type units. Each unit has only one actuator and cannot move independently. But when engaged in a swarm configuration, units are able to move rapidly by rotating around one another. The most important problem encountered when developing our multi-module robot was determining how units should join together. We designed a passive attachment mechanism that employs a single, six-pole magnet carried by each unit. Motion principles for the swarm were confirmed in simulation, and based on these results we constructed a series of hardware prototypes. In our teleoperation experiments we verified that a powered unit can easily transfer from one stationary unit to another, and that the swarm can move quickly in any direction while transforming.
