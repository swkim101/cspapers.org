A pivoting jaw retaining means for a yarn-type wet mop head, the main parts of which may be integrally moulded from appropriate plastic material and which has few moving parts. The retaining means has an elongated body provided with opposite spaced first and second terminal extensions downwardly extending from the ends of the body. One end of the jaw is pivotably secured to the lower free end of the first extension. The other end of the jaw and the inside surface of the lower end of the second extension are provided with releasably co-operating engagement means. When in engaged position the jaw and the body are in spaced parallel orientation. The second terminal extension also extends upwardly from the corresponding end of the body. The second terminal is pivotably associated between its ends with the body for outward movement of the lower free end of the second terminal extension away from the jaw. The retaining means is further provided with a semi-rigid release bar. One end of the release bar is attached to the shank at a point spaced from the body. The other end of the release bar is attached to the upper end of the second terminal extension. Downward pressure on a part of the release bar between its ends causes deflection of the release bar to pivot the second terminal extension and consequently move the free end of the terminal extension away from the jaw to release the engagement means when in position and permit the jaw to open. Removal of that downward pressure causes the release bar and the second terminal extension to return to original positions to permit re-engagement of the engagement means when the jaw is to be closed.
