A methodology is proposed for the systematic derivation of a series of complementary specifications of a data base application. The starting point for this series is chosen so as to be obtainable without undue difficulty from an informal specification. Thereafter each formal specification is systematically derived from the preceding one. This multiplicity of specifications is further justified by their complementary nature. Having distinct aims, they jointly provide a multi-purpose, comprehensive characterization of the data base application. The formalisms employed can be categorized according to several criteria, including the usual definitional, denotational, operational characterizations of semantics. A simplified example is used throughout to illustrate the development.
