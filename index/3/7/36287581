There is a growing movement toward designing more natural user interfaces that take advantage of an individual's experiential knowledge of speech and handwriting interaction. One disadvantage of these natural interfaces is that the system may not always interpret the user input accurately. No study has attempted to determine what impact these accuracy rates have on the user's acceptance or preference of a particular application. Given that handwriting and speech have a lower input accuracy rate than keyboard input, are there certain applications that individuals would prefer not to use with either a speech or handwriting input device?
