In this era of technology, rapid advancements are being made in the field of automation and signal processing. The developments made in digital signal processing are being applied in the field of automation, communication systems and biomedical engineering. Controlling through human speech is one of the fascinating applications of digital signal processing (DSP) and Automation Systems. This paper discusses the speech recognition and its application in control mechanism. Speech recognition can be used to automate many tasks that usually require hands-on human interaction, such as recognizing simple spoken commands to perform something like turning on lights or shutting a door or driving a motor. After speech recognition, a particular code related to spoken word is transferred through wireless communication system to 8051 microcontroller and it works accordingly. Many techniques have been used to compare the pattern of the speech signals and recent technological advancements have made recognition of more complex speech patterns possible. Despite these breakthroughs, however, current efforts are still far away from 100% recognition of natural human speech. Therefore, the project is considered involving processing of a speech signal in any form as a challenging and rewarding one.
