At Hunter College, the B.A. degree in Computer Science was the work of two people, whose goals were to provide a high quality degree, with as much choice of program specialization as possible under the constraints imposed by Hunter. It was felt that the program should be structured so as to provide a useful background for obtaining a job in industry or business, for those students not intending to go on to graduate school. The City University of New York is committed to Open Enrollment which means that our students have extremely diverse academic backgrounds.
 Because of limited commitment and resources, we have been forced to rely heavily on part-time instructors. Consequently we have not been able to offer all of the advanced courses on a regular basis.
 As a result of these factors, we settled on a small program, offering two specializations, that could be covered with a minimum of full-time faculty backed up by adjuncts.
