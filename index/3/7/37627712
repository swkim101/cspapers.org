The 90 Day Challenge team set out to deliver an end-to-end Web services solution to enterprise sales agents in 90 days, with immediate plans to extend the solution to other user groups. In order to meet their commitments, the team had to reuse the same component Web services in multiple contexts. By modeling the workflows and carefully managing scope at the component level, the team developed a suite of Web services that other teams could easily incorporated into multiple projects. As a result, twelve other programs to date have incorporated Web services from the 90 Day Challenge, saving weeks of development time.
