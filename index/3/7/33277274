We put forth a multiple representation approach to deriving the behavioral model of a digital circuit automatically from its structure and the behavioral simulation models of its components. One representation supports temporal reasoning for composition and simplification, another supports simulation, and a third helps to partition the translation problem. A working prototype, FUNSTRUX, is described.
