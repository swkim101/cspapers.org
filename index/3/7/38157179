The purpose of this paper is the description of a project for a course titled “Data Communications and Computer Networks.” The project is to write a protocol that allows transmission of a file from a sender to a receiver process. The project consists of three phases culminating in a sliding window protocol. The project is of interest for several reasons. First, students write both sender and receiver and run them concurrently and asynchronously. Second, errors are introduced randomly causing transmissions from the sender to the receiver to be damaged or lost. Furthermore, the error rate can be altered. Third, no special hardware connections are required. The project is written in Pascal (although other languages such as C can be used), runs on a VAX computer, and requires a few VMS system calls. We simulate data transmissions by writing to and reading from a shared mailbox.
