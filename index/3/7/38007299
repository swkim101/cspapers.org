A classroom method for programming instruction which emphasizes the evolution of correct algorithms by try, test, repeat is presented. The method is simple, reasonably obvious, and serves to illustrate many of the concepts of introductory programming. No special equipment or background is needed.
 The objective of the introductory programming course is the introduction of the concepts and techniques of programming to the uninitiated.
 As the presentation will attempt to make clear, this method relies on demonstration, teaching-by-example, intuition, and reasonableness. The goal is the presentation of algorithms and the associated techniques and concepts as they influence and abet the design processes so vital to programming.
