The aim of this study is to validate the time delay estimators recently developed by our group. We test the estimators with the real data in both case isometric isotonic and isometric anisotonic contraction in order to take into account the stationarity and the non-stationarity of the data. The results indicate that these estimators have coherent behaviors with the law of Henneman up to 60% Maximal Voluntary Contraction(MVC) in both cases.
