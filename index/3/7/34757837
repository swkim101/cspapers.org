This paper presents the evaluation techniques and forms for implementing group-oriented database projects in a senior level database course. A management system for monitoring the design, implementation, and testing of a small production database application using the team approach serves as the focus of this paper. Emphasis is upon both time and efficiency for students and instructor. The database prototype is implemented in phase one with a relational microcomputer tool and in phase two with a relational mainframe DBMS.
