This paper introduces the theoretical framework and design rationale for an innovative undergraduate module entitled "Living and Working on the Web" at the University of Southampton. The module design is based on the principles of collaborative social learning and the co-construction of knowledge. At the workshop a model of best practice will be presented, featuring a "blog-comment-reflect-feedback" cycle, which has derived from the synthesis of relevant literature and which will be reflected upon through an informal content analysis of the students' blogs. One of the problems facing this type of curriculum innovation is the difficulties faced when scaling up such modules to very large student groups, particularly in relation to feedback and assessment. To date, the single largest cohort has been 45 students. It is therefore also the intention of the presenters to engage the attendees in a discussion of how a module such as this could be feasibly extended into far larger cohort groups.
