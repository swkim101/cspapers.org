To explore various ideas and algorithms for improving relevance of a search engine, we found it necessary to build an infrastructure to provide large-scale data management and data processing capabilities. WebStudio is an infrastructure we have constructed to provide an integrated development environment (IDE) for researchers and developers to use in quickly building prototypes and conducting experiments at Web-scale. It is also a Web data management system to allow users to easily store, access, and manipulate Web data.
