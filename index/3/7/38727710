We propose the concept of the "Internet of Haptics" (IoH) that enables sharing experiences of others with the sense of touch. IoH allows to multicast haptic sensation from one Sensor-Node (Inter-Node) to multiple Actuator-Node (Ceive-Node) and to multicast from multiple Inter-Node to multiple Ceive-Node via the Internet. As a proof of concept, we developed the "HaptI/O" device which is a physical network node that can perform as a gateway to input or output the haptic information to/from the human body or tangible objects. We use the WebRTC as the baseline protocol for communication. Users can gain access IoH Web using a smartphone or PC and experience the haptic sensation by selecting the Inter-Node and Ceive-Node from a web browser. Multiple HaptI/O would be connected on the IoH server and transmit the haptic information from one node to multiple nodes as well as one to one mutual connection so that HaptI/O enables us to share our experiences with the sense of touch.
