This talk is informed by the concepts of computational reflection including reflective architectures, causal connections, and the definitions of these concepts in an object-oriented setting, and by an effort to radically rethink the human-machine interactive experience. The latter effort endeavors to design interfaces that are more immersive, more intelligent, and more interactive, and by doing so to change the human-machine relationship and to create systems that are more responsive to people's needs and actions and that become true "accessories" for expanding our minds.
