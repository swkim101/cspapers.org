Ubiquitous robotics, ambient Intelligence and cloud robotics are new research topics that start to gain popularity among the robotics community. The overlap that exists now between ubirobots and AmI makes their integration together within cloud computing valuable to create a hybrid physical-digital space rich with myriad of proactive intelligent services that enhance the quality and the way of our living and working. Indeed, there is no visible cooperation or synergies between ubiquitous computing and robots communities. This paper presents a workshop that is intended to facilitate discussions and build a bridge between these communities. Moreover we hope that satellite topics such as affective computing, semantic reasoning, and humancomputer interaction will enhance such discussions and foster the research in this area. We believe that both communities can learn and benefit from their mutual experiences.
