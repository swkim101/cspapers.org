Design conditions for existence of a static output feedback control for one class of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy continuous-time systems are presented in the paper. Embracing the property of H2 norm, a treated procedure, defined by the set of linear matrix inequalities and equalities, is provided for computation of the gain matrix of the control law realized in direct output structure. The approach is illustrated on an example, demonstrating validity of the proposed method.
