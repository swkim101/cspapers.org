It has become obvious that the Orange Book (TCSEC), is incomplete; integrity and availability are only touched upon. The Orange Book focuses much of its emphasis on disclosure (confidentiality) of data and little to unauthorized modification (integrity) of data. The Canadian Systems Security Centre has begun efforts to create a 'Made in Canada' Orange Book. The Canadian trusted computer product evaluation criteria, is an attempt to address those areas which were not (or were insufficiently) addressed in the US TCSEC. The Canadian criteria is not a definitive answer but an evolutionary step towards incorporation of the requirements of a computer-using community. >
