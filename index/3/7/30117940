This paper presents some complexity results for deductive recognition in the framework of languages such as KL-ONE. In particular. it focuses on classification operations that are usually performed in these languages through subsumption computations. The paper presents a simple language that encompasses and extends earlier KL-ONE-based recognition frameworks. By relying on parsing algorithms. the paper shows that a significant class of recognition problems in this language can be performed in polynomial time. This is in marked contrast to the exponentiality and undecidability results that have recently been obtained for subsumption in even some of the most restricted variants of KL-ONE.
