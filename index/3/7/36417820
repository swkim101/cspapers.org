In this paper, we present a method of management of a dynamic scene using octrees. The use of octrees in image rendering in 3D space is suitable as the octree is essentially a tree data structure in three dimensions. Most such methods resort to modification - namely, resizing and rebuilding - of the nodes of the tree used in order to accomplish the desired results. The main concern in such an approach is to minimize, or preferably, avoid resizing of nodes during runtime, as it takes a great toll on system resources. Here we present an algorithm that completely avoids resizing of nodes, hence achieving greater efficiency. This aspect of the algorithm is also borne out by the experimental conclusions we have obtained.
