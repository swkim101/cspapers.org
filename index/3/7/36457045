Rhythms guide our lives. Our biological clocks tell us when we need to sleep, eat and wake. But our use of technology can interrupt and obstruct these rhythms, making it difficult for our bodies to get what they need to stay healthy and balanced. Our MoodRhythm app helps individuals to live a more naturally rhythmic day. The key goals of MoodRhythm are to use patients' smartphones to actively and passively track daily rhythms and to provide affective feedback that can help patients to maintain a regular daily rhythm, while feeding this clinically valuable information back to their physicians.
