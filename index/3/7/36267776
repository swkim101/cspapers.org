The idea of photometric stereo is to determine the surface orientation of the points of an object in a picture using several views of an object taken with varying illumination, but from the same viewing direction. We can implement this method using reflectance map techniques. In order to calculate the reflectance map, we consider primarily the specular compenent of surface reflectance, since most industrial materials are very specular. The technique has been demonstrated by experiment.
