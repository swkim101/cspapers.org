In this paper, an ultra-wideband (UWB) bandpass filter with a frequency notch is designed and implemented. The proposed filter is based on coupled Microstrip line with U-shaped defected ground structure (DGS). By introducing Embedded Open Stubs (EOS) into input and output feed lines, the UWB bandpass filter can get a band-notched characteristic at the appointed frequency band. Several compensatory lines are introduced to compensate the damage bringing by EOS. The test results show that 3 dB pass-band is from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. The depth of the frequency notch is about âˆ’30dB at 5.8 GHz, which is deep enough to choke back interference from other wireless communication systems operating at the same frequency. The insertion loss in the pass-band is less than 1 dB (including the insertion loss of two SMA connectors).
