The second ACM workshop on cloud data management is held in Denver, Colorado, USA on October 12, 2015 and co-located with the ACM 22nd Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The main idea of moving-target defense (MTD) is to impose an asymmetric disadvantage on attackers by making systems dynamic and therefore harder to explore and predict. This workshop seeks to bring together researchers from academia, government, and industry to report on the latest research efforts on moving-target defense, and to have productive discussion and constructive debate on this topic. We have constructed an exciting program of 12 referred papers and two invited keynote talks that will give participants a comprehensive view of emerging research.
