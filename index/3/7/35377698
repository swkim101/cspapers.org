One recent change in software development is developers starting to take responsibility for the quality of their work by writing and executing automated tests. As with any new activity, there is a wide range of ways to perform this task. DevCreek collects, aggregates, and displays testing activity for individuals, teams, and the developer community as a whole. The goal is to provide individuals with global norms with which they can compare their testing. This demonstration will show the data collection, real-time feed-back, and aggregate reporting facilities within DevCreek. We will exercise our Eclipse plug-in during a short, live development session.
