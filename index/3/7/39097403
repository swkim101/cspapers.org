The organization of a programming service course is described. The objective is combining high instructional quality with economic use of departmental resources. With undergraduate tutors who help in the classroom as well as in consulting sessions and with the help of an automatic grading system, it was possible to lower the cost to about $7 per student credit hour (quarter system) without sacrificing instructional quality. Some results obtained by automatic monitoring of the student's work on programming assignments and by interviews and questionnaires are given to back the above claim.
