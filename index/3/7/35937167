Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers many benefits, including unsurpassed soft-tissue characterization and the ability to combine detection and biopsy into a single procedure. However, limited patient access in the narrow scanner bore requires tedious iterative positioning or use of robotic assistants that isolate the physician from the patient. As an alternative, we present a teleoperation technology for percutaneous procedures to meet the needs of interventional radiologists and overcome challenges imposed by the MR environment. The technology is demonstrated for a 1-DOF needle insertion procedure. The technology uses rolling diaphragms, a clutch, and a cable-capstan drive to propel the needle while relaying forces and motions to the operator. The system demonstrates excellent position tracking (< 0.7Â° error in the unloaded case) and reliably transmits changes in force. During needle teleoperation, users were able to detect light membrane punctures and differentiate spring stiffnesses nearly as accurately as by hand manipulation.
