The paper presents a technical solution for manually making replication of sculptures in real material from a numerical representation of the original work. This solution is based on a human centered system that provides an alternative to current techniques used in the art domain. This paper is focused on the presentation of the main capabilities of the system: functional and hardware characteristics, techniques for computer aided gesture.
