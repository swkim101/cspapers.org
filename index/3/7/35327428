We define the concept of the representative basic for interesting association rules, and an inference system which is purely qualitative. The representative basis is unique, and minimal with respect to (wrt) the inference system. On the representative basis, the inference system is correct and complete. Experimental results show that the number of rule in the representative basis is significantly reduced wrt the number of rules generated by other existing approaches.
