In this paper we propose a new testbed architecture that combines hardware network devices with virtual emulation test environment to improve scalability, flexibility and accuracy. The testbed enables to design and experiment new concepts for energy-efficient data center. It is based on OpenFlow, a Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology that facilitates the deployment of energy-aware protocols and mechanisms.
