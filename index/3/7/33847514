Most existing methods convert UFS to supervised learning problem by generating labels with specific techniques (e.g., spectral analysis, matrix factorization and linear predictor). Instead, we proposed a novel coupled analysis-synthesis dictionary learning method, which is free of generating labels. The representation coefficients are used to model the cluster structure and data distribution. Specifically, the synthesis dictionary is used to reconstruct samples, while the analysis dictionary analytically codes the samples and assigns probabilities to the samples. Afterwards, the analysis dictionary is used to select features that can well preserve the data distribution.Â The effective L2p-norm (0 < p <1) regularization is imposed on the analysis dictionary to get much sparse solution and is more effective in feature selection.We proposed an iterative reweighted least squares algorithm to solve the L2p-norm optimization problem and proved it can converge to a fixed point. Experiments on benchmark datasets validated the effectiveness of the proposed method
