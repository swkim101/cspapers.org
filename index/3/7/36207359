This paper proposes a design method of a support tool for detection and diagnosis of failures in discrete event systems (DES). The design of this diagnoser goes through three phases: an identification phase and finding paths and temporal parameters of the model describing the two modes of normal and faulty operation, a detection phase provided by the comparison and monitoring time operation and a location phase based on the combination of the temporal evolution of the parameters and thresholds exceeded technique. Our contribution lays in the application of this technique in the presence of faults arising simultaneously, sensors and actuators. The validation of the proposed approach is illustrated in a filling system through a simulation.
