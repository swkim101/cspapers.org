1. SUMMARY Many CS instructors are embracing MOOCs by creating their own course offering on one of the major MOOC platforms. Along with MOOCs has come a debate about their effect on academia. But rather than discussing MOOCs as a stand-alone entity, we want to discuss the usage of MOOCs to augment normal lecture classes. In such cases, instructors are supplementing their live lectures with on-line lectures which are often produced by leading experts of the field. Fox refers to these as SPOCs: small private online courses [1].
