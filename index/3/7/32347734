Presents an abstract model of an autonomous agent that integrates reactive and cognitive behaviour. The authors state three requirements (reactivity, timely behaviour, and symbolic representation) that should be accomplished by such an integration. Due to the fact that there exists no model up to now that covers all three aspects, the authors present an abstract model of an autonomous agent that does meet these requirements. To the modules of knowledge representation, planning, scheduling, and execution, the authors add the process of evaluation that constantly supervises the environment and the agent's actions in order to ensure the agent's reactivity. To validate the proposed model, the authors discuss an implementation in a complex robot scenario.<<ETX>>
