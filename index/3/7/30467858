MS Read is a prototype application implemented as an extension of the Web Browser that creates an evolving model of the users topic of interest. It uses that model to analyze documents that are accessed while searching and browsing the Web. In the presented version of MS Read the model is used to highlight topic related terminology in the documents. 
MS Read model of the user need is created by applying natural language processing to search queries captured within the Browser and to topic descriptions explicitly provided by the user while browsing and reading documents. It is semantically enhanced using linguistic and custom knowledge resources.
