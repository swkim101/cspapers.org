It is very difficult to calculate analytically the BER of M-QAM systems under the effect of nonlinear distortion caused by the nonlinear transmit high power amplifier (HPA). By introducing a model of the system in which the HPA is followed by the Tx filter, a procedure for estimating an upper bound of BER under the simultaneous effects of linear and nonlinear distortions, timing and phase errors is analyzed and presented in this paper.
