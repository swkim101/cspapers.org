In this paper, we present the performance evaluation of the anti-collision algorithm used in the RFID EPC global generation-2 (Gen2) standard using Miller modulation in AWGN environments. In order to improve the anti-collision performance in the noise environment, we use Miller sub-carrier modulation rather than F 0 waveforms and we also propose a new scheme for the tag structure equipped with the channel encoder block and the corresponding decoder block in the receiver of the reader system, without changing the basic nature of the EPCglobal Gen2 standard. By computer simulation, we show that the RFID system equipped with channel coding scheme shows a significant improvement in the anti-collision performance in practical noisy environments.
