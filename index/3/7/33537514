Humans can recover the shape of a surface from its image boundary. The authors have presented a new approach to shape from boundary [4]. It includes three points : the line of curvature (LOC) regularity, an algorithm for constructing LOC net from boundary, and the computation of surface orientation from LOC net. Briefing these ideas, this paper examines the underlying problems of the approach and proposes improvements.
