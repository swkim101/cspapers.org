We propose an approach to introduce computational models and basic programming principles in an integrated manner and as early as possible in the computing curricula. Our goal is to help educate students of computer science, mathematics, and the various science disciplines, in computational modeling. For this, we have developed a sequence of four courses in computational modeling, the first of which integrates computational modeling with programming principles and includes elementary numerical methods for solving the models. This entry-level course is described and a URL is provided with details of the four courses. Developing a computational model of a problem includes formulating the mathematical representation and implementing it by applying Computer Science concepts, principles and methods.
