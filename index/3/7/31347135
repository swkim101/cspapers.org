Quality and efficiency of healthcare services are expected to be improved by the proposed Electronic Health Record (EHR). The current administrative inefficiency, clinical decision-making errors and unpredictable quality are longstanding problems which are mostly caused by the deficiency of detailed patient record. The ability of integrating various patient records, created by different institutes, and effectively use a detailed health record enhances the healthcare professional's ability to provide the reliable and successful of knowledge-intensive health care delivery, avoid medical errors, improve quality, enhance efficiency, and have an elevated point of contentment and accomplishment during the proving of healthcare service. Identifying medical errors is a significant step for managing and avoiding them. The deficiency of detailed patient record is the vital causes for clinical errors. In this study we explores the idea of how greater sharing of more detailed healthcare information has the potential to improve the quality of patient care instead of minimizing the current system into Summary Patient Record only.
