Software architects are faced with a diverse set of problems when they begin to design a system Many development projects address intrinsically complex problems with limited resources. System evolution is a given, particularly as developers and users come to better understand the problem through the delivery of early system releases. The software architect must articulate a ‘X-ision” for the system which encompasses the different dimensions of the solution to all of the stakeholders. This vision must be both abstract and detailed, providing the development eam with a general understanding of how the system is structured and how it operates, while simultaneously providing each specialist with a set of constraints on the design and implementation of their components.
