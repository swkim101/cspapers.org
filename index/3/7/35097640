In this study, a high-capacity and low-latency fiber-wireless signal transport technology in the terahertz band is discussed. An advanced optical fiber communication technology is easily adopted for high-capacity terahertz signal transmission, as well as for encapsulation of existing radio services into the terahertz carrier.
