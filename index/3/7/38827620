This poster describes our experience with the convening of a statewide committee of Mathematics and Computer Science teachers and content specialists to compare the content of the AP Computer Science A Course (AP CS A) and the Computer Science Principles (CSP) course with the Alabama Course of Study-Mathematics. The purpose of the comparison was to identify overlaps in content and to make recommendations to the State Department of Education and the State Board of Education regarding the option of awarding mathematics credit for completion of the Computer Science courses. This crosswalk activity led to the December 2013 decision by the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) to count both CS Principles and CS A as courses satisfying the four-course requirement for high school graduation in Alabama. The poster will describe the crosswalk activity, the results, and the specific strategic approach to involve the ALSDE as collaborators in the activity.
