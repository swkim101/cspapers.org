Current knowledge acquisition tools have limited understanding of how users enter knowledge and how acquired knowledge is used, and provide limited assistance in organizing various knowledge authoring tasks. In this paper, we present a novel extension to existing knowledge acquisition tools where the system 1) captures the episodes of knowledge acquisition and knowledge use through a set of declarative reflection patterns 2) performs assessment on how to improve the future knowledge acquisition and knowledge use based on captured episodes, and 3) provides assistance to the users by combining the assessment results.
