Description: To meet aggressive design cycle, complexity, and productivity requirements, more electronic systems than before are being specified and designed at higher levels of abstraction, involve embedded processors and other programmable components, and achieve design re-use \vith hard~vareand sofivare components. k order not to compromise the productivity gains obtained by component-based systems, verification and test should be addressed early in the design cycle. This tutorird addresses the challenges, proposed methodologies, and current industrird practices in verification and test of components and component-based systems at higher levels of abstraction.
