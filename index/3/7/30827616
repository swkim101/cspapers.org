The Computational Chemistry Grid (CCG) is an NSF-supported virtual organization that provides access to high performance computing resources for computational chemistry and other disciplines with distributed support and services, intuitive interfaces and measurable quality of service. The GridChem middleware gives users a transparent graphical user interface to complex computational chemistry software. This interface allows for easier adoption of the application into the undergraduate curriculum.Cyberinfrastructure tools, such as CCG, will play a critical role in the educational arena. A panel from academia will address timely topics such as: Using the CCG in Undergraduate / Graduate Education; Education's Role in Cyberinfrastructures (NanoHub); Cyberinfrastructures and On-line Education (The Ralph Regula School of Computational Science); and an ITR Project Example Using Grid Computing in Education. This discussion will benefit educators, software developers, and those involved with Cyberinfrastructure, alike.
