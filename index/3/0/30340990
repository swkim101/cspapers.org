In real-time Internet based teleoperation, different robotic tasks have different dexterity requirements during task progress and thus different network resources are required for safe and reliable task accomplishment. In order to control remote manipulators efficiently and smoothly via the Internet, dynamic bandwidth allocation is crucial to successful accomplishment of robotic tasks controlled by remote operator. In this paper, a novel bandwidth allocation mechanism is developed based on the online measured task dexterity index of current dexterous tasks so that operators can control remote manipulators efficiently and smoothly even under poor network quality. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented resource (bandwidth) allocation algorithm in Internet based teleoperation system.
