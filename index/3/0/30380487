The utilization of remotely sensed data from aircraft and satellites have evolved over the years. Broadly, the steps involve image analysis. mapping. co-registration with other spatial and aspatial data sources and information extraction for decision support systems. InitialIy, each of these steps were independent activities. involving manual manipulation of analog data. However, with the advent of electronic imaging sensors, digital data has become available and the analysis. mapping, registration and information extraction can be done on computers. Computerization has been given a fillip by the complex demands of decision support system which need the handling of a wide variety of spatial and aspatial data sowces. For example, the current demands of sustainable development requires the analysis of imagery, maps, demographic data, anecdotal information, etc. using complex models. To meet these requirements, we need versatile data bases which can efficiently handle a plethora of data types with varying formats. The problem can be subdivided into two major areas. The first relates to remotely sensed data itself and the second to all other data such as maps, statistics, text, images etc.
