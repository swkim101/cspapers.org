There are many design and delivery trade-offs that engineers face in creating or evolving software systems. Challenges in accelerating delivery, offering more features, providing better more reliable systems, or managing costs - whose optimization are just some of the hurdles that contribute to system success (or failure). This panel will discuss the heuristics of trade-offs, the inherent risks - and plans to build on the success of the 2012 SPLASH workshop "What Drives Design".
