In this paper, we propose a design method for the mechanism of a robotic arm suitable for a multicopter. The motion of an arm attached to a multicopter can possibly disturb the multicopter attitude. Our aim is to suppress this attitude disturbance by mechanical methods. In the proposed design method, the arm has the following features for suppressing the disturbance of the multicopter attitude. 1. The robotic arm can adjust its center of gravity (COG). 2. In the simplified model, the sum of the angular momentum of the rotating parts constituting the robot arm is equal to zero. These features can compensate for both the displacement of the COG of the arm and the counter torque generated from rotating parts, which cause the disturbance to the multicopter attitude. Since the disturbance of the multicopter attitude can be suppressed mechanically, the robotic arm does not require a special flight control law. In other words, this robotic arm has the advantage of being attached to a multicopter using a common, off-the-shelf, multipurpose flight controller. Furthermore, we discuss the mass distribution, power transmission method, and the moment of inertia of rotating parts, such as the speed reducer, motor, and arm. Additionally, we fabricate a prototype robotic arm with four joints and three degrees of freedom (DOFs), based on the proposed design method. Finally, the experiments showed that the robotic arm suppressed the disturbance of the multicopter attitude caused by the arm motion.
