Yizkor Book collections contain firsthand commemorative accounts of events from the era surrounding the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, including documents from before, during, and after the Holocaust. Prior to our effort, information regarding the content and location of each Yizkor Book volume was limited. We established a centralized index and metadata repository for the Yizkor Book collection and developed a detailed search interface accessible worldwide.
