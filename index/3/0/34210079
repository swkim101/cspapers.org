The increasing amount of structured and semi-structured information available on the Web and in distributed information systems, as well as the Web's diversification into different segments such as the Social Web, the Deep Web, or the Dark Web, requires new methods for horizontal search. FuhSen is a federated, RDF-based, hybrid search platform that searches, integrates and summarizes information about entities from distributed heterogeneous information sources using Linked Data. As a use case, we present scenarios where law enforcement institutions search and integrate data spread across these different Web segments to identify cases of organized crime. We present the architecture and implementation of FuhSen and explain the queries that can be addressed with this new approach.
