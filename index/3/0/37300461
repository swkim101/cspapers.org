This paper describes the effect that the introduction of computing laboratory facilities has had on the curriculum of an undergraduate Computer Science program. From its initial use by only one course, the laboratory has grown gradually both in terms of equipment and involvement with the Department's teaching program. Demands placed on the laboratory by various courses have influenced the acquisition of new equipment. Conversely, with the addition of new and varied equipment, it was possible to incorporate the laboratory into more courses. The Paper describes this interplay between the development of the laboratory and the growth of the Department. Problems such as maintenance and support staff for the laboratory are discussed whenever they have affected decisions on the use of the laboratory by a course or the selection of equipment.
