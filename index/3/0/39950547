Since CHI '88 met in May of 1988, less than a year ago, several user interface products have appeared with the strength to fight for preeminence. AT&T and Sun Microsystems put together a joint software development effort that created Open Look®, a direct manipulation face for UNIX®. In response, many of the other major Unix system houses banded together to form the Open Software Foundation. OSF composed an alternate "standard" direct manipulation face for Unix, OSF/Motif TM. NEXT® not only introduced with much media hoopla a truly objectoriented user interface, they licensed it to IBM where it will become the face for some of the computer giant's Unix offerings.
