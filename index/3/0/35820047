Increasingly, scientists are using portals and desktop applications as "gateways" to access computational capabilities, information services, data collections, instruments and other resources. Developers are building community-specific tools and applications that are integrated via a portal or a suite of applications, providing access to high end resources. These gateways often support orchestrated workflow, resource directories (databases, compute resources, etc.), and execution services.The purpose of the BOF is to bring together developers, researchers or resource providers who are developing, deploying or using these types of capabilities to discuss common issues including usage models, authentication and authorization, access mechanisms and what to consider when accessing shared resources.
