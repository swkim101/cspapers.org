Many AI researchers want to test the utility of their systems in complex task environments defined by (e.g., real-time strategy) gaming simulators and/or simulators of computer-generated forces. Also, many developers of commercial and military gaming simulators seek behaviors that can be supported by these systems. However, these integrations require great effort. We will demonstrate the late Alpha version of TIELT, a testbed designed to fill these needs.
