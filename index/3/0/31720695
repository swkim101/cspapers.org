Our works on energy/utility present an approach for energy-efficient resource management that considers the utility requirements of users and the energy restriction that are set by them. In this demo, we show an initial prototype of our approach, demonstrating energy/utility trade-offs in an example application and how modeling individual components and their interaction can simplify the scheduling of resources.
