In 1978 Siemens decided to develop a stored program controlled fully digital switching system, the EWSD. Breathtaking advances in microelectronics and software engineering and the advent of powerful microprocessors had set the stage for this large development program. In 1980, the first EWSD switch went into service in the network of the Southafrican Telecom; at the end of 1995 more than 5.000 EWSD switches are installed in the telephone networks of 86 countries all over the world. Up to now 25.000 staff years for software engineering have been spent in 20 development centers around the world to develop EWSD runtime and support software. More than 1 billion gross lines of code are contained in the EWSD Configuration Management Database. In the session the decisive factors for success of the EWSD software engineering will be discussed: System architecture, software architecture, engineering process, support software, configuration management, networked software workstations and computing centers, distributed centers of competence, project management, training of software makers and managers.
