The Eclipse platform is designed for building integrated development environments for object-oriented applications. The goal of the ETX workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas about potential new uses of Eclipse and how the core Eclipse technology can be leveraged, improved and/or extended for research and teaching projects.
