To become proficient programmers, novices must develop the skills of writing, reading, debugging, and testing code. We believe that learning to write short pieces of code correctly the first time helps strengthen all of these skills. In this paper, we describe a type of exercise, called IRONCODE, that helps develop the code-once skill. We describe the exercise, the programming environment, its implementation, and our experiences using IRONCODE in a second semester programming class.
