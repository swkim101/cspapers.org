Many instructors have already discovered the joy of teaching programming using the Python programming language. Now it's time to take Python to the next level. This workshop will introduce Django, an open source Python web framework that saves you time and makes web development fun. It's aimed at Computer Science instructors who want to teach how to build elegant web applications with minimal fuss. Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Its goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, rapid development, and the principle of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Topics that will be covered during the workshop include: setup and configuration, template language, and database integration through object-relational mapping. Participants should have some familiarity with Python, HTML and SQL. Laptop Required.
