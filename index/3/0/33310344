A review is given of the current situation in two-year institutions with data-processing course offerings. There are three types of students, “transfer,” “occupational,” and “optional,” whose needs must be satisfied by any curriculum. The author suggests a curriculum for all schools, large and small, containing six courses, of which the student enrolls in four according to his educational goals.
