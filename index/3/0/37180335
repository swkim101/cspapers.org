The great project of the World Wide Web has succeeded - a large portion of the world's information is now instantly accessible through open protocols and open presentation formats. The Web is as Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned it, a vast resource of interconnected knowledge. Yet that resource exists in a universe of its own. Meanwhile the real world has become crowded with connected devices, none more significant than the smartphone - bringing the Web to eighty percent of the planet's adult population by the end of this decade. Smartphones have become fantastically adept at navigating cyberspace, but - with the singular exception of maps - have few real connections to the world immediately at hand. In 2017 we live in two worlds: the Web, and the real. The time has come to knit these two together. To begin that integration, our first step must be a deep moment of contemplation about what the Web and the real world have to offer one another. How can each amplify the value and capacity of the other? Because of the Web, the real world is pregnant with data and knowledge - what does that world look like? How do we use it? How does it change the way we think and behave? In this simple act of design thinking - toward a "Web-wide world" - we can reframe the possibilities of what both the Web and the real world can offer - and what we can offer both. This is the next great project for the Web - finding its place in the world.
