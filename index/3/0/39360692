This demo presents Vital-Radio, a wireless sensing technology that monitors breathing remotely, without requiring any body contact. Vital-Radio operates by transmitting a low-power wireless signal and monitoring its reflections off the human body. It uses these reflections to track motion associated with breathing, i.e., the chest movements caused by inhaling and exhaling. The demo will enable any person to sit in front of the device and check that it tracks their inhale and exhale process. The person may hold his/her breath and check that the device detects the breath holding event in real-time.
