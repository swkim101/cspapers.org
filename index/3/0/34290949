Learning to apply computer science requires practical experience and cannot only be taught in theory. Interactive learning is a new approach: educators teach small chunks of content in short cycles of theory, example, exercise, solution and feedback. It is based on active, computer-based and experiential learning and focuses on immediate feedback to improve the learning experience. It allows students to reflect about the content incrementally. It includes hands-on activities, guidance by the instructor and increases students' motivation and engagement. This workshop describes experiences of multiple interactive learning courses for large classes, including exercises for (1) multiple choice quizzes, (2) interactive tutorials, (3) interactive programming exercises, (4) interactive modeling, and (5) team activities. Based on our experience, we present multiple case studies and concrete examples of interactive exercises. While the assessment of many exercises can be (semi-)automated, teaching assistants in the classroom manually assess other exercises. We show how educators can integrate these exercises into large classes without significantly increasing their effort. Participants should bring a laptop to this workshop.
