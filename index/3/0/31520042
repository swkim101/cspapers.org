 Industry today is looking for creative systems analysts and programmers who can develop physical systems on the basis of sound business judgement rather than merely increasing the level of sophistication. They need “entrepeneurs” - those who know how to work effectively with hardware and software suppliers, know how to harness and direct the creative systems people, know how to be communications catalysts in giving advice and counsel to systems users, and know how to establish and maintain sensible budgets and project control systems.
 How these types of EDP personnel can be developed by the application of sound management principles to the establishment of “custom-built” educational and training programs that emphasize both the operations of the organization as well as the technical aspects of data processing will be discussed.
