In this paper, region exploration path planning algorithm is proposed. In order for a mobile robot to perform this task, appropriate measures with the shape of the working environment, which may be intricate or curved, is necessary. In addition, a robot must be able to react and be flexible when confronted with obstacles. With this algorithm, these challenges can be met by approximately expressing the working environment in grid points and regenerating the path using one that was planned beforehand. Simulations are used to demonstrate proposed exploration path planning and re-planning algorithm.
