In this workshop, participants will create and manipulate digital audio using open source software (Audacity, PureData, Processing's Minim Beta, Octave, and C/C++). The cross-disciplinary digital audio content links music, engineering, physics, mathematics, and computer science and was developed for and test-taught in computer science courses. Additionally, participants will access and use the freely available online videos, tutorials, and textbook that can be incorporated into their classrooms. The online content's development was funded by the National Science Foundation CCLI Grant, "Linking Science, Art, and Practice Through Digital Sound." Exercises that engage students in creative computational problem solving for sound and music applications will also be discussed. Laptops equipped with the open source applications mentioned above are strongly recommended but not required.
