Kinematic redundancy is a characteristic and beneficial property in collaborative robots nowadays as it enhances the flexibility and dexterity of the system. While the robot is manipulating an object, it is often necessary to kinematically reconfigure the robot, for example, when it obstructs the human. For this, internal or so-called null space motions can be carried out which do not affect the main task. In general, it is desirable that the human coworker can anticipate how the robot will move at any time. However, for null space motions this is typically not the case as they are non-intuitive and not suitable for interaction. In this work, we develop intuitive null space interaction behaviors for redundant manipulators, where the human can easily guide the robot. We want to provide users with a tool, that is straightforward to implement and solves real-world problems effectively. Two practical applications for an eight- and ten-DOF robot demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.
