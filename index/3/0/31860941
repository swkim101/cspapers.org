Defeasible reasoning is a nonmonotonic reasoning approach in which the gaps due to incomplete information are closed through the use of defeasible rules. Defeasible logic (Nute 1994) and its variants are an important family of defeasible reasoning methods. It is a simple, efficient but flexible non-monotonic formalism that offers many reasoning capabilities embodies the concept of preference and it has low computational complexity. Recent theoretical work on defeasible logics has: (i) established some relationships to logic programming (Antoniou et al. 2006); (ii) analyzed the formal properties of these logics (Antoniou et al. 2001) and (iii) has delivered efficient implementations (Antoniou & Bikakis 2007). Its use in various application domains has been advocated, including modelling of contracts (Grosof 2004), (Governatori 2005), legal reasoning (Governatori, Rotolo, & Sartor 2005), agent negotiations (Governatori et al. 2001), modelling ofagents and agent societies (Governatori & Rotolo 2004). Nonmonotonic rule systems are expected to play an important role in the layered development of the Semantic Web. Defeasible reasoning systems that are used on applications to the Semantic Web have already been implemented (Antoniou & Bikakis 2007). Semantic Web community has performed extensive research in the area of policies. It is a concept that encompasses many different notions and one of them are the business rules. In the current work, we develop a nonmonotonic rulebased system that can reason in Semantic Web applications associated with policies and business rules. It is based on an extension of defeasible logic with modalities and supports reasoning with RDF/S ontologies.
