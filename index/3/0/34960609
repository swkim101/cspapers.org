This paper presents a multi-domain information extraction system. In order to decrease the time spent on the elaboration of resources for the IE system and guide the end-user in a new domain, we suggest to use a machine learning system that helps defining new templates and associated resources. This knowledge is automatically derived from the text collection, in interaction with the end-user to rapidly develop a local ontology giving an accurate image of the content of the text. The system is finally evaluated using classical indicators.
