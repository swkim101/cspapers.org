Although synthesis dictionary learning for sparse representation has been well studied for universality representation (i.e., the dictionary is universal to all classes) and particularity representation (i.e., the dictionary is class-particular), jointly learning an analysis dictionary and a synthesis dictionary is still in its infant stage. Universality-particularity representation can well match the intrinsic characteristics of data (i.e., different classes share commonality and distinctness), while analysis-synthesis dictionary can give a more complete view of data representation (i.e., analysis dictionary is a dual-viewpoint of synthesis dictionary). In this paper, we proposed a novel model of analysis-synthesis dictionary learning for universality-particularity (ASDL-UP) representation based classification. The discrimination of universality and particularity representation is jointly exploited by simultaneously learning a pair of analysis dictionary and synthesis dictionary. More specifically, we impose a label preserving term to analysis coding coefficients for universality representation. Fisher-like regularizations for analysis coding coefficients and the subsequent synthesis representation are introduced to particularity representation. Compared with other state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods, ASDL-UP has shown better or competitive performance in various classification tasks.
