This paper addresses a method for synchronizing motion by multiple autonomous mobile robots using radio communication. The autonomous and decentralized robot system, ACTRESS, is a multi-agent robotic system including multiple autonomous mobile robots. The autonomous mobile robots are developed so as not only to act individually, but also to cooperate with the other robots if they cannot accomplish the task alone. The synchronized motion is sometimes required to execute such cooperative tasks. Every agent of ACTRESS is equipped with the communication system, which enables a message passing between any robotic agents. The prototype ACTRESS system is introduced, and cooperation among multiple robotic agents is discussed. A method for synchronization using the communication system is proposed. The method is applied to the prototype system, and side-by-side motion on the actual mobile robots is implemented as a example of synchronized motion.
