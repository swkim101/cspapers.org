Progress towards programming by demonstration for robotic assembly is presented, advocating the use of virtual impedance and virtual attractor trajectories as a means of encoding atomic behaviors. Switching among behaviors is invoked by recognition of events. Evidence is presented for associating these events with transients, such as impacts. The approach is shown to lead to robot skills that are fast, gentle and reliable.
