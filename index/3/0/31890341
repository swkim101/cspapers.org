This paper presents a study that uses extensive analysis of real security vulnerabilities to drive the development of: 1) runtime techniques for detection/masking of security attacks and 2) formal source code analysis methods to enable identification and removal of potential security vulnerabilities. The presentation will describe the hardware architecture of a Reliability and Security Engine (RSE) that embodies the proposed techniques, to provide run-time checking at the processor level.
