Existing tools for logical and physical data base design are reviewed in this paper. Logical data base design methods are classified and their features are compared. Design models for selecting physical data base structures are classified based on their applications. Also reviewed are previous research dealing with implementation issues such as index selection, buffer management, and storage allocation. Finally, system performance evaluation techniques for database systems are surveyed.
