In this paper, we report on a qualitative study of how users manage their reputation online. We focus particularly on people who are bothered by content online about themselves and how they manage reputation damage and repair. We describe how users view reputation management chores as necessary but unpleasant, and how they feel disempowered to repair their online reputation. Participants were unable to identify feasible repair mechanisms and ultimately failed to resolve their problems. Given the current state of dysfunction indicated by our findings, we advocate for increased HCI research attention to this area.
