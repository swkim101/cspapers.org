Addressing the crucial need for cybersecurity learning materials, the Security Injections @ Towson project (towson.edu/securityinjections) has developed modules for CS0, CS1, CS2 and Computer Literacy courses that target key secure coding concepts including integer overflow, buffer overflow, and input validation. Assessment results indicate that these modules have led to an increase in students' security-awareness and their ability to apply secure coding principles. Each security injection module includes four sections - background, code responsibly (includes methods to avoid security issues), laboratory assignment with a security checklist, and discussion questions. In this study, we are proposing to enhance these modules by incorporating e-learning strategies including lesson segmentation, instant feedback, and self-paced lessons to increase student learning. In addition, we are designing a system with auto-grading functionality and dashboards to encourage adoption by instructors. Segmenting modules into smaller sections and including --gatekeeper questions will facilitate learning and reduce cognitive overload. Providing feedback on incorrect answers encourages students to revisit relevant sections. The goal of this feedback based approach is to improve student learning and content retention. The nature of the enhanced modules allows for self-paced learning which is applicable for online learning environments. We conducted a pilot study using a module in CS0 undergraduate computer science class that included 60 in-class and 9 online students. The results of the pilot study indicated increased attention towards the content and possible improvement in retention of concepts. This project is partially supported by NSF under grant DUE-1241738
