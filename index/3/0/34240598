Web search is actually a pretty heavy task for most users since people need to launch a search engine's portal, phrase the right query and then go through search results to find the right information or service. To lower the search cost, commercial search engines have been improved in many ways, including query suggestion, relevant search, knowledge graph, ranking algorithm, user interface, and so on. I will briefly explain the progress along these features, especially for the largest Chinese search engine - Baidu. In addition to these approaches, another important way to lower search cost is to make Web search ready whenever a user intends to start a search, which becomes more important with the popularity of mobile devices. I will talk about the progress along this direction and the technologies behind it as well.
