PREFACE This volume is the official record of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. It contains abstracts for the tu-torials and panels as well as the texts of the presented papers. Such a meeting can be a success only through the efforts of a large number of people. We are first indebted to the very many authors who submitted papers. While the great majority of them reported important work, only a third could be included in the program. We are also indebted to the members of the Program Committee who helped make the difficult decisions: In addition, much credit goes to Bruce W. Ballard who organized the tutorial sessions and to Ralph Grishman and Cecile Paris who organized the demonstrations and exhibits. On administrative matters, Don Walker published the Call for Papers and this Proceedings, sent out the advertisements and registration packets, and handled countless other problems that most of us never knew existed. Kathy McKeown and Cecile Paris were in charge of the huge task of local arrangements. which provided extensive secretarial support for my correspondence and organizational activities.
