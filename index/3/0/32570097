1 The World-Wide Web as a Universal User Interface Our work is motivated by three trends. First, the ubiquitous migration of services to the World Wide Web is due in part to its simple, consistent, and now universal user interface: navigation by following links and filling out HTML forms are interactions familiar to even novice Internet users. Second, client-side extension technologies such as Java and JavaScript allow sites to extend and “personalize” the behaviors and interfaces of their services, with portable user-interface elements that integrate transparently into the browser’s existing interface. Finally, there has been a recent surge of interest in proxymediated access to the Web, in which proxy agents in the network infrastructure provide caching [ 11, anonymize user requests [2], or accelerate Web access via datatype-specific lossy compression [3,4,5]. Recent results show that these services can be built scalably and cost-effectively, and can shield the user from the limitations of their Internet connections or client platforms. Not surprisingly, the services have become increasingly powerful and therefore parameterizable and customizable by each user, resulting in increased attention on the design and implementation of the user interface by which the service can be controlled [S]
