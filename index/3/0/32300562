Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) has shown its promising power in high-level representation learning. From the perspective of manifold learning, we propose a graph regularized deep neural network (GR-DNN) to endue traditional DAEs with the ability of retaining local geometric structure. A deep-structured regularizer is formulated upon multi-layer perceptions to capture this structure. The robust and discriminative embedding space is learned to simultaneously preserve the high-level semantics and the geometric structure within local manifold tangent space. Theoretical analysis presents the close relationship between the proposed graph regularizer and the graph Laplacian regularizer in terms of the optimization objective. We also alleviate the growth of the network complexity by introducing the anchor-based bipartite graph, which guarantees the good scalability for large scale data. The experiments on four datasets show the comparable results of the proposed GR-DNN with the state-of-the-art methods.
