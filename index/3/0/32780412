To extend applicable area of minimally invasive neurosurgery, multi-DOF brain retract manipulator is developed. By inserting this manipulator deeper into the brain as an conductor and then other micromanipulator afterwards, it will be possible to realize new minimally invasive neurosurgery. The brain retract manipulator system is controlled by new safety method with brain retraction pressure monitoring system, Tendon-driven unit which controls lock or free status of each joint of multi-joint spatula, Passive-hybrid control system that assure the system a suitable safety. In evaluation test with a hog, insertion of the multi-joint spatula as deep as the cerebral base was realized, and the possibility of securing the space between the temporal lobe and the cerebral base is verified.
