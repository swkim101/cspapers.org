Online/offline community (O/OC), the integrated performance of community in a blend of online/offline activities is increasingly prevalent as online systems organise, mediate and broadcast forms of communal engagement. O/OCs are social machines where the focus is on the social achievement, rather than the computational outcomes, of the combined human-technical infrastructure. An O/OC model SPENCE is proposed as an analytical tool for describing social machines from the perspective of sociality. Twitter is a technical infrastructure and social network of shared online/offline community phenomena that is also a social machine combining social participation with conventional forms of machine-based computation. Drawing from the extensive Twitter research literature, a sample of papers are analysed against SPENCE, demonstrating the clarity of the organisation of inter-relating themes of a range of perspectives in current Twitter research. It is concluded that SPENCE provides a lens of synthesis for the sociality dimension of a social machine and can be used in taxonomic activities (such as the social machines observatory) to differentiate social machines.
