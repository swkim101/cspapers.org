Languages such as English contain a large number of words with multiple meanings. These words are commonly termed "lexlcal ambiguities", although it is probably more accurate to speak of them as potentially ambiguous. Determining how the contextually appropriate reading of a word is identified presents an important and unavoidable problem for persons developing theories of natural language processing. A large body of psycholingulstlc research on ambiguity resolution has failed to yield a consistent set of findings or a general, non-controverslal theory. In this paper, we review the results of six experiments which form the basis of a model of ambiguity resolution in context, and at the same account for some of the contradictions in the existing literature.
