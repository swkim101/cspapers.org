We propose a new type of hashing which we call virtual hashing. In contrast to any known hashing, a virtual hashing may modify its hashing function. Such changes may be performed when collisions arise. A virtual hashing may then find in one disk access, a record such that several accesses would be needed if the function initially chosen for the file was used. We define virtual hashings which practically independently of the number of such records find in one disk access almost each record of the file.
