We present QOOK, an interactive reading system that incorporates the benefits of both physical and digital books to facilitate active reading. QOOK uses a top-projector to create digital contents on a blank paper book. By detecting markers attached to each page, QOOK allows users to flip pages just like they would with a real book. Electronic functions such as keyword searching, highlighting and bookmarking are included to provide users with additional digital assistance. With a Kinect sensor that recognizes touch gestures, QOOK enables people to use these electronic functions directly with their fingers. The combination of the electronic functions of the virtual interface and free-form interaction with the physical book creates a natural reading experience, providing an opportunity for faster navigation between pages and better understanding of the book contents.
