In a statistical world faced with an explosion of data, regularization has become an important ingredient. In a wide variety of problems we have many more input features than observations, and the lasso penalty and its hybrids have become increasingly useful for both feature selection and regularization. This talk presents some effective algorithms based on coordinate descent for fitting large scale regularization paths for a variety of problems.
