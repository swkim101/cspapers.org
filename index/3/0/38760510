SSEAT 2008 is a workshop that focuses on the recent research approaches to automated testing using state-space exploration techniques. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers from both industry and academia to informally discuss the latest successes and remaining challenges in this domain. One important aspect of the workshop is to discuss techniques that were tried but did not work well in certain contexts. Another important aspect is to try to identify a set of programs that can be used for comparing various tools and techniques. There will be no proceedings, but a brief summary of the workshop will appear at the workshop web page.
