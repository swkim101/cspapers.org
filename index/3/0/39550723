Belief revision and belief update are two of the most basic types of belief change operations. We need to select either revision or update when we accept new information into the current belief, however, such decision making has not been considered. In this paper, we propose a unified framework of revision and update based on state transition models that enable us to do such decision making. This framework provides a hybrid operation of revision and update, called acceptance.
