This paper presents a game playing model of Score-Four that is a kind of alignment game similar to three dimensional tic-tac-toe. The present model aims at winning a game most efficiently. The principal proposal is an adoption of Decision Analysis, a wide-spread method of systems analysis, instead of Minimax Procedure. This paper includes a static evaluation on the state of game, a brief illustration of Decision Analysis, a method of strategy-making and an outline of a game playing machine. Based on the results from the experiments conducted with human players, we assert that Decision Analysis is a good method to make strategies which enable us to take advantage of the opponent's mistakes and it is shown that the risk caused by abandonment of the conventional assumption that the opponent selects the best move is averted by the introduction of a learning system.
