Puzzle-based learning (PBL) is an emerging model of teaching critical thinking and problem solving. Today's market place needs skilled graduates capable of solving real problems of innovation in a changing environment. While solving puzzles is innately fun, companies such as Google and Yahoo also use puzzles to assess the creative problem solving skills of potential employees. In this interactive workshop we will examine a range of puzzles, games, and general problem solving strategies. Participants will emerge with the needed pedagogical foundation to offer a full course on PBL or to include it as part of another course. Currently 40+ institutions around the world are offering courses based on PBL. More details are available at www.PuzzleBasedLearning.edu.au. Laptop optional.
