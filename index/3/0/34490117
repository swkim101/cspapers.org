During recent years, the interest in using heterogeneous computing architecture in industrial applications has increased dramatically. These architectures provide the computational power that makes them attractive for many industrial applications. However, most of these existing heterogeneous architectures suffer from the following limitations: difficulties of heterogeneous parallel programming and high communication cost between the computing units. To overcome these disadvantages, several leading hardware manufacturers have formed the HSA Foundation to develop a new hardware architecture: Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA). In this paper, we investigate the suitability of using HSA for real-time embedded systems. A preliminary experimental study has been conducted to measure massive computing power and timing predictability of HSA.
