Wideband spectrum sensing is an attractive topic in cognitive radio (CR). Filter-banks are a good approach for wideband sensing with different detection algorithms. A wideband sensing scheme with filter-bank realization was proposed as in [1] for long-term evolution advanced (LTE-A) signals. The scheme is able to detect and classify LTE-A signals in multi-channels in parallel. In this work, we validate the reliability of the scheme in realistic scenarios of mobile communications. Real wideband LTE signals are processed by the scheme with an integrated test-bed for LTE base-stations in emergency situations. The experimental results agree with previous works to approve the reliability of the spectrum sensing scheme. Besides, they lead a successful integration approach of the scheme into LTE base-stations.
