We present Nishanchi, a position and orientation aware handheld inkjet printer which can be used to transfer the reference marks from CAD to the workpiece for use in manual fabrication workflows. Nishanchi also has a digitizing tip that can be used to input features about the workpiece to a computer model. By allowing for this two-way exchange of information from CAD to a nonconcormal workpiece, we believe that Nishanchi might help make inclusion of CAD in manual fabrication workflows more seamless.
