We propose a method for implementing “the election process” - finding an extrema of values computed in a multiprocessor network. It operates in an average time less than Log2(N), for a network of size N. It requires a single register, memory cell, or global buss into which all the processors can attempt to write, with the success of one guaranteed; and from which they may all read, in parallel. A second method is given which guarantees termination in O(Log2(MAX)) steps.
