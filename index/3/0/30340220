In an information retrieval system, the query is the bridge between the collection database and the user. With query operators to define terms that should or should not appear in result documents, users could actually access their desired documents. For the web IR systems, no matter the underlying database or the user group is changed a lot comparing to the traditional environment, but the set of query operators is still unchanged.
