Field trips in kindergarten imply excellent chances to attain a wide spectrum of educational clues for the children. However, in-depth observation on their exploratory behaviors is uniquely challenging. Teachers mostly take all possible precautions against any incidents, sparing little time and attention for observation. We collaborated with kindergarten teachers to develop a system for delegated observation of the children's exploratory behaviors by using smartphones and sensor technologies.
