The traditional view of monitoring is extended from the execution-time validity checking of actions towards dynamic plan-validity checking and forecasting of risky situations. Monitoring for intelligent robots is recognized as an independent task, deeply embedded in the dynamics of planning and execution. The solution presented is based on very general assumptions of plans and planning, and is thus widely applicable within control systems over the whole bandwidth of reactivity. JANUS, an experimental monitoring shell based on the concepts of situation grids and world state aspect objects as generic monitors, has been implemented.
