In December 2011, CSTA published their new student learning standards for K-12 Computer Science. The current climate in K-12 schools is one of high stakes accountability with a strong focus on instructional standards. As a result, teachers, computer science education researchers, and K-12 outreach providers are increasingly being pressed to tie their content to national standards. The CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards provide de facto national standards for all of these purposes. In addition, they help promote K-12 computer science as an essential academic discipline and allow educators and researchers alike to share a common understanding of what students should be learning throughout their K-12 experience.
