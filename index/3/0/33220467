Service learning is an educational philosophy that promotes active learning through community service. We have recently applied this approach in our computer science curriculum, specifically to our software engineering course. In order that other computer science departments can benefit from our experience, we have developed a primer one can follow to establish a program for service learning in the computer sciences. We also describe and assess our experience after one year of applying service learning to software engineering.
