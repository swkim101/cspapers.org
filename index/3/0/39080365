The academic curriculum in computer science has been proposed, reviewed, and modified in an on-going process for years [I, 2, 3, 41. The resulting curricula have packaged the subject matter of computer science in many ways. The end result of these studies has been a carefully designed coverage of academic material in a fashion that requires students to master core material and guarantees student exposure to appropriate additional material that insures both breadth and depth of knowledge. We suggest that describing the “material that must be covered” is an inadequate approach to curriculum design, necessary but not sufficient. Whether one is teaching in a liberal arts environment or in a more preprofessional environment, there are more aspects to an education than the content that is covered in required and elective courses. In this paper we propose an experiential aspect of the computer science curriculum as a complement to the content aspect. We urge those who are designing new curricula or revising existing ones to consider this aspect and evaluate their curricula with regard to experiences as well as the more usual content evaluation.
