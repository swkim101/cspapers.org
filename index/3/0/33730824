Virtual design and manufacturing has become a key technology in reducing both design errors and manufacturing cost. In order to have a realistic evaluation, the cost of assembling, disassembling, and manufacturing a product has to be realized. A product's design and its manufacturability will give an overall manufacturing efficiency and production cost. To eliminate future production failure and control the cost, management has to be able to foresee and evaluate the whole process from design to production, easily and wisely. In recognizing the importance of this capability, a CAE/CAD/CAM Product (C3P) management tool based on a structured product coding system (SPCS) is developed for the process of virtual design and manufacturing.
