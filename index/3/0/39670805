The quest for scientific knowledge, whether illuminating the depth of outer space or mapping the genomes of life, requires critical advances in high-performance computing (HPC). These critical advances demand high-performance computers that deliver higher processing speeds, greater scalability and operational availability. Hitachi is sharply focused on providing solutions that exceed these demands.Our presentation will discuss Hitachi's approach to satisfying the requirements of high-performance computing (HPC), as well as introduce our positioning and product offerings in the HPC market space. We will address our hardware design concepts, compiler technology, and user application Tuning & Optimization methodology with real examples of application performance. And underpinned by an ongoing commitment to "Inspire the Next," Hitachi will also present its roadmap of technical and scientific High Performance Computing (HPC) offerings.
