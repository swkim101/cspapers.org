Reducing healthcare costs and improving quality of outcomes is a challenge even in developed economies. Much information remains in paper form, lack common standards, sharing is uncommon and frequently hampered by the lack of foolproof de-identification for patient privacy. All of these issues impede opportunities for data mining and analysis that would enable better predictive and preventive medicine. These issues are compounded in emerging economies due to geopolitical constraints, transportation and geographic barriers, a much more limited clinical workforce, and infrastructural challenges to delivery. Thus, simple, high-impact deliverable interventions such as universal childhood immunization and maternal childcare are hampered by poor monitoring and reporting systems. This workshop is focused on identifying challenges to be overcome for effectively delivering efficient healthcare and to the masses. Specifically, we will provide a forum to discuss research directions, share experience and insights from both academia and industry. The anticipated outcome of the workshop is an assessment of the state of the art in the area, as well as identification of critical next steps to pursue in this topic.
