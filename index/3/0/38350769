NOVA*STATUS is a text-retrieval system which is available at allNorwegian universities and several government institutions, runningon computers from different manufacturers.
NOVA*STATUS is a full-text retrieval system originally developedby AERE, Harwell, England, and redeveloped at the NorwegianComputing Centre for the Humanities and other Norwegianinstitutions. The data is divided into documents and each word (ora truncated part of it) in each document is potentially a key word.The format of the document is free. By use of prefixes it ispossible to divide each document into specific fields ofinformation.
A request to the system can consist of a Boolean expression ofwords and prefixes and relational expressions between prefixedwords. The system allows for macros which can be permanently storedwhich makes, for example, synonym lists possible. The system alsocontains procedures for off-line sorting and printing of cataloguesand for the coding of data for statistical analysis by SPSS.
At the Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities,NOVA*STATUS has been, and is still being used in a variety ofhumanistic archive applications. Several of these have a commondata format which consists of 20-30 defined fields of fixedinformation and one or more fields of free-text description ofe.g., photographs, paintings, archaeological and culturalartifacts, old buildings and documents. The second part of thepaper will describe the actual use of the system in these variousapplications.
