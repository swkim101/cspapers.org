In combinatorical problems from a set of great size elements with specified properties must be selected. Such problems arise in electrical and mechanical engineering. In this paper the characteristics of such problems are outlined. Then the problems are formulated in the state-space approach of problem solving. For the solution of these problems we applicate methods of artificial intelligence. The main steps of the algorithms, which we got as a result of our investigations from the point of view of problem solving, are described. The algorithms are based on heuristic rules or choosing effective operators during the solution process. Results of application are given.
