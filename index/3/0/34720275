Government funding of Computer Aided Design and Design Automation research can be beneficial if several kernel problems are addressed while leaving basic system integration to commercial system and semiconductor houses. Areas requiring basic research are:
 1. Device level optimization of chip layout for electrical performance.
 2. Methods for specifying and analyzing systems at a level above behavioral or algorithmic system definition.
 3. Self test and redundancy techniques.
