One of the major problems of relational database systems is to find efficient procedures for database operations. This paper discusses procedures to schedule join operations in a paging environment. We assume that the two relations required to be joined are divided into pages and that only a subset of all page-pairs (one page from each relation) are required to be processed. The number of page swappings varies depending on the sequence of the page-pair processing. Our problem is to find the schedules which require the least page-swapping counts. The problem, however, can be represented as a special case of the Hamiltonian path problem and thus it is shown to be NP-complete. Two sufficient conditions for the existence of the minimum solutions are shown, which are based on the Hamiltonian path condition and the Eular path condition. Using these conditions, heuristic procedures for near optimum solutions are obtained.
