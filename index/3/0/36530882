A programming by human demonstration (PHD) method playback of compliance trajectory is presented which utilizes compliance control to duplicate the human position and force trajectories when the parts being assembled are in the same location as during the demonstration, and will successfully adapt to certain variations in part location. To identify an appropriate compliance that will guarantee successful assembly, a second approach is presented that is based on multiple demonstrations. A criterion for selecting a compliance matrix is identified so that the robot errors in position and the maximum contact force will be less than those of the human, and that the robot will be able to achieve this level of performance as long as variation in workpiece location is not larger than during the demonstrations. The analysis is restricted to tasks which are demonstrated with a consistent sequence of subtasks, where each subtask consists of straight line translational motion.
