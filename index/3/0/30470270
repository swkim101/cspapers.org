It is proposed to use a processor in each direct storage device of a conventional computer system to improve the performance of a large data management system. These processors are used to search the physical records for the information desired. The effect of these processors on the critical performance parameters of the system (throughput of memory, channel, DASD, and CPU), and on the overall performance, is evaluated. It is shown that the proposed architecture solves certain performance problems associated with the storage subsystem and the CPU under heavy transaction traffic.
