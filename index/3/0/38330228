In order to provide a better learning and programing environment and to off-load users who do not need the resources of the mainframe, the University Computing Center at the University of Massachusetts implemented a programing lab for introductory programing courses. The lab uses miniframe workstations networked to the mainframe, avoiding problems usually inherent in more traditional micro labs. The workstations have menu-driven software. The hardware, the network, and the menu-driven software are described. Student evaluations and performance are discussed, and plans for future expansion are described.
