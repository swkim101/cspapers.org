When Mort asked me some weeks ago if I would be the kickoff speaker for this year's Design Automation Workshop, he told me about the general makeup of your group and high level of technical competence that would be represented here today. At first I was somewhat reluctant to accept because my own field of experience has not been with specific technical uses of computers, but rather with technical management of large groups of people concerned with development engineering on major missile programs. However, when I learned that my remarks could be directed toward broad future developments in design automation and its impact on the aerospace industry, and business in general, I accepted because I am extremely enthusiastic about the potential of computer technology in reshaping our traditional ways of doing things. I also welcome this opportunity to perhaps exchange ideas with your group which is in the forefront of a changing technology.
