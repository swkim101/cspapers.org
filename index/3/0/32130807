In this paper, we present a study on the visual navigation for a mobile robot. We perform the boundary detecting and color cluster techniques respectively to segment the road and nonroad. We propose a conception about useful information to decrease the computation, and compose the information with a special color coordinate base and the geometrical feature into a hybrid feature space to improve the color clustering.<<ETX>>
