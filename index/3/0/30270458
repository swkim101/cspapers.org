The members of this panel are experts in object and relational database technologies. The objective of this panel is to better understand the implications the choice of database technology has on the application developer using objects. Differentiating between the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches -relational (RDBMS), extended-relational and object (ODBMS) -can be a confusing task. The situation is becoming more complex as the technologies evolve to leverage each otherâ€™s strengths. Some RDBMSs are beginning to support some aspects of object technology and some ODBMSs are now supporting SQL query capabilities and interfaces.
