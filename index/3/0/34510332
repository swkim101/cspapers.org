Research in abstract argumentation typically pertains to finite argumentation frameworks (AFs). Actual or potential infinite AFs frequently occur if they are used for the purpose of nonmonotonic entailment, so-called instantiation-based argumentation, or if they are involved as modeling tool for dialogues, n-person-games or action sequences. Apart from these practical cases a profound analysis yields a better understanding of how the nonmonotonic theory of abstract argumentation works in general. In this paper we study a bunch of abstract properties like SCC-recursiveness, expressiveness or intertranslatability for unrestricted AFs.
