This paper describes a simple and original method to generate short UWB pulses, obtained by the transient response of a notch filter. Whose the first principle is based on a technique On-Off Keying signal with a carrier frequency centered at the rejection frequency (requires a very fast switch and a sinusoidal carrier). Now, we propose an all-digital solution, using a Phase-Shift Keying modulation to produce short pulses. We compare the both methods and show that pulses with a spectrum satisfying the FCC indoor regulatory mask in USA. The second method (without fast switch) which can be applied to the generation of pulses matched to any type of available spectrum mask (European, Asia, imaging, medical, outdoor, radar, ...). In both cases, circuits are realized at FCC to demonstrate these principles. It is shown that the measurements are in good agreement with the theory.
