A variable-length project for an introductory upper-division computer graphics course for majors is described. The project consists of the implementation of a graphics package based on the Graphical Kernel System (GKS, an ISO and ANSI standard) and application programs which demonstrate features of GKS. Any microcomputer with graphics capabilities equipped with an appropriate compiler can be used for the project. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of 2D computer graphics. A brief introduction to GKS is included.
