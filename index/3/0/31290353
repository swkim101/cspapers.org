In this paper the problem of controlling the motion of a nonholonomic vehicle along a desired trajectory using observations from an overhead camera is considered. The control problem is formulated in the image plane. We show that the system in the image plane is differentially flat and use this property to generate effective control strategies using only visual feedback. Simulation results illustrate the methodology and show robustness to errors in the camera calibration parameters.
