AS the size and complexity of integrated circuits increases, the need to "Floor Plan" designs becomes more and more obvious. To fill this need, a number of Floor Planning Systems have been proposed. These proposals and their implementations address a broad spectrum of approaches to the problem ranging from fully automatic to mostly manual. These systems also fit into a variety of places within the design cycle. This diversity indicates that the concept of floor planning is somewhat less than well defined. The question or "what floor planner and who uses it" will k: drscussed by the panel.
