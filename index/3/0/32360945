This workshop's goal is to establish a discussion of the best examples of effective and efficient HPC systems procurement. The concept of this workshop grew out of a panel session at the 2006 International Supercomputer Conference (ISC 2006). The goal of this workshop is accumulating and disseminating the shared expertise on assessing and acquiring HPC systems. This workshop will be the starting point to create a document of "best practices for HPC system procurements". Assuming initial success, this document could be kept alive with reports and input from sites that use and/or improve the practices.
