Three major issues in science education are the use of educational technology, problem-based learning, and the teaching of science in an integrated format. While the use of technology in the classroom has been growing rapidly and recognition of the effectiveness of active, problembased formats is spreading, implementation at most campuses is still piecemeal. The third issue of employing an integrated format is gaining momentum and has received national attention from professional organizations and funding agencies for the past several years. Change, however, is difficult due to the entrenched structure of single discipline-based instruction.
