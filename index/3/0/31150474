A top-down approach is presented for the derivation of, and corresponding exposition of sorting algorithms. Work done in automatic program synthesis has produced interesting results about sorting algorithms which suggest this approach. In particular insertion sort and selection sort are seen to be instances of merge sort and Quick sort, and sinking sort and bubble sort are presented as in-place versions of insertion sort and selection sort. This top-down approach is offered as an alternative way of deriving and ultimately teaching about sorting algorithms.
