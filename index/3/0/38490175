In this paper, detection and classification of steel surface defects is investigated. Image processing algorithms are applied for detecting four popular kind of steel defects, i.e., hole, scratch, Coil break and rust. The results show that the applied algorithms have a good performance on steel defect detection. Numerical results indicate that the implemented image processing algorithms have 88.4%, 78%, 90.4%, 90.3 % accuracy respectively on the hole, scratch, Coil break and rust defect.
