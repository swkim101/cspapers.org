Learning-based representations have become the defacto means to address computer vision tasks. Despite their massive adoption, the amount of work aiming at understanding the internal representations learned by these models is rather limited. Existing methods aimed at model interpretation either require exhaustive manual inspection of visualizations, or link internal network activations with external "possibly useful" annotated concepts. We propose an intermediate scheme in which, given a pretrained model, we automatically identify internal features relevant for the set of classes considered by the model, without requiring additional annotations. We interpret the model through average visualizations of these features. Then, at test time, we explain the network prediction by accompanying the predicted class label with supporting heatmap visualizations derived from the identified relevant features. In addition, we propose a method to address the artifacts introduced by strided operations in deconvnet-based visualizations. Our evaluation on the MNIST, ILSVRC 12 and Fashion 144k datasets quantitatively shows that the proposed method is able to identify relevant internal features for the classes of interest while improving the quality of the produced visualizations.
