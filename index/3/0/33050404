The Software Design and Documentation Language (SDDL) approach to software design automation consists of (1) a design and documentation language with forms and syntax that are simple, unrestrictive, and communicative, (2) a processor which can take design specifications written in the SDDL language and produce an intelligible, informative, machine reproducible document, and (3) methodology for effective use of language and processor for top-down design development. The language and processor capabilities are described and suggestions and guidelines for using SDDL are discussed.
