INTRODUCTION Model-based user interface design refers to a paradigm which uses an explicit, largely declarative representation capturing application semantics and other knowledge needed to specify the appearance and behavior of an interactive system. In this paradigm, an application developer instead of writing a large procedural program defines a model of facts, which controls behavior of reusable code, and a much smaller procedural program. The goal of the model-based UI design is to identify reusable components of a UI and to capture more knowledge in the model, while reducing the amount of new (procedural) code that has to be written for each new application.
