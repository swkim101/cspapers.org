Breast cancer is the most frequently life-threatening diagnosed type of cancer among women. Early and accurate diagnosis by acquiring a tissue sample using biopsy techniques is essential. However, small lesions only visible by MRI are often missed in standard methods, indicating the need for a robotic-assisted biopsy system that is MRI-compatible. Existing proof-of-concepts are difficult to employ due to large sizes and/or actuation complexities. Therefore, a compact pneumatically-actuated 5 DOF MRI-compatible robot was further developed and controlled by a computerized valve manifold. Accuracy and efficiency measurements have been performed using two different PVC breast phantoms with embedded fish oil capsules (mimicking lesions) inside a 0.25T MRI scanner. Preliminary results show that the end-effector was able to hit the targeted capsules, and that the position accuracy is in the range of 4.7â€“7.3 mm. The developed robotic system has potential to perform MRI-guided breast biopsies accurately and improve the clinical workflow.
