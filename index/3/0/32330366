This poster reports on a set of classroom interventions at a public urban university to reduce the failure and withdrawal rate in CS1. Though unsuccessful in their original goal of reducing the number of students withdrawing from the course or receiving poor grades, the interventions provided valuable information suggesting contributors to poor course outcomes. These included concurrent full-time enrollment and full-time employment and lack of foundational skills. We also found that at-risk students could be identified with a one-page quiz the third week of the semester. We have made several course revisions going forward, including restructuring programming assignments and adding online practice problems, and revised our academic advising procedures.
