We present PennCOSYVIO, a new challenging Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) benchmark with synchronized data from a VI-sensor (stereo camera and IMU), two Project Tango hand-held devices, and three GoPro Hero 4 cameras. Recorded at UPenn's Singh center, the 150m long path of the hand-held rig crosses from outdoors to indoors and includes rapid rotations, thereby testing the abilities of VIO and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms to handle changes in lighting, different textures, repetitive structures, and large glass surfaces. All sensors are synchronized and intrinsically and extrinsically calibrated. We demonstrate the accuracy with which ground-truth poses can be obtained via optic localization off of fiducial markers.
