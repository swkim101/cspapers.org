Along with rapid development and dilation of the urbanization in China, many existing MF AM-broadcast antennas need to be moved, renewed, and re-built. How to arrange multiple antennas of different frequency channels within a limited field become an important step of overall planning, before their individual design and establishment. In this article, the performances of an antenna under the environment of antennas group are analyzed firstly; and then the optimization method for planning the antennas group is introduced in sequence; and finally several practical applications are discussed.
