The increased importance of graphics in computer systems has made computer graphics a more visible and important part of computer science education. This graphics education can take any of several forms. This panel describes four of these: the graphics service course for non-majors, the graphics systems course, the graphics concepts and algorithms course, and advanced or graduate courses in graphics. This panel is based on part of a workshop presented at SIGGRAPH '87.
