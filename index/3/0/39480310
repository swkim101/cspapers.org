“Design and Test” inputs and outputs can be viewed as generic interfaces between product creators (system designers) and IC manufacturing. The interface is actually a set of engineering processes which transform the design inputs (specifications and requirements) into a data set that drives IC manufacturing. There is a gap between advances in manuafcturing and advances in design. Hence, the emphasis on design productivity. Design productivity can be viewed as a measure of the efficiency of the resource (people, skills, methodologies, computers, tools, libraries, etc.) when applied to these processes to meet design input requirements. Some resources and processes are “hard” and can be readily quantified, e.g., numbers of computers, tools, and people. Other are more elusive, e.g., organization skill set, “quality” of specification code, methodologies, etc. How to measure and improve design productivity is the topic addressed by the panel.
