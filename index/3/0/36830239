Student experience in introductory computer science classes can be enhanced by applying static analysis techniques to automatically grade assignments. At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), introductory computer science classes (using Python) exceed 650 students in size. As resources are limited, it is infeasible to have teaching staff individually examine each student's answer for small in-lecture exercises; however, qualitative data regarding student code independent from execution is still valuable (and in some cases required) to assess progress. When static analysis utilities were made available to instructors and integrated with automatic assignment testing, instructors were able to judge student performance and provide feedback at a scale that would otherwise be infeasible. There are clear advantages to applying static analysis techniques in comparison to less sophisticated methods (e.g. regular-expression based search). For one, students are unable to subvert grading by placing certain keywords within comments or string literals. Static analysis can also be applied to easily grade students on patterns that would be nontrivial to detect using a more naive method, for example in enforcing a rule that all member variables of a C++ class must be private, or verifying that a function takes the appropriate number and type of arguments.
