Browsers [1-2] are now among the most popular software for people to surf web pages and retrieve information from Internet for their own interest. However, people usually find the information they search for are scattered in several web pages, and cannot specify which parts of contents are interesting and how these parts are presented. In other words, todayâ€™s browsers are weak in personalization. To enhance the capability of personalization, browsers must have more power in managing contents of web pages. In this demo, we apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create a browser that can be personalized.
