Human Factors research is concerned primarily with minimizing unpredictable behavior in computer-based systems. Much Human Factors research stresses simplification of computer-based work into discrete, standard, and measurable sub-tasks. The performance of these elemental work-fragments can then be compared against “expert” performance times. In addition to increased worker output, simplified and standardized jobs allow managers to control work more completely. Similarly, standardized jobs usually allow the use of less-skilled labor.
 This aspect of Human Factors research is an outgrowth of Scientific Management (“time and motion” studies) and, ironically, the management theories of Charles Babbage, the 19th-century inventor of the computer. Scientific Management and Human Factors research share a number of important assumptions. For the most part, these assumptions have not been subjected to careful scrutiny. In time, they may prove the source of significant problems for both systems designers and users.
