This paper illustrates the use of Augmented Transition Networks (ATNs) as a design tool for constructing document retrieval systems for those personalized applications which are too small or specialized to attract a commercial vendor. ATNs, which are explained in the context of this application, are used not only to improve the human/computer interface with the retrieval system but also to conceptually organize its structure.
