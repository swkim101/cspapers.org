The European Commission opens in its 7th IST call for proposals an action line for Semantic Web Technologies. It builds on ideas that have been looming for many years but have received their greatest push when the World Wide Web Consortium set up an interest group on that theme. The Semantic Web aims to make content machine understandable in order to automate a wide range of new tasks within the context of heterogeneous and distributed systems. The action line centres on four aspects: formalisation of the semantics, derivation of attributes, intelligent ltering and information visualisation. The Web is currently a mighty collection of ashy data but diAEcult to exploit. Adding semantics to content and ensuring their interoperability will turn it into an eAEcient knowledge source.
