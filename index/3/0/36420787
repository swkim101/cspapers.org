Automated software engineering is concerned with how to apply computation to automate or partially automate software engineering tasks to achieve significant improvements in quality and productivity. Tools therefore play a dominant role within automated software engineering. The tool demonstration session at the ASEâ€™06 conference accounts for that by providing a forum to show and discuss new tool developments that highlight scientific contributions to the field of Automated Software Engineering. This year we have 9 tool demonstrations, each of which was reviewed by two reviewers. Each tool demonstration will have a time slot in the conference program, and also will be given a space at the conference site where conference attendees will be able to ask additional questions and see a personal demonstration.
