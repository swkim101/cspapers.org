We propose a new browsing system called "Web2Talkshow". It transforms declarative-based web content into humorous dialog-based TV-program-like content that is presented through cartoon animation and synthesized speech. The system does this based on keywords in the original web content. Web2Talkshow enable users to get desired web content easily, pleasantly, and in a user-friendly way while being able to continue working on other tasks. Thus, using it will be much like watching TV.
