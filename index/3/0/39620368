The Web of Things is a scenario where potentially billions of connected smart objects communicate using the Web protocols, HTTP in primis. A Web of Things envisioning and design has raised several research issues, from protocols adoption and communication models to architectural styles and social aspects facing. In this demo we present the prototype of a scalable architecture for a large scale social Web of Things for smart objects and services, named Paraimpu. It is a Web-based platform which allows to add, use, share and inter-connect real HTTP-enabled smart objects and "virtual" things like services on the Web and social networks. Paraimpu defines and uses few strong abstractions, in order to allow mash-ups of heterogeneous things introducing powerful rules for data adaptation. Adding and inter-connecting objects is supported through user friendly models and features.
