Q: What is a junior or community college?
 A: A college that offers two years of a four year undergraduate degree.
 Based on such an answer it would be assumed that the difference between a four-year and a two-year college is just thatâ€”one offers four years of education and the other only two. The assumption, however, fails to recognize two less obvious but major differences between the two types of institutions: educational objectives, and student population. Differences in these factors affect all areas of a college including curricula offerings and faculty selection.
 For purposes of this discussion we will examine these two factors (educational objectives and student population) only in terms of computer related curricula.
