In May 1993, 80 CS faculty horn around the country participated in an NSF-funded workshop at Brooklyn College to consider a particular theme-based approach in a non-traditional computer literacy course. The goal of the workshop was, first, to explain the approach to the participants and, second, to ask the participants for their reactions to and suggestions about our course. We also hoped to hear about other approaches to teaching such a course.
