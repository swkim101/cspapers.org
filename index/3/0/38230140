The main methods used for demining on land are manual detection using metal detectors and prodders, detection by specially trained dogs and mechanical clearance using armored vehicles fitted with frails, tillers or similar devices, however in all the methods the position of mine prior to detection is unknown. A lot of causalities occur during demining operation. Existing mechanical systems are expensive and very difficult to deploy specially in those areas where it is not possible to take heavy machinery. Due to the advancement in tracking systems, an integrated system employing latest tracking techniques using laser range finder as tracker can be used to detect the exact location of mine in the minefield. Radio frequency transmitter controls the aerospace vehicle. This new idea of detecting mines by integrating the above-mentioned technologies is implemented on a home made hovercraft using laser range finder system as a tracking tool thus providing a fixed reference point.
