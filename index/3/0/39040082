A description of gait is presented which enables modeling and visualization of intra-limb leg and body motions, and control of these motions by rider inputs. The rider inputs feed into a neural network, the outputs of which feed into a gait simulator which controls the gait by means of a finite state machine controller. Simulation results are presented for gaits seen in exhibition horse riding. The simulation runs in real time on a Silicon Graphics IrisCrimson VGXT.
