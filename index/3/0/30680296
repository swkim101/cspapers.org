How do you prepare students today, to work on the most widely available computing platforms of tomorrow? Programmable cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) have already become more numerous then PCs. With their small size and mobility, these devices present both new opportunities and unique software engineering challenges like small memory models, cross-platform development, state machines, and wireless networking. You will learn how to use the Java Micro Edition (J2ME) to easily develop labs based on arcade and logic games that will motivate and excite your students. In this session we will present the initial results of a NSF CCLI project to develop materials for Handheld and Ubiquitous Computing in the Undergraduate Curriculum.
