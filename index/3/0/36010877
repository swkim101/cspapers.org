We propose a demonstration of EmStar’s tools and services and showcase some applications written in EmStar. EmStar is a software environment for developing and deploying wireless sensor network applications on a mixture of deployed devices from 8-bit Motes running TinyOS to 32bit Microservers running Linux. EmStar provides libraries that implement message-passing IPC primitives, tools that support simulation, emulation, and visualization of live systems, both real and simulated, and services that support networking, sensing, and time synchronization. In particular, EmTOS is a service that allows developers to execute TinyOS code on a simulated Mote within the EmStar framework. While EmStar’s design has favored ease of use and modularity over efficiency, the resulting increase in overhead has not been an impediment to any of our current projects. The demonstration will highlight various EmStar tools, features, and services: laptop simulation of a tiered network of Motes and Microservers; a laptop simulation interacting with ”real nodes” (i.e. simulated Motes communicating with real Motes); visualization of links and node states; time synchronization; link statistics; etc. Furthermore, we’ll demonstrate the ease at which EmStar programs transition from a simulated environment to a deployed environment running on real nodes. An example EmStar progam is a delay tolerant networking application that moves data along a linear
