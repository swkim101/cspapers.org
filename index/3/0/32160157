We propose to study the average response time distribution of tasks owing to the pessirnism introduced by the analysis of the synchronous case and unsafe response t irne obtained by sirnulation. In this regard, the problem we address is twofold. First, we need to determine a relevant and safe probabilistic feasibility interval that is representative of the systems behaviour over its entire lifetirne. Second, we need to compute the response time distribution of any job of a task within this feasibility interval in order to combine them into an average distribution. This is a complex problem due to the fact that job arrivals are variable as well as their execution times. As feasibility interval, we define the probabilistic hyperperiod which is an extension of the deterministic hyperperiod used in state of the art analyses.
