Instead of studying the properties of social relationship from an objective view, in this paper, we focus on the two individuals' subjective and asymmetric opinions on their interrelationships. The sociolinguistics theories propose to characterize the individuals' opinions of their interrelationship with interactive language features. With this inspiration, we investigate the subjective asymmetry of the interrelationship with the asymmetry of the interactive language features including the frequency, quantity, quality and emotion. Experimental results with Enron email corpus provide suggestive evidences and thus reveal that the pair-wise language styles on an interrelationship are asymmetric, and this asymmetry can be a joint effect of the individuals' opinions of the interrelationship and their personal language habits. The results also indicate that the degree of the asymmetry could be related to the individuals' personality traits.
