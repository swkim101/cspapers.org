Search engines in online communities such as Twitter or Facebook not only return matching posts, but also provide links to the profiles of the authors. Thus, when a user appears in the top-k results for a sensitive keyword query, she becomes widely exposed in a sensitive context. The effects of such exposure can result in a serious privacy violation, ranging from embarrassment all the way to becoming a victim of organizational discrimination. In this paper, we propose the first model for quantifying search exposure on the service provider side, casting it into a reverse k-nearest-neighbor problem. Moreover, since a single user can be exposed by a large number of queries, we also devise a learning-to-rank method for identifying the most critical queries and thus making the warnings user-friendly. We develop efficient algorithms, and present experiments with a large number of user profiles from Twitter that demonstrate the practical viability and effectiveness of our framework.
