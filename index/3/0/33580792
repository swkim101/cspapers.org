The members of this panel are active in the area of standardization of object and database technologies. The objective of this panel is to better understand current activities related to objects and database standards and the prognosis for reaching agreement. For years now there has been tension not only between the object and database worlds, but also within the database world between the objectdatabase and relational-database communities. These tensions surface in efforts to standardize the object and database technologies. There are several groups involved in these efforts: this panel represents the viewpoints of the Object Management Group (OMG), the Object Database Management Group (ODMG), the ANSI X3H2 SQL Database Technical Committee, and the ANSI X3H7 Object Information Management Technical Committee.
