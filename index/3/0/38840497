Generic Dispatcher Service 5 ● A single service instance is not sufficient to provide low response times and high availability. ● Therefore, several instances of a service run concurrently on several hosts and our dispatcher avoids load skews performing load balancing. ● This dispatcher service (Layer-7 switch), acts as proxy for arbitrary services and is a generic solution for such situations. ● The dispatcher is implemented as a regular service. Therefore, it is more flexible, extensible, and seamlessly integrated into the service platform. ● Special feature: automatic service replication
