The conceptual system in medicine can be ordered by a relation between two concepts. We can then define a lattice structure over the ordered conceptual system. Such a lattice whose elments are the aggeregates of concepts can be used to simulate the inferential process of medical decision making. This model can potentially unify all models so far proposed for computer-based medical decision making, from both the statistical and empirical (AI) approaches. When combined with the semi-empirical approach, the model is able to constitute the computer algorithm which is most suited to attack the diagnostic problems, even where neither number of sample data per disease categories are large nor reliable medical knowledge has been provided. The model is also a good guideline by which one can clarify relations between medical terms and concepts, and to organize logical thinking into a knowledge system.
