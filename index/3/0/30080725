Most people spend more than 90% of their time indoors. Indoor air quality (IAQ) influences human health, safety, productivity, and comfort. This demo introduces MAQS, a personalized mobile sensing system for IAQ monitoring. In contrast with existing stationary or outdoor air quality sensing systems, MAQS users carry portable, indoor location tracking sensors that provide personalized IAQ information. To improve accuracy and energy efficiency, MAQS incorporates three novel techniques: (1) an accurate temporal n-gram augmented Bayesian room localization method; (2) an air exchange rate based IAQ sensing method; and (3) a zone-based proximity detection method for collaborative sensing.
