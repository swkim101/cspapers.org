For this class of problems the solution can be represented as a plan tree, branching on various possible observations. Recent successful approaches translate the partially observable contingent problem into a non-deterministic fully observable problem, and then use a planner for non-deterministic planning. While this approach has been successful in many domains, the translation may become very large, encumbering the task of the non-deterministic planner. In this paper we suggest a different approach - using an online contingent solver repeatedly to construct a plan tree. We execute the plan returned by the online solver until the next observation action, and then branch on the possible observed values, and replan for every branch independently. In many cases a plan tree can be exponential in the number of state variables, but still, the tree has a structure that allows us to compactly represent it using a directed graph. We suggest a mechanism for tailoring such a graph that reduces both the computational effort and the storage space. Furthermore, unlike recent state of the art offline planners, our approach is not bounded to a specific class of contingent problems, such as limited problem width, or simple contingent problems. We present a set of experiments, showing our approach to scale better than state of the art offline planners.
