Scatter/Gather is designed to stimulate is a very open dialog of new ideas and emerging work. This is your chance to tell everyone about your new idea! This year we'll modify the format a bit to more closely resemble an "un-conference" in which the meeting is driven and created dynamically by the participants. We'll use a whiteboard to self-organize so look for the sign-up display at the conference near the registration area -- but don't delay because time-slots are limited and it's first-come, first-served. Remember, the idea is to share and get feedback on your ideas, not make a polished presentation!
