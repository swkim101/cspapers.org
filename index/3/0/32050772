Presents a combined system for hand and finger kinesthetic feedback for the exploration and manipulation of different kinds of rigid objects in virtual environments. A three-degrees-of-freedom haptic interface, called DeKiFeD3 (Desktop Kinesthetic Feedback Device 3), with the capability of generating kinesthetic hand feedback, is combined with a commercial haptic glove to generate additional kinesthetic feedback to the fingers of a human operator. This system results in a new quality of kinesthetic perception and needs appropriate rendering algorithms, as described in this paper. The paper also presents an approach to improve the operator's immersion into a virtual scenario by adding auditory and visual feedback.
