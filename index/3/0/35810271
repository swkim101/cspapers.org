This paper describes a program that learns procedures by examining worked-out examples in a textbook and bv working problems two kinds of production (If-then) rules are created: working forward rules that produce an action when a proceduie is executed and difference rules that suggest operators from observed transformations. Dining example learning, the program examines two states in an example, fig tires out the operator that produced the second state and creates a production with some part ot the first line in the condition with the operator-tor in the action. During learning by working problems, the program generates its own example trace by problem solving and uses the same example learning techniques.
