The main aim of this paper is to indicate how various losses may be reduced or avoided when the development of software does not proceed according to its schedule; i.e., if what we call “bankruptcy” occurs. Data were collected from twenty three projects in various types of applications, the projects together containing a million lines of code. The causes of failure in developing software were obtained by interviewing the managers of the projects under observation. Having analysed these two aspects, this paper points out under what circumstances managers are likely to fail and proposes a method of detecting failures in the software development.
