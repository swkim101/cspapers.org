A monitoring and control system is being developed for the Aperture Array Verificaton System (AAVS) prototype of the Low Frequency Aperture Array (LFAA) component of the Squatre Kilometer Array (SKA). This software system will have to continuously monitor hundreds of thousands of antennas; schedule, run and monitor observations; control the data flow within the element and outwards; and provide the operational and diagnostic utilities for the system. This paper will describe the various elements of the software stack and the integration with the TANGO control system framework.
