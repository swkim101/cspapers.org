Design courses in Computer Systems Design are being taught in many undergraduate programs both for Computer Science and Electrical Engineering students. A design project is explained in this paper to give all the information to the students regarding the important concepts in both logic and systems level. The computer has sixteen instructions, two K memory and a single index register. This project can also be enlarged by introducing many extra hardware features.
