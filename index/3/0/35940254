As new input devices for interactive systems appear (e.g., eye pointing devices, data gloves, motion detection systems, speech recognition systems), devices based on bioelectric signals are emerging. They are still very few and mainly used for electronic music systems. This development, which have been pioneered by Rosenboom (1976), originates from the desire to control electronic music by biofeedback techniques. For example, he designed sophisticated systems which allow one to control music by the brain waves.
