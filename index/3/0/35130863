A design procedure of a special UHF RFID tag antenna is presented in this paper. The final antenna is matched well with the ST Microelectronics XRAG2 chip at the intended resonant frequency with bandwidth of 33 MHz and has omni-directional beam patterns with gain of 1.86 dBi. A prototype has been successfully fabricated, tested by Rohde & Shwarz ZVB Vector Network Analyzer and showed good fit with the simulation results.
