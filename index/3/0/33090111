We have been trying to explore embodied cognition by putting computational cognitive models on physical robots. We believe that there are three primary advantages to doing so: 1. Algorithms written for traditional real-time robotic systems tend to use efficient mathematical representations such as matrices, which may not be natural for people to use. People seem to use a combination of spatial and propositional knowledge (Shepard & Metzler, 1971;Taylor & Tversky, 1992). Using common representations also eliminates complex processes of translation and decreases confusion due to loss of information. 2. Second, if a human is going to collaborate in shared space with a robot, the robot should not exhibit unnatural or “alien” behaviors. Therefore, we propose that some robot behaviors should be modeled on human performance of a task. 3. Third, we believe that in some areas of robotics, the use of computational cognitive models, rather than traditional control algorithms, is simply a better programming technique for the task. For a domain, we have chosen hide and seek, because it forces us to work in a complex, dynamic environment, it allows us to explore embodied cognition issues (i.e., when is someone hiding?), and allows us to explore methods of combining both cognitive and robotic/AI methods into a single system. Hide and seek also encapsulates many interesting real-world tasks including urban search and rescue, homeland defense (finding nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons), and military actions such as finding hidden troops. In our previous work (Trafton, et al., 2004), we have described a case study of a young child learning how to play hide and seek. We built an ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998) model of the sequence of learning that the child went through, put that model on the robot, and showed that the robot is able to learn where the appropriate places to hide are, and play hide and seek. We were able
