Phoebus is a project whose goal is to allow legacy applications to utilize high bandwidth connections over Internet2's Hybrid Packet Optical Infrastructure (HOPI) backbone. Phoebus works by breaking a single end-to-end TCP connection into a series of transport layer connections. The end connections (from Internet2 edge nodes to the end hosts) still use TCP. However, the connection over the Internet2 backbone is handled by server software running on the edge nodes. These servers can then choose the best transport protocol and protocol settings for sending the data across Internet2. Using this service, end users are no longer required to modify a variety of TCP settings in order to achieve good performance over long distances. The end users only need to be concerned about ensuring adequate speed across the path between themselves and the Internet2 edge nodes. In many cases, the default TCP settings will prove adequate for achieving acceptable speeds.
