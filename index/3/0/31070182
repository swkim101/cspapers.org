Portraits in Practice invites companies with technically advanced software-engineering practices and intriguing research challenges to discuss them with the ICSE 2007 participants. The sessions in this track let researchers hear industrial practitioners describe their projects and concerns in some detail, and they let other practitioners hear what technologies these companies recommend. The track provides an open discussion and blunt assessment of future needs with experts from these leading industries. The goal is to encourage and foment improved communication between leading companies and academic researchers.
