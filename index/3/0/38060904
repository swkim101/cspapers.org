The teleprogramming system employs a supervisory control approach where operator interaction with a virtual environment directs the actions of a remote manipulator operating semi-autonomously. We focus on the detection, diagnosis, and recovery from unexpected situations frequently arising during normal operation. The teleprogramming system employs a single thread approach to error recovery that is inherent in the system design. We perform two experimental tasks, each highlighting a different role for the operator, using the teleprogramming system with a simulated communication time delay of 10 seconds. In the first task of inserting and extracting bolts, the operator assumes the role of "task level reasoning" or task planning and sequencing, task state reasoning, and diagnostic procedure generation. In the second task, puncturing and slicing duct tape, the operator performs "action level reasoning" or diagnosing and correcting unexpected situations and determining success of actions. Our experimental results indicate that complex tasks can be accomplished when the operator is provided multiple and overlapping forms of feedback.<<ETX>>
