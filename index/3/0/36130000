Spotify provides users with access to a massive repository of streaming music. While some aspects of music access are familiar to the information retrieval community (e.g. semistructured data, item recommendation), nuances of the music domain require the development of new models of user understanding, intent modeling, relevance, and content understanding. These models can be studied using the large amount of content and usage data at Spotify, allowing us to extend previous results in the music information retrieval community. In this presentation, we will highlight the research involved in developing Spotify and outline a research program for large scale music access.
