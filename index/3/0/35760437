While mobile apps for smartphones are consistently popular, the most common way for users to explore the Internet is still through the WWW. Websites are however not explicitly equipped with information regarding their location -- an issue for use on mobile devices. With this work we aim at bridging this gap by adding a location layer to websites and letting users browse by nearby websites. We present a mobile demonstrator called Webnear.me. Once installed on the smartphone, users are able to list websites in proximity their location: Near.me. Websites in proximity to another one can be browsed too: Near.this. With our application we strive to give answers to the question of how web content should be tagged with locations. We approach this question with several content- and user-centric location-tagging methods.
