There has been a lot of work on evaluating and improving the relevance of web search engines. In this paper, we suggest using human computation games to elicit data from players that can be used to improve search. We describe Page Hunt, a single-player game. The data elicited using Page Hunt has several applications including providing metadata for pages, providing query alterations for use in query refinement, and identifying ranking issues. We describe an experiment with over 340 game players, and highlight some interesting aspects of the data obtained.
