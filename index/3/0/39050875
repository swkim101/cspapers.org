The Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) of ABET evaluates programs utilizing outcomes-based assessment methods. To better support the outcome-based accreditation concept, the proposed new computing accreditation criteria do not include detailed curriculum standards. Instead, they expect programs to clearly define program outcomes and objectives, establish an assessment process to determine the extent to which these outcomes and objectives are achieved by graduates, and use the data thus collected to improve the program. The quality improvement processes used in higher education thus reflect the quality improvement processes that have proven useful in other industries. During this session we will discuss the assessment process with the objective of helping programs develop and carry out an assessment plan with ease.
