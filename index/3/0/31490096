In this demonstration we present Pulsar, a speed-of-light propagation-aware time synchronization platform. Pulsar uses ultra-wideband (UWB) radios for time transfer with each node backed by a chip scale atomic clock (CSAC) that in combination are able to provide accuracy on the order of 10's of nanoseconds for indoor applications. The demonstration will show two Pulsar boards generating a tightly synchronized PPS output that is able to adjust for the distance between the nodes. Even without communication, the devices maintain synchronization over multiple seconds due to a stable CSAC clocking the system.
