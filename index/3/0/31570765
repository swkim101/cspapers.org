Printed circuit board design time can be greatly reduced by the use of a computer program called ACCEL developed jointly by Sandia Corporation and the Thomas Bede Foundation under contract to Sandia. ACCEL is a program which designs printed circuit boards and produces the drawings for their construction. The input is encoded from an engineer's schematic diagram by a clerk with no knowledge of electronics. The outputs of the program are a schematic, parts list, printed circuit negative, assembly drawing, and a hole drilling list. ACCEL is written in Fortran II for the IBM 7090 computer and the drawings are produced on the Stromberg Carlson 4020 cathode ray tube plotter.
