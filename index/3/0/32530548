A geometric map which quantitatively represents the locations of entities in the environment are widely employed for indoor navigation. Navigation based on a geometric map provides high accuracy in positioning, but making an accurate map for a large area is difficult. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes a framework of indoor navigation based on a partially quantitative map. The map comprises the models of geometric entities in the environment, the locations of which are partially defined. Using the partial information, the robot searches and recognizes entities as a landmark while navigating in the environment.
