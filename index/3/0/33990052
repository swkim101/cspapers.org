1. SUMMARY The keyboard and mouse combination has been the dominant input paradigm for mainstream computers for several decades. Recently, however, we are seeing increased interest in pen-based and touch-based input techniques that rely on interpreting "strokes." This tutorial will help faculty members understand the importance of, and challenges associated with, the stroke based interaction paradigm. Attendees will learn about a simple algorithm called "Elastic Matching" that can be used recognize single strokes. At the same time, attendees will learn how unistroke recognition and the Elastic Matching algorithm can be used as the basis for a timely and compelling project for CS1 students.
