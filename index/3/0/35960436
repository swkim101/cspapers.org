Wireless communication is one of the most attractive and productive areas in today's communication field. So far, wireless systems have been optimized in terms of spectrum efficiency and transmission reliability. However, most of the recent research efforts have ignored the importance of wireless network's environmental responsibility, e.g., energy efficiency and environmental impact. Recently, it has been shown that the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is growing faster than originally predicted. This realization has led to a push towards “green” wireless communications that strives for improving energy efficiency as well as reducing environmental impact. The need to develop green wireless communication systems turns out to be more and more urgent as wireless networks are becoming ubiquitous. This talk identifies many research and industry opportunities to enable future green wireless communications.
