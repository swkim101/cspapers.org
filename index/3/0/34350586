Websites need to be displayed on a panoply of different devices today, but most websites are designed with fixed widths only appropriate to browsers on workstation computers. We propose to programmatically rewrite websites into responsive formats capable of adapting to different device display sizes. To accomplish this goal, we cast retargeting as a cross-compilation problem. We decompose existing HTML pages into boxes (lexing), infer hierarchical structure between these boxes (parsing) and finally generate parameterized layouts from the hierarchical structure (code generation). This document describes preliminary work on ReMorph, a prototype 'retargeting as cross-compilation' system.
