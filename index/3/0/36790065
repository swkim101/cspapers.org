We are presenting the most recent version of MEAD (v. 3.08), a large-scale public-domain summarizer that has been used in a number of applications, including the 2001 JHU summer workshop and the NewsInEssence project (www.newsinessence.com). A version of MEAD finished in first place on task 4 at DUC 2003 and finished in the top three on two other tasks.
