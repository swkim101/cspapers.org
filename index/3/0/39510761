We are pleased to present the proceedings of the 2006 Workshop on Memory Systems Performance and Correctness (MSPC 2006). MSPC focuses on improving the memory system performance and correctness of general-purpose programs. MSPC continues the successful series of Memory Systems Performance workshops held in 2002 (Berlin), 2004 (Washington, DC), and 2005 (Chicago). This year, the steering committee decided to add a correctness aspect to the workshop. This multi-disciplinary workshop fosters collaboration among researchers in a range of fields including compilers, memory management, programming languages, architecture, operating systems, performance evaluation, and database systems.MSPC 2006 solicited papers on all aspects of memory system performance and correctness. We received twenty-seven submissions. Each paper received three reviews from the program committee. The program committee met on September 5 via teleconference and selected the eleven papers in these proceedings. The final program contains papers covering a broad range of topics, including traditional topics such as cache design and garbage collection, as well as new topics such as memory models for transactional memory and memory management techniques for improving reliability. In addition to the papers, we are fortunate to include a keynote talk from David Wood on the memory systems challenges of multi-core processors.
