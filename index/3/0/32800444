As more programming environments add logging features and programming data becomes more accessible, it is important to have a conversation about how we share and use this data. Uses of programming log data range from big-picture analyses to dashboards for instant teacher feedback, to intelligent, data-driven learning environments. The goal of this BOF is to talk about what data is important to collect, where it can be gathered and shared, what general data formats make sense, how to handle privacy and anonymization, and what ultimately we want to see the data used for. The BOF welcomes both producers of programming log data and current or potential consumers, interested in how it could be applied in their classrooms or research. One hopeful outcome of this BOF is a commitment to documenting and sharing existing programming data in an accessible location and format.
