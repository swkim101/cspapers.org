With the advent of micro/mini computers and timesharing facilities, personalized information systems are a reality. Computing courses are needed that can successfully raise the competency level of the general college student to the point where the computer can be used as a powerful tool. At present, curriculum development abounds, and is being extended, for courses that pertain to future applications and system programmers. However, curriculum development related to meeting degree tool requirements is centered only around the first course in computing, typically either an elementary programming course, or one which provides an introduction to computers and society. This paper describes a course in personalized applications libraries to be used as a follow-up to the typical first computing course, with the objective of enabling students to be more successful in realistically meeting tool requirements. The paper includes a course overview, catalog description, course outline, and a bibliography of related reference material.
