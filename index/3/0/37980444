A general framework for update-based planning is presented. We first give a new family of dependence-based update operators that are wellsuited to the representation of simple actions and we identify the complexity of query entailment from an updated belief base. Then we introduce conditional, nondeterministic and concurrent updates so as to encode the corresponding types of action effects. Plan verification and existence are expressed in this update-based framework.
