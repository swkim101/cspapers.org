This paper presents a new hierarchical scheduling method for a large-scale production system based on a hierarchical Petri net model, which consists of FOHPN and TPN. The automobile production system equipped with 2 stand-by lines is focused as one of a typical large-scale system and these stand-by lines are controlled by binary signal. In a high level, the FOHPN model is used to represent continuous flow in production of an entire system, and MLD description is used to control the net dynamics of FOHPN. Also in a low level, TPN is used to represent production environment of each sub-line in a decentralized manner, and MCT algorithm is applied to find a feasible semi-optimal process sequences for each sub-line.
