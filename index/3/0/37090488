The study of genetic algorithms (GAs) in the undergraduate curriculum introduces students to parallel search strategies and to experimental design. Not only does it build on the topics covered in an Analysis of Algorithms course but it exposes students to issues such as the importance of the form of representation to solving a problem and to the difficulties encountered when a local minima is selected as the solution rather than the best global solution. As an illustration of the merits of including genetic algorithms in the curriculum, an undergraduate research project investigating the use of a diploid sexual model for crossover operations is described.
