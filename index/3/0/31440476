VLSI technology is rapidly approaching a million devices per “random” logic chip. The potential complexity of such chips will exceed the ability of humans to organize and layout the silicon, and bring out a product in a competitive and timely market position.
 Traditional computer aided layout techniques will flounder and low layout densities and/or excessive computer costs, and the fast changing technology will obsolete all library data almost as soon as it is used (or before).
