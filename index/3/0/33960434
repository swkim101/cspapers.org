Computer science departments require a richness of computer support that is virtually unique among other academic disciplines. Not only is good computer service a necessity, but a variety of languages and modes of operation on a modern system are also required. In many cases these computing needs can be met through the use of a large computer system located on the campus. However, oftentimes neither a new (or a small) department nor its host institution can afford to support such a large scale system. Thus, a choice arises between the use of a limited local capacity and a richer but remote capacity. As the computing hub of the Regional Computing Network for schools in the San Francisco Bay Area for the past two years, Stanford has had an opportunity to observe and evaluate the impact of network computing in this regard. It is the purpose of this paper to report upon some of these observations for the benefit of those who may become involved with a network decision, either as a supplier or as a user of network service.
