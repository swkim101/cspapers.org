The 4th International Workshop on Patent Information Retrieval builds on the experiences of the first three workshops, to provide its participants an exciting, scientifically challenging and interactive event, where specific issues of patent retrieval may be put into the general context of Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management, in order to explore innovative solutions to new and old problems, but also to evaluate and adapt traditional or classic approaches to new problems. This year, we observe an increase in the use of standardized test collections in the contributions received, and, at the same time, new discussion points on how to make such standardized evaluation exercises more accessible to the larger IP community.
