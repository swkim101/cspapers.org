Innovative cabling solutions will be a key factor in realizing next generation supercomputing clusters. Demands for higher data rates, larger clusters, and increased density cannot be optimally addressed with existing twin-axial cabling solutions. Quellan, Inc.'s family of low power, low latency Lane Manager ICs provide a 2x reach extension over standard cable for single lane data rates up to 6.25 Gb/s. In addition, the Lane Managers can facilitate increased density and improved airflow through clusters by enabling narrow gauge cables to operate at maximum lengths comparable to that of standard 24AWG cabling. Integrated higher layer features ensure compliance with a variety of current and emerging standards such as Infiniband, PCI Express, and CX-4. This presentation will highlight the performance and advanced features set of the Lane Manager family while also detailing the benefits of this technology for addressing various signal integrity challenges inherent to the cabling infrastructure of supercomputing clusters.
