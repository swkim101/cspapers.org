We present D-ForenRIA, a distributed forensic tool to automatically reconstruct user-sessions in Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), using solely the full HTTP traces of the sessions as input. D-ForenRIA recovers automatically each browser state, reconstructs the DOMs and re-creates screenshots of what was displayed to the user. The tool also recovers every action taken by the user on each state, including the user-input data. Our application domain is security forensics, where sometimes months-old sessions must be quickly reconstructed for immediate inspection. We will demonstrate our tool on a series of RIAs, including a vulnerable banking application created by IBM Security for testing purposes. In that case study, the attacker visits the vulnerable web site, and exploits several vulnerabilities (SQL-injections, XSS...) to gain access to private information and to perform unauthorized transactions. D-ForenRIA can reconstruct the session, including screenshots of all pages seen by the hacker, DOM of each page and the steps taken for unauthorized login and the inputs hacker exploited for the SQL-injection attack. D-ForenRIA is made efficient by applying advanced reconstruction techniques and by using several browsers concurrently to speed up the reconstruction process. Although we developed D-ForenRIA in the context of security forensics, the tool can also be useful in other contexts such as aided RIAs debugging and automated RIAs scanning.
