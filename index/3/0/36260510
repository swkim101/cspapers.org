A parallel processing method of rotating and comparing three-dimensional objects is presented. The multi-processor has an abstract structure in which the Individual processors are located at the vertices of a geodesic dome. The design has been tested on the same type of object matching problems as Shepard (3) used in his mental rotation experiments with human subjects. The same linear "reaction time" behaviour is found.
