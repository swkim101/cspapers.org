Analyzing, mining and extracting information from data does not require a full featured database, but rather simply the ability to work with persistent data. Advantages of ‘(light weight” data management include: 1) Light weight software tools allow applications to have high performance, low overhead access to persistent data. 2) Light weight software tools can easily be customized and optimized. We have developed a software tool called PToo1 that provides high performance, low overhead access to persistent data. PToo1 is usually used as a library, which when linked to a C++ application provides persistence for instances of C++ classes which are created using an overloaded “new” operator. Our primary target applications are scientific computing and data mining. For this reason, PToo1 does not support transactions, back up and recovery, or any of the other functionality usually associated with an object oriented database. Furthermore, our applications primarily involve read only data and generally require very high performance. PToo1 allows the programmer to specify when they need only read access, allowing it to optimize access time. The physical design of PToo1 is based upon the management of contiguous physical collections of memory pages, or segments, and physical collections of segments which we call folios. There are three basic components to the system: a Persistent Object Manager and a Segment and Folio Manager. The philosophy underlying the design of PToo1 is to rely on functions of the operating system, file system and compiler whenever possible, even at the risk of somewhat reduced performance. For example, PToo1 uses the operating system’s memory management facilities to provide the basic persistence; the file system’s input-output operations to manage the segments and
