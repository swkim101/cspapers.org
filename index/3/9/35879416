Passkeys have been around since personal phones have existed. The typical numeric PIN offers a limited number of combinations and is relatively easy to crack by guessing or eavesdropping. A tap sequence used as a passkey offers an infinite number of different combinations making it unique to that person and that person alone. Once a passkey is saved, it can be compared using the Euclidean distance formula to any other passkey resulting in a dissimilarity score to the master key. If this score is within a certain threshold, that passkey will grant or deny the user access. Our results show that it is possible to authenticate using a unique tap sequence, and convenient enough to be used every day to unlock a personal device.
