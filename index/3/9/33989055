Abstract : A model of the design process is developed in two stages, corresponding to the task environment of design and the activity of posing and solving design problems. Use of the model with top-down and bottom-up disciplines is discussed. An example of the design of an object using a semi-automated design system based on the model is presented. Several issues raised by the model's qualitative aspects, its suitability to automated design, and lines for further development are discussed. (Author)
