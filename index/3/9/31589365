In this paper, we present a novel and low-complexity lossless compression for gray-scale images. The gray-scale image is first separated into bit-planes. These bit-planes are then performed a binary wavelet transform (BWT) to obtain an efficient representation for compression. The BWT bits of significant bit-planes are then encoded by the run-length coder that uses Golomb-Rice codes for run-encoding. The experimental results show that the algorithm obtained efficiency in image compression, and low-complexity in implementation that is highly applicable for image compression systems on small spacecraft's on-board computers.
