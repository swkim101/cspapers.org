We report here on an extensive redesign and unification of the Introductory Computer Programming sequences offered to computer science, computer engineering, information science and digital media majors. The redesign is intended to improve student learning while reducing costs. The approach makes use of substantial Web-based course material and course management tools, including multi-level online modules that individualize instruction and enable students to self-schedule learning each week. Each module covers a particular aspect of computer programming at different levels of knowledge. Students are assigned work and reading from the module at a level appropriate to the objectives of the long-term goals of their major. This allows students in different majors to acquire the appropriate skill level for each technique and concept. Peer mentors and teaching assistants provide assistance online or in person. In the future, we plan to expand the self-scheduling aspect of the course to allow students to enter the course at different modules, depending on their previous knowledge.
