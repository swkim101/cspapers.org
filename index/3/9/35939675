A software measurement tool designed for the users of PRIME, an interactive system being developed, is presented. The tool, called SMT, allows its user to instrument a program, modify a pre‐existing instrumentation and specify how the collected data are to be reduced by typing in a few simple commands. The user can also write his own measurement routines, which specify the actions to be taken at event detection time, and submit them to the SMT; after checking their correctness, the SMT deals with them as with its built‐in, standard measurement routines. The design goals of a general‐purpose tool like the SMT are discussed, and the prototype version of the tool, which has been implemented, is described from the two distinct viewpoints of a user and of a measurement‐tool designer. An example of the application of the prototype to a measurement problem is illustrated, the reasons why not all of the design goals have been achieved in the implementation of the prototype are reviewed, and some of the foreseeable extensions of the SMT are described.
