Organizations large and small continuously strive to improve strategic decision-making. Strategic decision-making (distinguished from operational decision making) involves making substantial investments of resources over long periods of time before results are evident. These decisions are made using quantitative and qualitative information - experience, intuition, and subjective assessment. These are people decisions, not decisions made by machines.So, how can data interfaces be designed to support these most critical decisions of the organization?This case study looks at approaches taken with one R&D (research and development) client to address their key strategic decisions: whether to move research efforts into the next stage of development or cancel the project. We will discuss how we've used web-based interface technologies to create visual metaphors for data including: visualizing time, collaborating, and modeling scenarios. We'll also demonstrate approaches to embedding more abstract constructs like decision theory, statistical analysis, and competitive advantage into these interfaces.
