We present a neural network based graph embedding method for detecting malicious accounts at Alipay, one of the world's leading mobile payment platform. Our method adaptively learns discriminative embeddings from an account-device graph based on two fundamental weaknesses of attackers, i.e. device aggregation and activity aggregation. Experiments show that our method achieves outstanding precision-recall curve compared with existing methods.
