This paper presents the design of the Interacting-BoomCopter (I-BoomCopter) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), designed specifically for environmental interactions. The novel design consists of a horizontally mounted four-blade reversible propeller on a front boom that is attached to a standard tri-rotor UAV configuration. A custom end-effector and force sensor is placed at the end of the front boom for autonomous pushing and pulling interaction tasks. The modeling of the new platform is presented and two prototype versions built, flight tested, and characterized. Finally, the efficacy of the new platform for environmental interactions is evaluated with an autonomous door opening task and a teleoperated door opening and door closing task.
