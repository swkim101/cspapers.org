Summarization and visualization tools are believed to be helpful in navigating through large volumes of data since a visual representation may elicit more deliberate query reformulation and better feedback to the retrieval system. Results from improved feedback explain the growing interest in visualization tools in academic and industrial research (for example, Scatter/Gather by Xerox, ThemeMedia by Batelle, Live Topics by AltaVista).
