Japan's growing elderly population is becoming a serious problem. In addition, the ratio of elderly people who are bedridden is higher than in western countries. A range of facilities have been developed to help old people with excretion, bathing and sleeping. However, improvements can be made in all areas by improving this mobility. As a first step in this direction, we have developed a walking rehabilitation system for elderly people, with sponsorship from the Ministry of Health and Welfare.<<ETX>>
