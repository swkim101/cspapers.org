The concept of utilizing the Coandia effect to produce stable flight in saucer type Aerial Vehicles (AV) was first conceived in 1935 by Henri Marie Coanda. Coanda's proposed AV design remained a relatively unexplored curiosity for decades until the recent surge in popularity of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) revitalized interest in the topic. Coand√§ effect UAV offer some distinct advantages over standard multirotors due to their robust frame design, which offers a unique mix of crash resistance, flight safety, and flight performance making them ideal for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications. While much work has been performed in the area of characterization for Coanda surfaces and improved mechanical design of saucer type UAV, little work has been found in the literature discussing stability and attitude control of the platform. This work seeks to contribute to the study of these drones by introducing an approximate servo mapping for desired control effort of a particular prototype, and an experimental control law implemented within the framework of a modified commercially available flight stack.
