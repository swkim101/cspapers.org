Abstract : A streaming statistical algorithm detects SSH client keystroke packets in a TCP connection on any port. Input data are time-stamps and TCP-IP header fields of packets in both directions, measured at a monitor on the path between the hosts. No packet content is included. The algorithm uses the packet dynamics just preceding and following a client packet with data to classify the packet as a keystroke or non-keystroke. The dynamics are described by classification variables derived from the arrival time-stamps and the packet data sizes, sequence numbers, acknowledgement numbers, and flags. The algorithm succeeds because a keystroke creates an identifiable dynamical pattern. Final testing of the algorithm is based on analysis of about 1 million connections covering all common network protocols. Data visualization and the statistical design of experiments play a critical role in the analysis. It is common to treat the choice of tuning parameters of a statistical or machine learning algorithm as an optimization that finds one set of parameter values. Instead, we run a designed experiment that treats the tuning parameters as statistical tuning factors, which yields valuable information about algorithm performance. One application of the algorithm is identification of any TCP connection as an SSH interactive session, allowing detection of backdoor SSH servers. More generally, the algorithm demonstrates the potential for the use of detailed packet dynamics to classify connections, important for network security. The algorithm is has been prototyped in the widely-used Argus traffic audit software system.
