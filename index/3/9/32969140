This paper proposes a system of mapping classes of syntactic structures as instruments for automatic text understanding. The system illustrated in Japanese consists of a set of verb classes and information on mapping them together with noun phrases, tense and aspect. The system, having information on direction of possible inferences between the verb classes with information on tense and aspect, is supposed to be utilized for reasoning in automatic text understanding.
