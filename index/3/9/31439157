Numerous network representation-based algorithms for network classification have emerged in recent years, but many suffer from two limitations. First, they separate the network representation learning and node classification in networks into two steps, which may result in sub-optimal results because the node representation may not fit the classification model well, and vice versa. Second, they are mostly shallow methods that can only capture the linear and simple relationships in the data. In this paper, we propose an effective deep learning model, Graph Ladder Networks (GLN), for node classification in networks. Our model learns a ladder network which unifies the representation learning and network classification into one single framework by exploiting both labeled and unlabeled nodes in a network. To integrate both structure and node content information in the networks, the most recently developed graph convolution network, is further employed. The experiments on the most popular academic network dataset, Citeseer, demonstrate that our approach reaches outstanding performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.
