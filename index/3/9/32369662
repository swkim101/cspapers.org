This paper describes practical experience in structuring a large amount of data (about 1000 reels of 7-track 556 binary code decimal magnetic tapes of 1970 census data). The hardware and software systems were given. The goal was to structure the database for online devices and to make the retrieval as efficient as possible. This paper explains only the database architecture finally chosen.
