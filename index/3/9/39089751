For the high speed processing of databases, it is fundamental to introduce various VLSI architectures to the processing of basic functions. Especially, sort and batch search requires high speed modules. The VLSI algorithms of them must make use of the time necessary for the transfer of a large amount of data to and from the modules. These modules should be nonprogrammable in order to avoid serious overheads. However, they should be able to extend their capacity and wordlength by the connect ion of them. This paper solves the problem of how to extend the wordlength of search and sort hardware modules. It proposes bit-sliced architectures of an interval search engine and a two-way-merge sorter. The slicing of these engines does not csuse excessive overheads. The decrease of the slice length decreases the hardware complexity, and increases the flexibility of the mOdUle8. Therefore, it increases the feasibility of the VLSI implementation of these hardware modules.
