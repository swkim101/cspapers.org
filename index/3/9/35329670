The 1940 and 1950 Public Use Sample Project is the creation of 1/100 household samples from the 1940 and 1950 Censuses of Population. The data source for the samples is the microfilmed original Population Schedules which contain the census enumerator's recording of household information. The procedure to sample the universe of household listings and transcribe the sample households' data is described in the paper. A pretest of the 1940 Public Use Sample included a comparison of three methods of sampling and transcription. The results of this comparison are reported. The applicability of these procedures to similar projects is discussed.
