In this tutorial, we will first introduce the basic concepts of Intel SGX, its development workflows, potential applications and performance characteristics. Then, we will explain known security concerns, including cache/branch side-channel attacks and memory safety issues, and corresponding defenses with various working demos. Last but not least, we will introduce various ways to quickly start writing SGX applications, especially by utilizing library OSes or thin shielding layers; we will explain the pros and cons of each approach in terms of security and usability.
