The Object Management Group (OMG) is promoting standards for distributed object systems among system software vendors. The OMG has currently ado@ed two sets of standards, known as CORBA and COSS. CORBA is the core communication mechanism which all OMG objects use it enables distributed objects to opmte on =ch other. COSS defines standard services that SUppOtt the integration of distributed objects. The Common Object Request Broker Amhitecture (CORBA)[l] detines an interface definition language (IDL) for objects. The language allows designem to specify interfaces as a set of operations and attributes. The CORBA defines object references. Object references are typed by interfaces specified in IDL. Object references unify access to objects. A client using an object cannot tell if the object being accessed is locrd or remote or how the object is irnpl~ mented or stored, The Common Object Services Specifications
