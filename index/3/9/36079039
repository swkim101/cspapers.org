The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) Homework Submission Server is an ongoing open source project used to collect, compile, and automatically grade programming homeworks for students in our introductory and sophomore computer science classes. It allows viewing of homework, lab, test, and overall grades and late submissions and excused absences on homework. Our first hypothesis is that an electronic submission server is the preferred way for students to submit their coding homeworks because it provides immediate feedback about the correctness of their code and ensures fair, consistent grading since their code is compiled and run with the same test cases, on the same computer. Our second hypothesis is that students appreciate courses with a flexible policy for late submission of homeworks, allowing them to use a specific number of "late days" throughout the semester without penalty. We recently conducted a survey to test these hypotheses and will incorporate specific feedback from the students as we continue development and expand the server to more courses at RPI and other universities.
