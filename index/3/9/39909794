This paper shows how interval analysis can be used to get guaranteed 3D measurements with a stereovision sensor. We propose to describe coordinates of image points by intervals. Thus, we propose a new method based on interval analysis tools to propagate this kind of unknown but bounded uncertainty. Finally, we apply this method to compute a guaranteed model for a projective camera and a guaranteed 3D reconstruction.
