Organizations of all size, whether in business or government are recognizing the strategic role of data and the huge challenge they have to derive value from it. Consumer businesses want to better understand and engage with their customers. Logistics companies want to better optimize their operations. Governments want to find ways to deliver services more effectively and to reduce costs. We see the same patterns repeat across multiple industries. Conventional data management and data mining techniques are breaking down because of the huge volumes of data that need to be processed, because of the variety of ways that data is collected and stored and because of the need to make decisions quickly and on the most current information. The convergence of these trends is creating new opportunities for innovation in algorithms, programming models and computer architecture. In this talk, I will offer a perspective on the emerging field of business analytics on big data and explore connections with the world of high performance computing.
