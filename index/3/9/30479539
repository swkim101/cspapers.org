The studio-based learning (SBL) model aims to promote learning in a social and collaborative context by having learners construct, iteratively refine, and critically review design artifacts under the guidance of instructors and disciplinary experts. Recognizing the potential of SBL to foster the development of not only technical design skills, but also increasingly-coveted communication and collaboration skills, we have been adapting the approach for computing education, implementing it in various courses, and evaluating its impact over the past 5 years. This effort now involves 26 computing courses at 15 institutions in seven states. To our knowledge, this represents the most systematic implementation and evaluation of a pedagogy for computing education to date. This special session will introduce SBL to the SIGCSE community and facilitate a discussion and exchange of ideas. In addition to oral and poster presentations of the SBL model and its evaluation results, the session will feature "war stories" from teachers who have applied the model to their courses and hands-on activities to help attendees apply SBL to their courses.
