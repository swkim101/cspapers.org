This paper presents a contribution to image indexing applied to the document creation task. The presented method ranks a set of photographs based on how well they aesthetically work within a predefined document. Color harmony, document visual balance and image quality are taken into consideration. A user study conducted on people with a range of expertise in document creation helped gather the right visual features to consider by the algorithm. This shows some benefits for the traditional document creation task, as well as for the case of ever-changing web page banner colors and layout.
