Hassan Ait-kaci introduced the ψ-term, an informational structure resembling feature-based functional structures but which also includes taxonomic inheritance (Ait-Kaci, 1984). We describe ψ-terms and how they have been incorporated into the Logic Grammar formalism. The result, which we call Inheritance Grammar, is a proper superset of DCG and includes many features of PATR-II. Its taxonomic reasoning facilitates semantic type-class reasoning during grammatical analysis.
