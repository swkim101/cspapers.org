In many cases several mobile robots (autonomous agents) can be used together to accomplish tasks that would be either more difficult or impossible for a robot acting alone. Many different models have been suggested for the makeup of such collections of robots. In this paper the authors present a taxonomy of the different ways in which such a collection of autonomous robotic agents can be structured. It is shown that certain swarms provide little or no advantage over having a single robot, while other swarms can obtain better than linear speedup over a single robot. There exist both trivial and non-trivial problems for which a swarm of robots can succeed where a single robot will fail. Swarms are more than just networks of independent processors - they are potentially reconfigurable networks of communicating agents capable of coordinated sensing and interaction with the environment.
