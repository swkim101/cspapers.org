When one time reference distribution node is referenced to another time reference distribution node through a repeater, the same delays are put into signals transmitted from the repeater that are in signals received by the repeater. This is accomplished by introducing variable storage buffers into the paths of signals transmitted from the repeater, and by providing for their control. Since the same delays are added to signals transmitted to a node that are in the signals received from that node, the difference in signal transit times in the two directions of transmission on a duplex transmission path is minimized. Accordingly, the transit time in both directions of transmission between any pair of nodes, which are communicating through the repeater, is essentially the same, and high accuracy is maintained for time reference distribution among the nodes of an electronic network.
