The Intelligent Interfaces Group is an interdisciplinary group with interests in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and cognitive science. The primary mission is to provide research and development support to both the regulated and unregulated business units of NYNEX (the Regional Bell Operating Company for New York and New England). The Group was started in October 1986. The Intelligent Interfaces Group is part of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory; other groups in this Laboratory are Expert Systems, Neural Networks and Machine Learning, and Speech Technologies.
Staff members have interests in tutoring systems and tutoring strategies, the design and use of multi-modal communications systems, the evaluation of interactive systems, the development of software toolkits, and similar areas. Projects are selected to support these interests as well as have near-term practical benefits. Some projects are conducted at the request of NYNEX family units, others are initiated by staff members. All projects are funded by NYNEX.
