The study of minicomputer systems in a laboratory environment has been considered by both Electrical Engineering [1], and Computer Science [2] departments. In a summary of the COSINE Committee report on Digital Laboratories, Booth [1] points out that since minicomputers are becoming an integral part of many industrial systems, it is mandatory that students be made aware of the principles of such systems. Further, Booth suggests that the best way to accomplish this is in a projects-oriented laboratory environment. We certainly agree with his statement that “A successfully completed project thus gives the student a sense of accomplishment that is hard to duplicate in any other educational situation.”
