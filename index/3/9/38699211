The paper presents an original hybrid position/force control scheme. The novelty of the control law lies in the absence of Cartesian position servoloop. It is shown that when one tries to implement a hybrid control based upon a previously published scheme and task description, the Cartesian position servoloop automatically disappears. This is an essential result that is taken into account to construct the control diagram. Two types of experimental results are presented. The first experiments are aimed at validating the theoretical results we have obtained; the second experiments prove the efficiency of our hybrid control.
