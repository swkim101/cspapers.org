In the field of design automation, in general and in the automatic design of digital computers in particular, it is frequently necessary to translate machine descriptions and designer requests from the input language to the language of the design automation system. This process is very similar to the translation of artificial computer programming languages into machine language. Hence, it is reasonable to attempt to apply the techniques developed for writing compilers to the task of translation required within a design automation system. In this paper we will describe the use of one such tool, the meta-compiler or syntax directed compiler.[1]
 A meta-compiler is a compiler specifically tailored for the generation of other compilers. The input to a meta-compiler consists of a description of the input and output languages of the compiler to be generated and the algorithmic relationship between them. The use of a meta-compiler reduces the generation of compilers from an extremely formidable task of assembly language programming to a more routine task of higher language programming.
