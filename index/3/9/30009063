Probability distributions produced by the cross-entropy loss for ordinal classification problems can possess undesired properties. We propose a straightforward technique to constrain discrete ordinal probability distributions to be unimodal via a combination of the Poisson probability mass function and the softmax nonlinearity. We evaluate this approach on two large ordinal image datasets and obtain promising results.
