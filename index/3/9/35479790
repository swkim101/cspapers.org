The sharing and control of information on the Web needs to be balanced to provide the web community with the best experience and outcomes. The Policy-Aware Web is an emerging direction that may hold the key in getting this balance right by allowing future policy languages to maintain this harmonization. This panel will discuss, highlight, and debate the challenges in moving towards the Policy-Aware Web and the paths it could lead. The target audience includes all web stakeholders as most policies, such as privacy and rights, are intrinsic to all web users, information, services and content.
