Shows how to compute the region of accessibility for a model of a car that moves forwards and backwards with a lower bounded turning radius and a constant velocity. This problem deals with the computation of the shortest paths when the starting configuration i.e., position and direction, is completely specified and the goal is only defined by a position letting free the direction. The authors first exhibit the shortest path for any goal position and show its uniqueness. Then they compute the boundary of the region reachable by such paths. Such regions are useful in motion planning for a nonholonomic mobile robot.
