Recently, very small radio wave sensors (RWS) are tried to be put in to a human body for human health case purpose. As for a very small antenna in a sensor, normal-mode helical antenna (NMHA) is suitable due to its high efficiency with very small sizes. In this paper, antenna design method and electrical characteristics are clarified for very small NMHA which size is from 0.03 to 0.06 wavelengths in a human body conditions. Firstly, antenna self-resonant structures are clarified through electromagnetic simulations. Next, antenna input resistance changes for human body conductivity changes are clarified. Moreover, radiated power changes are also examined.
