This paper proposes a general framework of for a system with a semantic browsing and visualization interface called Knowledge Communication, Collaboration and Creation Browser (KC3 Browser) integrates multimedia contests and web services on the grid networks, and makes a semantic mash-up called knowledge workspace (k-workspace) with various visual gadgets according to user's contexts (e.g. their interests, purpose and computational environments).
 KC3 Browser also achieves a link-free browsing for seamless knowledge access by generating semantic links based on an arbitrary knowledge models such as ontology and vector space models. It assists users to look down and to figure out various social and natural events from the web contents.
 We have implemented a prototype of KC3 Browser and tested it to an international project on risk intelligence against natural disaster.
