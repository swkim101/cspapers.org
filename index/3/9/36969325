In this paper a method of scene analysis and pattern recognition is outlined. Relational structures are employed as a tool for describing scones and objects. Descriptive primitives are extracted from the TV image together with their interrelations and the recognition is defined as a task of matching this structural description against models. The method completely reported in [3], has been developed for the vision subsystem of the GOALEM robot [2]. For comparisonsee [1] where another structural techniques are reviewed.
