This paper explores the use of computer languages for specifying ICs. Many different aspects of an IC may be specified via language such as logical function and layout. The logic function of an IC may be specified via boolean equations and the layout may be specified via shapes expressed with cartesian coordinates. With such specification, the computer can simulate the behavior of the IC and generate layouts with great precision.
