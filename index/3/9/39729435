IoT has long been a hot topic, and many researchers have made great efforts especially in wireless charging and communication between smart furniture, recognization and localization. However, people always divide charging, communicating and sensing apart. In our paper, we put forward a simple but practical method to make use of NFC communication and resonance-type WPT to build up a system which can be used to locate, identify, charge devices while providing a platform for objects to communicate with each other. Our system acts as an intelligent controller, and it links all devices registered to it together to form a scalable network based on common furniture in daily life.
