We study the problem of how to cover a set of points by a small number of axis-parallel ellipses. This question is well motivated by a special pattern recognition task where one has to identify ellipse-shaped protein spots in 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis images. See [4] for a description of the application and for several algorithms for practical variations of the problem. Here we first investigate the covering problem from a theoretical point of view, and then consider a restricted variant induced by the application.
