The goal of our research project was to create an artificial chef program that produces novel salad recipes with limited human assistance. Our program was designed in two steps: first, we constructed a statistical model to rank recipes. Then, we experimented with various search algorithms to explore the salad recipe space for novel ingredient combinations. Surprisingly, we discovered that the top ranked recipes from a randomly generated population, as determined by our model, were already of high quality. To validate the quality of our automatically generated salads, we conducted a blind taste test with three computer designed and three human designed salads. The best performing computer salad was competitive with the human salads, but received a lower rating.
