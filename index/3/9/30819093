A Perceptual Significance Hierarchy (PSH) for line art images is developed which represents the relative perceptual significance of each image component. This is possible through the use of a set of image-features which are used by the human visual system. The PSH and related rho-space computer vIsion algorithms can be used to automate the fake color separation process used by the printing industry. This is accomplished by adding rudimentary visual processing capabilities to a computer graphics system.
