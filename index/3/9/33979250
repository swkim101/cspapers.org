The aim of work was to develop natural environments imitators for data protection systems against leakage through optical channels. The article describes the investigation of the spectral and polarization characteristics of green leaves of plants, sand and peat. Spectral and polarization characteristics was studied using goniometric measuring unit G-5 and a spectropolarimeter Gemma MC-09 with resolution of at least 1.5 nm and a polarization attachment allowing to register spectral radiance of the samples at various positions of the polaroid axis. The spectral and polarization characteristics provided by the samples of different groups in the band of 370-1070 nm were obtained.
