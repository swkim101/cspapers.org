While root-mean squared error (RMSE) is a good indicator of error in a received image, it does not always take into account the structure of the image and the way images are perceived by the human eye. Using the newly-proposed structural similarity image measure (SSIM), wavelets previously studied by the authors were analysed again. Results showed a close relationship between RMSE and SSIM, and using a combination of both techniques the Daubechies wavelet family gave slightly better quality images than Biorthogonal family. The auto-correlation of the received images was also used to quantify structural loss.
