1. Summary Previous sessions and presentations at SIGCSE have explained to the community many details about the development, piloting, and exam format of the NSF/College Board Computer Science Principles (CSP) [1-3] project --a project that is intended and designed to be a rigorous, engaging, and broadly appealing Advanced Placement (AP) course taught in high schools, for which students can earn placement and/or credit for a college course. We are now less than two years from the launch of the course as an official Advanced Placement course in 2016-2017. Hundreds of high schools have offered courses designed around the CSP Framework, but these courses differ in many respects â€“ from choice of programming language, to the degree of emphasis on the Internet, to varying focuses on modeling/simulation, and more.
