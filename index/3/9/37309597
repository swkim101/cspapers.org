Although existing approaches use topic modeling to mine the semantic information of items by grouping the tags labelled for items, they overlook an important property that tags link users and items as a bridge. Thus these methods cannot deal with the data sparsity without commonly rated items (DS-WO-CRI) problem, limiting their recommendation performance. Towards solving this challenging problem, we propose a novel tag and rating based collaborative filtering (CF) model for item recommendation, which first uses topic modeling to mine the semantic information of tags for each user and for each item respectively, and then incorporates the semantic information into matrix factorization to factorize rating information and to capture the bridging feature of tags and ratings between users and items.As a result, our model captures the semantic correlation between users and items, and is able to greatly improve recommendation performance, especially in DS-WO-CRI situations.Experiments conducted on two popular real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms the conventional CF approach, the state-of-the-art social relation based CF approach, and the state-of-the-art topic modeling based CF approaches in terms of both precision and recall, and it is an effective approach to the DS-WO-CRI problem.
