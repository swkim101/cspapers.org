We developed a dextrous robotic hand system with four identically structured fingers. Each finger has 6DOF (degrees-of-freedom), so the hand has a total of 24DOF. Further we developed a 6-axis force and torque sensor to detect forces and moments at the finger-tip, so it is possible for this robotic hand to control grasping forces during object manipulation. In this paper we show some experiments of grasping and manipulating objects using a 6-axis hybrid controller approach. Using data from the force-torque sensor and appropriate position and force references in control, object parameters like friction and stiffness can be estimated.<<ETX>>
