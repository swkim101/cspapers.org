The purpose of this tutorial is to present some ideas on how to teach parallel computing at the undergraduate level. It is targeted for teaching with a laboratory component of a course using a distributed memory, message-passing parallel architecture. This architecture has been chosen because it seems that it is the type of architecture most accessible for use in undergraduate courses. In addition, some of the fundamental issues of parallel computing, such as synchronization, deadlock, coordination of communications, task granularity, and Amdahlâ€™s law can readily be studied using a message-passing architecture.
