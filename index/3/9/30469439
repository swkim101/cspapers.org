In this work, we study indoor passive tracking problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), in which we assume the target being tracked is "clean", i.e., there is no any equipment carried by the target and the tracking procedure is considered to be passive. We design, implement and test our tracking methods in a WSN testbed consisting of 40 wireless sensor nodes and one base station (laptop).
