PRESS is a computer program for solving symbolic, transcendental, nondifferential equations, [3]. We describe a new equation solving method, called Homogenization, which we have implemented in PRESS. Homogenization prepares equations, so that they can be solved by the Change of Unknown method. It does this by causing different occurrences of the unknown to occur within identical subterms. The method has application, outside equation solving, to the problem of generalizing expressions.
