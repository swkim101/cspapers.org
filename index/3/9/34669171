Faculty face motivational and engagement challenges in general education computing courses. Inquiry-based learning strategies show promise in engaging students in an authentic discovery process. In a general education computer literacy course, we adapted scenario-based curriculum to create a classroom environment where students are faced with a real-life cybersecurity crisis and spurred into active discussion. Working as a team, they were required to analyze provided evidence and document a reasoned solution. We share implementation strategies and challenges to adopting scenarios promoting active learning. Our pilot data suggests this curriculum approach has a positive impact on students' interest in computing, while engaging them in real-world, multi-disciplinary content.
