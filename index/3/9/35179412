In this paper, a robust and optimal control method is proposed for the attitude control problem of multirotors. The designed controller consists of an optimal controller and a robust compensator. The optimal controller is designed based on the linear quadratic regulation control method for the desired tracking of the nominal linear system, whereas the robust compensator is introduced to restrain the influence of multiple uncertainties. Tracking errors are proven to be bounded with specified boundaries ultimately. Simulation and experimental results on the hexarotor demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust optimal control approach.
