Sensor networks are driven by signals in their environments. Their execution is constrained by available computational and energy resources. They are typically deployed in environments that preclude human intervention in the event of failure, and must therefore gracefully cope with disruptions in their computation, communication and energy resources. This demonstration presents Sunflower, a full-system simulator for sensor networks. Sunflower is aimed at modeling all of the components which are of interest in sensor networks.
