Cyber-physical systems (CPS) use distributed feedback loops to control physical processes. Designing practical distributed CPS controllers often benefits from a logically centralized approach, where each node computes the control law locally based on global knowledge of the system state. We present Mixer, an all-to-all communication scheme that enables all nodes in a multi-hop low-power wireless network to exchange sizable packets with one another. Mixer's design integrates synchronous transmissions with random linear network coding, harnessing the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. Results from testbed experiments with an early Mixer prototype show that our design reduces latency by 1.1-2.6Ã— for 16-96-byte packets compared with the state of the art, while providing a reliability above 99.9% in most settings we test.
