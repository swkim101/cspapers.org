INTRODUCTION WHY A SPREADSHEET? Traditionally, computer science educators have introduced students to basic computer science concepts via a pro~ming language paradigm as evidenced by typical texts used in CS 1 [D083, KW87, HKF93]. The same approach is used with respect to development of problemsolving skills. This paper describes an alternative approach in which a spreadsheetAlatabase package is used as an introductory vehicle to motivate many computer science ideas. As an added benefit to this approach, the student learns to use a valuable problem-solving tool.
