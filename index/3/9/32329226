Fred Brooks' seminal book, "The Mythical Man-Month" (MMM) is a firmly established classic in software engineering. Many of us feel compelled to use this work to help our students appreciate and put into practice the fundamental software engineering concepts contained between its covers. This often amounts to using "passive" lesson plans such as required readings followed by lectures and exams; these rarely fully satisfy our learning objectives. Rather, students often have mixed reactions to MMM with the result that it has little impact on their attitudes and practices, both in and out of the classroom. This paper outlines a more active approach to incorporating MMM into the classroom, one that we have refined over 6 years, at multiple universities and in both graduate and undergraduate courses. It includes learning objectives, a lesson plan, sample materials, an implementation discussion, and an evaluation of the approach's impact.
