In computer science experimentation, more researchers have begun using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Discerning how to apply this mathematical technique can be confusing; papers in this area tend to focus on results rather than the methodology in using PCA. Consequentially, reproducing or verifying PCA results is difficult without prolonged communication with the authors. Our larger goal is to create a general descriptive methodology for PCA usage and determine criteria for evaluation of PCA software implementations. This will be a resource for discipline-specific researchers. Here we focus on evaluation of the program Cluster 3.0 with a Noni fruit experiment from our chemistry department.
