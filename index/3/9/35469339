We apply LDPC codes for turbo inter-carrier interference (ICI) cancellation (channel detecting) and decoding in OFDM systems due to mobility of channels. The simulation result shows that the proposed turbo ICI cancellation and sum-product algorithm decoding of LDPC coded OFDM systems can achieve the better error rate performance than turbo ICI cancellation and BCJR decoding of convolutional coded OFDM systems when the codeword length is 816 bits.
