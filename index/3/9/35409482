The accelerated accumulation of knowledge in recent years has illustrated graphically the value of developing human resources to their most usable form at an early point in each person's life span. Not only is this early development important to the continued growth of the nation but to the expanded life style and earned human dignity of each individual. Traditional education techniques have fallen short in this regard. Students have graduated from two year colleges, four year colleges, and graduate programs with ill defined capabilities directed toward no specific area within the world of work. Human resource capability loss has been staggering and in some instances, irreparable harm has resulted. In recognizing the problem and its wide-spread ramifications the Federal Government as well as State Governments have developed programs of career education for junior and four year colleges. Central Texas College in Killeen, Texas, is one of these development areas and provides an excellent two year associate degree in Computer Science. The curriculum and text requirements are presented in this paper.
