KLYDE is a software workbench that helps students study issues related to the design, implementation, and empirical analysis of algorithms. Using the system's graphical user interface students can design and conduct experiments to study the efficiency of a variety of algorithms and their underlying implementations. The data generated by these experiments can be studied directly, or imported into speadsheet and presented graphically. This paper gives an overview of the KLYDE system and illustrates how the system can be used in a variety of undergraduate computer science courses.
