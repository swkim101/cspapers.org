This work is concerned with the problem of reasoning about physical objects and their positions in the space. The main goal is to develop a system which is able to "imagine" the scene in which a story takes place, inferring by means of suitable rules the items which are not explicitly named, in order to verify the relevance of knowledge about the physical environment in the process of stories understanding. The specific topic covered by this work is the problem of objects instantiation and a set of rules for inferring the existence of an object is proposed.
