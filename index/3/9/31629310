The Fortran Tools consist of mostly open source software that allows the scientific programmer to work in a modern graphical-oriented environment and provides the student with a complete package of books and tools.Included are a Fortran 95 compiler, an Eclipse-based IDE (Photran), software to make plots, software to build Fortran application programs that use a graphical user interface for input/output, libraries, and other tools. Included are three books in PDF format.A free version uses the F subset compiler, which is ideal for learning Fortran and developing new code.The tools will be described and demonstrated.
