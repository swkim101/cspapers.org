There are three different approaches to an introductory computer science course: technical competance, non-technical awareness, and a mixture of technical competance and non-technical awareness. This paper discusses the best strategy for a course aimed at students who will not need a high level of technical competance once they leave the course. A course which develops a computer awareness through a mixture of technical programming instruction and a discussion of computer applications and power for good or evil. Films are extensively used.
