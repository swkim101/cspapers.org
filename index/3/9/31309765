Expertise search is a well-established field in information retrieval. In recent years, the increasing availability of data enables accumulation of evidence of talent and expertise from a wide range of domains. The availability of big data significantly benefits employers and recruiters. By analyzing the massive amounts of structured and unstructured data, organizations may be able to find the exact skill sets and talent they need to grow their business. The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for industry and academia to discuss the recent progress in talent search and management, and how the use of big data and data-driven decision making can advance talent acquisition and human resource management.
