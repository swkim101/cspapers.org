In recent years, the discipline of computing has matured to the point of having distinct sub elements, each of which is developing curriculum recommendations, accreditation criteria, conferences, professional societies and publications. Specific curriculum recommendations exist for five distinct areas: (Computing Curricula 2001: Computer Science (CS2001) [4] and IS 2002 Model Curriculum and Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Information Systems (IS-2002) [1]), (Computing Curricula 2004: Software Engineering [2] and Computing Curricula: Computer Engineering [5]) and one that will likely be finished early in 2006 (Computing Curricula: Information Technology [6]). More broadly, recent work in the UK to identify the variety of computing related programs currently offered in British universities identified 2,400 distinct program names [3]! This proposal is for an update of a project to keep the family of computing related disciplines together. This project is partially funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF grant 0338546, Special Project: All in the Family: A unified representation of the computing and information related disciplines), and is being run by a joint task force from several professional societies, with ACM taking the lead. The goals of the project are to provide a union of all that is computing, and various ways of organizing and visualiz-
