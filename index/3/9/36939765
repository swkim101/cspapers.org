The time and cost of implementing data processing applications can be greatly reduced through the use of software systems which provide language for the expression of file-level operations on data, i.e., operations whose operands are sets of records or entire files, such as report generation and sorting. Such systems, which have been referred to as self-contained systems or generalized file management systems, have characteristically been restricted to logical data structure classes no richer than hierarchies. This paper explores the extension of the concept of file-level operations to network structures, as exemplified by the CODASYL DDLC data structure class, on the assumption that such a facility will prove useful to certain types of users (e.g., data administrators) for certain types of data manipulation (e.g., data base creation and updating). The paper first outlines the general requirements which must be met in such a facility, and then describes a specific approach to the development of a language for such a facility.
