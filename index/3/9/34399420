An agent's utility for a partition is based upon which role she fulfills within the coalition and which roles are being fulfilled within the coalition. The major contributions of the paper include designing the RTHG model, with its corresponding stability and (NP-hard) optimization criteria, designing a heuristic partitioning algorithm and local search algorithm, implementation and testing.
