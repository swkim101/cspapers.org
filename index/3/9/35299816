"Service is the rent we pay for the space we take up on earth", my dad's mantra, and one used by many. Participating in professional organizations such as SIGCSE and its parent organization, ACM, has been for me an incredibly rewarding obligation. Many have given of their time and talents to help me on my way. Some of those who have followed in my footsteps have also forged paths of service making mine pale in comparison. This computer science education community affords incredibly rich opportunities for service in venues ranging from local to international. Service in SIGCSE and similar communities can reap untold benefits for both the volunteer and the community served.
