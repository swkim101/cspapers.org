Extracting records from web pages enables a number of important applications and has immense value due to the amount and diversity of available information that can be extracted. This problem, although vastly studied, remains open because it is not a trivial one. Due to the scale of data, a feasible approach must be both automatic and efficient (and of course effective). We present here a novel approach, fully automatic and computationally efficient, using signal processing techniques to detect regularities and patterns in the structure of web pages. Our approach segments the web page, detects the data regions within it, identifies the records boundaries and aligns the records. Results show high f-score and linearithmic time complexity behaviour.
