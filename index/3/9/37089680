One approach of how to pass through a doorway by a mobile robot is discussed. In this task-oriented approach, the proposed task is to realize a total behavior of opening a door and passing through a doorway for a mobile robot equipped with a manipulator. In this paper, we describe a design of such behavior, and a simulation of the behavior is shown. The key of such behavior is the cooperation between robot's function sub-systems, e.g. the locomotion control system, the manipulator control system and the sensor systems.<<ETX>>
