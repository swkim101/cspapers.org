The paper describes a visual programming approach to transferring the operator's manipulation skill directly to the robot. The objective is to let the robot learn by observing the human expert moving in his/her own work space. High-speed and high-precision acquisition of the location information is expedited by a marker-based visual system mounted on a conic tool surface, assisted by transputer calculation. Possible violation of the robot physical constraint is checked online with the provision of computer graphic facilities in the system which are also used for subsequent automatic path refinement.
