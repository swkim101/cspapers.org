We present the Program by Design introductory CS curriculum through the lenses of graphics, animations, algebra, and data structures. Animations programming is popular for CS1, but many such curricula lack clean paths into CS2. Program by Design is different. Using and reinforcing concepts from algebra, students learn to write animations (including standard topics such as model/view separation and event-handling), then move seamlessly into working with structured data, lists, trees, and objects. The curriculum emphasizes design, testing, and writing maintainable programs, without losing the engagement of animations. The workshop uses lectures and hands-on exercises to provide high- school and college teachers an overview of the approach. See www.programbydesign.org. Laptop Optional.
