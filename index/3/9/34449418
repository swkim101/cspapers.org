ZnO/V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> mixed and bilayer composites on glass substrate were deposited by magnetron sputtering at room temperature. Mixed composites were prepared by dual target magnetron sputtering from both ZnO and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> targets whereas bilayer composites were obtained by deposition of V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> bottom layer capped by ZnO thin layer. Post annealing treatment in oxygen ambience at different temperatures was conducted. Variation in microstructural and optical properties with the annealing temperature was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractrometer (XRD) and photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature. The results indicated that heat treatment in oxygen ambience provided more reaction points between ZnO and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> for mixed composite whereas bilayer composite had a limited interaction at the interface of ZnO and V2Os layers. Presence of zinc oxide vanadates (α-Zn<inf>3</inf>(VO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>) after heat treatment revealed the temperature sensitive interaction between ZnO and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>. Dramatically enhanced visible light emission was observed from the annealed samples which is attributed to the presence of α-Zn<inf>3</inf> (VO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>. The enhancement in light emission from composite ZnO/V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> could act as the promising application for future optoelectronic devices.
