The brief history of knowledge discovery is filled with products that promised to bring "BI to the masses". But how do you build a product that truly bridges the gap between the conceptual simplicity of "questions and answers" and the structure needed to query traditional data stores? In this talk, Chris Neumann will discuss how DataHero applied the principles of user-centric design and development over a year and a half to create a product with which more than 95% of new users can get answers on their first attempt. He'll demonstrate the process DataHero uses to determine the best combination of algorithms and user interface concepts needed to create intuitive solutions to potentially complex interactions, including: Determining the structure of files uploaded by users Accurately identifying data types within files Presenting users with an optimal visualization for any combination of data Helping users to ask questions of data when they don't know what to do Chris will also talk about what it's like to start a "Big Data" company and how he applied lessons from his time as the first engineer at Aster Data Systems to DataHero.
