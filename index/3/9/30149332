The papers in this volume were presented at the Thirteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, held January 6-8, 2002 in San Francisco, California. The Symposium was jointly sponsored by the SIAM Activity Group on Discrete Mathematics and by SIGACT, the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory.In response to the Call for Papers, 283 Long Form abstracts and 43 Short Form Abstracts were submitted. The program committee met "electronically" from July 31 to September 25, 2001, and accepted 110 Long Form abstracts and 19 Short Form abstracts. The decisions were based on originality, technical contribution, and relevance. The submissions were not formally refereed, although every attempt was made to verify the main claims. In addition to the program committee members, many additional reviewers contributed to this effort. It is expected that most of the accepted papers will appear in more complete form in scientific journals.
