A multi-layer, X.25 based protocol has been implemented on a multiprocessor system. The higher layer protocol resides in the system processor while the lower level protocol (X.25 levels 2 and 3) runs on a peripheral processor. This paper focuses on the boundary between the system and peripheral processors. It discusses how flow control is done, how control information is passed across the boundary, and the synchronization problems that arose. In addition, it describes effects on performance resulting from splitting the protocol across the two processors.
