A one-room-type sensing system named Robotic Room 11 for recognizing and accumulating human behavior in ordinary life is constructed. In order to recognize human behavior, we propose an idea that human behavior can be estimated from the human position, posture, the objects surrounding the human and time. Based on this idea, multiple sensors are distributed on such objects as floors, beds and desks. From these sensors, information of a human position and use conditions of household appliances are extracted and integrated. Experiments of sensor information description are successfully performed to show that the system can recognize and accumulate human behaviors.
