We introduce CoSense, a collaborative sensing platform for mobile devices that opportunistically distributes sensing tasks between familiar devices in close proximity. We use empirical energy measurements together with data collected from everyday transportation behaviour to demonstrate that our solution can significantly reduce power consumption while maintaining the best possible sensing accuracy.
