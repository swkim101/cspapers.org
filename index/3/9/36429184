EXTENDED ABSTRACT The retrieval of structured resources using unstructured queries is challenging as we need to deal with the matching between entities of two different types. Consider an unstructured query, “publications of K.H. Gan in WI”, in a structured retrieval system. To match this query to structured resources, the system needs to transform it into a format that is comparable to the structure of the resources. As such, we develop a solution that automatically transform unstructured query to a mediated query which is enhanced with structural information. The mediated query is then matched against structured resources to obtain relevant results.
