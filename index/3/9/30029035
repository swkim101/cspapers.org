Existing botnet detection tools suffer from two primary limitations: case specificity and rigidity. Case-specific detection mechanisms leverage instance-specific characteristics of botnets (typically related to C&C). As a result, the scope of detection is narrow and tailored to a sub-class of the entire phenomenon. Similarly, rigidity in design leads to difficulties in (a) accommodating new detection parameters in their decision policies, (b) tuning/configuring their operation, (c) modification of decision policies, and (d) simultaneous implementation of multiple decision policies. In addition to these architectural aspects, flexibility of the tools is further compromised by unavailability of source-code. Currently, no tool exists that can be used to easily implement and test new botnet detection mechanisms. In this poster we present BotFlex— a community-driven network-based tool for botnet detection, designed to address the shortcomings of existing tools identified above. We also present our first-cut implementation of BotFlex which conceptualizes botnet infection as a complex event detectable via multiple trigger paths. BotFlex employs a custom correlation framework which detects and curbs botnet threats by reasoning about vertical (across time) and horizontal (across multiple entities) events. Both BotFlex and its correlation framework are released in open-source for community use [2]. We evaluate BotFlex for accuracy over 500 GB of enterprise traffic collected from one of Pakistan’s largest ISPs, Nayatel, with ground truth obtained using a one-time sample of Team Cymru’s reputation list for the collection duration.
