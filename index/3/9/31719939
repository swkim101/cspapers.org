This paper proposes a novel structure for dispersion controlling and low confinement losses with a hybrid core hexagonal-octagonal photonic crystal fiber (6/8-PCF). By including hexagonal rings lattices structure in the cladding region of the conventional O-PCF and adjusting the size of air holes around the two innermost cladding structure, we can successfully design low flattened PCF with low confinement loss. The influence of design parameters on the properties of chromatic dispersion, confinement loss, effective area of the hybrid cladding HO-HPCF is also investigated. The low flattened dispersion feature, as well as the low confinement losses is the main advantages of the proposed PCF structure, making it suitable as chromatic dispersion controller/compensator for broadband communication system.
