The development of firmware controlled devices poses several new requirements on Design Automation. Because firmware is central to system design and reflects heavily on system speed and cost, the basic assembly parameters change after during the early design phases. It is necessary to have an automation system which is able to react to design changes without reprogramming of system components. Thus the standard approach of simulating firmware with a special purpose language and a special purpose assembler or assembler/simulator is no longer practical. This paper discusses a general solution to the several requirements of firmware design.
