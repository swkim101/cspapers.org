The increased demand for some type of introductory computing/computer science course does not stem solely from computer science epartments. A variety of other disciplines re discovering that the adequate training of computer users involves more than a short course in a programming language. Consequently, there is a need for a basic course sequence that:
 1. Teaches the fundamentals of computing to students from a wide variety of disciplines (including computer science);
 2. Provides the student with some useful skills, regardless of where he terminates in that sequence;
 3. Permits students who become interested in computing to study advanced topics without paying undue penalties (i.e., without trapping them in terminal courses);
 4. Accomplishes these aims without hopeless fragmentation of the department's offerings (as is still the case in mathematics) or giving up responsibility for most service courses (as is the case with statistics).
