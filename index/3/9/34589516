This thesis describes the MM32k, a massively parallel SIMD computer which is easy to program, high in performance, low in cost and effective for implementing highly parallel neural network architectures. The MM32k has 32768 bit serial processing elements, each of which has 512 bits of memory, and all of which are interconnected by a switching network. The entire system resides on a single PC-AT compatible card. It is programmed from the host computer using a C++ language class library which supports variable precision vector arithmetic. The MM32k also supports direct video input and output for machine vision applications.
