Given the simple fact that mathematics forms the foundation of computing, mathematics must play a meaningful role in the computer science program. This meaningful role, however, must be substantially less, in content, than a second major. We must avoid the extreme of little or no mathematics in the curriculum. We must, at the same time, avoid the excess of too much mathematics.
 The need for restraint becomes most obvious when we recognize that the ideal liberal arts program should be approximately one-third for a major, one-third for a broad “liberal arts” component, and one-third for free electives. A curriculum including all of the mathematics suggested in “Curriculum-68”, all of the computer science now needed by an individual wishing to devote his or her post-baccalaureate life to computing, and a minimal number of necessary cognates from other disciplines, would strain the traditional concept of the conventional four-year liberal arts degree. Thus, the only alternatives to moderation in the mathematics component are moderation in the major itself (unthinkable), extension of the curriculum to five or more years, and/or conversion of the curriculum to a professional degree, i.e., an engineering degree.
