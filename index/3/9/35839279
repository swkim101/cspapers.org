Meaningful work is a deep human need. We all yearn to contribute to something greater than ourselves, be listened to, and work alongside friendly peers. Data mining consulting is a powerful way to use technical skills and gain these great side benefits. The power of analytics and its high return on investment makes one's expertise welcome virtually everywhere. And the variety of projects and domains encountered leads to continual learning as new problems are met and solved. Teaching and writing are possible, and there is great satisfaction in seeing one's work actually implemented and used, potentially touching millions.
 Still, in industry, one has the joy and hazards of working closely with other humans, where final success can depend as much on others as oneself, and on social as well as technical issues. In my experience, business risk strongly outweighs technical risk in whether a solution is used. I will share some hard-won lessons learned on how to best succeed, both technically and socially, in the results-oriented world of industry.
