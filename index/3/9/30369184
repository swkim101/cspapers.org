This paper describes the development of an extended Kalman filter model for autonomous ground vehicle navigation using integrated civilian-band GPS position measurements and inertial navigation information. The Kalman filter model incorporates a detailed statistical model of all major GPS errors including those associated with selective availability (SA) range errors. The resulting model consists of 14 states. Data showing the accuracy of this filter is presented.<<ETX>>
