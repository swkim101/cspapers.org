For years, disciplines such as Physics and Chemistry have utilized the closed labomtory to introduce their students to the experimental methodologies of their disciplines. While lectures are useful in exposing students to the conceptual and theoretical aspects of a discipline, a supervised laboratory provides students with hands-on experience using those concepts, and teaches those skills that are useful in the discipline. This paper describes the design, implementation, and first year of use of the Unix ~assmq a Computing laboratory facility at Calvin College. We hope that institutions facing similar decisions can benefit from our experience.
