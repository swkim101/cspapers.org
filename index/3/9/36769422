A new prototype of biped walking robot, named as EP-WAR2 (Electropneumatic WAlking Robot), has been built at the Laboratory of Robotics and Mechatronics in Cassino. This prototype has been provided for logical sensors in order to avoid different obstacles which have been classified as right and left corners, right and left walls, and entire wall. A walking analysis of EP-WAR2 has been carried out for each type of these obstacles. The control system is given by a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). Thus, a specific flow-chart for PLC programming has been based on several subroutines in order to foresee in advance and control several situations during the walking motion. External sensor system and PLC programming have been tested on autonomous motion of EP-WAR2 in unknown environments.
