For the past two years at Villanova we have successfully conducted a ‘virtual” lab in conjunction with our CSl and CS2 courses. We use the term “virtual” to describe our lab because we have neither a reserved room for the lab work nor scheduled lab hours. Instead, the students can work at any of the public terminal sites on campus whenever they are open. They can even work on their labs at home if they have the ability to phone into our computer network. This paper explains why we choose to implement the Virtual Lab, its basic structure, topics, and success.
