To effectively reason about oneâ€™s own knowledge, goals, and reasoning requires an ability to explicitly introspect. A computational model of introspection is a second-order theory that contains a formal language for representing first-order processes and that processes instances of this representation. The reasoning algorithm used to perform such processing is similar to the algorithm used to reason about events and processes represented in the original
