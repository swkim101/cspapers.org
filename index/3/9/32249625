Sharing of security related information is believed to greatly enhance the ability of organizations to defend themselves against sophisticated attacks. If one organization detects a breach the automated sharing of observed security indicators (such as IP addresses, domain names etc.) provide valuable, actionable information to others. Through analyzing shared data it seems possible to get much better insights into emerging attacks. Sharing higher level intelligence about campaigns, threat actors and mitigations is also of great interest. Both in the US and the EU there are major efforts underway to strengthen information sharing. Yet there are a number of technical and policy challenges to realizing this vision. The First ACM Workshop on Information Sharing and Collaborative Security (WISCS 2014) aims to bring together experts and practitioners from academia, industry and government to present innovative research, case studies, and legal and policy issues. WISCS 2014 is held in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA on Nov. 3, 2014 in conjunction with 21st ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2014).
