This paper describes the Wire Integration Computer Program, WICOP, which provides a complete wire data processing and documentation service for engineering design areas. WICOP is a flexible, large volume, high-speed data processing and documentation program capable of producing multiple output formats. The most important service provided by WICOP is to provide documents which can be used to check the design, to aid in fabrication, and to maintain a permanent record of the wiring of the hardware. The use of WICOP eliminates many of the repetitive clerical functions normally associated with the preparation of wire lists.
