This paper presents a simple extension of first order predicate logic to include a default operator. Rules of inference governing the operator are specified, and a model theory for interpreting sentences involving default operators is developed based on standard Tarskian semantics. The resulting system is trivially sound. It is argued that (a) this logic provides an adequate basis for default reasoning in A.I. systems, and (b) unlike most logics proposed for this purpose, it retains the virtues of standard first order logic, including both monotonicity and simplicity.
