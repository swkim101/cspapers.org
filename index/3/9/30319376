In a recent study of modular robots (2000), the authors demonstrated the feasibility of dynamic rolling motions as a novel means of locomotion. In such a system the capability of large shape change is used to induce tipping and rolling behaviors of the robot itself. However, the dynamics of the tipping motion and the contact forces that occur on impact with the ground are complex. In this paper, a two-phase planning and switching control sequence is introduced to achieve stable and reliable motion of an icosahedral Tetrobot modular robot. Simulation of the resulting rolling motions suggests that speed and direction of the rolling can be controlled, and both sustained uphill and downhill rolling motions are feasible.
