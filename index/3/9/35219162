This article proposed a new cipher - Crypt(BM)_64A. This cipher was developed on the basis of Controlled Substitution Permutation Networks (CSPNs) oriented to applications in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Crypt(BM)_64A was proved to be secure according to NESSIE test and differential characteristic in order to prevent differential cryptanalysis. The proposed cipher was also implemented in FPGA for the technological parameter comparison with some commonly used ciphers.
