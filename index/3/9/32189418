This paper describes a project-oriented Computer Science or Computer Information Systems Practicum course. This particular course differs in several ways from other similar courses. First, it is taught outside of the normal academic year. Second, a real attempt is made to simulate the environment in which a computing professional would be expected to work. Third, all of the projects are taken from the real world and are sponsored by individuals who actually want the work done. Fourth, it has components designed to teach the students how to make informal and formal public speeches on subjects with which they are familiar. Finally, it has components designed to help the students look for jobs after graduation. This course has worked well at a major engineering school and at a small regional liberal arts school.
