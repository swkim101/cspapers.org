1. SUMMARY The Overview Report of the joint ACM, IEEE-CS, and AIS series on the Computing Curricula was published in 2006. It can be accessed at http://www.acm.org/education/. Its goal is to provide perspective for those in academia who need to understand what the major computing disciplines are and how the respective undergraduate degree programs compare and complement each other. Subsequently, the report has been used as the basis for the production of a brochure to be sent to all US high schools and a web site to support the brochure at which further information relevant to potential students will be found. The aim of both the brochure and supporting web site is to aid recruitment of students in to undergraduate programs in the Computing disciplines. The special session will present both the brochure and the web site, with the intention of seeking feedback to inform future developments, both in the US and UK.
