The use of virtual reality technologies as a medium for artistic expression requires the combined talents of artists and computer scientists working in concert. We created a course to bring together students and faculty from these two diverse worlds, both to create artistic virtual environments and to foster skills needed to work on interdisciplinary teams. This paper describes this course, the art works created and discuses some of the issues that arise when such worlds collide.
