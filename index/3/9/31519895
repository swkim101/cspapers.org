This contribution attempts a conceptual and practical introduction into the principles of wiring or constructing special machines for language processing tasks instead of programming a universal machine. Construction would in principle provide higher descriptive adequacy in computationally based linguistics. After all, our heads do not apply programs on stored symbol arrays but are appropriately wired for understanding or producing language.
