Describes the development of a multi-sensor tactile digit. This instrumented finger has the ability to detect contact pressure/force, hardness, texture, temperature, slip, surface profile/shape, and thermal conductivity. This information is subsequently transferred directly from the robot to the skin of the remote operator using tactile feedback units based on piezo, vibro and thermal effects. This multipurpose human-machine interface (tele-taction) provides the user with an enhanced degree of true feel for a grasped object.
