In this paper, we study relations ranking and object classification for multi-relational data where objects are interconnected by multiple relations. The relations among objects should be exploited for achieving a good classification. While most existing approaches exploit either by directly counting the number of connections among objects or by learning the weight of each relation from labeled data only. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, TensorRRCC, which is able to determine the ranking of relations and the labels of objects simultaneously. Our basic idea is that highly ranked relations within a class should play more important roles in object classification, and class membership information is important for determining a ranking quality over the relations w.r.t. a specific learning task. TensorRRCC implements the idea by modeling a Markov chain on transition probability graphs from connection and feature information with both labeled and unlabeled objects and propagates the ranking scores of relations and relevant classes of objects. An iterative progress is proposed to solve a set of tensor equations to obtain the stationary distribution of relations and objects. We compared our algorithm with current collective classification algorithms on two real-world data sets and the experimental results show the superiority of our method.
