The recent developments in the space technology demand various services to the exhausted or damaged satellites such as refueling and repairing in order to extend their life spans. In this paper, an automated object capturing with a two-arm flexible manipulator is addressed, which is a basic technology for such services. This object capturing includes the symmetric cooperative control, the visual servoing, the resolution of the inverse kinematics problem and the optimization of the configuration of a two-arm redundant flexible manipulator. There have been no researches on such a practical application with the flexible manipulators so far. The effectiveness of this capturing sequence is validated with the experiment.
