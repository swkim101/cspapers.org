The purpose of the discussion that follows is to shed some light on the mystical process of buying a computer. The problem of computer acquisition is often approached from a very rational, very scientific perspective with lots of charts, graphs, comparisons and rating scales. Sometimes the original intent of the effort can get lost in the piles of data.
 What I hope to do here is to augment or clarify this super rational approach (which certainly has its place) with some practical, down to earth common sense. At the very least, what I am advocating could certainly become the basis for a more elaborate scientific approach. In order to keep things simple, I have looked at the problem of computer acquisition in terms of (1) some thinking, (2) some planning, (3) and a lot of doing.
