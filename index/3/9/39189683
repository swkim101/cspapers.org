During the process of applying remote sensing image data, how to save the mass remote sensing image data of different times and use them effectively is an important problem. Researches show that the traditional large commercial relational database cannot storage the mass remote sensing data effectively and also cannot support unlimited data storage. In this paper, we combine the file system, relational database SQL and embedded database SQLite to build a distributed spatial database framework for storing and processing massive remote sensing data. On the one hand, data storage in this framework can break from the traditional large commercial relational database; on the other hand, it can satisfy the wide application demand, support multiple attribute data retrieval condition, have "instant" response ability. Experimental results show our method is effective, and it could be enhance the global search efficiency. Keywords-remote sensing data;slice;sqlite files;distributed spatial database
