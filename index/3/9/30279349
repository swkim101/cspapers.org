This paper discusses the problems arising from the need for measuring data communication performance parameters. It derives the statistical information needs from the needs of known network models and from the performance parameter standards defined in the Federal Government and ANSI Standards on Data Communication Performance. It reviews existing monitoring devices and outlines their capabilities and shortcomings in regard to collecting data communication performance statistics. In conclusion, the paper outlines the functionalities of a modular set of performance monitoring tools, which could satisfy most of the monitoring needs of a data communication system. Although the parameters of modeling and the Performance Standards address the problems of data communication subsystems in general, this paper emphasizes the problems of distributed network systems with layered architectures. The reader should be familiar with the basics of the architecture of Open System Interconnection as the distributed network architecture is named in the draft of the international standard.1
