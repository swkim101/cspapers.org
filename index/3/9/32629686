The National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) works with faculty at all stages of the pipeline to create measureable change at their educational institutions. While faculty are typically committed to this work, they often do not have the time or expertise to create clear, measureable goals that can be assessed and reported to funders or administration. In this BoF, participants will work with NCWIT-developed change tracking tools, and social scientists to develop goals for their home institutions.
