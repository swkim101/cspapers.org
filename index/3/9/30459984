TAE Plus was built at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center to support the building of GUI user interfaces for highly interactive applications, such as realtime processing systems and scientific analysis system. TAE Plus is designed as a productivity tool for the user interface designer. Human factor experts and user interface designers frequently do not want to have to learn the programming details of the windowing environment before they use a GUI development tool to prototype and/or develop an application's user interface. TAE Plus has been developed with this user in mind. TAE Plus is a user interface management system that supports (1) interactively constructing the visual layout of an application screen, (2) rehearsing the UI, (3) generating the application source code to manage the UI, (3) generating the application source code to manage the UI, and (4) providing run-time services to manage the UI during application execution.
