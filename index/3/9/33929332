SQL Server 7.0 offers three different styles of replication that we call Transactional Replication, Snapshot Replication, and Merge Replication. Merge Replication means that data changes can be performed at any replica, and that the changes performed at multiple replicas are later merged together. Because Merge Replication allows updates to disconnected replicas, it is particularly well suited to applications that require a lot of autonomy. A special process called the Merge Agent propagates changes between replicas, filters data as appropriate, and detects and handles conflicts according to user-specified rules.
