Would a school system allow a person with only an eighth-grade education to become an English teacher? Would a self-taught math teacher be given full responsibility for the high school math program? The answers to these questions are obvious to everyone: to become a subject-matter specialist school teacher, one must demonstrate competency by fulfilling state certification requirements. Yet these same school systems, which have well-defined qualification standards for English teachers and math techers, today often assign full responsibility for the computer studies/computer science program to teachers who are self-taught or whose formal training is equivalent to an eight-grade education in the subject. While it is easy to understand the prachical constraints that make these things necessary at the present time, it should also be easy to see that this unusual situation clashessharply with the practice in all other subject areas. A task group of the Association for Computing Machinery's Elementary and Secondary Subcommittee has been formed to study the issue of teacher certification for computing teachers. This panel will discuss proposed curriculum and solicit reaction from interested attendees.
