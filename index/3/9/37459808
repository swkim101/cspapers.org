Members of geographically distributed work groups often complain of a feeling of isolation and of not knowing “who is around”. Argohalls attempt to solve this problem by integrating video icons, clustered into groups representing physical hallways, into the Argo telecollaboration system. Argo users can “hang out” in hallways in order to keep track of the co-workers on their projects, and they can roam other hallways to “run into” whoever happens to be there.
