Learning from Observation (LFO) has been widely applied in various types of robot system. It helps reduce the work of the programmer. But the available systems have application limited to rigid objects. Deformable objects are not considered because: 1) it is difficult to describe their state, and 2) too many operations are possible on them. In this paper, we choose the knot tying as case study for operating on nonrigid bodies, because a "knot theory" is available and the type of operations is limited. We describe the Knot Planning from Observation (KPO) paradigm, KPO theory and KPO system.
