Recognition of gender from face images has accomplished great popularity and also enlightened some new research problems. In this paper, we presented a new technique for gender classification using DWT and PCA. The technique has shown performance better than existing gender classification techniques. Experiments were carried out on standard face database used in various existing works of literature. Our proposed method provides high accuracy and is resilient to brightness changes comparison to those techniques which are in practice.
