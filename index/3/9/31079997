The KING KONG parser described by this paper attempts to apply the principles of relational grammar to the parsing of English in older to overcome the problems encountered by syntactic and semantic parsers. Specifically, this-parser uses relational categories such as subject, direct object, and instrument to map syntactic constituents onto semantic roles with in CD-like structures. Thus, the parser makes use of both syntactic and semantic information to guide its parse.
