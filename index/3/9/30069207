A new method for sensor fusion is proposed and a sensor fusion system using the method with parallel processing architecture is shown. The method utilizes mappings between sensor data and can be applied not only to static coordination transforms between sensor data, but also to the dynamics of actuators. Capabilities of the method are confirmed by edge tracking experiments using the experimental sensor fusion system with a PSD (position sensitive detector), a CCD camera and an XY-recorder. The system is based on parallel processing architecture using transputers in a network. It is concluded that parallel processing is an intrinsic architecture for sensor fusion.
