In a cooperative problem-solving environment, such as an office, a hierarchical planner can be incorporated into an intelligent interface to accomplish tasks. During plan execution monitoring, user actions may be inconsistent with system expectations. In this paper, we present an approach towards reasoning about these exceptions in an attempt to accommodate them into an evolving plan. We propose a representation for plans and domain objects that facilitates reasoning about exceptions.
