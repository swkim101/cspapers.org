This paper describes a new method for the specification and implementation of parallel activities on abstract objects. The priority relationship, which is of practical importance, is an important part of this method. The syntax of a suitable specification language is given. Restrictions in the lower levels of a hierarchical system can be hidden towards the upper levels (e.g. finite capacity of buffers or memories) by an appropriate use of synchronization. To make the use of a particular level as flexible as possible, the level should be subject to as few restrictions as possible. Synchronization conditions on different levels can lead to deadlocks.
