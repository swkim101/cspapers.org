T. Parsons proposed and partially analyzed the following pursuit-evasion problem on graphs: A team of searchers traverse the edges of a graph G in pursuit of a fugitive, who moves along the edges of the graph with complete knowledge of the locations of the pursuers. What is the smallest number s(G) of searchers that will suffice for guaranteeing capture of the fugitive? We show that determining whether s(G) ≤ K, for a given integer K, is NP-hard for general graphs but can be solved in linear time for trees. We also provide a structural characterization of those graphs with s(G) ≤ K for K = 1,2,3.
