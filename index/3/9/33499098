For feature representation, gradient and color features are most widely used, but how to effectively combine them for visual tracking is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a rich feature descriptor, MC-HOG, by leveraging rich gradient information across multiple color channels or spaces. Then MC-HOG features are embedded into the correlation tracking framework to estimate the state of the target. For handling the model drift problem caused by occlusion or distracter, we propose saliency proposals as prior information to provide candidates and reduce background interference. In addition to saliency proposals, a ranking strategy is proposed to determine the importance of these proposals by exploiting the learnt appearance filter, historical preserved object samples and the distracting proposals. In this way, the proposed approach could effectively explore the color-gradient characteristics and alleviate the model drift problem. Extensive evaluations performed on the benchmark dataset show the superiority of the proposed method.
