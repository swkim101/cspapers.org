We describe our approach in developing a Cloud Computing course for undergraduate CS majors. Teaching Cloud Computing can be a challenge, as there are many concepts that need to be covered within the limited time-frame of a three-credit hour semester course. Our approach focused on teaching the concepts and techniques for writing distributed client software using Cloud services, while covering other aspects of Cloud Computing at a higher-level using a story-telling approach. The core concepts were taught through a series of hands-on, scenario-driven, lectures and labs using Cloud services provided by Amazon.com. We share our experience in evaluating other Cloud Computing platforms for use in the class, and the challenges and false assumptions we encountered while teaching it.
