DRAW(IT)N is a package of four similar interpretive programmes used in teaching computer graphics. The four programmes, each consisting of a Fortran interpreter and subroutines, permits the definition and manipulation of 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional objects in a batch or interactive mode; further-more objects as instances may be grouped in sub-assemblies and assemblies in a hierarchial manner. In each case the output may be plotted on a standard plotter or CRT display unit; also an approximate drawing may be obtained on a line printer or CRT alphanumeric terminal, particularly for debugging purposes. Due to the nature of the programmes, modifications are readily made, that is, subsets can be used or additional commands added. Furthermore, being written in Fortran, the programmes are transportable and in fact have already been run on two different types of computer.
