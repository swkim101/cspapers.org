The idea of treating utterances as programs to be run in human brains or on a computer is jxirsued by advocating the use of the environment notion for natural language semantics. One structure of environments is devoted to keeping track of the real or fictive interlocutors and another to distinguishing somebody's linguistic behavior from its pretense and belief, while the third one represents the structure of topics in a discourse. The reguired flexibility of environment manipulation is expected to be supplied by the Bobrow-Wegbrelt primitives.
