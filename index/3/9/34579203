College students do not automatically possess basic standards of acceptable and unacceptable behavior with regard to computer hardware, software, and data sets. For their sake and our own we need to spell out what is expected of them.
Universities like mine have stated that students cannot be penalized or dismissed for theft or for damage to equipment/software/records unless they have received a copy of a written policy describing proscribed activities and their penalties.
This paper includes two sample policies. One considers only the use of software in microcomputer laboratories. The other covers mainframe, minicomputer and microcomputer facilities, use of resources in a chargeback system, penalties for plagiarism and illegal copying of software, and individual responsibilities with regard to group projects.
