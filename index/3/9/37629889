Today’s competitive business climate dictates that companies derive more information out of their databases. Analysts looking for business trends in their company’s database pose increasingly complex queries, often through query generator front-end tools. Businesses must extract as much useful information as possible from the large volumes of data that they keep, making parallel database technology a key component of such business intelligence applications. Enterprises and independent software vendors continue to require support for more application productivity and capability. And many growing enterprises have data stored in many systems, often both tile systems and database systems from a variety of vendors. All of these areas contribute to high performance at low cost. Being able to access and manage this data with high performance, fast response time and low total cost of ownership is a compelling advantage in business today.
