One might ask: “How have U.S.F. C.S. graduates done in their careers?” Quantitatively speaking, the succinct answer, based on Table 1, appears to be “Magnifique:” At a 1976 annual salary of $19,100 for a 29-year old professional, they are among the higher-paid of all graduates from university-level baccalaureate programs. Qualitatively speaking, at a 1976 reunion attended by 27% of all C.S. alumni, they talked positively and optimistically about their careers. A similar phenomenon occurred at the most recent 1977 U.S.F. C.S. reunion
 The Administrative Management Society has surveyed 52,803 data processing position holders in seven job categories and employed by 4,895 U.S. companies in five industries and compiled average salaries, as of February 3, 1976 (I). The average U.S. programmer was then making an annual $13,572 ($261/week), a figure exceeded by our graduates after about 2 years of experience. However, the highest salaries, the survey reports, were in the western region of the U.S., with a programmer making an annual $16,900 ($325/week). Note, from Table 1, that our C.S. graduates, taken as a group, even though not all are programmers, exceed this figure also after about 4 years of experience.
