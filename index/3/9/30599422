The purpose of this paper is to present the mathematical background for using entropy in real-time scheduling as well as the relationship between entropy and utilization. We present a new scheduling algorithm based on entropy to schedule tasks in real-time systems. The goal is to minimize the uncertainty of the scheduling problem by executing the task with the highest entropy first without missing any deadline. The uncertainty measurement is based on the probability of the execution of a task during the hyper-period. This study aims to present entropy as a new parameter that can be used by researchers in different real-time systems fields.
