Sensor networks are envisioned to be rapidly deployed and used in a wide variety of applications. They are considered to be particularly apt for environments which are remote, hostile, or inaccessible. In such environments infrastructure does not exist, and is hard to build and maintain. One of the inherent problems of such scenarios is deployment. Ideally sensor nodes are deployed in ways best suited to sensing the target phenomenon in the environment. However, this information is typically not available in advance. A possible workaround is to allow some of the sensor nodes to be mobile. The ability to move the sensor nodes to locations of interest is a tool that reduces the dependency on static deployment to a certain extent. In this work, we show the utility of a static sensor network augmented with a single mobile node in a contour finding task.
