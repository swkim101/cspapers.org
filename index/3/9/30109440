Given a collection of documents, various multi-document summarization methods have been proposed to generate a short summary. However, few studies have been reported on aggregating different summarization methods to possibly generate better summarization results. We propose a weighted consensus summarization method to combine the results from single summarization systems. Experimental results on DUC2004 data sets demonstrate the performance improvement by aggregating multiple summarization systems, and our proposed weighted consensus summarization method outperforms other combination methods.
