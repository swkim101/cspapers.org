This paper presents a new onboard locating system of an autonomous vehicle using signposts put along routes. The locating system estimates location and direction of the vehicle on the basis of the observa- tion of signposts and revolution counts of main wheels. The Kalman filter is employed to estimate the loca- tion and direction of the vehicle on real time base, and smooth and accurate estimation is realized. The ex- perimental result shows that the accurate location and direction of the vehicle is obtained through the system.
