An optimal grid is designed so that the reliability of the camera focal length calibration using it is theoretically maximized. The analysis is based on a statistical error model of the line fitting in digital images. The reliability of the focal length is quantitatively computed from the reliability of the edges to which lines are fitted. A realistic device is designed by adding many technical improvements, and a prototype model is shown.
