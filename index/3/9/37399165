Twitter is a unique microblog, which is different from conventional social media in terms of its quickness and on-the-spot-ness. Many Twitter's users send messages, which is commonly called "tweets", to Twitter on the spot with mobile phones or smart phones, and some of them send photos and geotags as well as tweets. Most of the photos are sent to Twitter soon after taken. In case of photos related to some events, most of them are taken during the events. We think that Twitter event photo mining is more useful to under- stand what happens currently over the world than only text-based Twitter event mining. In this paper, we propose a system to mine events visually from the Twitter stream. To do that, we use not only tweets having both geotags and photos but also tweets having geotags or photos for textual analysis or visual analysis. Although there exist many works related to Twitter mining using only text analysis such as typhoon and earthquake detection by Sakaki et al. [1], only a limited number of works exist on Twitter mining using image analysis. Nakaji et al. [2] proposed a system to mine representative photos related to the given keyword or term from a large number of geo-tweet photos. They extracted representative photos related to events such as "typhoon" and "New Year's Day". They used only geotagged photo tweets the number of which are limited compared to all the photo tweets. Gao et al. [3] proposed a method to mine brand product photos fromWeibo which employs supervised image recognition, which is different from event detection. They integrated visual features and social factors (users, relations, and locations) as well as textual features for brand product photo mining. In this paper, we detect visual events using geotagged non-photo tweets and non-geotagged photo tweets as well as geotagged photo tweets. In the experiments, we show some examples of detected events and their photos such as "rainbow", "fireworks" and "festival".
