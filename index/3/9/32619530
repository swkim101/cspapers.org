With appropriate software, computer graphics can be an ideal introductory science course, one that is attractive to many students who would normally try to avoid such courses. It is important that this course emphasize mathematics and algorithms rather than results; a “black box” approach to technical issues omits the intellectual rigor that is essential to the way science is carried out. Many of the standard techniques in graphics are accessible to students at a relatively low level, even without programming experience.
