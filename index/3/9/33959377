The paper at hand aims to introduce for the first time the concept of robot behavioral mapping, which is an amalgamated environment and human representation suitable for long term navigation planning, task scheduling and decision making. The robot perception mechanisms comprised the cornerstone for metric and semantic mapping, which gave thrust to the development of robots capable of apprehending the operational environment in a human compatible manner. Yet, safety is a mandatory ingredient for the human-robot cohabitation and, thus, social mapping became a momentous element in the robotics community, where the human presence is modeled along with the environment. The behavioral mapping constitutes the evolution of the aforementioned technologies in the near future, aiming to consolidate an additional dimension to the domain of robotics perception in accordance which, robot companions should shape behavioral conformation for living with people.
