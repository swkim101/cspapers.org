For both practical and transcendent reasons, large numbers of school personnel should be trained in computing as soon as possible. Given the educational backgrounds of most such personnel, that training will have to be largely remedial from the computer scientist's point of view. At the same time, to be attractive to such personnel, the training has to carry a graduate label. This paper suggests what these practical and transcendent reasons are and briefly describes an example of the sort of training program needed.
