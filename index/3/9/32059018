A novel technique for synchronization of burst signal using a first order digital phase locked loop (DPLL) with modified structure has been reported in this paper. The modified DPLL structure possess the merit of quick signal acquisition time, better noise handling capability, extended range of stability region etc. The merit of the proposed structure has been verified using computer simulation and hardware experiment.
