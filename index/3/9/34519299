In the virtual world, changing properties of objects such as their color, size or shape is one of the main means of communication. Objects are hidden or revealed when needed, or undergo changes in color or size to communicate importance. I am interested in how these features can be brought into the real world by modifying the optical properties of physical objects and devices, and how this dynamic appearance influences interaction and behavior. The interplay of creating functional prototypes of interactive artifacts and devices, and studying them in controlled experiments forms the basis of my research. During my research I created a three level model describing how physical artifacts and interfaces can be appropriated to allow for dynamic appearance: (1) dynamic objects, (2) augmented objects, and (3) augmented surroundings. This position paper outlines these three levels and details instantiations of each level that were created in the context of this thesis research.
