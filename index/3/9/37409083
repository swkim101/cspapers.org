Introduction We are studying various metnods of representing numbers in semantic networks, Tnere are two reasons for tnis. First/ semantic networks nave been proposed since tne late sixties as formalisms for tne general representation of knowledge. Lately , tneir popularity has increased. Yet problem areas persist for whicn tne representations have not yet been carefully worked out. Some of tnese are discussed in Woods, 1975. Numeric information is another of the issues tnat "need to be addressed and solutions integrated into a consistent wnole in order to produce a logically adequate semantic network formalism" (Woods, 197b, p. bO). Tne second reason for tne interest in representing numeric information is that reflection on tnis problem, and experimentation witn various alternatives nave led to tne conclusion tnat numeric information is oasicaliy syntactic ratner than semantic. Tnis conclusion suggests tnat tne way to provide numeric information to a semantic network is to provide it witn a gracious interface to a syntactic representation say a syntactic network. Moreover , such a dual network representation seems generally useful for natural language understanding systems. Tnis note sets tne stage for an explica-tion of semantic and syntactic networks, tneir differences, and possible interfaces between tnem. i\ more complete discussion is in preparation. Numeric information provides an example domain for the study.
