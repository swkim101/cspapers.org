The Beyond MPI birds-of-a-feather session is intended to bring together user community pioneers of recent computing languages which address the need to specify parallelism within a program. This BOF focuses on languages and derivative language specifications that express parallelism in a higher-level context beyond the explicit call-based API provided by MPI. Example languages include Unified Parallel C (UPC) and Co-Array Fortran (CAF), although there will be time allocated to discussing emerging languages as well. This forum provides an opportunity for the UPC and CAF user community to share experiences and propose improvements to language innovators and industry as well as share best known methods and solutions to common issues. Practical solutions and current implementations are the focus of this BOF.
