The UbiComp research community has a long history of interdisciplinary research on technology, engineering, and human behavior. But, one disciplinary voice that often seems to be missing is design. Due to the value of design to integrate knowledge and insights from across disciplines and focus on the future world, it seems that design might play a critical role in helping UbiComp research through its holistic approach. China is the world leader in manufacturing, and it is almost never the place where the innovative, high-tech products and services are designed. With UbiComp in China, now seems the perfect time to discuss bridging east and west and bringing design to UbiComp. This workshop aims to provide a disciplinary forum for researchers and experts from design computer science, psychology and anthropology to exchange ideas on the issue of collaboration. It will build understanding across disciplines and explore the potential opportunity for design in UbiComp research and practice.
