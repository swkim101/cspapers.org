After many years, the robotics research community has settled on standard middleware: the Robot Operating System (ROS). This standard presents a great opportunity for educational robotics. This hands-on workshop will engage participants in ROS-based curricula for CS 02 and advanced undergraduates. The workshop will highlight how ROS has simplified, enabled, and expanded flipped robotics curricula in CS 02. Our advanced materials show how ROS enables easy access to the robotics research community, permitting larger and more research-representative projects. This workshop is two long hands-on sessions punctuated with short reports from the presenters' experience. Participants will implement the first two assignments of our CS 2 curriculum. http://www.cs.hmc.edu/dodds/ROSatSIGCSE2013.
