The successful exploitation of LSI for creating products with greater function at reduced cost per operation is critically dependent on the availability of design systems that comprehend the job to be done. As system and component technologies continue their rapid rate of development, there is an increasingly higher probability that our ability to capitalize on them will be severely impacted by the lack of appropriate design system technology development. These impacts will take the form of our inability to deliver an affordable product to the marketplace while the demand still exists and before the technology is completely absolete.
 This position statement is not intended as an indictment of those who presently plan and implement “DA” but rather it is a warning to both users and developers of DA indicating where we will end up unless we look beyond the activities that engage us today and change our focus from “Design Automation Tools” to “Product Design Systems”.
