This presentation describes a method for generating functional test programs for Large Scale Integrated Circuits (LSI) and Logic Cards having hundreds of logic gates.
 J. P. Roth's D-Algorithm, and S. Seshu's Logic Simulation Method have both been used extensively for generating logic circuit test patterns.
 We have developed a more efficient method which incorporates both of these methods.
 The new method solves diagnostic problems related to the logical circuits obtained by partitioning logic circuits making up the digital hardware.
 In this presentation, we describe a test pattern generating method, and an Automatic Diagnostic Program Generator (ADP-3) using this method with a FACOM 230-60 computer.
