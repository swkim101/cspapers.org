This paper presents the Doppler Power spectrum density (PSD) of a cellular mobile channel when directional antennas are deployed at both ends of the radio link. A macrocellular environment is modeled by assuming Gaussian and uniform scatter density around mobile station. The statistics of angle of arrival are used to explain the Doppler power density spectrum for macrocellular environment. Results are shown for various scenarios and the impact of the beamwidth of the directional antennas as well as the direction of motion of the mobile on Doppler PSD is investigated.
