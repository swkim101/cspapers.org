There are several kinds of errors for which error detecting and error correcting codes have been constructed. Solid burst errors are common in many communications. In general communication due to the long messages, the strings of solid bursts of small length may repeat in a vector itself. The concept of repeated bursts is introduced by Beraradi, Dass and Verma[3] which has opened a new area of study. They defined 2-repeated bursts and obtained results for detection and correction of such type of errors. This paper considers a new similar kind of error which will be termed as '2-repeated solid burst error of length b'. Lower and upper bounds on the number of parity checks required for the existence of codes that detect 2-repeated solid burst error of length b or less are obtained. This is followed by an example of such a code. Further, codes capable of detecting and simultaneously correcting such errors have also been dealt with.
