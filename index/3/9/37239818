The benefits of engaging undergraduate students in research are numerous and well-known. Therefore, many schools are encouraging undergraduate research. However, carrying out undergraduate research in a liberal arts school can be challenging â€“ liberal arts schools usually lack the resources typically available in larger research universities; the research programs of faculty at such schools are often insular; undergraduates may not always be adequately prepared or motivated for research; and research is only one of the many activities competing for the time and energy of undergraduate students. The objective of this panel is to discuss how undergraduate research can be successfully carried out in liberal arts schools in spite of all these constraints. We want to examine the mechanics of undergraduate research in such an environment which practices work and which do not.
