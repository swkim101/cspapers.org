One of the core XP (Xtreme Programming) practices is that of the "on-site customer". In the words of Kent Beck (2000) in his book "eXtreme Programming Explained" the intent is that a "real customer must sit with the team, available to answer questions, resolve disputes, and set small-scale priorities" â€¦ "someone who will really use the system when it is in production". This panel brings together practitioners and researchers to discuss and offer wisdom on the challenges and opportunities inherent in the practice.
