This paper studies the performance of cognitive underlay decode-and-forward relay systems, where relay and destination nodes are equipped with multiple antennas and channel state information (CSI) of interference links are assumed to be imperfect. To analyze the effect of imperfect CSI on the system performance, the system outage probability has been derived in closed-form expression. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to verify the analysis results under various system conditions.
