Although kernel bugs have had serious security implications for the past three decades, researchers have not studied their importance or the mechanics for discovering, exploiting, and fixing them as much as theyýve focused on other information technology infrastructure components. Yet, over the past several years, an increasing number of kernel security vulnerabilities have demonstrated that the most important component of todayýs operating systems is not free of bugs--when these vulnerabilities are exploited, serious security incidents ensue.In this installment of Attack Trends, I focus on kernel security issues, recent vulnerabilities, and the emergence of publicly available exploit code for them.
