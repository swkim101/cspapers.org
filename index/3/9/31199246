Vulcanisable, elastomeric chloroprene-sulphur copolymers having viscosities of from 60 to 35 MU, strengths of >20 MPa and sulphur contents of from about 0.5 to 0.7%, by weight, in the batch are obtained by polymerising chloroprene in the presence of from 0.10 to 0.35%, by weight, of sulphur to form a latex I, polymerising chloroprene in the presence of from 0.50 to 1.00% by weight, of sulphur to form a latex II, mixing latices I and II in a ratio of from 4:1 to 1:4 (based in each case on solids), optionally together with other sulphur-modified polychloroprene latices, the mixture is peptised and worked-up to form the solid rubber, the percentages quoted being based on the quantity of monomer.
