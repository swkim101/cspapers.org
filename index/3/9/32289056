Area estimation of I layouts has -:come an important requirement for early design and top-down chip planning tools. Especially the relation of area and aspect ratio (shape function) is necessary for chip planning. Statistical models have been published with good results for standard cell blocks with near unity aspect ratios. This paper describes a new model for the prediction of shape functions for aspect ratios up to 15. The model is based on the shape and connectivity of adjacent cells. It can be used for many different design styles and has been tested for standard cell blocks and for the placement of general cells.
