If you are a software professional, your job is changing. Outsourcing and global development affect many things in our work environment: what and where we build, how (and when) we communicate, and how we prepare ourselves for the future.
 Outsourcing and global development inherently create challenges with long-distance communication, cultural differences, and crossing organizational boundaries. For example, how do software interface contracts help or hinder system integration? How can a team in one country extend or maintain software built by developers in another country?
 This Panel will appeal to anyone whose job is affected by outsourcing and globalization. Panelists will present and discuss both social and technical issues.
