Proposes to control the attitude of space structures using a serial three-link PUMA-type manipulator that can be mounted on the space structure. This unconventional method of attitude control exploits the nonholonomic nature of the constraints that arise due to the conservation of angular momentum. The author adopts a surface integral approach for manipulator motion planning that will reorient the space structure in any desired way. The salient features of the algorithm are (a) it is possible to mathematically prove the controllability of the system, (b) the motion of the manipulator can be planned amidst additional constraints like joint limits of the manipulator, and (c) the algorithm can be easily extended to flexible space structures.
