Welcome to the Proceedings of the 25th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2015), held at the Portola Hotel & Spa, Monterey, California, USA. This year's program includes 30 wonderful papers which cover topics ranging from high performance transaction processing systems to formal specification for practical implementations, from techniques for energy-aware systems to experiences with globally distributed software in the wild, from bug finding to big data. The program committee worked hard to select some of the most creative and interesting ideas in computer systems research today, and each accepted paper was lovingly shepherded by a program committee member to make sure the papers are as readable and complete as possible. We hope you will enjoy the program as much as we did in selecting it.
