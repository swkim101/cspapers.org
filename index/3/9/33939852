This paper describes an exercise used in a first-year graduate course, Programming Languages Foundations, which deals with formal methods of speci~ing the semantics of a programming language. By having the students translate semantic equations directly into Prolog clauses thereby constructing an interpreter, this exercise makes denotational semantics more tangible and practical, After a brief description of the course, the two parts of the exercise are presented and illustrated by an example.
