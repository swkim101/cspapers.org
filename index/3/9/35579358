Service learning is a great idea, but can be fraught with problems. We have taken an alternative to the project-course approach. Instead of team-based system-development, we use a student-consultant model. Students individually consult with a nonprofit.
 Each student leads a small technology project that brings about sustainable change in an organization, while developing analysis, planning, and communication skills. One instructor can manage 30 clients a semester, and we have had nearly 400 to date. Our clients are happy and recruit others.
 In this session we will share our tricks and help attendees adapt them to their situations: managing a large number of partnerships, helping students develop leadership and communication skills, and assessing their performance. A student presenter will describe her consulting experience.
