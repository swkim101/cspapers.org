Pointwise and pairwise collaborative ranking are two major classes of algorithms for personalized item ranking. This paper proposes a novel joint learning method named alternating pointwise-pairwise learning (APPL) to improve ranking performance. APPL combines the ideas of both pointwise and pairwise learning, and is able to produce a more effective prediction model. The extensive experiments with both explicit and implicit feedback settings on four real-world datasets demonstrate that APPL performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods.
