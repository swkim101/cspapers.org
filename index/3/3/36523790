Most universities have experienced the stresses of shrinking budgets and increasingly scarce resources during a time when it also has been necessary to develop viable programs in computer science, computer engineering and information systems. Many, as a consequence, have had to confront issues about the legitimate reallocation of such resources (6, i0). Recently, rapid development of high-level computer software which is making computing power more accessible to technically untrained users has begun to erode the gap between non-technical users and data processing specialists with respect to simple or routine applications (9, 13, 17). The coincidence of such technical changes in the business world with scarce resources for higher education recommend a review and perhaps a refocusing of the goals and orientation of four-year undergraduate information systems programs, particularly those located in business schools.
