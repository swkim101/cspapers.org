This paper presents ToneSense, a new paradigm for communication between devices using different wireless technologies. ToneSense encodes information into the transmission power levels of regular frames. Receivers sense the power strength and decode as meaningful information bits. Evaluations show that ToneSense achieves â‰¤ 4% symbol error rate. Our work sheds light on wireless coexistence problems and cross-technology communications.
