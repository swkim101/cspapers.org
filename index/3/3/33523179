In this paper, a method for robot self-localization based on a catadioptric omni-directional sensor is introduced. The method uses natural geometric landmarks of the environment. It is assumed that the robot moves on flat surfaces and straight lines can be identified in the surrounding environment image acquired by the catadioptric system. This omni-directional vision system is based on a camera plus a convex mirror designed to obtain (by hardware) the ground plane bird's eye view. Results from the application to a real robot moving on RoboCup soccer field and concerning the method's accuracy are presented.
