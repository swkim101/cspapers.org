In an increasingly mobile connected world, our user experience of mobile applications more and more depends on the performance of cellular radio access networks (RAN). To achieve high quality of experience for the user, it is imperative that operators identify and diagnose performance problems quickly. In this paper, we describe our experience in understanding the challenges in automating the diagnosis of RAN performance problems. Working with a major cellular network operator on a part of their RAN that services more than 2 million users, we demonstrate that fine-grained modeling and analysis could be the key towards this goal. We describe our methodology in analyzing RAN problems, and highlight a few of our findings, some previously unknown. We also discuss lessons from our attempt at building automated diagnosis solutions.
