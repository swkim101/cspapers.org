From an ongoing research project on teaching hash tables using worked examples, we present four preliminary observations. First, that rather than there being a small set of common misconceptions, student misconceptions are diverse and often unique to the student. Second, that students' naive language about hash tables when given a pretest is influenced by words from the Internet (e.g. "hashtag"). Third, we observed that students' language on concept questions evolves with repeated testing, becoming more conceptually accurate but technically less precise. And finally, that students' code code correctness is not correlated to code style, but is correlated to how students performed on the concept questions.
