Automated execution of remote tasks in hazardous environments is shown to result from proper integration of computer models and sensor directed control. The highly modular GISC (generic intelligent system control) approach facilitates such integration and thus enables conventional technologies to demonstrate highly intelligent behavior. Extensive use of sensing and computer modeling automates many remote operations resulting in fast, safe remote operations. The structure of the GISC environment facilitates integration of sensing systems to map a hazardous environment to support dynamic construction of the world model which is used to automate remote tasks. When world model information is coupled with real-time sensor-directed control of a robot, tasks can be accomplished automatically even in unstructured environments. Thus, operations which are very slow and potentially hazardous when done remotely are converted to fast, safe tasks for even inexperienced operators.
