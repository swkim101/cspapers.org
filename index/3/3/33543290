When agile methods arose, they were tried in small, collocated teams developing medium critical client or server software mostly with internal teams or effort-based contracts. Even today many proponents and skeptics of agile development believe that these parameters limit its use. Others have tried to cross these boundaries and have applied the agile value system to large teams, distributed development, highly critical or embedded systems or in an environment that doesn't support decision-making. Some of them have succeeded, others have failed. Most of them had to adapt agile techniques to their specific context.
 This workshop tries to deepen the understanding of agile values, principles and techniques by exploring these experiences. We invite practitioners and academics who have experience with testing the boundaries of agility or are interested in their findings.
