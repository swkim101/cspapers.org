We propose using relaxed deep supervision (RDS) within convolutional neural networks for edge detection. The conventional deep supervision utilizes the general groundtruth to guide intermediate predictions. Instead, we build hierarchical supervisory signals with additional relaxed labels to consider the diversities in deep neural networks. We begin by capturing the relaxed labels from simple detectors (e.g. Canny). Then we merge them with the general groundtruth to generate the RDS. Finally we employ the RDS to supervise the edge network following a coarse-to-fine paradigm. These relaxed labels can be seen as some false positives that are difficult to be classified. Weconsider these false positives in the supervision, and are able to achieve high performance for better edge detection. Wecompensate for the lack of training images by capturing coarse edge annotations from a large dataset of image segmentations to pretrain the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the well-known BSDS500 dataset (ODS F-score of .792) and obtains superior cross-dataset generalization results on NYUD dataset.
