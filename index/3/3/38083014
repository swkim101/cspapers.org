A Frequency - Modulated Continuous - Wave (FMCW) radar system is built to measure the distance to target in range of 1 - 4.5m with high accuracy. A method of range resolution enhancement using Gaussian window and Gaussian interpolation is proposed, simulated and implemented. The simulated results show that FMCW radar systems with Gaussian interpolation method implemented provide measurement errors smaller than 1mm, which is 500 times less than those of conventional systems. The proposed resolution enhancement algorithm is implemented on the designed FMCW radar system. The experiment results show that the designed radar system exhibits the maximum error less than 3mm in range of 1 - 4.5m. Methods to overcome the non-idea characteristics of the radar system is also proposed and implemented.
