The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the Management Information Systems (MIS) curricula in higher education in the United States (U.S.) and the Republic of China (R.O.C.). Several factors that affect the MIS curricula and its development in these two countries were closely examined. Similarities and differences were identified and compared; strengths and weaknesses were analyzed and described.
In particular, this study focused on the undergraduate MIS programs in both countries. Comparisons of the MIS programs were made concerning: MIS program history, MIS program setting, admission requirements and standards, graduation requirements and standards, computer hardware and software facilities, curriculum model adopted, required courses, instructional methods, faculty profiles, student profiles, and relationships with the industry. Based on the findings, some recommendations for improving the Chinese MIS curricula were offered.
