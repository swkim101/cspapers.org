Applications that manipulate digital audio and video represent a growing class of computations executed by workstation users. This class of computations is known as continuous media. Their distinguishing characteristic is that they must process and transport media samples within application-specific time constraints. To support these real-time activities, the operating system must manage resources so that their time constraints can be satisfied whenever possible.
