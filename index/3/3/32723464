In this paper, we propose efficient Zero-Forcing (ZF) Detectors based on the a Group Detection (GD) approach in order to reduce the computational cost of the conventional linear detectors when they are adopted in Massive MIMO systems. Using the GD, we first divide a Massive MIMO system into two MIMO ones with smaller dimensions. Then, we apply the conventional ZF detector to the sub-systems to recover the signals. The resulting detector is called ZF-GD. In order to further improve the But Error Rate (BER) performance of the receiver, we propose the second detector, called ZF-IGD, by applying the conventional ZF detector to the sub-systems in an iterative manner. Both analytical and simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance and complexity of the proposed detectors. It is shown that they are suitable for Massive MIMO systems and can be used flexibly depending on the compromise between performance improvement and computational complexity.
