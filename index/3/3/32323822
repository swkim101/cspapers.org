The ever-increasing knowledge graphs impose an urgent demand of providing effective and easy-to-use query techniques for end users. Structured query languages, such as SPARQL, offer a powerful expression ability to query RDF datasets. However, they are difficult to use. Keywords are simple but have a very limited expression ability. Natural language question (NLQ) is promising on querying knowledge graphs. A huge challenge is how to understand the question clearly so as to translate the unstructured question into a structured query. In this paper, we present a data + oracle approach to answer NLQs over knowledge graphs. We let users verify the ambiguities during the query understanding. To reduce the interaction cost, we formalize an interaction problem and design an efficient strategy to solve the problem. We also propose a query prefetch technique by exploiting the latency in the interactions with users. Extensive experiments over the QALD dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective as it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both precision and recall.
