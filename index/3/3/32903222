If one wishes to execute specialized processing on the HTTP requests and responses that flow between WWW clients and servers, one can add the processing in the clients, in the servers, or between them. We describe a novel approach to the latter; we generalize the notion of proxy servers to construct application-specific proxies that act as transducers on the HTTP stream. We have built a sample set of transducers to demonstrate the idea and an initial toolkit to ease the task of constructing these transducers and attaching them to the HTTP stream.
