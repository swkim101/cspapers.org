The implementation of GERM, a data base management system based on the Entity-Relationship model, is presented. GERM is an end-user system providing complete facilities for interactive data base management, including retrieval, browsing, update, definition and reporting. The system has a modular design with the functional components arranged hierarchically. This paper discusses two specific areas, utility components and data access components. The data access components are layered, each approaching data access at a different level of abstraction. An example retrieval request is used to demonstrate how the components interact.
