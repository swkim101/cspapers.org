We propose a novel structure, the data-sharing graph, for characterizing sharing patterns in large-scale data distribution systems. We analyze this structure in two such systems and uncover small-world patterns for data-sharing relationships. Using the data-sharing graph for system characterization has potential both for basic science, because we can identify new structures emerging in real, dynamic networks; and for system design, because we can exploit these structures when designing data location and delivery mechanisms. We conjecture that similar patterns arise in other large-scale systems and that these patterns can be exploited for mechanism design.
