A study has been carried out to relate the maintenance performance of a collection of PL/I programs to measures that characterize control flow, data usage, and software science attributes of the programs. The programs are from two subsystems of a business data processing application. Interesting relationships were found not only between the maintenance data and the measures but also among the measures themselves. This paper discusses some of the stronger of these relationships.
