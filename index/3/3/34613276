Object-oriented systems often exhibit idiomatic and recurring structures of objects and classes that solve particular design problems and make systems more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable. Design patterns have been proposed as one way to represent, record and reuse these recurring design structures and associated design experience. Here we report on experiences in using design patterns during the design of object-oriented systems.
