In this p;,per I [ discuss the formal relationship between the process of focussing and interpret;ition of pronominal anaphora. The discussion of focussing extends the work of Grosz [1977]. Foct,ssing is defined algorithmical]y as a process which chooses a focus of attention in a discourse and moves it around as the speaker's focus ch'mges. The paper shows how to use the focussing algorithm by ;m extended example given below. DII Alfred a,ld Zohar liked to play baseball. 2 They played it everyday after school before dinner. 3 After their game, the two usually went for ice cream cones. 4 They tasted really good. 5 Alfred always had the vanilla super scooper, 6 while Zohar tried the flavor of the day cone. 7 After the cones had been eaten, 8 the boys went home to study. In this example, the discourse focusses initially on baseball. The focus moves in DI-3 to the ice cream cone. Using this example, I show how the formal algorithm computes focus and determines how the focus moves according to the signals which the speaker uses in discourse to indicate the movement.
