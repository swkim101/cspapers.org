S EMEDICO is a semantic search engine designed to support literature search in the life sciences by integrating the semantics of the domain at all stages of the search process—from query formulation via query processing up to the presentation of results. S EMEDICO excels with an ad-hoc search approach which directly reﬂects relevance in terms of information density of entities and relations among them (events) and, a truly unique feature, ranks interaction events by certainty information reﬂecting the degree of factuality of the encountered event.
