Computing pervades students' academic and personal lives. Increasingly the core concepts of computational thinking are required for success in other fields. Should CS Principles become a general education requirement for all freshmen? This BOF will provide a platform for the discussion of whether or not the various courses taught as CS-0, Introduction to CS, or CS Principles have clearly defined a set of core competencies that should be required of all undergraduates. Do the national initiatives around computational thinking and CS 10K herald consensus or controversy around those core competencies? Discussion will include a look at one course that has been adopted as a general education requirement; its core concepts, textbooks and documented learning outcomes; and the institutional rationale for its acceptance as a general education requirement-filling course.
 Related to this question is a proposed new CS Principles AP exam that is currently in development. The BoF will describe how the course above relates to the CS Principles AP Exam and the core competencies described through the CS Principles project. Discussion leaders will describe the value of the CS Principles AP initiative in gaining political and administrative support for introducing the course into high schools. They will share some initial data illustrating the wide variety of challenges encountered while introducing the same course as a pre-AP course into regional high schools.
