In this paper, we present a new Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) design method for a class of output time-varying delay-derivative dependant and delay-dependant systems. Based on a suitable choice of a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the Linear Matrix Inequality LMI optimization, the stability of the estimation error is obtained and the gains of the observer are computed. In fact, the specific delay-derivative-dependent technique is introduced to reduce the time-varying delay conservatism on the state estimation. Furthermore, to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed theoretical concepts, a numerical example is taken.
