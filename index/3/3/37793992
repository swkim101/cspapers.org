This paper illustrates four experiences in cross software development for microprocessors. After a comparison among some programming techniques (high-level languages, macroprocessors, meta-assemblers and special purpose systems) a translator writing system has been used to implement a cross-assembler, a simulator, a microassembler and a cross compiler for a microprocessor, showing its great flexibility at a low cost. Each of the four applications is briefly described and compared with similar programs written using other techniques.
