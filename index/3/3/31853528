The Microprocessor Software Engineering Facility (MSEF) is an integrated set of software tools to support the development and maintenance of microcomputer software. The MSEF is hosted on a PDP-11 computer under the UNIX operating system but could support the production of software for many different microcomputers. The MSEF Change Control Library promotes defining, updating, and integrating parts of a software configuration, isolation of user work environments, and version control. The MSEF supports the organized testing of software components by associating test scenarios and test results with the components to be tested. The MSEF also provides automatic change logging with a configuration audit trail. A macro assembler supporting structured langauge constructs is included in the tool complement.
