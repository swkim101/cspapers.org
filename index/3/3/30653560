This paper characterizes two ad hoc routing protocols LAR and DSDV for sensor area networking on TinyOS. To the best of our knowledge no such comparison of these selected protocols is being made on TinyOS, an event driven component based operating system for embedded sensor networks. Energy utilization in mobile ad hoc networks or sensor networks is a major concern. Minimizing energy in terms of payload, battery power, CPU and memory utilization at a node are important factors that decide the potential of a routing scheme. This paper presents the comparison of the mentioned protocols on the basis of energy being consumed by the whole network. The scenario considered was the one in which the whole information was gathered at one node, i.e., the base station or the sink node of the network. Results indicate that LAR performs better than DSDV.
