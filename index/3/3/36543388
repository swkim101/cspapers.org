A lexical knowledge base is a repository of computational information about concepts intended to be generally useful in many application areas including computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and information science. It contains information derived from machine-readable dictionaries, the full text of reference books, the results of statistical analyses of text usages, and data manually obtained from human world knowledge.
