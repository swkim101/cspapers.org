Surveillance of public places has become a world-wide concern. The ability to identify abnormal human behaviors in real-time is fundamental to the success of intelligent surveillance systems. The recognition of abnormal and suspicious human walking patterns is an important step towards the achievement of this goal. In this research, we have developed an intelligent visual surveillance system that can classify normal and abnormal human walking trajectories in outdoor environments by learning from demonstration. It takes into account both the local and global characteristics of the observed trajectories and be able to identify their normality in real-time. By utilizing support vector learning and a similarity measure based on hidden Markov models, the developed system has produced satisfactory results on real-life data during testing.
