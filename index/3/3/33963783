This paper describes an algorithm allowing systemization of data base design operations. The objectives of the algorithm are three-fold: it allows (1st) the synthesis of a physical data structure from an appropriate description of reality (i.e. from a conceptual view specification) such that (2nd) the operations required to map the physical data structure onto the most important logical structures are minimized and (3rd) anomalies in storage operations may not occur (i.e. the normalization criteria as proposed respectively by E.F. Codd (2), by W. Kent [4] and (less formally) by M.E. Senko [11] are respected). The algorithm may be used both for traditional data base systems (working with hierarchical and/or network data structures) as well as for relational data base systems.
