With the increasing complexity of today’s (and certainly tomorrow’s) integrated systems, the real design challenge has shifted from making first-time-right silicon to making a first-time-right specification and, of course, the associated chip that implements this specification correctly. Many of today’s systems on a chip contain embedded CPU and / or DSP cores and have a large amount of software that determines the function of the chip. To know that all the system functions are specified and implemented correctly often requires hours of exposure to real data in a real user environment. This can not, to any reasonable approximation, be done by means of simulation. For that reason fine-tuning of the system spec can usually only be done if an initial silicon-version of the system has become available.
