In strategic management there has been a debate over many years. Already in 1962 Alfred Chandler had stated: Structure follows Strategy. In the nineteen eighties, Michael Porter modified Chandler's dictum about structure following strategy by introducing a second level of structure: organizational structure follows strategy, which in turn follows structure. So the question became: what is leading what?.
 Technology has in this debate been seen as a part of either the structure of the organisation itself, or part of the development of the environment in which the organisation tries to survive by adapting. The notion that technological advancement can also change the paradigmas of organisational strategy-development is new. This has mainly to do with the impact of the technological changes on the workflow and procedures of organisations. Never before they were so profound as in our days.
 Technological change affects us on different levels of our strategic development. I will give three examples of changes that are occurring or have occurred in "Sound and Vision".
 The first is the introduction of RFID transmitters in admission rings for the Sound and Vision experience. The second is the setup of a back office media asset management, storage and distribution structure for the Public Broadcasters. The third is the development of the archive towards becoming a Media-Application Service Provider.
