This paper describes a local navigation strategy for obstacle avoidance of autonomous mobile robots. Primarily a vision sensor was employed to navigate the robot, and ultrasonic sensors were used to avoid collision when a robot neared obstacles. Instead of building a local map. the heading angle and speed of the robot was determined from the image and range data by use of approximate reasoning during every feedback ('on t rol cyr 1 c .
