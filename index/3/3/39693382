In this paper, we describe experiences of various projects when exploiting a collaborative design approach for the development of new services or products. Early user involvement in the product development process is nowadays generally accepted and standardised [7]. Also broad stakeholder involvement, ecosystem and living lab approaches are introduced for more contextual, need-driven and holistic development of service system. [6] However, the methods and techniques for accomplishing this may vary widely. Various methods naturally fit for certain special purposes but also customizing of methods for special needs and particular contexts is very important. Broad stakeholder involvement and commitment for lengthy development process needs to be taken into account when planning design process. In addition co-design and authentic, active user participation to design, calls for the new approaches, methods and tools and even renewal of the traditional model of user centered design.
