In this paper we introduce an artificial intelligence project and operating systems project that use a model railroad system to focus on high-level software concepts. The use of the railroad system differs from that found in hardware oriented courses. Instead of concentrating on low-level hardware issues, we use the railroad layout to present a physical representation of the central issues in these courses. We begin with a description of each project, the concepts they cover, and the design of the train system, Next, we discuss our experiences using the railroad system.
