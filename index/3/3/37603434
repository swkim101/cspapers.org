FRM is an experimental, knowledge-based system that assists in the judgmental aspects of budget planning and financial resource management. Problem solving in this domain requires many kinds of knowledge from many sources. We represent domain knowledge uniformly as constraints and view resource management and planning problems as constraint satisfaction and resolution tasks. We sketch here the financial resources management problem, our approach, and early results, concentrating on constraint representation and management issues in the system.
