The ECS program includes an inquiry-based college-preparatory curriculum that introduces students to the creative nature of computing, technology as a tool for solving problems, and the relevance and impact of CS. This workshop will provide participants the opportunity to engage in activities from the ECS curriculum that highlight the six computational practices common to ECS and CS Principles. We will explicitly model the inquiry-based design of the activities and facilitate discussions that highlight how inquiry manifests itself in the computational practices. This workshop is appropriate for K-12 educators and college/university faculty who are interested in deepening their understanding of how teacher pedagogy is critical to broadening participation in computing. Laptop Optional.
