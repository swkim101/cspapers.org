Across much of the field of Al, a gap exists between research scientists seeking to extend the frontiers of knowledge and practitioners in Industry and government seeking to solve important applied problems using Al technology. Addressing this gap, this panel will discuss significant applications of the 1990's whose development will depend on advances in Al beyond the horizon of today's knowledge. The goal of the panel is to present for consideration and discussion significant technical problems whose solution will enable the development of dramatic applications with the potential for high social or economic impact.
