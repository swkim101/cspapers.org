Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR)---techniques to dynamically overlay digital information in the user's view through mobile devices---has the potential to uniquely contribute to people learning about objects or environments in situ. Using interactive expert videos and side-by-side MAR views on a location sensitive tablet, our prototype system, GreenHat MAR, simulates how experts go about making observations in the field, and encourages students to actively observe their environment to learn about biodiversity and sustainability issues in their natural environment. We present our design process, the GreenHat MAR prototype, and results from our preliminary evaluation study.
