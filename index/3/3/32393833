In practical Prolog applications, difficult and opaque uses of control primitives are often unavoidable. To relieve these difficulties, a preliminary set of high-level control predicates has been developed. Two technical goals were achieved. The first was to cast control facilities found desirable in conventional languages into a logic-programming form. The second was to provide convenient high-level structures for all the sorts of algorithmic routines a Prolog clause might sensibly perform. The availability of such structures should make deliberately algorithmic use of Prolog respectable and may help win Prolog wider use.
