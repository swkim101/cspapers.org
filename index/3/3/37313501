Demands for more effective information management, coupled with advances in computer hardware and software technology, have resulted in the emergence of the information utility concept, whereby database computers specialized for information storage and processing can serve as information nodes. Such database computers can provide high-performance and high-reliability information management services to both conventional and "personal" computers. 
 
In this paper key advances in information technology, both hardware and software, are described. Special attention is devoted to three approaches to the development of more specialized information processing architectures: (1) firmware enhancement, (2) "intelligent" controllers, and (3) minicomputer "back-end" processors. These approaches are preliminary to the development of truly specialized high-performance, high-reliability database machine architectures. The DBC and INFOPLEX functional modular database machine architectures are presented as examples.
