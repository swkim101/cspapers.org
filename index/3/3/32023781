As the field of data processing grows, it becomes increasingly important for the computer professional to keep abreast of new developments. Because one of the most significant of these new developments is structured programming, we decided to use knowledge of structured programming concepts as a measure of how up-to-date a programmer is. Thus, we undertook to answer the following questions:
 1. How up-to-date are today's programmers, i.e. how aware are they of some of these new concepts?
 2. From what sources did they learn about these concepts? How much did these sources influence their work?
 3. What are some of the other factors which influence up-to-dateness?
 To find the answers, we prepared a survey of sixteen questions. The first fifteen questions were designed to provide us with a background profile of our polled population. The last question dealt specifically with structured programming, presenting a list of programming concepts and potential sources for learning about these concepts. The respondent was questioned about his familiarity with a particular concept, his source of learning about the concept, and the degree to which his work was influenced by this source. The responses were input to a program written in CROSSTABS, a commercially available utility package, to produce tables of cross-tabulations and frequency percentages. We analyzed these tables and our conclusions drawn from this analysis follow.
