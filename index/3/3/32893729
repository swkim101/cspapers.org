This paper introduces a leg design method aiming at speed maximization for quadruped robots with two-segment compliant legs, in trotting and bounding. The proposed method is an effort to address the leg design challenge in a holistic way, exploiting the coupling between gait parameters, leg design parameters and hardware constraints, while remaining control scheme independent. Optimal body trajectories and footfalls are derived using a simplified centroidal dynamics model, whereas joint trajectories and torques are computed by a more complex dynamic model, incorporating actuation parameters and constraints. The method is applied using real robot parameters to yield an optimal leg design, validated through a realistic trotting simulation experiment. In this experiment, the robot achieves accelerating motion from stance towards the maximum speed predicted by the method.
