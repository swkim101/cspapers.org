This paper describes a fully automated process of address book enrichment by means of information extraction in e-mail signature blocks. The main issues we tackle are signature block detection, named entites tagging, mapping with a specific person, standardizing the details and auto-updating of the address book. We adopted a symbolic approach for NLP modules. We describe how the process was designed to handle multiple-type of errors (human or computer-driven) while aiming at 100% precision rate. Last, we tackle the question of automatic updating confronted to users rights over their own data.
