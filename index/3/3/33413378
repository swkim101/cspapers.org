Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetic eye disease which causes damage to the blood vessels in the retina. Most of studies are applied in MATLAB environment that is designed for research only. For solving these problems above, a new prototype of Android based DR grading system will be introduced in this study. The proposed design architecture emphasizes and enhances the computing power usage efficiency of DR grading system in ARM platform running Android. The novelty lies in the idea of creating MATLAB-like environment using IT++ library to ease the conversion from MATLAB source code to C++. Another contribution is applying the multithreading technique to image processing module to decrease the execution time in Android OS. This approach have improved the system in terms of execution time with 14.5 seconds.
