We develop a new technique for 3D object modeling by integrating the 2D vision methodology with a laser based high precision measurement technology. After calibrating the spatial relationship between the CCD camera and the range laser, the system captures an image of the inspected object, extracts 2D image features such as edges, curves and corners, and provides intelligent guidance for the range laser sensor to obtain 3D measurements on these features. The available range data are analysed and synthesized to construct a CAD model of the object.
