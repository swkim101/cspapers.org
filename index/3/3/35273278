Clusters of commodity Linux systems are being used to scale-up image resolution and data set capacity to meet the needs for visualizing the vast amounts of data generated by high-performance computing systems. As with computational problems, visualization problems can be distributed so that multiple processors and graphics cards can work on them in parallel. Clusters ranging from a handful of nodes to well over a hundred are being used to drive multi-tile displays with tens of millions of pixels and to apply many nodes to each tile of a display. The decreasing cost and increasing performance of graphics cards and commodity networking make this an attractive approach with much promise.This BOF will have some short presentations describing approaches to scalable visualization being used by applications and software packages, followed by an open discussion of these topics.
