In this paper the method of consolution for clause form theorem proving is introduced. Consolution is based on the connection method. Th is means that in a consolution derivation the paths through the input formula are checked for complementarity. In contrast to resolution this checking can be done in a systematic way as in any connection calculus. It is proved that the consolution calculus presented here is sound and complete and that it can simulate resolu t ion step by step and is a generalization of resolution. It combines the advantages of the connection method such as the directedness of search w i th the advantages of resolution such as the possibility of the use of lemmata.
