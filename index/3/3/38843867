This symposium showcases the latest work from Japan and Southeast Asia on interactive systems and user interfaces that address under-explored problems and demonstrate unique approaches. In addition to circulating ideas and sharing a vision of future research in human-computer interaction, this symposium aims to foster social networks among young researchers and students and create a fresh research community.
