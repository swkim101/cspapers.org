We motivate a new line of image forensics, and propose a novel approach to photographer identification, a rarely explored authorship attribution problem. A preliminary proof-of-concept study shows the feasibility of our method. Our contribution is a forensic method for photographer de-anonymisation, and the method also imposes a novel privacy threat.
