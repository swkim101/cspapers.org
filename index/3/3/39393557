With the need to develop two new Software Engineering courses, SE I and SE II, for 1995, we considered that this would provide an ideal opportunity for a project (CourseWeb) in incorporating the use of a web site and hyperlinked documents (webpages) into our software engineering educational environment. Our goal was to create and publish an electronic set of course materials that encompassed more than just the lecture notes, textbook references and assignments. The environment that we use is a localised World Wide Web (WWW) site running an http (hypertext transfer protocol) daemon, serving pages to local clients running either Netscape or Mosaic browsers. Materials are mainly ASCII text, formatted with HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) tags. This paper describes our experiences in analysing the requirements for the CourseWeb project, in designing both the necessary infrastructure and the webpages themselves and the implementation of our final design. In the light of our experiences we also discuss some future directions for our project and some of the constraints that the available technology places on our design.
