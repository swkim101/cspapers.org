Instead of local nearest neighbor patch matching used in most existing internal SR methods, ESR employs epitomic patch matching that features robustness to noise, and both local and non-local patch matching. Extensive objective and subjective evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of ESR on various images.
