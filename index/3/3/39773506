Reports on a new national course designed to be an Advanced Placement course in Computer Science have been reported in [13]. This course has been designed from first principles to be taught nationwide at both the secondary and post-secondary levels. As part of this joint NSF/College Board project, 11 high schools are partnered with 10 colleges to teach the course, be part of a national initiative to test assessment items, and to help validate the curriculum framework that is the basis for the course and project.
