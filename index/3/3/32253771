Failures in production are a de facto rule for distributed software systems. In particular, modern distributed systems are composed of heterogeneous building blocks contributed by third parties and guaranteeing the end-to-end resilience is becoming a major challenge. Even though each of these software components can embed fault tolerance or dependability protocols, it remains difficult to assess their effectiveness upon the occurrences of unexpected failures. As part of this work, we propose a new generation of fault injection framework that can be deployed in production to challenge Blockchain-based distributed systems. This paper therefore reports on the state of the art in this area and potential opportunities for novel contributions towards building anti-fragile distributed systems on the Blockchain.
