Micro-mobility has many protocols, which adopt hierarchical architectures and paging from cellular networks and employ them in mobile IP. In this paper the authors address three main issues of existing micro-mobility protocols e.g., inefficient registration for the first time when mobile node enters foreign network area, communication bottleneck, and single point of failure. As existing Micro-mobility protocols are centralized because all the communication and registration through a single point e.g., global foreign agent. The authors proposed a new micro-mobility scheme which is an efficient, scalable and fault tolerant solution. The authors distributed that workload on FAs. They include additional features behave differently in diverse situations
