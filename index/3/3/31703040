The rise of Maker communities and open-source electronic prototyping platforms have made electronic circuit projects increasingly popular around the world. Although there are software tools that support the debugging and sharing of circuits, they require users to manually create the virtual circuits in software, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. We present CircuitSense, a system that automatically recognizes the wires and electronic components placed on breadboards. It uses a combination of passive sensing and active probing to detect and generate the corresponding circuit representation in software in real-time. CircuitSense bridges the gap between the physical and virtual representations of circuits. It enables users to interactively construct and experiment with physical circuits while gaining the benefits of using software tools. It also dramatically simplifies the sharing of circuit designs with online communities.
