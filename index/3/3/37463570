The ubiquity of mobile camera devices has been triggering an outcry of privacy concerns, whereas privacy protection still relies on the compliance of the photographer or camera hardware, which can hardly be guaranteed in practice. In this demo, we introduce LiShield, which automatically protects a physical scene against photographing, by illuminating it with smart LEDs flickering in a specialized waveform. We use a model-driven approach to optimize the waveform, so as to ensure protection against the (uncontrollable) cameras and potential image-processing based attacks. We have also designed mechanisms to unblock authorized cameras and enable graceful degradation under strong ambient light interference. This demo will show our prototype implementation, with simple on-site experiments that demonstrate how LiShield effectively destroys unauthorized photo capturing.
