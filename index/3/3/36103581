This paper addresses aspects of the feasibility of extending high performance brushless DC motor torque-speed capabilities by using multi-speed transmissions. Initial dynamic modeling and simulation results show that a transmission-based electrical servo actuator can have similar load capabilities with widely used hydraulic actuator in robot manipulators.
