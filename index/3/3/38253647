Assessment of ABET/CAC accredited programs can become a burdensome task that generates lots of paper, takes hours of faculty time, and produces little in the way of meaningful results that can be used as a basis for improving a program. The result is often lack of active participation by faculty and an increase in negative attitudes that tend to further erode assessment effectiveness. This is a serious problem at small schools that cannot afford the luxury of full time assessment personnel and are totally dependent on faculty for the assessment process. This paper presents five assessment methods that require a minimum of paper-work and faculty time but are nevertheless effective in presenting an accurate assessment of a program's objectives. The five methods presented are: 1. the Assessment Day concept; 2. personal class assessment; 3. sampled student work; 4. faculty interview groups; and 5. student focus groups.
