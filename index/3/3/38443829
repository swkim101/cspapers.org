The Blackbox project collects data from opted-in users of the BlueJ beginners' Java IDE. This data includes source code edits, compilation results, and use of various tools within BlueJ (such as the debugger). Interested researchers may sign up either to use the global database, and/or to use Blackbox as a data collection platform for their local BlueJ-based studies. Blackbox has been running for over two years and contains the results of over 100 million compilation events from over 1 million users. Over 50 researchers have already signed up for access to the data. This session will allow interested researchers, whether already using Blackbox or not, to come together and talk to each other and to the Blackbox team about using the Blackbox data in their research. The Blackbox team will provide a brief overview of the project, and the research opportunities it provides, followed by lots of time for questions and discussion.
