The primary goal for a specification language is to provide a means for accurate, succinct description of processing algorithms and their related data structures: in effect, a description with a minimum of extraneous detail. In general, progress toward this goal has been achieved by moving from assembly languages with their requirement for detailed knowledge of data processing structures to notations, such as the mathematical formalisms, which avoid the use of specific computer representations. In this sense, FORTRAN, ALGOL, and PL/I are early specification languages, while APL, the Vienna Definition Language, and SETL are more advanced forms.
