In this paper, the dynamic performance of position-based visual servoing methods in the Cartesian and image spaces are investigated. Two major classifications of the position-based method are analyzed. For motion control defined in the stationary desired end-effector frame, the shortest straight line Cartesian trajectory can be achieved, but the corresponding image trajectories are not controlled and may leave the camera field of view. For motion control defined in the moving current end-effector frame, the straight line Cartesian trajectory is not guaranteed, however, the im- age trajectories can be indirectly controlled in this method to move approximately along straight lines when the commanded orientation is small. Simulation results are given to compare the Cartesian and image trajectories of various implementations of the position-based method with those of the image-based and 2 1/2-D methods.
