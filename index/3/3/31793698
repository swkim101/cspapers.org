In the first talk, Dr. Lebow will discuss DoD plans for providing secure voice for three disparate communities within DoD: 1. Narrowband Tactical (datarate: up to 2.4 KB), 2. Wideband Tactical (16 and 32 KB) and 3. Long-haul Strategic (DCS-based, up to 9.6 KB). Dr. Lebow will compare advantages and deficiencies of the three systems and will discuss the evolution of these systems into a two-rate architecture in the 1990's.,

 The final paper, by Dr. Bartee, is a discussion of protocol standardization requirements for the interconnection of present and future DoD data networks such ARPANET, AUTODIN I & II, and other DoD data handling networks such as Intelligence community's COINS II (Community On-line Intelligence Network System), and IDHSC II (Intelligence Data Handling System Communications). Bartee will conclude his talk with a discussion of database management problems in computer networks. The discussion will emphasize the data acquisition problem.
