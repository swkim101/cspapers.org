In this paper, we propose the concept of robotic task design for task directed robotics in order to develop a framework for achieving versatile robotic task execution system. This system consists of the following subsystems: 1) a robotic task design system; 2) a teaching (programming) system; and 3) a task execution system. These have equal importance in accomplishing the task intended by the user with the robot system instead of over emphasizing the task execution system which has been the main research area of robotics in terms of motion control. Based on this proposed concept, a robotic task execution controller called NOAC is designed. The main concept in the structure of NOAC is to separate function (1) which is commonly needed by every task in the task class (task class function) and function (2) which is a task-oriented function. They are to be parallel processed on NOAC system. This separation simplifies software development. A deburring task is designed based on the nature of the burr and implemented onto the NOAC system with the above concept. This system is shown to be simple and expandable.<<ETX>>
