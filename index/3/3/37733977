The EDA Industry and Venture Capital seem to have grown together over the last three decades. While the vast majority of EDA start ups have been venture capital funded, there are other alternatives to creating and growing a new business. By better understanding the relationship between start ups and venture capitalists, the enterpreneur is better equipped to make decisions which effect the ability to start a company in the first place, its ownership structure, its definition of success, its ability to achieve success and its overall rate of growth.

Given the present structure of the EDA industry, is there room for EDA start ups to achieve significant growth so they can be attractive investment opportunities, and 2.

In this session, VC's and successful founders/CEO's discuss their points of view based on past experience and their vision of the future.
