Given a weighted undirected graph G(V, E) and a subset R of V, we present an online algori thm for finding a Steiner tree on R tha t s imultaneously approximates the shortest path tree and the min imum weight Steiner tree. The cost of the tree we construct is within an O(log [RI) factor of the optimal cost, and the path length from the root to any terminal is at most O(1) t imes the shortest path length. The algorithm needs to perform at most one reroute for each node in the tree. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n We are given a weighted undirected graph G = (V, E) with a cost function c : E --+ ~, and a source node s. Receivers R = {Vl,V2,...,vk} arrive in an online fashion. Our goal is to maintain a Steiner tree T on RU {s}. Let c(T) = ~eeTC(e) be the total cost of T. Let dG(s,v) be the shortest pa th distance from s to v with respect to the cost function c, and let dT(s,v) be the pa th length from s to v in T. Also, for a receiver v, let StretchT(v) = dT(s,v)/dG(s, v). Now, define StretchT = maxvcR StretchT(v) and let CostRat ioT = c(T)/c(T*), where T* is the minimum weight Steiner tree on the vertices in R U {s}. An algori thm for this problem is (p, q)competit ive if StretchT < p and CostRatioT ~ q for the tree T p roduced by the algorithm.

Email: kamesh~cs, s t a ~ fo rd . e du problem that s imultaneously guarantees a small value for p and q. This problem arises in the context of dynamic multicast routing for delay sensitive applications where it is important to construct, in an online fashion, multicast trees with small total cost as well as small delays from the source to each receiver. See [2] for a detailed motivation. Our main result is the DSG (Delay Sensitive Greedy) Algorithm, which is (O(1), O(log IRI))competit ive. We need to do a small amount of rerouting each node in R gets rerouted at most once (A node is said to be rerouted when its parent pointer in the tree changes). It is worth noting that the shortest pa th tree is (1, I R I 1)-competitive, whereas the greedy strategy is (IRI 1, log IRI)-competit ive [3]. Further, wi thout reroutes, no algori thm can achieve be t te r than ~( log IRI)-competitive ratio for the second quant i ty [3]. The offiine version of this problem was s tudied by [1, 4]. We believe tha t the simplicity and the ease of implementat ion of DSG are its main strengths, as it is difficult to retrofit existing networks such as the Internet to accommodate complicated routing protocols. 2 T h e D S G (Delay Sensitive Greedy) A l g o r i t h m Let T be the tree constructed so far for receiver set R. We root the tree T at s, and assume all edges in T are directed towards the root. For any node v in tree T, let parent(v) denote the parent of v in T.
