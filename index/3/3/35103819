The Web contains vast amounts of HTML tables. Most of these tables are used for layout purposes, but a small subset of the tables is relational, meaning that they contain structured data describing a set of entities [2]. As these relational Web tables cover a very wide range of different topics, there is a growing body of research investigating the utility of Web table data for completing cross-domain knowledge bases [6], for extending arbitrary tables with additional attributes [7, 4], as well as for translating data values [5]. The existing research shows the potentials of Web tables. However, comparing the performance of the different systems is difficult as up till now each system is evaluated using a different corpus of Web tables and as most of the corpora are owned by large search engine companies and are thus not accessible to the public. In this poster, we present a large public corpus of Web tables which contains over 233 million tables and has been extracted from the July 2015 version of the CommonCrawl. By publishing the corpus as well as all tools that we used to extract it from the crawled data, we intend to provide a common ground for evaluating Web table systems. The main difference of the corpus compared to an earlier corpus that we extracted from the 2012 version of the CommonCrawl as well as the corpus extracted by Eberius et al. [3] from the 2014 version of the CommonCrawl is that the current corpus contains a richer set of metadata for each table. This metadata includes table-specific information such as table orientation, table caption, header row, and key column, but also context information such as the text before and after the table, the title of the HTML page, as well as timestamp information that was found before and after the table. The context information can be useful for recovering the semantics of a table [7]. The timestamp information is crucial for fusing time-depended data, such as alternative population numbers for a city [8].
