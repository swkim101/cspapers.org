This paper focuses on robust adaptive sliding mode control for a power system with time varying delay in the states with mismatched uncertainties and external disturbances. The uncertainties and disturbances are assumed to be norm-bounded but the bound is not necessarily known. The power system is a seventh order synchronous machine infinite bus system. The adaptive controller is designed to guarantee the state variables to converge into a residual set of the origin by estimating the unknown upper bound of the uncertainties and disturbances. Detailed simulation results clearly are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the control strategy.
