The arrival of ubiquitous computing environment, while providing services in many devices and users has been a lot of movement. In this environment, users want "seamless" service. A lot of mobility in ubiquitous computing environment to provide "seamless" service to users, many studies was used to substitute the service. An existing service substitution does not considerate the characteristic of ubiquitous computing environment. Furthermore, it does not support ordering substitution list for fit of the user requirements. This paper proposed the approach for the operation recommendation considering the ubiquitous computing environment. This approach is based a Semantic Web technique. In addition, we investigated ubiquitous in the environment quality of services (QoS) that it has been used to research. We identified QoS of the existing ubiquitous computing environment that affects the user based on the substitution of alternative operations execution time, execution cost, availability and location. In addition, we defined new QoS that is suitable in substitution and based on QoS list identified.
