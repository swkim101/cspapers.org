n order to overcome the limitations of traditional monolithic firewalls, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has implemented a Secure Collaboration Zone (SCZ) to provide high performance connectivity using a host-based security model where the network firewall is replaced by a centrally managed host-based firewall on each system in the SCZ. This approach, coupled with intrusion detection capabilities and tight system configuration management controls, eliminates the firewall bottleneck and creates a layered security model that enables secure data transfer at rates which scale to today's system and network capabilities. For SC06 we will be using Polygraph, a high-performance implementation of a statistical and physical model-based feature matching algorithm, to run identification calculations on spectral data resulting from tandem mass-spectrometry experiments. In particular, a compute cluster at SC06 will run Polygraph to access a preprocessed information archive of spectral data located at PNNL in the SCZ.
