Wireless embedded Internet (WEI) is a new research trend nowadays, with a focus on developing new wireless embedded end devices, network protocols, optimized models of intelligent context management, as well as the integration of WEI applications to the Internet. However, current approaches are still lack of a dimension, i.e., cost-effective WEI solution at a reasonable price for developing market like Vietnam. In this paper, new low-power wifi sensor motes are designed and implemented for using in the smart building applications at the reasonable cost. The energy consumption measured on the developed low-power wifi sensor mote shows that its lifetime is improved much longer, with the use of our proposed low-power hardware architecture and low-power software technique.
