The Visual Interaction Design Special Interest Area (VIDSIA) meeting provides a place for visual design practitioners, educators, and supporters to gather informally and share ideas and work. VIDSIA was formed at CHI 92 and has met at CHI since. We created VISUAL-L, a popular electronic distibution list for those interested in visual aspects of interaction design, and the VIDSIA column of the SIGCHI Bulletin.
