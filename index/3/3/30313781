We present the use of plastic fuse beads as a prototyping approach in physical computing and as a material in electronic circuitry. We introduce the properties of this craft and material, and describe a collaborative experiment with a group of teenagers, in which this approach was tested as a participatory project. This open-format workshop demonstrated the feasibility, affordances and youth-friendliness of using this craft and material for simple DIY physical computing projects and for the tangible learning of basic principles of interaction design.
