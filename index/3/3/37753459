The development of future search engine technology is no longer limited to free text. Rather, the aim is to build core indexing services that focus on extreme performance and scalability for retrieval and analysis across structured and unstructured data sources alike. In addition, binary query evaluation is being replaced with advanced frameworks that provide both fuzzy matching and ranking schemes, to separate value from noise. As another trend, analytical applications are being enabled by the computation of contextual concept relationships across billions of documents/records on-the-fly.Based on these developments in search engine technology, a set of new information retrieval infrastructure patterns are appearing:1. the mirroring of DB content into a search engine in order to improve query capacity and user experience,2. the use of search engine technology as the default access pattern to both structured and unstructured data in applications such as CRM and storage and document management, and3. a paradigm shift is predicted in business intelligence.The presentation will review key trends from search engine development and relate these to concrete user scenarios.
