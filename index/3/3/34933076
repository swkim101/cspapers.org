An overview of a logic program interpreter written in Lisp is presented. The interpreter is a Horn clause-based theorem prover augmented by Lisp functions attached to some predicate names. Its application to natural language processing is discussed. The theory of operation is explained, including the high level organization of the PROVE function and an efficient version of unification. The paper concludes with comments on the overall efficiency of the interpreter.
