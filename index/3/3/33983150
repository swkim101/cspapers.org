An essential part of any interactive programming development system is an incremental parser capable of error recovery. This paper presents a general incremental parser for LR(1) grammars allowing several/any form of modifications in the input program. The parser is suplemented with error recovery routines using an error automaton. Errors can be corrected automatically by recovery routines, or by the user at his request.
