Computing Curricula 1991 calls for breadth in the undergraduate computer science curriculum. Many authors have recommended structured laboratories for computer science. This is a report on a project to combine these goals in an introductory sequence of courses. We present two courses in which all programming is done in a laboratory environment, leaving the lectures for more conceptual material that ranges over a broad selection of topics. Student reactions to this project have been very positiveâ€”we have increased the number of students continuing with the major, as well as student satisfaction with the courses themselves.
