Bootstrap teaches students to create their own videogames using a programming approach that directly reinforces state and national algebra standards. Used in classrooms across the country, Bootstrap is proving successful at transferring skills from programming to algebra word problems in 8th and 9th grade students. Due to the algebraic foundation for both content and pedagogy, math teachers with limited programming experience find the curriculum highly approachable; many offer it as a module within an algebra course. Bootstrap is a prefix to a higher-level computer science curriculum called Program by Design that emphasizes data-driven design and testing (with or without the videogame focus). In this BOF, current and potential users of these curricula will discuss the connections between introductory computing education and algebra education, share best practices for teaching and moving beyond these curricula, and generate ideas for future evolution of both curricula. The two facilitators will adapt the format as needed to support the interests of the participants.
