The authors propose a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) that uses a VSS to form the linguistic rules. First, they prove that there exists a sliding line in the FLC. Secondly, a Lyapunov function is selected to show that the fuzzy controller system (FCS) is globally asymptotical stable. The proposed control method is applied to stabilize a cart-pole system. The effect of adjusting the scaling factor, varying the rules of the VSS, and modifying the membership function on the FCS are also addressed.
