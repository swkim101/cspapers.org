There are currently two means of communicating across public packet switched data networks: via virtual circuits and via datagrams. Virtual circuits are well suited to stream type applications such as time sharing, while datagrams are generally regarded as being appropriate for short inquiry - response transactions. This paper proposes that there is also a wide class of transaction oriented applications which are best served using virtual circuits.
 The requirements of a specific transaction application are outlined followed by a description of the virtual circuit based implementation that was designed to support a corresponding service on the Datapac network. For this class of application, virtual circuits efficiently provide a central computer facility with tight control over a distributed population of terminals.
