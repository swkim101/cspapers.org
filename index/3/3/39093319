The ever increasing use of computers for school administrative and instructional programs poses a continuing challenge for educators. School personnel and students need an intelligent understanding of the computer and its advantages in order to best utilize its potential. Recognition of this need has brought about various agencies and commercial groups offering courses that give the administrators and teachers this knowledge.

Besides their specialized training, it often works out to be the least costly in the long run.
