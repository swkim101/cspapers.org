The papers in this volume were presented at the Eighteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, held January 7--9, 2007, in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Symposium was jointly sponsored by the SIAM Activity Group on Discrete Mathematics and by SIGACT, the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory. 
 
In response to the call for papers, a total of 382 papers were submitted, one of which was subsequently withdrawn. The program committee accepted 139 submissions, which included four pairs of papers that were subsequently merged. This resulted in 137 papers in the conference proceedings and 135 presentations at the conference. The decisions were based on originality, technical contribution, and relevance. In addition to the program committee members, over 400 members of the community contributed to the selection process by reviewing papers; many of these researchers reviewed a number of different submissions. The submissions were not formally refereed, although every attempt was made to verify the main claims. It is expected that most of the accepted papers will appear in more complete form in scientific journals.
