This paper presents newly developed mobile microrobots with high precision in the sub-micrometer range, while offering a macroscopic workspace. The main parts of the mobile microrobots, a mobile platform and a manipulator unit, are explained. The mobile platform's actuation is based on the slip-stick-principle. Because of new arrangement of the components promising characteristics have been investigated. Especially of interest is the low voltage needed to drive the actuators, because it makes possible the integration of batteries. A manipulation unit with actuators based on a combination of electric motors and piezoelectric actuators is described as well. Finally the future effort and outlook is discussed.
