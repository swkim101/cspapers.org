Telecommunication industry is predicted to have an important role in total energy consumption of industry area. Thus, the increasing energy cost in operational costs demands effective tools to identify energy efficiency indicators (EEIs) and predict the evolution of energy efficiency performance (EEP). The energy efficiency (EE) improvement of any segment in the communication networks (CNs) can help lower energy cost and protect environment of network operators. The spread of users in overall areas results in the increasing number of base stations (BSs), which are main components of CN. As a supporting function of management tools, predicting EEP is a requested function of energy management system (EMS) by network operators. In this context, this paper presents the demand of EMS for integrating prediction of EEP deterioration. In addition, the energy efficiency function block to modelling the BSs with numerous of indicators is proposed. By prognostic approaches (PA) and suitable aggregation methods, network operators can handle their situations. An EEP degradation demonstration has been conducted by using PA and EE model of BS. An additional benefit can also be seen as increasing reliability of energy backup units in various scenarios of power source disturbance. Finally, the requirement of sensor networks in acquiring technical data of BS deterioration states is mentioned.
