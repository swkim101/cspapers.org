Our work in this extended abstract focuses on a feature crucial to Virtual Reality (VR): gaze tracking, i.e., determining user’s eye fixation direction. Not only does gaze tracking allow users to interact with the content just by glances, it also can greatly improve user’s visual experience, reduce VR sickness, and save systems (display) energy. The energy saving can be achieved by foveated rendering [7, 10], which progressively reduces image details outside the eye fixation region. Such energy saving is particularly beneficial for mobile VR headsets, where the display is powered by a smartphone.
