Abstract : In the Hough transform, a feature in an input space I votes for parameters in a transform space P with which it is compatible. It it also uses negative votes to vote against parameters with which it is incompatible, background bias and inherent noise in P can be reduced and peaks sharpened. In the usual Hough transform implementation, an array is used to accumulate votes, raising the problem that the space requirement increases exponentially with the number of parameters. Accumulation in a fixed-size content-addressable cache(or hash table) may provide a solution. (Author)
