The proliferation of optical networking throughout the global research networking community has created the foundation for the creation of Dynamic Ethernet Lightpath provisioning between regional and global research networks. Ciena will provide an overview of dynamic provisioning of Ethernet lightpaths (GbE, 10GbE), fueled by technologies that represent the latest advancements in optical networking. Key capabilities such as OTU/OTN, multi-protocol support, 10GbE optical switching, and automated control plane technologies will be explained in context of providing automated provisioning and management for regional and global research networking requirements. Network deployments will be highlighted that feature these technologies in support of research networks.
