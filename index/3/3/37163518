This paper describes a technique for automatically designing and producing artwork for multi-layer laminates used in digital computer construction at Litton Industries. This technique consists of a number of computer programs which are a sub-system of a general design automation effort called IDAS (Integrated Design Automation System). The laminate design programs deal with the problems of artwork production and inter-connection of electronic components frequently experienced in computer system design and construction.
 The laminate programs have been under developments for the past 18 months and are all operational. During the 18 months of development numerous experiments comparing the automatic laminate design method to the manual method have been performed. This paper discusses the results of these experiments along with some details of the programs and their operation. Before a discussion of automatic laminate design can proceed some preliminary definitions are required.
