over the last decades, the areas of database systems and data visualization developed almost independently. While research on databases deals with the efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of data, research on data visualization deals with the effective portrayal of data with the goal towards insight about the data,. There is, however, a great need for combining the benefits from both areas. (In one side, visualization systems deal with very large amounts of data and therefore Ilt?~~ database systems as hac.kencis; and on the other side, there are very large databases containing a treasure of undiscovered information which could be unveiled using visualization technology. lJntil recently, however, there has not been much interaction between the two areas. With the exceptions of visualizing database sche.mas for database design (cf. semantic data models such as the ER-IIIodel) and visual querying of the database (cf. visual query systems such as QBE), visualization has been only of minor importance in the database area, especially the aspect of visualizing the data itself. Since size and clirnensionality of databases is growing rapidly, the visualization of the data itself however is becoming increasingly important.
