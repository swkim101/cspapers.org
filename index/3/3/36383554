In mobile ad hoc networks, transmission is a challenging problem, because the wireless channel is characterized by limited bandwidth, multi-hop connectivity, and dynamically varying network topology. Compared with unipath routing protocols, multipath routing is an attractive alternative for route resilience and throughput, however, existing multipath routing protocols have problems, such as no concern for expecting traffic and load balancing. In this paper, we present a multipath routing protocol based on DSR, firstly, which uses multi-probing and round-Robin mechanisms (MRDSR) for updating alternate multiple path. Then we propose the multipath DSR with load-aware and load-balancing approaches, which monitor the current and future congestion status of active routes and distribute the data on each path evenly. The solutions had been implemented and evaluated with NS2. In using proposed concept, superior performance in comparison with DSR and MRDSR, can be achieved.
