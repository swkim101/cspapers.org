The paper concerns visuo-inertial filtering and estimation based on homography and angular velocity measurements, i.e. data obtained from a mono-camera/IMU sensor. We extend recently developed nonlinear filters on the special linear group of homographies to the estimation of scene parameters and velocity of the sensor. A validation of the proposed solution and a comparative evaluation based on real data is presented.
