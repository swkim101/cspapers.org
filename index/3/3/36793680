This paper presents a new parameterisation approach for the graph-based SLAM problem utilising unit dual-quaternion. The rigid-body transformation typically consists of the robot position and rotation, and due to the Lie-group nature of the rotation, a homogeneous transformation matrix (HTM) has been widely used in pose-graph optimizations. In this paper, we investigate the use of unit dual-quaternion (UDQ) for SLAM problem, providing a unified representation of the robot poses with computational and storage benefits. Although UDQ has been widely used in kinematics and navigation (known as Michel Chaslesâ€™ theorem or Skrew motion), it has not been well utilised in the graph SLAM optimisation. In this work, we re-parameterise the graph SLAM problem using UDQs, focusing on the optimisation performance and the sensitivity to poor initial estimates. Experimental results on public synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational complexity, whilst retaining the similar accuracies compared to the HTM-based one. With the poor initial estimates, it is also shown that the rotation vector-based perturbation is more stable than the quaternion-based in recovering the error dual-quaternion.
