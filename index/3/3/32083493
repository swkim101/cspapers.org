Specifically, leveraging user-contributed data from cross-domain social media, the idea is to perform multi-modal learning for a given photo, aiming to present peopleâ€™s description or comments, geographical information, and events of interest, closely related to the photo. These information then can be used for various purposes, such as being a real-time guide for the tourists to improve the quality of tourism. As a result, this research investigates modern challenges of image annotation, image retrieval, and cross-media mining, followed by presenting promising ways to conquer the challenges.
