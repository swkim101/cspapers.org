Interpreting the results of performance analysis and generate alternative design to build component system is a main challenge in the software performance domain. Improving one quality feature can weaken another; quality features cannot be individually improved. Furthermore, the span of design space hinders the selection of the appropriate design alternative. In the context of Component-based system, the paper discusses the assessment of performance characteristics of software architecture, auto-generation of the new candidates, as well as relevant concepts to optimization problems such as design space and degree of freedoms. We introduce an approach supports the alternative design decision using PSO as a promised meta-heuristic technique. Performance cannot be assisted in isolation of other non-functional properties; we outline the process of evaluating the software performance considering the probability of its conflicting with reliability. Therefore, the proposed approach enables the architect to reason on the auto-provided architectures and chooses the optimal solution. Consequently, better architecture design could be obtained and time to develop the system will be reduced. Finally, a simple case study is illustrated in the paper as an example to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.
