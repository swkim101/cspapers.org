MDA provides an open, vendor-neutral approach to the challenge of business and technology change. Based firmly upon OMGâ€™s established standards, MDA aims to separate business or application logic from underlying platform technology. Platform-independent applications built using MDA and associated standards can be realized on a range of open and proprietary platforms, including CORBA, J2EE, .NET, and Web Services or other Web-based platforms. Fullyspecified platform-independent models (including behavior) can enable intellectual property to move away from technology-specific code, helping to insulate business applications from technology evolution, and further enable interoperability. In addition, business applications, freed from technology specifics, will be more able to evolve at the different pace of business evolution.
