Issues discussed in previous papers are re examined and new aspects of using Pascal ar e explored . In particular, Lecarme (2) and Grie s (3) have presented material showing the requirements for a programming language in an introductory programming course . Lecarme examined the following questions : whom to teach, why , how and which language? He analysed the mai n reasons for the choice of a language : economical, pedagogical and political and after comparisons between languages, he chose Pascal . In a second paper (4), he studied the relation ships with structured programming . For Gries , three aspects should be included in an introductory programming course : problem solving , descriptions of algorithms and verification o f these algorithms ; his choice was PL/1 .
