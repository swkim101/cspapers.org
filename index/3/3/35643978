We propose a new multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) based scheme for audio signal watermarking. By using this scheme, small size images can be embedded as a digital watermark for audio signal. Our proposed scheme automatically selects the intensity of watermark for embedding in audio signal during MOGA evolution cycle. The main benefit of this scheme is that it finds optimal tradeoffs between two contradicting properties i.e. robustness and imperceptibility. The watermark embedded show more robustness against common occurring attacks.
