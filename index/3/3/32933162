Different from the IP-based routers, Named Data Networking routers forward packets by content names, which consist of characters and have variable and unbounded length. This kind of complex name constitution plus the huge-sized name routing table makes wire speed name lookup an extremely challenging task. Greedy name lookup mechanism is proposed to speed up name lookup by dynamically adjusting the search path against the changes of the prefix table. Meanwhile, we elaborate a string-oriented perfect hash table to reduce memory consumption which stores the signature of the key in the entry instead of the key itself. Extensive experimental results on a commodity PC server with 3 million name prefix entries demonstrate that greedy name lookup mechanism achieves 57.14 million searches per second using only 72.95 MB memory.
