K12 CS education is expanding at an unprecedented scale throughout communities nationwide. Throughout research on CS education and education more broadly, the disconnect between research and practice, or research and implementation, is well documented. To enhance its relevance to and for practice, research should build on existing knowledge and account for local contexts, and the engagement of research and researchers should be coordinated to facilitate their connection to practice. In offering this session at SIGCSE, we likely will move away from "local contexts" to larger issues; research priorities, however, often are shaped by external, funding priorities and RFPs. The knowledge forum format will allow the community to engage in a process of setting its own agenda which can later be aligned to funding opportunities. Prioritizing topics and questions for research and implementation in ways that are rooted in the needs of instruction and that draw on collective expertise is increasingly important. The proposed special session addresses this issue through a systematic and tested prioritization format. Specific objectives of the proposed session will be to: (1) introduce the topic prioritization format to participants; (2) demonstrate how the format can be used to identify and to organize research priorities among a group of experts; (3) implement the format with members of the SIGSCE community; (4) plant the seeds for potential collaborations; (5) and solicit feedback from the SIGSCE community on how to improve the format.
