A comparison is made of systems the author has designed for a main frame and a microcomputer. The limitations and advantages of microcomputers for data base management are discussed. Example applications are presented. Advantages of the set theoretic approach are discussed. Applications most suitable for the relational model are described, and contrasted on both the large and small system.The systems discussed include a commercial system Condor Series 20 DBMS which runs on CP/M, on Z-80 microcomputers and MICRO, a system which runs on MTS on large virtual memory main frame computers. CP/M is the operating system of Digital Research. MTS is the operating system at the University of Michigan.
