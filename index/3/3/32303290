Since its publication twenty years ago, "Peopleware Productive Projects and Teams" (Dorset House, 1987), by Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister, has enlightened software professionals and non-professionals alike. Peopleware introduced among other topics - "team gel", design patterns, the "Furniture Police" - to the software engineering community and suggested that "sociology matters more than technology or even money." This unique session with the pioneers of our profession is an opportunity to learn, reflect, and share experiences -- looking forward to the future. This compendium consists of brief bios and first person retrospectives on "Peopleware".
