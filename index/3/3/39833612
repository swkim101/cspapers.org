Although orchestration represents a key component of Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs), few adopters of service orientation actually use it. In spite of available standards and products, aggressive marketing has forced many users to jump on the SOA bandwagon ill-prepared to use the technology. We are developing a pattern language to bring the state of the practice closer to the state of the art. These patterns will help SOA designers and product evaluators make informed decisions when building SOAs or evaluating orchestration middleware.
