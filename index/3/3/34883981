In this paper, two printed monopole antennas are proposed which use a composite right/left-handed (CRLH) metamaterilal transmission line in oder to achieve WLAN band. The physical size and operation frequency of antenna are determined by the CRLH metamaterial's unit-cell. The both fabicated prototypes have compact radiation elements, and exhibits good agreement beetwen the measured and simulated parameters.
