Broadband fixed wireless access (BFWA) systems are a fixed point-to-multipoint (P-MP) broadband cellular networking solution operating at millimeter-wave frequencies. The P-MP BFWA systems are suitable for the high-density deployment of high capacity wireless access infrastructures but there are still difficulties in the operations of wireless systems such as the degradation of wireless link quality in rainy wide areas, routing issues in mesh topology, etc. In this study, we propose node architectures and a shortest path routing scheme for wireless chordal ring network (CRN) that is suitable for BFWA systems. The CRN topology has the primary advantages of using the chordal links to shorten transferring paths of data packets and providing increased reliability compared to the original ring network due to its multiple routing paths. A BFWA system with the CRN topology is an effective approach to overcome the limitations of P-MP BFWA systems. To guarantee data packets in CRN routing with a shortest path and avoiding out-of-sequence packet delivery problem, we devise a new routing algorithm for the CRN. With mathematical proof, our new routing scheme outperforms other routing schemes for networks based on the ring topology.
