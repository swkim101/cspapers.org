In this paper, a novel de-blocking algorithm is proposed, using block wiener filtering, shift and weighted average operations. The dissipation of block boundary occur by a combination of the shift and average operations. However, visually annoying artifacts are noticeable around the edge region in highly compressed images. In the proposed method, the wiener attenuation coefficients are given based on the estimated error in a block unit. The DCT encoded images have a large margin of error from one block to another. Hence texture information losses are prevented while smoothening effect is applied to the region around the edge. In examples, the proposed algorithm shows better performance than the previous one.
