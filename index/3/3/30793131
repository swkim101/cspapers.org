This paper is concerned with the problem of developing a family of locking protocols which employ both SHARED and EXCLUSIVE locks and which ensure the consistency of database systems that are accessed concurrently by a number of asynchronously running transactions. The protocols in the family are not two-phase. They are applicable to database systems which are hierarchically organized as well as database systems which are modeled by directed acyclic graphs. A comparison with other previously published protocols is also presented.
