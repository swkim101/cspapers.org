The Canadian Design Research Network-(CDRN) is setting up a prototype Design Grid. The Design Grid has several goals including:1)enabling national and international design reviews in areas ranging from urban planning, landscape architecture, architect and aerospace engineering. 2)allowing interactive discussions including video/audio streaming and shared powerpoints between highly distributed individuals and institutions where individuals may only have access to very modest technical resources. 3)allowing the public to access visualizations of buildings and see the impact of those buildings. 4)allow the sharing of design courses across universities.
