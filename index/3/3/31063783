We have built web interfaces to a number of Natural Language Processing technologies. These interfaces allow students to experiment with different inputs and view corresponding output and inner workings of the systems. When possible, the interfaces also enable the student to modify the knowledge bases of the systems and view the resulting change in behavior. Such interfaces are important because they allow students without computer science background to learn by doing. Web interfaces also sidestep issues of platform dependency in software packages, available computer lab times, etc. We discuss our basic approach and lessons learned.
