1. The General Situatio n When one is accustomed to steadily rising chart s year after year, it becomes very difficult to accept a downturn . The decreases are first rationalized as a temporary abnormality, then viewed a s an extended lull, and only reluctantly acknowledged as a truly long-term depression. Such ha s been the case with college admissions. From 1870 to 1950, college enrollment double d about every fifteen years. In the decade of th e 50's, it doubled again, and in the decade of th e 60's it nearly tripled [DOE]. One important reason for these dramatic increases was, of course, the pool of available students . In the 1940's the number of pre-schooler s rose 53 .4%, and in the 1950's about 25% [BOY]. However, it appears that this trend has reversed . In the 1960's, the number of pre-schooler s dropped 15 .5% [BOY]. It is expected that the number of high school graduates will peak around 1978 , drop 15% by 1984, and drop 22% by 1990 [DOE]. Table I shows the historical and projecte d number of high school students for 1964 throug h 1984, It also shows the estimated number of thes e students in each of the specified SAT verbal scoring intervals [DOE]. Hence the applicant pool for college recruitment is shrinking. However, this is not the onl y factor-the percentage of students from this poo l who actually attend college is also shrinking. Hardest hit by this latter factor will b e state universities which have traditionally attracted large numbers of students in the 250-45 0 range of Table I. A growing portion of thes e students are no longer interested in post hig h school education, at least on a full-time basis , because their reasons for attendance have bee n eliminated-the draft, peer pressure, the promis e of a better job, etc. In addition, more of thos e who do seek additional education are selectin g vocational/technical programs or associate degre e programs .
