This workshop introduces participants to the pedagogy and practice of using Free/Open Source Software development practices into their curriculum, and then guides them through deployment of a turnkey courseware framework to be used for their own courses. The framework supports automatic blog checking, automatically generated student profile pages, Gravatar integration for profile pictures, Travis-CI continuous Integration tests, and repository changes reported via Github webhooks to IRC. Participants will learn how to use Github in the Classroom, the basics of Flask, a python web framework, and how to deploy their courseware to Red Hat's OpenShift Cloud, a free Platform-as-a-Service to host courseware and/or other web sites.
