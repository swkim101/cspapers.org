There are a number of database systems available free of charge for the research community, with complete access to the source code. Some of these systems result from completed research projects, others have been developed outside the research community. How can the database community best take advantage of these publically available systems? The most widely used open-source database is MySQL. Their objective is to become the 'best and most used database in the world'. Can they do it without the database research community?
