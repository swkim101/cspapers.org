This paper deals with the development of a field furrow mobile robot which moves so as to maintain the environment in which vegetables are planted. The robot is provided with two clinometers for detecting the inclination angle of the robot, linear actuator which controls the robot posture on the pitch axis, two DC servo motors which effects turning motion. Control of the inclination angle of the pitch axis is effected, then new active sensing of the inclination angle on the roll axis for turning motion is performed, and movement with turning motion is effected in a row spacing using roll angle data. Availability of the robot system was proved by experiments.<<ETX>>
