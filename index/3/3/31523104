Assumptions about the relationship between the source and target domains should lead to tractable solutions on the one hand, and be realistic on the other hand. Here we propose a generative domain adaptation model that allows for modelling different assumptions about this relationship, among which is a newly introduced assumption that replaces covariate shift with a possibly more realistic assumption without losing tractability due to the efficient variational inference procedure developed. In addition to the ability to model less restrictive relationships between source and target, modelling can be performed without any target labeled data (unsupervised domain adaptation). We also provide a Rademacher complexity bound of the proposed algorithm. We evaluate the model on the Amazon reviews and the CVC pedestrian detection datasets.
