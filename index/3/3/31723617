The topic of this paper is a Partitioned Ring Structure Processor (PRSP) which is a data structure system that has been designed for small computers. PRSP provides techniques of creating and traversing very complex network type structures as necessitated by an application. The created structures are highly efficient in storage space and can be efficiently partitioned into secondary storage such that very large data structures (106 bytes) can be handled in a small stand alone computer. PRSP has been implemented and utilized as the most important part of the GOLD31 System designed and developed at RCA Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. The GOLD System has been used for over two years in the design of circuit artwork.
 In Part II of this paper I will discuss the hardware and software environment in which PRSP operates, and some of the problems encountered and solved in the design of PRSP. In Part III the detailed operation of PRSP is given. In Part IV partitioning and segment management techniques are described.
