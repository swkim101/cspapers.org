We designed and constructed a 24x24-port optical circuit switch (OCS) prototype with a programming time of 68.5 μs, a switching time of 2.8 μs, and a receiver electronics initialization time of 8.7 μs [1]. We demonstrate the operation of this prototype switch in a data center testbed under various workloads.
