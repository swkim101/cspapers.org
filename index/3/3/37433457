The low numbers of female students in computing and computer science courses is still of concern. Initiatives to bring together women in technology to share their experiences, is an important aspect of increasing the numbers of female students entering the computing profession. A very successful celebration of Women in Technology was recently held in Australasia based on a tried and true US model. This model was adapted for the region and added to, other countries will be able to take the model and use it in their own environments and cultures. This poster will describe the recent event and give suggestions and models for other regions and countries to be able to replicate it.
