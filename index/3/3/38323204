An optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) add-drop multiplexing using Raman amplification-based adiabatic soliton compressor (RA-ASC) and a fiber-based cross phase modulation (XPM) switch is experimentally demonstrated. A 10 Gb/s clock train is compressed by the RA-ASC and then acts as a control signal in the fiber-based XPM switch to perform the OTDM add-drop multiplexing. A 10 Gb/s data channel is dropped from a 40 Gb/s OTDM data signal and a new 10 Gb/s data channel is added in its place. Below 2-dB power penalties are obtained for all demultiplexed channels after OTDM add-drop multiplexing.
