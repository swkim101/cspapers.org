The Storage Utilization Factor (SUF) of Block Split Data Structuring (BSDS) scheme (e.g.IBM's VSAM) is analyzed in this paper. We analyze SUF in both cases of light input after arbitrary initial loading and heavy inputvolume at initial loading. It is shown that expected SUF for sufficiently large number of inputs and large size of data block is ln2= 69.31% and SUF distribution is fairly sharp. SUF fluctuation in light input after given initial loading increases as block size is increased. We also present a variation of BSDS to improve SUF by 13%. Some experimental results indicate that the analysis of expected SUF is sufficiently adequate.
