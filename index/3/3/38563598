This paper describes the development of a model for delivering the traditional fiist course in computer science that takes advantage of the unique characteristics of eaeh component of the learning environment. These components are reading, classes, tutorials, labs, and assignments. Students take responsibility for learning the language by reading the textbook in preparation for the class. The class presents models for problem solving using the language the students have learned, emphasizing the careful reasoning required to move from a statement of a problem through the analysis, the design and the implementation of a solution in a programming language. The tutorial reinforces these models by giving students opportunities to apply the models themselves. Structured labs train students to use the computing environment to reinforce their learning of language features and to implement, debug and test solutions to problems. Together these components build studentsâ€™ confidence and ability to tackle the assignments and project.
