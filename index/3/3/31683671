In this paper, interference cancellation (IC) schemes are compared with the inverse channel detection scheme for space-time block coded multi-rate multi-user systems. One of the interference cancellation scheme is based on QR decomposition interference suppression combined with Interference cancellation and the other scheme is based on minimum mean square estimation (MMSE) combined with interference cancellation. Computationally inverse channel detection scheme is much better than the interference cancellation scheme but its performance is poorer than the other two.
