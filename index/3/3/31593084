Nowadays, distracted driving is becoming a very dangerous epidemic on the roadways. A lot of activities may lead to distracted driving, such as texting, making phone calls, using GPS or road maps, eating, using in-car entertainment systems, etc. As the number of smartphones is rapidly growing year by year, using smartphone is by far the most dangerous and alarming driver distraction. In this paper, we design an app on iPhone for reducing the smartphone-related distracted driving, which can run in the background and can lock the smartphone screen with no passwords required when it detects that the user is driving. After the user finishes driving, the lock will be removed immediately. We also describe a DTM algorithm to detect the transportation mode and give the performance analysis of our system. The results show that our system can save more energy than other related applications.
