We propose an intelligent environment for "co-experience communication" consisting of stationary and wearable sensors, and communication robots. The environment captures many events collaboratively from multiple viewpoints using a combination of stationary sensors that track people's behaviors and interactions, and wearable sensors that observe the viewpoints and areas of interest of individual persons. Humanoid communication robots also play a role as assistants to help visitors pay attention to significant events. First of all, the basic framework of the environment is described. Next, our developing exhibition room is introduced as an example of an intelligent environment.
