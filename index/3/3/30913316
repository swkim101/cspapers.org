Not for the faint of heart, this book transcends specific software design paradigms by examining what makes a good design good. The discussion is mostly at a level of abstraction beyond specific design techniques, but when Coplien descends from lofty abstract concepts to give specific examples, he does so in the context of the processes we go through every day in applying various C++ design paradigms. His abstract concepts are so general that they could apply to the process of analyzing any type of problem â€“ not just software problems. In short, this book makes you think about how you think; it analyzes how you analyze.
