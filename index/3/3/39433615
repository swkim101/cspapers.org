As the conversation for broadening participation in computer science expands, the need for diversity among computing students becomes clearer. Yet, each year at SIGCSE, there are very few opportunities for people working with, or interested in working with students of color at the K-12 AND university levels to share experiences and collaborate on how to best support our students. This BOF will provide a platform for not only discussing effective, culturally relevant approaches to teaching computer science to students of color, but also addressing questions and concerns of people serving this demographic.
