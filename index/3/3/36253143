This panel will discuss the enrollment boom, as well as potential effective practice strategies to respond to the increasing demand for computing education. Does the current enrollment "boom" represent the "third bubble", or is it here to stay? Is there a difference in what's happening at universities that offer Ph.D. degrees or what's happening at 4-year universities and colleges? What 'best practice' strategies exist (if any) to handle the demand? And, importantly, will this "boom" have a positive or negative effect on underrepresented students' Join us for a lively discussion on the recent student interest in computing education at our universities and colleges.
