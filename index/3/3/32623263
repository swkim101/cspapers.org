This project attempted to find a solution to the problem of declining yield rates at colleges and universities around the nation. Yield rate, the rate at which accepted students decide to enroll at a given school, is important to a school for academic, economic and logistical reasons. As such, this project aimed to raise the yield rate at Davidson College by applying machine learning techniques to applicant data in order to predict the yield decisions of the applicants. Using these techniques, a model was created that predicted applicants' yield decisions with 86% accuracy. With these predictions, Davidson College can have a better understanding of their yield and can consequently make more informed, tactical admissions decisions, thus raising their yield rate.
