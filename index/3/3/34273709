This panel aims to explore the dynamic networking effects of the Web. Today, linkages on the Web are augmented with dynamic connectivities based on various monetization strategies: e.g. ads and sponsored links. Such linkages change the dynamics of user click/flow on the Web. The key focus of this panel is to debate whether/how such dynamic effects on the Web can be modeled and best exploited. How can we derive cooperative placement strategies that are optimal from a customer perspective? As the World Wide Web becomes more dynamic with fluid link placements guided by different factors, optimizing link placement in a cooperative fashion across the Web will be an integral and crucial component.
