Traditionally beginning undergraduate computer science students are taught a high level programming language. Since the early 1970's Pascal has become the de facto standard introductory programming language. With the creation of Ada, its standardization, and the availability of validated compilers, there is considerable discussion concerning the introduction of Ada into the computer science curriculum. This paper discusses the approach taken by the Computer Science Department at Harvey Mudd College.
