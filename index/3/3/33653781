Wireless control systems are gaining a lot of attention, due to its easy deployment comparing to wired control systems recently. Real-time wireless networks have been proposed to give preference to high-priority tasks and keep timeliness of packet delivery. In control systems, however, network delay influences significantly the control system performance, whose applications have dynamic characteristics. Motivated by the observation, we propose a dynamic network scheduling solution to minimize the error in control applications in a system, by considering the application behavior and changing its priority based on dynamic conditions. We plan to conduct a case study based on a nuclear power plant to analyze the interaction between cross-layer real-time network scheduling and control.
