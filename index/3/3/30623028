This note announces a new algorithm for equitable colorings and a new bound on the equitable chromatic number of graphs. An equitable coloring of a graph is a proper vertex coloring such that the sizes of any two color classes differ by at most 1. The equitable chromatic number of a graph G, denoted Xeq(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to equitably color the graph G. The famous result of Hajnal and Szemer~di [2] from 1970 says that for every graph G and any k _> A(G) + 1, G has an equitable coloring with k colors. This implies the upper bound Xeq(G) ~ A(G) + 1. This deep result provides a sharp bound, but the bound can be improved for some important classes of graphs. Consider the case of trees. For the star, Sn, that is an n-vertex tree in which one vertex is adjacent to the rest of the vertices, Xeq(Sn) = 1 + V(n 1)/2]. This turns out to be the worst case for trees because for every tree T, Xeq(T) _~ 1 + [A(T)/2] [4]. This tight upper bound for trees is in contrast with the result by Bollob~ and Guy [1] that "most" trees can be equitably 3-colored. Specifically, their result implies that any nvertex forest F with A(F) < n/3 can be equitably 3colored. These results illustrate the two main themes in the area of equitable coloring: the first is to find tight upper bounds on the equitable chromatic number for a class of graphs, usually as a function of A. The second is to find constant upper bounds on the equitable chromatic number for a class of graphs from which all "star-like" graphs have been removed.
