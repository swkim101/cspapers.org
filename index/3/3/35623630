This paper deals with hierarchical design, component re-use and more generally structured design methodology at the behavioral level. This methodology has two main concepts: hierarchy and regularity. Hierarchies are used for decomposing a complex design into more manageable sub-parts. Regularity is aimed at maximizing the re-use of already designed components and sub-systems. The methodology is illustrated using AMICAL, an architectural synthesis tool, and a design example, namely a Proportional Integral Derivative. The design is decomposed hierarchically Into a top controller using a set of sub-systems. AMICAL is then used for the design of one sub-system which is used In a second step as a functional unit, by AMICAL, for the synthesis of the full design.
