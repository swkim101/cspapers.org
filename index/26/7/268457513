The landscape of computer science (CS) education in the United States has experienced a significant shift, with a notable emphasis on moving beyond introducing CS courses at the high school level to providing K-8 CS learning experiences. Early exposure to CS fosters interest and the foundational knowledge and skills needed for students to pursue future CS opportunities. However, the concept of equitable access to CS education at the elementary and middle school levels is still relatively nascent. To address the issue, we provide an in-depth analysis of our collaborative endeavor with a local public school district to develop and iteratively refine a professional development experience to enable teachers to implement a CS-integrated lesson in their classrooms. In this paper, we expand on the structure of the educator training experience and highlight strategies for curating and adapting CS lessons. In addition, we critically reflect on the strengths and challenges of this program based on teacher surveys and focus groups, as well as propose potential iterations for the program.
