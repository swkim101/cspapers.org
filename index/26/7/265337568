A differential-fed dual-polarized dual-band stacked microstrip patch antenna is proposed for 2.45-GHz and 3.5-GHz applications. The design is composed of a double differential-fed slotted patch for dual-polarization and unidirectional radiation pattern. The antenna utilizes $TM_{10}$ mode for the low-band operation. Four rectangular slots are introduced to create an extra resonance in the upper-band while a stacked patch with four vias is implemented to further broaden the high-band operating bandwidth. With the combination of differential-fed scheme and symmetric structure, the proposed antenna yields very high isolation of $\geq$ 40 dB. The fabricated prototype with a profile of 0.09$\lambda_{2.45-GHz}$ obtains a measured 10-dB return loss bandwidth of 2. 42-2.52 GHz and 3. 21-4.12GHz. The simulated results also show highly symmetrical patterns and low cross-polarization in all operating frequencies for both differential-port operation.
