Recently, many deep stereo matching methods have begun to focus on cross-domain performance, achieving impressive achievements. However, these methods did not deal with the significant volatility of generalization performance among different training epochs. Inspired by masked representation learning and multi-task learning, this paper designs a simple and effective masked representation for domain generalized stereo matching. First, we feed the masked left and complete right images as input into the models. Then, we add a lightweight and simple decoder following the feature extraction module to recover the original left image. Finally, we train the models with two tasks (stereo matching and image reconstruction) as a pseudo-multi-task learning framework, promoting models to learn structure information and to improve generalization performance. We implement our method on two well-known architectures (CFNet and LacGwcNet) to demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental results on multi-datasets show that: (1) our method can be easily plugged into the current various stereo matching models to improve generalization performance; (2) our method can reduce the significant volatility of generalization performance among different training epochs; (3) we find that the current methods prefer to choose the best results among different training epochs as generalization performance, but it is impossible to select the best performance by ground truth in practice.
