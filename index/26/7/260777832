In this artifact we provide the means to reproduce our main results. Specifically, we show that our framework, UNCON - TAINED , finds container confusion, both dynamically while fuzzing and statically with dataflow tracking. We have evaluated our artifact on an Ubuntu 22.04.1 (stock Linux kernel v.5.15) with 16 cores @2.3GHz (AMD EPYC 7643) using a total of 16 QEMU-KVM virtual machines with 4GB RAM.
