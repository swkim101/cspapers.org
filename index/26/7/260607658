Nowadays, many universities and colleges are offering courses at distance. In this paper, I present my experiences and results with the offering of a CS1 course to students in our campus. The course was offered during the last academic year 97-98. I describe our motivation for the on-line course and my observations about student performance. Also, I compare the results of the on-line class with the traditional one.
