Wrapping is the process of navigating a data source, semi-automatically extracting data and transforming it into a form suitable for data processing applications. There are currently a number of established products on the market for wrapping data from web pages. One such approach is Lixto [1], a product of research performed at our institute.Our work is concerned with extending the wrapping functionality of Lixto to PDF documents. As the PDF format is relatively unstructured, this is a challenging task. We have developed a method to segment the page into blocks, which are represented as nodes in a relational graph. This paper describes our current research in the use of relational matching techniques on this graph to locate wrapping instances.
