Facial emotion recognition (FER) constitutes an essential social skill for both humans and machines to interact with others. To this end, computer interfaces serve as valuable tools for training individuals to improve FER abilities, while also serving as tools for gathering labels to train FER machine learning datasets. However, existing tools have limitations on the scope and methods of training non-clinical populations and also on collecting labels for machines. In this study, we introduce Find the Bot!, an integrated game that effectively engages the general population to support not only human FER learning on spontaneous expressions but also the collection of reliable judgment-based labels. We incorporated design guidelines from gamification, education, and crowdsourcing literature to engage and motivate players. Our evaluation (N=59) shows that the game encourages players to learn emotional social norms on perceived facial expressions with a high agreement rate, facilitating effective FER learning and reliable label collection all while enjoying gameplay.
