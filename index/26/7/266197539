Over the past decades, point cloud-based place recognition has garnered significant attention. This research paper presents a pioneering approach, denoted as the Multi-scale Point Octree Encoding Network (MPOE-Net), designed to acquire a discriminative global descriptor for efficient retrieval of places. The key element of the MPOE-Net is the point octree encoding module, which adeptly captures local information for each point by considering its nearest and farthest neighbors. Further enhancing local relationships, a multi-transformer network is introduced, utilizing a novel grouped offset-attention mechanism. To amalgamate the multi-scale attention maps into a comprehensive global descriptor, a multi-NetVLAD layer is incorporated. Through rigorous experimentation across diverse benchmark datasets, our proposed method unequivocally outperforms existing techniques in the realm of point cloud-based place recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.
