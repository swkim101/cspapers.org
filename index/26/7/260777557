We propose a security protection principle for confidential computing, Proof of Being Forgotten (PoBF). It has two requirements: N O L EAKAGE and N O R ESIDUE . These properties are formalized and proven under an abstract model for Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in Coq. On the other hand, we implement a prototype PoBF-Compliant Framework (PoCF), which provides a framework to conduct Confidential Computing as a Service (CCaaS). These prototypes come with a verifier that can prove some properties specified in PoBF are satisfied. Besides, PoCF can support various real-world applications and the protections introduced in PoCF incur minor runtime performance overhead.
