Link prediction has traditionally been studied in the context of simple graphs, although real-world networks are inherently complex as they are often comprised of multiple interconnected components, or layers. Predicting links in such network systems, or multilayer networks, require to consider both the internal structure of a target layer as well as the structure of the other layers in a network, in addition to layer-specific node-attributes when available. This problem poses several challenges, even for graph neural network based approaches despite their successful and wide application to a variety of graph learning problems. In this work, we aim to fill a lack of multilayer graph representation learning methods designed for link prediction. Our proposal is a novel neural-network-based learning framework for link prediction on (attributed) multilayer networks, whose key idea is to combine (i) pairwise similarities of multilayer node embeddings learned by a graph neural network model, and (ii) structural features learned from both within-layer and across-layer link information based on overlapping multilayer neighborhoods. Extensive experimental results have shown that our framework consistently outperforms both single-layer and multilayer methods for link prediction on popular real-world multilayer networks, with an average percentage increase in AUC up to 38%.
