Many real-world NLP applications face the challenge of training an entity disambiguation model for a specific domain with a small labeling budget. In this setting there is often access to a large unlabeled pool of documents. It is then natural to ask the question: which samples should be selected for annotation? In this paper we propose a solution that combines feature diversity with low rank correction. Our sampling strategy is formulated in the context of bilinear tensor models. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the amount of labeled data necessary to achieve a given performance.
