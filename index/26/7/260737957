As with any machine learning problem with limited data, effective ofﬂine RL algorithms require careful regularization to avoid overﬁtting. One class of methods, known as one-step RL, perform just one step of policy improvement. These meth-ods, which include advantage-weighted regression and conditional behavioral cloning, are thus simple and stable, but can have limited asymptotic performance. A second class of methods, known as critic regularization, perform many steps of policy improvement with a regularized objective. These methods typically require more compute but have appealing lower-bound guarantees. In this paper, we draw a connection between these methods: applying a multi-step critic regularization method with a regularization coefﬁcient of 1 yields the same policy as one-step RL. While our theoretical results require assumptions (e.g., deterministic dynamics), our experiments nevertheless show that our analysis makes accurate, testable predictions about practical ofﬂine RL methods (CQL and one-step RL) with commonly-used hyperparameters.
