gence continues to be one of the most exciting and active areas of computer science. This is reflected in an increase in submissions to the 22nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence over the previous edition. We received 1,325 papers in total, and accepted 400 papers (30.2 percent), 227 for oral and poster presentation (17.1 percent) and 173 for just poster presentation (13.1 percent). No distinction is made in these proceedings between papers presented at the conference orally or by poster.
