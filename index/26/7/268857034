In the realm of video object segmentation (VOS), the challenge of operating under low-light conditions persists, resulting in notably degraded image quality and compromised accuracy when comparing query and memory frames for similarity computation. Event cameras, characterized by their high dynamic range and ability to capture motion information of objects, offer promise in enhancing object visibility and aiding VOS methods under such low-light conditions. This paper introduces a pioneering framework tai-lored for low-light VOS, leveraging event camera data to elevate segmentation accuracy. Our approach hinges on two pivotal components: the Adaptive Cross-Modal Fusion (ACMF) module, aimed at extracting pertinent features while fusing image and event modalities to mitigate noise interference, and the Event-Guided Memory Matching (EGMM) module, designed to rectify the issue of in-accurate matching prevalent in low-light settings. Additionally, we present the creation of a synthetic LLE-DAVIS dataset and the curation of a real-world LLE-vas dataset, encompassing frames and events. Experimental evaluations corroborate the efficacy of our method across both datasets, affirming its effectiveness in low-light scenarios.
