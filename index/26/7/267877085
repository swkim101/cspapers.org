The objective of the joint ISWC/UbiComp Adjunct session is to provide a venue to allow the community to showcase emerging research and ideas which are promising but not yet mature enough to be submitted to the regular tracks of either ISWC or UbiComp. 
 
We think it is a very important element of this joint conference to provide the space and time to reflect on novel ideas. The Poster, Demo and Doctoral School format and the associated sessions allow exactly this. It permits researchers to engage in a discussion with their peers on early results, bounce back ideas, and contribute to the scientific dialogue in our community.
