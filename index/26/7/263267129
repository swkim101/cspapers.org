The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma shows that any n points in Euclidean space (with distances measured by thel2 norm) may be mapped down to O((log n)/ε) dimensions such that no pairwise distance is distorted by more than a (1 + ε) factor. Determining whether such dimension reduction is po sible in l1 has been an intriguing open question. Charikar and Sahai [7] recently showed lower bounds for dimension reduction inl1 that can be achieved by linear projections, and positive res ults for shortest path metrics of restricted graph families. However the ques tion of general dimension reduction in l1 was still open. For example, it was not known whether it is possib le to reduce the number of dimensions to O(log n) with 1 + ε distortion. We show strong lower bounds for general dimension reduction in l1. We give an explicit family of n points inl1 such that any embedding with distortion δ requiresn ) dimensions. This proves that there is no analog of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma f or l1; in fact embedding with any constant distortion requiresn dimensions. Further, embedding the points into l1 with 1+ε distortion requires n 1 2 −O(ε log( 1 ε )) dimensions. Our proof establishes this lower bound for shor test path metrics of seriesparallel graphs. We make extensive use of linear programmin g and duality in devising our bounds. We expect that the tools and techniques we develop will be usefu l for future investigations of embeddings into l1.
