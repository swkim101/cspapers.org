Zeroing neural networks (ZNNs) are powerful alternatives to solving quadratic programming (QP) for constrained control of parallel and serial robots. A recent study showed that a ZNN solver designed based on a perturbed Fischer-Burmeister function (pFB-ZNN) achieves more satisfactory performance than other ZNN solvers. The pFB-ZNN solver suffers from manual tuning of an extra hyper-parameter and may encounter residual error peaks. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a new Mangasarian-Solodov function-based ZNN (MS-ZNN) solver. The MS-ZNN solver has no extra hyper-parameter to be tuned and it can eliminate residual error peaks appeared in the pFB-ZNN solver, ensuring a higher solution accuracy. Mathematically, this paper details the design and convergence analysis of the MS-ZNN solver, demonstrating its convergence in the sense of Lyapunov. Numerical studies are comparatively performed, verifying the effectiveness and superiority of the MS-ZNN solver. The MS-ZNN solver is then successfully applied to kinematic control of a parallel robot and a serial robot under joint constraints. Both simulative and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MS-ZNN solver is applicable to constrained control of parallel and serial robots with joint-limit avoidance achieved.
