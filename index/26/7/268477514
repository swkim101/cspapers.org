Students are using generative artificial intelligence (genAI), organizations are embracing AI and machine learning, tools are emerging almost daily, and addressing these evolving technologies can be overwhelming. Rather than choosing to ignore genAI, instructors of computer science (CS) can find ways to teach with and guide students in the use of genAI in their courses. Teaching about genAI can be incorporated with instruction about effective and appropriate uses of the ever-growing tools. This special session brings together three experienced CS educators who integrate genAI in their work with high school students, college students, and in-service teachers. The session environment allows for participant involvement in three model activities that showcase genAI tools with learner-focused practices. Participants will be provided supporting teaching resources for each guided activity and encouraged to discuss with peers and presenters.
