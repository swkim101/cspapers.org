Building on momentum in the computing community for more undergraduate experiential and interdisciplinary learning opportunities, our report details a novel approach to teaching data science in an archaeological field school study abroad context. Our structure included group and individual learning, and the flexible course design facilitated students' pursuit of their own interests via projects developed in partnership with domain experts. We provide reflections on the effectiveness of carrying out this flexible course design in the context of an interdisciplinary, domain-centered, data science course. This report also provides our reflections on the effectiveness of centering archaeological problems and using computational tools to teach responsible data practices emphasizing data collection, classification, analysis, visualization, translation, and storytelling. Finally, we explore some of the learning outcomes students demonstrated in their projects and their course reflections.
