In this paper, we propose a method to automatically and efficiently tune high-dimensional vectors of controller parameters. The proposed method first learns a mapping from the high-dimensional controller parameter space to a lower dimensional space using a machine learning-based algorithm. This mapping is then utilized in an actor-critic framework using Bayesian optimization (BO). The proposed approach is applicable to complex systems (such as quadruped robots). In addition, the proposed approach also enables efficient generalization to different control tasks while also reducing the number of evaluations required while tuning the controller parameters. We evaluate our method on a legged locomotion application. We show the efficacy of the algorithm in tuning the high-dimensional controller parameters and also reducing the number of evaluations required for the tuning. Moreover, it is shown that the method is successful in generalizing to new tasks and is also transferable to other robot dynamics.
