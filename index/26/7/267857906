The development of molecular scale devices and circuits can be greatly enhanced by simulation of their components and by formulating design principles that will make molecular circuitry smaller, more efficient and more reliable. Recent advances in theoretical methods and HPC have enabled the predictions of novel materials and phenomena entirely from computation, without any experimental input. Several examples will be described briefly, including superstrong nanomaterials, novel molecular sensors and nanodevices. Petascale computers will allow for simulations of entire device structures from first principles, thereby not only dramatically enhancing ultrascale computing of the future, but also greatly reducing its power requirements. However, taking full advantage of petascale will not only require scaling to 100,000 cores, but also favorable scaling of the computational algorithms. We will show that key parts of our algorithms scale linearly with the number of atoms, making them ideal candidates for a petascale implementation.
