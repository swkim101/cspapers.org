Flapping-fin unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) propulsion systems enable high maneuverability for tasks ranging from station-keeping to surveillance but are often constrained by their limited computational power and battery capacity. Previous research has demonstrated that time-series neural network models can accurately predict the thrust and power of certain fin kinematics based on the specified gait coupled with the fin configuration, but can not fit an inverse neural network that takes a thrust request and tunes the kinematics by weighting thrust generation, smooth movement transitions, and power attributes. We study various combinations of the three weights and fin materials to create different ‘modes’ of movement for a multi-objective UUV, based on controller intent using an inverse neural network. Finally, we implement and validate an enhanced power-aware inverse model by benchmarking on the Raspberry Pi Model 4B system and testing through generated simulated movements.
