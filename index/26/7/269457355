In this paper, we reveal the two sides of data augmentation: enhancements in closed-set recognition correlate with a significant decrease in open-set recognition. Through empirical investigation, we find that multi-sample-based augmentations would contribute to reducing feature discrimination, thereby diminishing the open-set criteria. Although knowledge distillation could impair the feature via imitation, the mixed feature with ambiguous semantics hinders the distillation. To this end, we propose an asymmetric distillation framework by feeding teacher model extra raw data to enlarge the benefit of teacher. Moreover, a joint mutual information loss and a selective relabel strategy are utilized to alleviate the influence of hard mixed samples. Our method successfully mitigates the decline in open-set and outperforms SOTAs by 2%~3% AUROC on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset and experiments on large-scale dataset ImageNet-21K demonstrate the generalization of our method.
