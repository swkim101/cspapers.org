While password stufﬁng attacks (that exploit the direct pass-word reuse behavior) have gained considerable attention, only a few studies have examined password tweaking attacks, where an attacker exploits users’ indirect reuse behaviors (with edit operations like insertion, deletion, and substitution). For the ﬁrst time , we model the password tweaking attack as a multi-class classiﬁcation problem for characterizing users’ password edit/modiﬁcation processes, and propose a generative model coupled with the multi-step decision-making mechanism, called P ASS 2 EDIT , to accurately characterize users’ password reuse/modiﬁcation behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of P ASS 2 EDIT through extensive experiments, which consist of 12 practical attack scenarios and employ 4.8 billion real-world passwords. The experimental results show that P ASS 2 EDIT and its variant signiﬁcantly improve over the prior art. More speciﬁcally, when the victim’s password at site A (namely pw A ) is known, within 100 guesses, the cracking success rate of P ASS 2 EDIT in guessing her password at site B ( pw B (cid:2) = pw A ) is 24.2% (for common users) and 11.7% (for security-savvy users), respectively, which is 18.2%-33.0% higher than its foremost counter-parts. Our results highlight that password tweaking is a much more damaging threat to password security than expected.
