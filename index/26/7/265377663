 Managing system changes is one of the most challenging and important tasks facing today’s engineering designers. Beyond the numerous design revisions that occur during the design process, accelerating rates of technological and societal growth strain existing systems, and those that will produce the greatest value are the systems that can be adapted and evolved. The complexity of modern engineered systems requires that significant resources be invested so that changes can be managed throughout the design and redesign processes. Implementing even relatively small modifications can require extensive design effort in systems with many coupled and entangled relationships. There is significant evidence that design margins can effectively limit change propagation, yet the relationship between margins and change propagation has not been fully studied. In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying how margins create flexibility at a component level in an engineered system. We define a decision variable’s (DV) Complex Flexibility Range (CFR) as the extent by which a variable can change while maintaining feasibility with respect to all requirements and constraints. A high-powered rocket’s recovery system is modeled, and the CFRs are calculated for multiple DVs. We use the quantified CFRs to demonstrate how margins create flexibility at the level of DVs and how changing a decision variable impacts margins and DV flexibility. Several applications for CFRs are identified, including 1) predicting change propagation, 2) identifying change absorbers, 3) communicating changes in margin/flexibility, and 4) negotiating DV selection and requirements definition. This work provides a foundation for further study of how margins can be allocated and for studying how systems can be efficiently, and effectively, adapted and evolved.
