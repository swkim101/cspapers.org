Many-core processors offer massively parallel computation power representing a good opportunity for the design of highly integrated avionics systems. Such designs must face several challenges among which 1) temporal isolation must be ensured between applications and 2) bounds of WCET must be computed for real-time safety critical applications. In order to partially address those issues, we propose an appropriate execution model, that restricts the applications behaviours, which has been implemented on the Kalray MPPA-256. We tested the correctness of the approach through a series of benchmarks and the implementation of a case study.
