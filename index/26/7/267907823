Software engineering environments have a history of about two decades. Early environments provided support for small fragments of the software process (usually focusing on programming-in-the small). Then there was a trend towards support for more complete software processes (from early phases like requirements analysis and design down to testing and configuration management). Ten years ago the notion of process-centered software engineering environments initiated a new field in software engineering: software process research. The key idea was to use a model of a software process as input parameter for a software engineering environment. The environment was supposed to “behave” in accordance to the process model. Some aspects of this vision became true, others turned out to be of little practicability.
