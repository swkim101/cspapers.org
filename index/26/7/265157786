Best practices in programming need to be emphasized in a CS1 course as bad student habits persist if not reinforced well. The C++ programming language, although a relatively old language, has been regularly updated with new versions since 2011, on the pace of once every three years. Each new version contains important features that make the C++ language more complex for backwards compatibility, but often introduce new features to make common use cases simpler to implement. This poster contains experiences in designing a CS1 course that uses the C++ programming language that incorporates "modern" versions of the language from the start, as well as recent conferences about the language. Our goals were to prevent many common bad habits among C++ programmers.
