Current software engineering methods employ a variety of design notations and techniques during the development process. This paper suggests a new, unified approach to developing software, termed Program/System Design. Programs are viewed as being made up of systems of data-coupled, data-activated processing units. Using a coherent hierarchy of data flow diagrams, complex systems are specified as compositions of successively simpler systems. The methods are illustrated by a Program/System solution to the Telegram Problem.
