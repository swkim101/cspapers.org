Optical character recognition(OCR) is the technology to identify text characters embedded within images. Conventional OCR models exhibit performance degradation when performing with noisy images. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model, which combines computer vision using optical sensor with natural language processing by bidirectional encoder representations from transformers(BERT) and cosine similarity scoring. The proposed model uses a confidence rate to determine whether to utilize optical sensor alone or BERT/cosine similarity scoring combined with the optical sensor. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms approximately 4.34 times better than the conventional OCR.
