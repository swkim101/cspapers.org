Current Conversational AI systems employ different machine learning pipelines, as well as external knowledge sources and business logic to predict the next action. Maintaining various components in dialogue managers' pipeline adds complexity in expansion and updates, increases processing time, and causes additive noise through the pipeline that can lead to incorrect next action prediction. This paper investigates graph integration into language transformers to improve understanding the relationships between humans' utterances, previous, and next actions without the dependency on external sources or components. Experimental analyses on real calls indicate that the proposed Graph Integrated Language Transformer models can achieve higher performance compared to other production level conversational AI systems in driving interactive calls with human users in real-world settings.
