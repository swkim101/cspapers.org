This session will help attendees interested in broadening participation in computing (BPC) select specific BPC activities to engage in, either individually or as a group or department. Attendees will be provided with a list of more than 60 BPC activities and will participate in a guided discussion to help select those best suited to them. Topics of discussion will be introduced by the session organizers, discussed in small groups, and then summary points will be shared with all attendees. The guided topic prompts will cover (1) how each activity contributes to BPC; (2) the expected feasibility, impact, and relevance of activities and how to prioritize them; (3) methods of sustaining activities for long enough to see results; and (4) next steps, including implementing activities and incorporating them into departmental BPC plans. At the end of the session, each attendee will have selected multiple BPC activities suited to their goals and institution and have developed their ability to analyze BPC activities along several axes and anticipate how best to sustain them.
