Pausing behavior in introductory Computer Science (CS1) courses has been related to course outcomes and could be linked to a student's cognitive load. Using Cognitive Load Theory and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development as a theoretical framework, this study empirically analyzes keystroke latencies, or pause times between keystrokes, with the goal of better understanding what types of assignments need more scaffolding than others. We report the characteristics of eleven assignments, introduce a method to analyze pausing behavior, and investigate how pausing behavior changes with assignment characteristics (e.g., introducing new programming constructs, engaging creativity through Turtle graphics, etc). We find evidence that pausing behavior does change based on the assignment characteristics and that assignments with particular characteristics, such as object-oriented principles, may be more likely to have excessive demands on student working memory. We also find evidence that assignment completion time may not be an accurate measure of assignment difficulty.
