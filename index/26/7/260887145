Sequential recommendation demonstrates the capability to recommend items by modeling the sequential behavior of users. Traditional methods typically treat users as sequences of items, overlooking the collaborative relationships among them. Graph-based methods incorporate collaborative information by utilizing the user-item interaction graph. However, these methods sometimes face challenges in terms of time complexity and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, this paper presents AutoSeqRec, an incremental recommendation model specifically designed for sequential recommendation tasks. AutoSeqRec is based on autoencoders and consists of an encoder and three decoders within the autoencoder architecture. These components consider both the user-item interaction matrix and the rows and columns of the item transition matrix. The reconstruction of the user-item interaction matrix captures user long-term preferences through collaborative filtering. In addition, the rows and columns of the item transition matrix represent the item out-degree and in-degree hopping behavior, which allows for modeling the user's short-term interests. When making incremental recommendations, only the input matrices need to be updated, without the need to update parameters, which makes AutoSeqRec very efficient. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoSeqRec outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, while showcasing its robustness and efficiency.
