Imagine a social scientist looking at the National Security Council emails for background information on how a policy decision was made; imagine a biographer accessing an email archive of a prominent scientist to find her role in a seminal discovery; or imagine an individual pondering over his own personal email collection to remember who was responsible for what part of the project he participated in three years ago. In all these scenarios the person making the analysis wants to determine who were the key actors, what roles did they play, what actions did they take, and what was the outcome of those actions. We are interested in developing automatic techniques that would allows us to extract such information from email collections. In this paper we focus on one aspect of this problem: detecting the people roles. A single person can “play” different “personas” almost at the same time: e.g., she is a graduate student and a research assistant and a friend and so on. These roles are reflected in the content of all her communications with the outside world and thus in her email messages as well. We want to detect those roles so we can determine the relationship between the actors, – e.g., who started a project and who was responsible in bringing it to completion. We also want to treat emails created by the same person in different roles separately, – e.g., we would like to separate her personal emails from the professional ones. We view a collection of emails as a multi-party dialog where each message carries one or several social actions or “speech acts” [4]. We believe that an individual’s role can be detected by analyzing the patterns of the speech
