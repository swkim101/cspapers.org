Augmented Reality (AR) provides a safe and low-cost option for hazardous safety training that allows for the visualization of aspects that may be invisible, such as radiation. Effectively visually communicating such threats in the environment around the user is not straightforward. This work describes visually encoding radiation using the spatial awareness mesh of an AR Head Mounted Display. We leverage the AR deviceâ€™s GPUs to develop a real time solution that accumulates multiple dynamic sources and uses stencils to prevent an environment being over saturated with a visualization, as well as supporting the encoding of direction explicitly in the visualization. We perform a user study (25 participants) of different visualizations and obtain user feedback. Results show that there are complex interactions and while no visual representation was statistically superior or inferior, user opinions vary widely. We also discuss the evaluation approaches and provide recommendations.
