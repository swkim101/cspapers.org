The accurate prediction of the neighboring vehicles' trajectories affects the security of autonomous driving vehicles. However, it is challenging for existing methods to anticipating the trajectories of vehicles in the vicinity due to the uncertainty of driving behaviors and the complex interaction patterns of traffic flows. In this study, incorporating the planning information of the ego vehicle, we propose a novel trajectory prediction approach based on the hierarchical attention mechanism. Firstly, a spatio-temporary attention module is presented to extract the social interaction of surrounding vehicles and capture the temporal dependence of continuous frame historical information and planning information. Then, a hard-soft attention module is designed to perform two tasks: weighing the importance of both historical and future information, and learning different location information about the target vehicles. Our method is evaluated on two national highway datasets. The experimental results show that our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
