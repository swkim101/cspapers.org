Previous selective dynamic compilation systems have demonstrated that dynamic compilation can achieve performance improvements at low cost on small kernels, but they have had difficulty scaling to larger programs. To overcome this limitation, we developed DyC, a selective dynamic compilation system that includes more sophisticated and flexible analyses and transformations. DyC is able to achieve good performance improvements on programs that are much larger and more complex than the kernels. We analyze the individual optimizations of DyC and assess their impact on performance collectively and individually.
