In conversational AI assistants, SLU models are part of a complex pipeline composed of several modules working in harmony. Hence, an update to the SLU model needs to ensure improvements not only in the model specific metrics but also in the overall conversational assistant performance. Specifically, the impact on user interaction quality metrics must be factored in, while integrating interactions with distal modules upstream and downstream of the SLU component. We develop a ML model that makes it possible to gauge the interaction quality metrics due to SLU model changes before a production launch. The proposed model is a multi-modal transformer with a gated mechanism that conditions on text embeddings, output of a BERT model pre-trained on conversational data, and the hypotheses of the SLU classifiers with the corresponding confidence scores. We show that the proposed model predicts defect with more than 76% correlation with live interaction quality defects, compared to 46% baseline.
