Generative Flow Networks, known as GFlowNets, have been introduced in recent times, presenting an exciting possibility for neural networks to model distributions across various data structures. In this paper, we broaden their applicability to encompass scenarios where the data structures are optimal solutions of a combinatorial problem. Concretely, we propose the use of GFlowNets to learn the distribution of optimal solutions for kidney exchange problems (KEPs), a generalized form of matching problems involving cycles.
