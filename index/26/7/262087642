Welcome to the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management! The organizers and sponsors of CIKM'02 join me in the hope that this conference proves to be an opportunity for the sharing of knowledge, and the creation and renewal of friendships.The first CIKM conference took place about ten years ago. In cybertime that is truly ancient history, and you may agree that the world has changed in many ways since then. One thing that has not changed is the need for scientists to meet each other, to exchange ideas, and to welcome new members of the scientific community. To the extend that CIKM does this, it serves its purpose.
