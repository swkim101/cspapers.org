A new method of teaching traditional concepts of CS1-CS2 is discussed. The new method uses real-time data acquisition, teaming, and interdisciplinary courseware to illustrate basic computer science concepts. We present a series of experiments and the corresponding software engineering elements. These experiments have proved to be motivating for a broad spectrum of students.
