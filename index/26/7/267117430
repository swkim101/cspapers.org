Background: A wealth of information is hidden within unstructured text. This information is often best utilized in structured or relational form, which is suited for sophisticated query processing, for integration with relational databases, and for data mining. For example, newspaper and e-mail archives contain information that could be useful to analysts and govenment agencies. Information extraction systems produce a structured representation of the information that is “buried” in text documents. Unfortunately, processing each document is computationally expensive, and is not feasible for large text databases or for the web. With many database sizes exceeding millions of documents, processing time is becoming a bottleneck for exploiting information extraction technology.
