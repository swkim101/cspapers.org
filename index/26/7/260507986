The stochastic network calculus (SNC) holds promise as a versatile and uniform framework to calculate probabilistic performance bounds in networks of queues. A great challenge to accurate bounds and efficient calculations are stochastic dependencies between flows due to resource sharing inside the network. However, by carefully utilizing the basic SNC concepts in the network analysis the necessity of taking these dependencies into account can be minimized. To that end, we unleash the power of the pay multiplexing only once principle (PMOO, known from the deterministic network calculus) in the SNC analysis. We choose an analytic combinatorics presentation of the results in order to ease complex calculations. In tree-reducible networks, a subclass of general feedforward networks, we obtain an effective analysis in terms of avoiding the need to take internal flow dependencies into account. In a comprehensive numerical evaluation, we demonstrate how this unleashed PMOO analysis can reduce the known gap between simulations and SNC calculations significantly, and how it favourably compares to state-of-the art SNC calculations in terms of accuracy and computational effort. Motivated by these promising results, we also consider general feedforward networks, when some flow dependencies have to be taken into account. To that end, the unleashed PMOO analysis is extended to the partially dependent case and a case study of a canonical topology, known as the diamond network, is provided, again displaying favourable results over the state of the art.
