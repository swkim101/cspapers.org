SIRE (Syracuse Information Retrieval Experiment) is an interactive bibliographic retrieval system. It was developed at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. It is implemented in SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language), an ALGOL like language, on a DEC KL-10. SIRE presently has two data bases; 1) one issue of Physics Abstracts with 7146 documents; and 2) a sign language linguistics data base from Gallaudet College with 490 documents.
