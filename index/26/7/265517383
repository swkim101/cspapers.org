This course explores somatic approaches to experience design in HCI. Designing for Sensory Appreciation focuses on cultivating our bodily sensory experience as a resource for design. This course exemplifies how somatic approaches can be applied through sensory appreciation in the form of case studies that incorporate experience-based activities. We have tailored this course for online experiential activities that link theory with practice in the context of HCI design exemplars. The course invites a rethinking of the process of designing for technology based on the emerging somatic turn within Human Computer Interaction [15, 19, 20, 25, 26] that acknowledges design for the experience of the self [15,31] and recognizes the interiority of human experience as an equal partner in technological design processes.
