We explore and evaluate single-handed folding interactions suitable for “modified clamshell flip phones” with a full screen touch display that folds in half along the short dimension. Three categories of interactions are identified: only-fold, touch-enhanced fold, and fold-enhanced touch; in which gestures are created using fold direction, fold magnitude, and touch position. A prototype evaluation device is built to resemble clamshell flip phones, but with a modified hinge and spring system to enable folding in both directions. A study investigates performance and preference for 30 fold gestures to discover which are most promising. To demonstrate how folding interactions could be incorporated into flip phone interfaces, applications such as map browsing, text editing, and menu shortcuts are described.
