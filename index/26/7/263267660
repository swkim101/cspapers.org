A <i>zone diagram</i> is a new variation of the classical notion of Voronoi diagram. Given points (sites) <b>P</b><inf>1</inf>,...,<b>P</b><inf><i>n</i></inf> in the plane, each <b>P</b><i>i</i> is assigned a region <i>R<inf>i</inf></i>, but in contrast to the ordinary Voronoi diagrams, the union of the <i>R<inf>i</inf></i> has a nonempty complement, the <i>neutral zone</i>. The defining property is that each <i>R<inf>i</inf></i> consists of all <b>x</b> ∈ R<sup>2</sup> that lie closer (non-strictly) to <b>P</b><inf><i>i</i></inf>. than to the union of all the other <i>R<inf>j</inf></i>, <i>j</i> ≠ <i>i</i>. Thus, the zone diagram is defined implicitly, by a "fixed-point property," and neither its existence nor its uniqueness seem obvious. We establish existence using a general fixed-point result (a consequence of Schauder's theorem or Kakutani's theorem); this proof should generalize easily to related settings, say higher dimensions. Then we prove uniqueness of the zone diagram, as well as convergence of a natural iterative algorithm for computing it, by a geometric argument, which also relies on a result for the case of two sites in an earlier paper. Many challenging questions remain open.
