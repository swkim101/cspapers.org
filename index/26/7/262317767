What we’re doing now with reverse engineering is Archeology. We’re trying to gain an understanding of existing systems by examining ancient artifacts and piecing together the software equivalent of broken clay pots. Then we look to restructuring and reengineering to save the day. But what we really need is Perestroika more fundamental restructuring which changes the basic ways we deal with institutions and methods. For software maintenance and systems development, it means going beyond the concepts of application reengineering by reverse engineering the essential elements of the present system and integrating this knowledge into evolutionary development supported by CASE.
