We are delighted to present the papers from the 2nd NDA Workshop on Network Data Analytics, which took place on 19th May, 2017 co-located with the ACM SIGMOD conference in Chicago, Illinois, USA. 
 
Networks are prevalent in today's electronic world in a wide variety of domains ranging from engineering to social sciences, life sciences, physical sciences, and so on. Researchers and practitioners have studied networks in multiple ways like defining network metrics, providing theoretical results and examining problems like pattern mining, link prediction, etc. The NDA workshop is a forum for exchanging ideas and methods for mining, querying and learning with real-world networks, developing new common understandings of the problems at hand, sharing of data sets where applicable, and leveraging existing knowledge from different disciplines. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers from academia, industry, and government, to create a forum for discussing recent advances in (large-scale) graph analysis, as well as propose and discuss novel methods and techniques towards addressing domain specific challenges and handling noise in real-world graphs.
