Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have the potential to provide low-power phase shifting in silicon photonics, but techniques for designing low-loss devices are necessary for adoption of the technology. Based on coupled mode theory (CMT), we derive analytical expressions relating the loss and, in particular, the phase-dependent loss, to the geometry of the MEMS phase shifters. The analytical model explains the loss mechanisms of MEMS phase shifters and enables simple optimization procedures. Based on that insight, we propose phase shifter geometries that minimize coupling power out of the waveguide. Minimization of the loss is based on mode orthogonality of a waveguide and phase shifter modes. We numerically model such geometries for a silicon nitride MEMS phase shifter over a silicon nitride waveguide, predicting less than −1.08 dB loss over a 2π range and −0.026 dB loss when optimized for a π range. We demonstrate this design framework with a custom silicon nitride process and achieve −0.48 dB insertion loss and less than 0.05 dB transmission variation over a π phase shift. Our work demonstrates the strength of the coupled mode approach for the design and optimization of MEMS phase shifters.
