This paper presents the design, characterization, and testing of a steerable needle robot for minimally invasive neurosurgery. The robot consists of a rigid outer tube and two telescopic tendon-driven steerable tubes. Through the rotation, translation, and bending of individual tubes, this telescopic tendon-driven needle robot can perform dexterous motion and follow the path of the tip. We presented the design of the needle robot and its actuation system, modeling of the robotic kinematics, characterization of the robot motion, results of the open-loop kinematic control, and demonstration of the follow-the-leader motion. The position error of the robot tip is 0.92 mm, and follow-the-leader motion error is 1.1 mm. Due to its small footprint and unique motion ability, the robot has the potential to be manipulated inside human brain and used for minimally invasive neurosurgery.
