Shuffled regression is the problem of learning regression models from shuffled data that consists of a set of input features and a set of target outputs where the correspondence between the input and output is unknown. This study proposes a new deep learning method for shuffled regression called Shuffled Deep Regression (SDR). We derive the sparse and stochastic variant of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for SDR that iteratively updates discrete latent variables and the parameters of neural networks. The effectiveness of the proposal is confirmed by benchmark data experiments.
