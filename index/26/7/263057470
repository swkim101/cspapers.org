Image-based navigation paradigms have recently emerged as an interesting alternative to conventional model- based methods in mobile robotics. In this paper, we augment the existing image-based navigation approaches by presenting a novel image-based exploration algorithm. The algorithm facilitates a mobile robot equipped only with a monocular pan-tilt camera to autonomously explore a typical indoor environment. The algorithm infers frontier information directly from the images and displaces the robot towards regions that are informative for navigation. The frontiers are detected using a geometric context-based segmentation scheme that exploits the natural scene structure in indoor environments. In the due process, a topological graph of the workspace is built in terms of images which can be subsequently utilised for the tasks of localisation, path planning and navigation. Experimental results on a mobile robot in an unmodified laboratory and corridor environments demonstrate the validity of the approach.
