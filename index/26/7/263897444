In this paper, the recently developed ℒ1 adaptive control strategy is experimentally validated for the first time on a parallel kinematic manipulator. The ℒ1 adaptive controller is known for its decoupled estimation and control loops which enables fast adaptation while guaranteeing robustness of the closed-loop system. The control scheme is experimentally implemented on a 4-DOFs parallel kinematic manipulator. Based on the obtained experimental results, a comparative study shows that the proposed ℒ1 adaptive controller outperforms the PD controller in terms of tracking performance thanks to the compensation of the nonlinearities in the adaptive controller.
