In this paper, we propose a video transmission scheme for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) systems. More particularly, to transmit a scalable video coding (SVC) video sequence, we have rationally exploited the spatial modulation (SM) and singular value decomposition (SVD) to convey base layer (BL) and enhancement layers (ELs), correspondingly. In addition, we also propose an adaptive constellation selection to effectively alleviate the high correlation issue in the VLC channel. Finally, the result in the simulation section shows that in comparison with the conventional MIMOVLC scheme, the proposed schemes are better in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for various simulation scenarios.
