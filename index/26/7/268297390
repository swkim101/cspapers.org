In the field of Learning from Demonstration (LfD), Dynamical Systems (DSs) have gained significant attention due to their ability to generate real-time motions and reach predefined targets. However, the conventional convergence-centric behavior exhibited by DSs may fall short in safety-critical tasks, specifically, those requiring precise replication of demonstrated trajectories or strict adherence to constrained regions even in the presence of perturbations or human intervention. Moreover, existing DS research often assumes demonstrations solely in Euclidean space, overlooking the crucial aspect of orientation in various applications. To alleviate these shortcomings, we present an innovative approach geared toward ensuring the safe execution of learned orientation skills within constrained regions surrounding a reference trajectory. This involves learning a stable DS on SO(3), extracting time-varying conic constraints from the variability observed in expert demonstrations, and bounding the evolution of the DS with Conic Control Barrier Function (CCBF) to fulfill the constraints. We validated our approach through extensive evaluation in simulation and showcased its effectiveness for a cutting skill in the context of assisted teleoperation.
