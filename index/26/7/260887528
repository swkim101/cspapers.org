Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to detect all the visual relation triplets in a given image. With the emergence of various advanced techniques for better utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic information in each relation triplet, SGG has achieved great progress over the recent years. However, due to the ubiquitous long-tailed predicate distributions, todayâ€™s SGG models are still easily biased to the head predicates. Currently, the most prevalent debiasing solutions for SGG are re-balancing methods, e.g., changing the distributions of original training samples. In this paper, we argue that all existing re-balancing strategies fail to increase the diversity of the relation triplet features of each predicate, which is critical for robust SGG. To this end, we propose a novel Compositional Feature Augmentation (CFA) strategy, which is the first unbiased SGG work to mitigate the bias issue from the perspective of increasing the diversity of triplet features. Specifically, we first decompose each relation triplet feature into two components: intrinsic feature and extrinsic feature, which correspond to the intrinsic characteristics and extrinsic contexts of a relation triplet, respectively. Then, we design two different feature augmentation modules to enrich the feature diversity of original relation triplets by replacing or mixing up either their intrinsic or extrinsic features from other samples. Due to its model-agnostic nature, CFA can be seamlessly incorporated into various SGG frameworks. Extensive ablations have shown that CFA achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the trade-off between different metrics.
