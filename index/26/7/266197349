As robotic intelligence increases, so does the im-portance of agents that collect data from real-world environments. When learning in contact with the environment, one must consider how to minimize the impact on the environment and maintain reproducibility. To achieve this, the contact force with the environment must be reduced. One way to achieve this is to reduce the inertia of the arm. In this study, we present an arm we have developed with 6 degrees of freedom and low inertia. The inertia of our arm has been significantly reduced compared to previous research, and experiments have confirmed that it also has low joint friction torque and good contact sensitivity.
