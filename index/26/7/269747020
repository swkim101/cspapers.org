With advances in electronic-skin and wearable technologies, it is possible to continuously measure stress markers from the skin and sweat to monitor and improve wellbeing and health. Understandably, the sensorâ€™s engineering and resolution are important towards its function. However, we find that people looking for an e-skin stress sensor may look beyond measurement precision, demanding a private and stealth design to reduce, for example, social stigmatization. We introduce the idea of a stress sensing "wear index," created from the combination of human-centered design (n=24), physiological (n=10), and biochemical (n=16) data. This wear index can inform the design of stress wearables to fit specific applications, e.g., human factors may be relevant for a wellbeing application, versus a relapse prevention application that may require more sensing precision. Our wear index idea can be further generalized as a method to close gaps between design and engineering practices.
