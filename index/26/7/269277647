Modern data centers (DCs) employ various traffic load balancers to achieve high bisection bandwidth. Among them, flowlet switching has shown remarkable performance in both load balancing and upper-layer protocol (e.g., TCP) friendliness. However, flowlet-based load balancers suffer from the inflexibility of flowlet timeout value (FTV) and result in sub-optimal performance under various application workloads. To this end, we propose Halflife, a novel flowlet-based load balancer that leverages fading FTVs to reroute traffic promptly under different workloads without any prior knowledge. Halflife not only balances traffic better, but also avoids the performance degradation caused by frequent oscillation or shifting of lows between paths. Furthermore, Halflife's fading mechanism is not only compatible with most flowlet-based load balancers, such as CONGA and LetFlow, but also improves their performance when leveraging flowlet switching in RDMA network. Through testbed experiments and simulations, we prove that Halflife improves the performance of CONGA and LetFlow by 10% ~ 150%, and it outperforms other load balancers by 30% ~ 200% across most application workloads.
