Voice assistants are becoming increasingly pervasive due to the convenience and automation they provide through the voice interface. However, such convenience often comes with unforeseen security and privacy risks. For example, encrypted trafﬁc from voice assistants can leak sensitive information about their users’ habits and lifestyles. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of ﬁngerprinting voice commands on the most popular voice assistant platforms (Google, Alexa, and Siri). We also provide a deeper understanding of the feasibility of ﬁngerprinting third-party applications and streaming services over the voice interface. Our analysis not only improves the state-of-the-art technique but also studies a more realistic setup for ﬁngerprinting voice activities over encrypted trafﬁc. Our proposed technique considers a passive network eavesdropper observing encrypted trafﬁc from various devices within a home and, therefore, ﬁrst detects the invocation/activation of voice assistants followed by what speciﬁc voice command is issued. Using an end-to-end system design, we show that it is possible to detect when a voice assistant is activated with 99% accuracy and then utilize the subsequent trafﬁc pattern to infer more ﬁne-grained user activities with around 77-80% accuracy.
