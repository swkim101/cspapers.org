Although smart speakers and other voice assistants are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, their always-standby nature continues to prompt significant privacy concerns. To address these, we propose K IMYA , a hardening framework that allows device vendors to provide strong data-privacy guarantees. Concretely, K IMYA guarantees that microphone data can only be used for local processing, and is immediately discarded unless a user-auditable notification is generated. K IMYA thus makes devices accountable for their data-retention behavior. Moreover, K IMYA is not limited to voice assistants, but is applicable to all devices with always-standby, event-triggered sensors. We implement K IMYA for ARM Cortex-M, and apply it to a wake-word detection engine. Our evaluation shows that K IMYA introduces low overhead, can be used in constrained environments, and does not require hardware modifications.
