Directing undergraduate studies (DUS) is often undertaken by an individual (possibly department chair) or committee that lacks formal training for DUS duties. In addition, growing teaching demands are often outpacing growth in faculty, which lead to unique pressures on the DUS activities that are neither addressed by recent departmental experience nor shared among local peers. The focus of this session is common Computing DUS-specific challenges: the logistics and administration of undergraduate programs. Although the session focuses on Undergraduate Studies, those charged with direction and oversight of all types of degree programs are welcome to participate and share. Participants will be given a forum to: 1) identify some of the most common DUS activities and responsibilities; 2) share challenges, successes, and tips with other participants; and most importantly, 3) a chance to network with peers who may be able to share valuable knowledge and support beyond the session. Online tools will be used to organize and prioritize discussion topics, so participants should bring a laptop or mobile device.
