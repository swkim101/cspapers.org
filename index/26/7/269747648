The concept of dealing damage is established and widespread in video games. With growing complexity and countless interactions in modern games, capturing how damage unfolds becomes an intricate problem - for developers just as for players. Misunderstanding how to optimize damage potentials includes risks of game imbalances, game-breaking exploits, mismatches between player skill and challenge (harming flow), and impaired perceived competence. All of these considerably impact player experience, game reception, success, and retention, yet polishing optimal strategies remains often a player community effort. To accelerate, inform and ease this process, we implemented an interactive tool capable of simulating, visualizing, planning and comparing damage strategies in video games. Following a case study within the Guild Wars 2 community, we contribute a player-driven perspective on the problem of damage optimization, as well as an artifact that resulted in empirical improvements â€“ advancing the fields of game analytics, game evaluation methods and self-regulated learning.
