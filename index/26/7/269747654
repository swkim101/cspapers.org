Predicting users’ emotional states during interaction is a long-standing goal of affective computing. However, traditional methods based on sensory data alone fall short due to the interplay between users’ latent cognitive states and emotional responses. To address this, we introduce a computational cognitive model that simulates emotion as a continuous process, rather than a static state, during interactive episodes. This model integrates cognitive-emotional appraisal mechanisms with computational rationality, utilizing value predictions from reinforcement learning. Experiments with human participants demonstrate the model’s ability to predict and explain the emergence of emotions such as happiness, boredom, and irritation during interactions. Our approach opens the possibility of designing interactive systems that adapt to users’ emotional states, thereby improving user experience and engagement. This work also deepens our understanding of the potential of modeling the relationship between reward processing, reinforcement learning, goal-directed behavior, and appraisal.
