Attributed graph clustering is an unsupervised task that partitions nodes into different groups. Self-supervised learning (SSL) shows great potential in handling this task, and some recent studies simultaneously learn multiple SSL tasks to further boost performance. Currently, different SSL tasks are assigned the same set of weights for all graph nodes. However, we observe that some graph nodes whose neighbors are in different groups require significantly different emphases on SSL tasks. In this paper, we propose to dynamically learn the weights of SSL tasks for different nodes and fuse the embeddings learned from different SSL tasks to boost performance. We design an innovative graph clustering approach, namely Dynamically Fusing Self-Supervised Learning (DyFSS). Specifically, DyFSS fuses features extracted from diverse SSL tasks using distinct weights derived from a gating network. To effectively learn the gating network, we design a dual-level self-supervised strategy that incorporates pseudo labels and the graph structure. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that DyFSS outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-task SSL methods by up to 8.66% on the accuracy metric.
