Securing employment and housing are key aspects of pursuing independent living. As these activities are increasingly practiced online, web accessibility of related services becomes critical for a successful major life transition. Support for this transition is especially important for people with autism or intellectual disability, who often face issues of underemployment and social isolation. In this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews and contextual inquiries with neurotypical adults and adults with autism or intellectual disability to understand common and unique goals, strategies, and challenges of neurodiverse adults when searching for employment and housing resources online. Our findings revealed that current interfaces adequately support practical (e.g., finance) goals but lack information on social (e.g., inclusivity) goals. Furthermore, unexpected search results and inaccessible social and contextual information diminished search experiences for neurodivergent users, which suggests the need for predictability and structured guidance in searching online. We conclude with design suggestions to make neurodivergent usersâ€™ online search experience an opportunity to demonstrate their independence.
