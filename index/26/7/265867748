It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 6th Workshop on Software Quality -- WoSQ08. As with previous workshops, the workshop is intended for researchers in the area of software quality and aims to encourage discussion on their research progress and to explore future directions. The goals of the working session are to exchange experience, to discover areas of mutual collaboration and to envision future trends in the field of software quality. To achieve this, the workshop aims to bring together academic, industrial and commercial communities interested in software quality topics to discuss the different technologies being defined and used in the software quality area. 
 
The workshop had 10 papers accepted for presentation and discussion. We are pleased to have gathered a truly international community with papers from Austria, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Pakistan, United Kingdom and the United States. All papers had two reviews.
