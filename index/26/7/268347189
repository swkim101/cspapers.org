The evolution of the art of filmmaking is closely tied to technical innovation. From the earliest invention of the motion picture camera to the first use of stop motion and on to the development of techniques that use computers for modern-day visual effects, filmmaking has evolved through collaboration between art and science. Today, the visual effects industry uses computer science technology to bring worlds and galaxies to life. And yet many students are unaware that there are computer science careers within the media and entertainment industry. Encouraging this diverse group of talented computer scientists to enter the field not only gives students options in their careers but also strengthens this collaborative industry. Dr. Rachel Rose, Director of Research & Development at the storied visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), will share her experience leading the development of software and hardware innovations that help artists bring film to life. Dr. Rose will also discuss the important role the Academy Software Foundation plays in maintaining a base of open source software for the industry that anyone can contribute to, including students. She will outline some of the outreach and education efforts within the Foundation that encourage students of diverse backgrounds to consider a career in the industry.
