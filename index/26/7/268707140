The population characteristics of the datasets related to the same task may vary significantly and merging them may harm performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method of domain adaptation called "cross-adaptation". It allows for implicit adaptation to the target domain without the need for any labeled examples across this domain. We test our approach on 9 datasets for SARS-CoV-2 detection from complete blood count from different hospitals around the world. Results show that our solution is universal with respect to various classification algorithms and allows for up to a 10pp increase in F1 score on average.
