Recently, how the model performance scales with the training sample size has been extensively studied for large models on vision and language related domains. Nevertheless, the ubiquitous node classification tasks on web-scale graphs were ignored, where the traits of these tasks, such as non-IIDness and transductive setting, are likely to cause different scaling laws and motivate novel techniques to beat the law. Therefore, we first explore the neural scaling law for node classification tasks on three large-scale graphs. Then, we benchmark several state-of-the-art data pruning methods on these tasks, not only validating the possibility of improving the original unsatisfactory power law but also gaining insights into a hard-and-representative principle on picking an effective subset of training nodes. Moreover, we leverage the transductive setting to propose a novel data pruning method, which instantiates our principle in a test set-targeted manner. Our method consistently outperforms related methods on all three datasets. Meanwhile, we utilize a PAC-Bayesian framework to analyze our method, extending prior results to account for both hardness and representativeness. In addition to a promising way to ease GNN training on web-scale graphs, our study offers knowledge of the relationship between training nodes and GNN generalization.
