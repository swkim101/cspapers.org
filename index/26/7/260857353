Participatory budgeting (PB) is an implementation of direct democracy that allows members of a community to make collective budgeting decisions. However, existing PB processes rely upon a pre-defined central budget. We introduce a framework for pooling resources in addition to selecting projects, which we call PB with Resource Pooling. We motivate the key characteristics of this model and the basic properties we would like a mechanism to satisfy. We summarize results and discuss interesting questions related to our framework.
