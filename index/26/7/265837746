Metamorphic Testing (MT) is a testing technique that exploits the relationships among the inputs and outputs of multiple executions of the program under test, so- called Metamorphic Relations (MRs). MT has been proven highly effective in testing programs that face the oracle problem, for which the correctness of individual output is difficult to determine. Since the introduction of MT in 1998, the interest in this testing methodology has grown immensely with numerous applications in various domains such as machine learning, bioinformatics, computer graphics, simulation, search engines, decision support, cloud computing, databases, and compilers.
