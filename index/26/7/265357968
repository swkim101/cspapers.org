 Engineering design optimization problems are commonly multi-objective, involve computationally expensive simulations, and have uncertainty. In these problems, consideration of uncertainty can produce feasibly robust optimized design solutions, i.e., optimized and feasible under uncertainty. In general, methods for solving multi-objective robust optimization problems can be computationally expensive. To ease the computational burden and make these methods more accessible, a surrogate-based bi-objective Bayesian feasibility robust optimization method from the literature has been extended in this paper to higher numbers of objectives. A key component of the proposed method is a new acquisition function. The acquisition function proposed in this paper uses a Monte Carlo approach to approximate the expected centroidal improvement of the solution set. The proposed acquisition function is compared against exact (closed form) acquisition function-based approaches and other methods from the literature. The experimental results from this study suggest the multi-objective robust optimization framework is insensitive to the selection of acquisition function.
