It is our great pleasure to welcome you to Seattle for the 2008 ACM International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis -- ISSTA 2008. This year's symposium continues the tradition of ISSTA being the premier forum for presentation of research results on leading edge issues related to software testing and analysis. 
 
The call for papers attracted 101 submissions to ISSTA 2008, the same number as the year before, which shows the significant ongoing interest in the field. The program committee accepted 26 papers that cover a variety of topics, including static analysis, fault localization, and various hybrid testing and analysis approaches. Additionally, we invited a number of student authors to present their ideas as posters at the conference. 
 
The program includes two distinguished keynote speakers: Jim Larus on "The Real Value of Testing" and Ben Liblit on "Cooperative Debugging With Five Hundred Million Test Cases". Five satellite workshops (Defects, PADTAD, TAV-WEB, WODA, and SSEAT) offer attendees the chance to present work and exchange ideas on focused topics of shared interest. Further program details are available on the ISSTA 2008 Web site at http://issta08.rutgers.edu/.
