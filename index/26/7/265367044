 Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is the study of the influence of any given inputs on the outputs of a model. In the context of engineering design, GSA has been widely used to understand both individual and collective contributions of design variables on the design objectives. So far, global sensitivity studies have often been limited to design spaces with only quantitative (numerical) design variables. However, many engineering systems also contain, if not only, qualitative (categorical) design variables in addition to quantitative design variables. In this paper, we integrate the novel Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) with Sobolâ€™ analysis to develop the first metamodel-based mixed-variable GSA method. Through two analytical case studies, we first validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for mixed-variable problems. Furthermore, while the new metamodel-based mixed-variable GSA method can benefit various engineering design applications, we employ our method with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (BO) to accelerate the Pareto front design exploration in many-level combinatorial design spaces. Specifically, we implement a sensitivity-aware design framework for metal-organic framework (MOF) materials that are constructed only from qualitative design variables and show the benefits of our method for expediting the exploration of novel MOF candidates from a many-level large combinatorial design space.
