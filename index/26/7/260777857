For credit card transactions using the EMV standard, the integrity of transaction information is protected cryptographically by the credit card. Integrity checks by the payment terminal use RSA signatures and are part of EMV’s ofﬂine data authentication mechanism. Online integrity checks by the card issuer use a keyed MAC. One would expect that failures in either mechanism would always result in transaction failure, but this is not the case as ofﬂine authentication failures do not always result in declined transactions. Consequently, the integrity of transaction data that is not protected by the keyed MAC (online) cannot be guaranteed. We show how this missing integrity protection can be exploited to bypass PIN veriﬁcation for high-value Mastercard transactions. As a proof-of-concept, we have built an Android app that modiﬁes unprotected card-sourced data, including the data relevant for cardholder veriﬁcation. Using our app, we have tricked real-world terminals into downgrading from PIN veriﬁcation to either no cardholder veriﬁcation or (paper) signature veriﬁcation, for transactions of up to 500 Swiss Francs. Our ﬁndings have been disclosed to the vendor with the recommendation to decline any transaction where ofﬂine data authentication fails.
