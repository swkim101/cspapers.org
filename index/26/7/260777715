Access control conﬁgurations are gatekeepers to block un-welcome access to sensitive data. Unfortunately, system administrators (sysadmins) sometimes over-grant permissions when resolving unintended access-deny issues reported by legitimate users, which may open up security vulnerabilities for attackers. One of the primary reasons is that modern software does not provide informative logging to guide sysadmins to understand the reported problems. This paper makes one of the ﬁrst attempts (to the best of our knowledge) to help developers improve log messages in order to help sysadmins correctly understand and ﬁx access-deny issues without over-granting permissions. First, we conducted an observation study to understand the current practices of access-deny logging in the server software. Our study shows that many access-control program locations do not have any log messages; and a large percentage of existing log messages lack useful information to guide sysadmins to correctly understand and ﬁx the issues. On top of our observations, we built S EC L OG , which uses static analysis to automatically help developers ﬁnd missing access-deny log locations and identify relevant information at the log location. We evaluated S EC L OG with ten widely deployed server applications. Overall, S EC L OG identiﬁed 380 new log statements for access-deny cases, and also enhanced 550 existing access-deny log messages with diagnostic information. We have reported 114 log statements to the developers of these applications, and so far 70 have been accepted into their main branches . We also conducted a user study with sysad-mins (n=32) on six real-world access-deny issues. S EC L OG can reduce the number of insecure ﬁxes from 27 to 1, and also improve the diagnosis time by 64.2% on average.
