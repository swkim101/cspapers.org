Proper analysis and validation of gene expression data is not a trivial task. Most of the existing approaches identify individual or group of markers/signatures where the validation only goes as far as literature and biological experimental validation. In this paper we discuss a framework that could be considered to develop and validate patterns from gene expression data and work towards future clinical test kits.
