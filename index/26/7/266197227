Miniature soft robots present great potential in delicate manipulations due to their gentle force, complaint structures, and flexible motions. Easy control and fast response make pneumatic actuation a prevalent method for driving soft robotics. In addition, sequential motions are also crucial for enhancing the grasping and moving abilities of soft robots. How-ever, existing miniature pneumatic soft robots are limited to one-dimensional geometries and simple motions due to the difficulties in designing and fabricating intricate small airways in miniature pneumatic soft robots, which restricts them from more versatile deformations. Here, we employ intricate monolithic microchannels embedded into miniature soft robots' mon-olithic bodies for sequential motions. After verifying the effects of the channel diameter, strain-limiting layer, and elastic modulus of the robot's body on the bending behaviors of the ID soft robots, we fabricated a soft flower robot capable of sequential and simultaneous 3D-to-3D shape morphing through five individual microchannels and a soft carnivorous plant robot containing 2D interconnected microchannels capable of sequential enclosed grasping through a single inlet.
