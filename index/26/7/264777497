In this paper, we present a novel robust framework for low-level vision tasks, including denoising, object removal, frame interpolation, and super-resolution, that does not require any external training data corpus. Our proposed approach directly learns the weights of neural modules by optimizing over the corrupted test sequence, leveraging the spatio-temporal coherence and internal statistics of videos. Furthermore, we introduce a novel spatial pyramid loss that leverages the property of spatio-temporal patch recurrence in a video across the different scales of the video. This loss enhances robustness to unstructured noise in both the spatial and temporal domains. This further results in our framework being highly robust to degradation in input frames and yields state-of-the-art results on downstream tasks such as denoising, object removal, and frame interpolation. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluations on standard video datasets such as DAVIS, UCF-101, and VIMEO90K-T.
