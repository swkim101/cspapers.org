This paper investigates the nature of the design pro- cess for parallel operating systems. It proposes a tem- poral logic-based formal methodology addressing the high-level design of such systems. In operating sys- tems design much use is made of the informal notion of resource bindings. A way of improving the high- level design of parallel systems is proposed by provid- ing a formal language for enumerating the design space and thus enabling all high-level design alternatives to be represented. A design process to be used with this language is given, the aim being to establish the most appropriate binding. The process is temporal logic- based and permits high-level design of parallel systems to be analysed, tested and, in certain cases, formally verified before implementation is embarked upon.
