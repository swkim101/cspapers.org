It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Scrutinizing Agile Practices or Shoot-Out at the Agile Corral workshop. The agile software development movement brings both new energy and new hype to the software methods discussion. The mission of the workshop is identifying what is established knowledge, what is dubious knowledge, where research could potentially help validate or invalidate some of the agile practices, and some strategies to get there. 
 
The call for papers attracted 13 submissions from Asia, North America, South America, Europe and the Middle East. The program committee accepted 8 papers that cover a variety of topics, including deconstructing and characterizing the agile process, calculating business value, improving communications, a case study of failure, and a behavioural study of pair programming. We hope that these proceedings will spark thoughtful debate.
