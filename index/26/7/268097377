Hardware execution attacks exploit subtle microarchitectural interactions to leak secret data. While checking programs for the existence of such attacks is essential, verification of software against the full hardware implementation does not scale. Verification using abstract formal models of the hardware can help provide strong security guarantees while leveraging abstraction to achieve scalability. However, handwriting accurate abstract models is tedious and error-prone. Hence, we need techniques to generate models that enable sound yet scalable security analysis automatically. In this work, we propose micro-update models as a modelling framework that enables sound and abstract modelling of microarchitectural features. We also develop algorithms to generate micro-update models from RTL semi-automatically. We implement our modelling and generation framework in a prototype tool called PAUL. We evaluate our approach by synthesizing micro-update models for the Sodor5Stage processor and components from the cva6 (Ariane) processor. We demonstrate how these models can be generated hierarchically, thus increasing scalability to larger designs. We observe up to 8Ã— improvement in run time when performing analysis with the generated models as compared to the source RTL.
