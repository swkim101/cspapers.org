It is a common practice for designers to create digital prototypes from a mock-up/screenshot. Reverse engineering graphic design by detecting its components (e.g., text, icon, button) helps expedite this process. This paper first conducts a statistical analysis to emphasize the importance of relations in graphic layouts, which further motivates us to incorporate relation modeling into component detection. Built on the current state-of-the-art DETR (DEtection TRansformer), we introduce a learnable relation matrix to model class correlations. Specifically, the matrix will be added in the DETR decoder to update the query-to-query self-attention. Experiment results on three public datasets show that our approach achieves better performance than several strong baselines. We further visualize the learnt relation matrix and observe some reasonable patterns. Moreover, we show an application of component detection where we leverage the detection outputs as augmented training data for layout generation, which achieves promising results.
