Programming nowadays has become an important tool in various scientific fields, not only in terms of software engineering but also for knowledge acquisition. In this regard, we analyze epistemic programming as an interdisciplinary, cognitive perspective on programming, enabling programmers to gain insights into individual interests. As a first step towards implementing epistemic programming in computing education, we assess, whether novice programmers can utilize epistemic programming as a means of gaining insights and exploring their interests with the help of a worked example. Therefore, we report on findings from a study, analyzing eye-tracking data, screen recordings, and transcripts from retrospective think-aloud interviews. The results indicate that the participants were able to engage in a data-driven epistemic programming process and to gain individual insights. They used the given worked example - especially at the beginning of the process - by adopting code and then adapting it according to their interests, following different approaches. The study thus provides some first indications that engaging in epistemic programming with the support of worked examples can serve as a way of individualized knowledge acquisition - also for programming novices - and thus illustrates a new perspective on computing education for all.
