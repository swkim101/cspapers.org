Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchanges are two-sided marketplaces, similar to eBay, where individuals can offer to sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for payment. Due to disintermediation, these marketplaces trade off increased privacy for higher risk (e.g., scams/fraud). Although these marketplaces use feedback systems to encourage healthier transactions, anecdotal evidence suggests that feedback often fails to capture vendor-associated risks. This work documents the online safety of cryptocurrency P2P marketplaces, identifies underlying issues in feedback-based reputation systems, and proposes improved mechanisms for predicting/monitoring risky accounts. We collect data from two cryptocurrency marketplaces, Paxful and LocalCoinSwap (LCS) for 12 months (06/2022--06/2023). The data includes over 396,000 listings, 67,000 vendors, and 4.7 million feedback for Paxful; and about 52,000 listings, 14,000 users, and 146,000 feedback for LCS.First, we show that the current feedback system does not sufficiently convey enough information about risky vendors, and is susceptible to reputation manipulation through user collusion and automation. Second, combining various publicly available information, we build machine learning models to predict account suspension, and achieve a 0.86 F1-score and 0.93 AUC for Paxful. Third, while our models appear to have limited transferability across markets, we identify which features most help account suspension across platforms. Finally, we perform a month-long online evaluation to show that our models are significantly more successful than mere feedback-based reputation schemes at predicting which users will be suspended in the future.
