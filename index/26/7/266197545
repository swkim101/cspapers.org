Humanoids operate in repeated contact and non-contact with their environment and so the motion of humanoids such as walking on uneven terrain or in a narrow space requires the accurate force and position control. Joint torque control systems are suitable for position and force control, but are prone to friction and other modeling errors. To solve this problem, methods have been proposed to realize torque control in combination with joint position control systems or by improving joint structures such as sensors and actuators, but these methods have problems such as response delay and increased weight and volume. Thus, it is difficult to achieve motion of life-sized humanoids by whole-body torque control. In this paper, we solve challenges not with one specific layer, but rather with multiple layers that complement each other. We propose a hierarchical whole-body torque control method using four layers: friction compensation based on a vibration-suppressed model, whole-body resolved acceleration control using priority, center-of-gravity acceleration control based on foot-guided control, and landing position time modification based on capture point. We verify through walking experiments that the proposed methods can control the life-sized humanoid robot driven by high-reduction ratio joints by whole-body torque control without a torque sensor or joint position control, and that it enables the robot to move and even transport an object on outdoor uneven terrain.
