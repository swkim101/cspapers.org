Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by irregular electrical discharges called seizures, which affects approximately 50 million individuals worldwide. Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a vital role in identifying and monitoring the brain activity of epilepsy patients. Deep learning seizure prediction techniques, such as CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM, have been proposed to enhance seizure prediction accuracy. Recent research has proposed a new method for predicting seizures in EEG signals using the Discrete Wavelet Transform and a CNN-Transformers classifier. The method derives time-frequency domain feature sets using EEG signals that have been preprocessed to generate Daubechies-4 wavelets. Combining the strengths of CNN1D and Transformers, the CNN-Transformers classifier is employed to classify standard EEG data. The proposed method is computationally efficient, storage-friendly, and suitable for real-time seizure detection. On the BONN dataset, it achieved impressive results: 99.72% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 99.82% specificity, 0.998 AUC, and 0.012 FPR in just 24 epochs. Training occurred in the 46.64 to 50.72 seconds range on an RTX 3050 GPU.
