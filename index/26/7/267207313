There have been many studies on understanding data visualizations regarding general users. However, we have a limited understanding of how people with ADHD comprehend data visualizations and how it might be different from the general users. To understand accessible data visualization for people with ADHD, we conducted a crowd-sourced survey involving 70 participants with ADHD and 77 participants without ADHD. Specifically, we tested the chart components of color, text amount, and use of visual embellishments/pictographs, finding that some of these components and ADHD affected participantsâ€™ response times and accuracy. We outlined the neurological traits of ADHD and discussed specific findings on accessible data visualizations for people with ADHD. We found that various chart embellishment types affected accuracy and response times for those with ADHD differently depending on the types of questions. Based on these results, we suggest visual design recommendations to make accessible data visualizations for people with ADHD.
