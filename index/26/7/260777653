Modern software is continuously patched to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities. Patching is particularly important in robotic vehicles (RVs), in which safety and security bugs can cause severe physical damages. However, existing automated methods struggle to identify faulty patches in RVs, due to their inability to systematically determine patch-introduced behavioral modifications, which affect how the RV interacts with the physical environment. In this paper, we introduce P ATCH V ERIF , an automated patch analysis framework. P ATCH V ERIF â€™s goal is to evaluate whether a given patch introduces bugs in the patched RV control software. To this aim, P ATCH V ERIF uses a combination of static and dynamic analysis to measure how the analyzed patch affects the physical state of an RV. Specifically, P ATCH V ERIF uses a dedicated input mutation algorithm to generate RV inputs that maximize the behavioral differences (in the physical space) between the original code and the patched one. Using the collected information about patch-introduced behavioral modifications, P ATCH V ERIF employs support vector machines (SVMs) to infer whether a patch is faulty or correct. We evaluated P ATCH V ERIF on two popular RV control software (ArduPilot and PX4), and it successfully identified faulty patches with an average precision and recall of 97 . 9% and 92 . 1%, respectively. Moreover, P ATCH V ERIF discovered 115 previously unknown bugs, 103 of which have been acknowledged, and 51 of them have already been fixed.
