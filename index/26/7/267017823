Partially annotated images are easy to obtain in multi-label classification. However, unknown labels in partially annotated images exacerbate the positive-negative imbalance inherent in multi-label classification, which affects supervised learning of known labels. Most current methods require sufficient image annotations, and do not focus on the imbalance of the labels in the supervised training phase. In this paper, we propose saliency regularization (SR) for a novel self-training framework. In particular, we model saliency on the class-specific maps, and strengthen the saliency of object regions corresponding to the present labels. Besides, we introduce consistency regularization to mine unlabeled information to complement unknown labels with the help of SR. It is verified to alleviate the negative dominance caused by the imbalance, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC 2007, MS-COCO, VG-200, and OpenImages V3.
