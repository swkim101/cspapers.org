The artifact evaluation process is designed to validate the repeatability and usability of the results presented in the research paper "Evading Provenance-Based ML Detectors with Adversarial System Actions." The paper introduces P ROV N-INJA , a novel framework designed to discover adversarial samples, also known as gadgets, specifically tailored for path-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Graph Neural Network-based IDS. The primary objective of P ROV N INJA is to identify actions that can successfully evade state-of-the-art IDSs. The evaluation process comprises two main components: training and testing the IDS and generating adversarial examples to evade the IDSs. As a valuable resource, the authors provide a GitHub link that grants access to the source code, data, and scripts necessary for reproducing the results described in the paper. By offering these artifacts, the researchers enable fellow researchers and practitioners to replicate and build upon their work in provenance-based ML detectors. The artifacts include comprehensive software, data, and scripts employed to generate the findings presented in the paper. The accessibility of the GitHub repository ensures transparency. It fosters collaboration among researchers, facilitating advancements in the domain of provenance-based ML detectors and contributing to the overall improvement of security systems.
