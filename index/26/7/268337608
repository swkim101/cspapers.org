To promote knowledge and interest in computer science (CS) among historically marginalized racial and gender groups, a three-and-a-half-week CS summer camp was developed using a culturally relevant pedagogical framework. This program encompassed hands-on instruction utilizing MIT App Inventor, collaborative projects in mobile app design, and various mentoring sessions. A cohort of 42 minority students who are predominantly Black received tailored guidance based on dynamic assessment informed scaffolding. The analysis of surveys, individual interviews, classroom observations, and focus group interviews revealed a positive impact of the program. Participants not only exhibited increased confidence in block-based coding but also displayed increased interest in STEM careers and a broader understanding of the CS field. Despite these positive outcomes, the influence on CS career aspirations appeared to be limited. Although the program helped participants explore various CS career options, their initial career aspirations remained unchanged, indicating a need for an extended period to observe lasting effects.
