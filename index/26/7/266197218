This paper proposes a new locomotion algorithm for truss robots on irregular terrain, in particular, for the Variable Topology Truss (VTT) system. The previous Polygon-based Random Tree (PRT) search algorithm for support polygon generation is extended to irregular terrain while considering friction and internal force limitations. By characterizing terrain, unreachable areas are excluded from search to increase efficiency. A one-step rolling motion primitive is generated based on the kinematics, statics, and constraints of VTT. The locomotion planning is completed by transforming and connecting multiple motion primitives with respect to the desired support polygons. The algorithm's performance is verified by conducting simulations in multiple types of environments.
