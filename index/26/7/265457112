Stylized text-to-image generation focuses on creating images from textual descriptions while adhering to a style specified by a few reference images. However, subtle style variations within different reference images can hinder the model from accurately learning the target style. In this paper, we propose InstaStyle, a novel approach that excels in generating high-fidelity stylized images with only a single reference image. Our approach is based on the finding that the inversion noise from a stylized reference image inherently carries the style signal, as evidenced by their non-zero signal-to-noise ratio. We employ DDIM inversion to extract this noise from the reference image and leverage a diffusion model to generate new stylized images from the"style"noise. Additionally, the inherent ambiguity and bias of textual prompts impede the precise conveying of style. To address this, we introduce a learnable style token via prompt refinement, which enhances the accuracy of the style description for the reference image. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that InstaStyle achieves superior performance compared to current benchmarks. Furthermore, our approach also showcases its capability in the creative task of style combination with mixed inversion noise.
