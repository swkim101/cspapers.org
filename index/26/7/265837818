It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems --SEAMS 2008- workshop. This year's workshop continues the tradition of SEAMS 2006 and SEAMS 2007 of being the premier forum for presenting new research results and experience reports, discussing challenges and establishing research collaborations in the area of software engineering for self-adaptive and self-managing systems. 
 
The call for papers attracted 31 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe, Australia, and the United States. The program committee accepted 17 high quality papers that cover a variety of topics, including requirements, architecture, design, implementation and quality assurance for adaptive and self-managing systems. In addition, the program includes roundtables and keynote speakers on a variety of topics related to engineering adaptive and self-managing systems. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers working in those areas. 
 
We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought-provoking and that the workshop will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.
