We will briefly describe the role of entity centered structure (ECS) of sentences in natural language inferencing. The basic structure of sentences in discourse, generally singles out an entity, to be called center, among all those which are the arguments of the main predicate. ECS makes n-ary predicates look like monadic by temporarily masking their structure, thereby affecting the relative ease with which certain inferences are made and information is retrieved. This short paper deals with a preliminary formulation of a system designed to capture these ideas and contains several examples of how some natural language inferences can be represented in the system. Formal properties of the system are under investigation.
