Neural networks have been called “more important than the atomic bomb” and have received a major funding commitment from DARPA. Nevertheless, it is difficult to find even a mention of neural network concepts and applications in many computer science or information systems curricula. In fact, few computer science or information systems faculty are aware of the profound implications of neurocomputing on the future of their field. This paper contends that neural networks must be a significant part of any artificial intelligence course. It illustrates how neural network concepts can be integrated into traditional artificial intelligence course material. Two programming packages for simulating neural networks on personal computers are recommended.
