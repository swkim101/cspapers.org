Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have gained considerable attention for their high-quality results in 3D scene reconstruction and rendering. Recently, there have been active studies on various tasks such as novel view synthesis and scene editing. However, editing NeRFs is challenging as accurately decomposing the desired area of 3D space and ensuring the consistency of edited results from different angles is difficult. In this paper, we propose ICE-NeRF, an Interactive Color Editing framework that performs color editing by taking a pre-trained NeRF and a rough user mask as input. Our proposed method performs the entire color editing process in only under a minute using a partial fine-tuning approach. To perform effective color editing, we address two issues: (1) the entanglement of the implicit representation that causes unwanted color changes in undesired areas when learning weights, and (2) the loss of multi-view consistency when fine-tuning for a single or a few views. To address these issues, we introduce two techniques: Activation Field-based Regularization (AFR) and Single-mask Multi-view Rendering (SMR). The AFR performs weight regularization during fine-tuning based on the assumption that not all weights have an equal impact on the desired area. The SMR maps the 2D mask to 3D space through inverse projection and renders it from other views to generate multi-view masks. ICE-NeRF not only enables well-decomposed, multi-view consistent color editing but also significantly reduces processing time compared to existing methods.
