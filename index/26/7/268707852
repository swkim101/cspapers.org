One of the most crucial capabilities in the commercial sector is a personalized prediction of a customer's next purchase. We present a novel method of creating a commerce intelligence engine that caters to multiple merchants intended for the UB Platform, managed by e-payment company Harex InfoTech. To cultivate this intelligence, we utilized payment receipt data and created a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based commerce model using a Transformer to accommodate multinational and merchant trade. Our model, called General Commerce Intelligence (GCI), provides a range of services for merchants, including product recommendations, product brainstorming, product bundling, event promotions, collaborative marketing, target marketing, and demand fore-casting etc. To bolster user privacy and foster sustainable business collaboration, especially among micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), the GCI model was trained through federated learning, especially with glocalization. This study delves into the structure, development, and assessment of GCI, showcasing its transformative capacity to implement User Centric AI and re-shape the global commerce landscape to benefit MSMEs.
