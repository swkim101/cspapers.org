Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in language-related tasks, but their deployment poses significant challenges due to substantial memory and storage requirements. Weight-only quantization has emerged as a promising solution, significantly reducing memory and storage needs without sacrificing too much performance. In this study, we introduce SignRound, a method that leverages signed gradient descent (SignSGD) to optimize rounding values and weight clipping in just 200 steps. SignRound integrates the advantages of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), delivering exceptional results across 2 to 4 bits while minimizing tuning costs and avoiding additional inference overhead. For example, SignRound achieved absolute average accuracy improvements ranging from 6.91% to 33.22% at 2bits, as measured by the average zero-shot accuracy across 11 tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalization in recent models, achieving near-lossless 4-bit quantization in most scenarios. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/intel/auto-round.
