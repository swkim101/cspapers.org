An efficient and effective decoding mechanism is crucial in medical image segmentation, especially in scenarios with limited computational resources. However, these decoding mechanisms usually come with high computational costs. To address this concern, we introduce EMCAD, a new efficient multi-scale convolutional attention decoder, designed to optimize both performance and computational efficiency. EMCAD leverages a unique multi-scale depth-wise convolution block, significantly enhancing feature maps through multi-scale convolutions. EMCAD also employs channel, spatial, and grouped (large-kernel) gated attention mechanisms, which are highly effective at capturing intricate spatial relationships while focusing on salient regions. By employing group and depth-wise convolution, EMCAD is very efficient and scales well (e.g., only 1.91M parameters and 0.381G FLOPs are needed when using a standard encoder). Our rigorous evaluations across 12 datasets that belong to six medical image segmentation tasks reveal that EMCAD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 79.4% and 80.3% reduction in #Params and #FLOPs, respectively. Moreover, EMCAD's adaptability to different encoders and versatility across segmentation tasks further establish EMCAD as a promising tool, advancing the field towards more efficient and accurate medical image analysis.
