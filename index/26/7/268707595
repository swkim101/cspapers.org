My thesis focuses on the integration of serverless computing with Peer to Peer (P2P) architectures in distributed Machine Learning (ML). This research aims to harness the decentralized, resilient nature of P2P systems, combined with the scalability and automation of serverless platforms. We explore using databases not just for communication but also for in-database model updates and gradient averaging, addressing the challenges of statelessness in serverless environments.
