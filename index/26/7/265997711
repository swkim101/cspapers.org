2D top-down maps are commonly used for the navigation and exploration of mobile robots through unknown areas. Typically, the robot builds the navigation maps incrementally from local observations using onboard sensors. Recent works have shown that predicting the structural patterns in the environment through learning-based approaches can greatly enhance task efficiency. While many such works build task-specific networks using limited datasets, we show that the existing foundational vision networks can accomplish the same without any fine-tuning. Specifically, we use Masked Autoencoders, pre-trained on street images, to present novel applications for field-of-view expansion, single-agent topological exploration, and multi-agent exploration for indoor mapping, across different input modalities. Our work motivates the use of foundational vision models for generalized structure prediction-driven applications, especially in the dearth of training data.
