Graph Signal Processing (GSP) has proven to be a highly effective and efficient tool for predicting user future interactions in recommender systems. However, current GSP methods recognize user interaction patterns based on the interactions of all users, so that the recognized interaction patterns are not fully user-matched and easily impacted by other users with different interaction behaviors, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation performance. To this end, we propose a hierarchical graph signal processing method (HiGSP) for collaborative filtering, which consists of two key modules: 1) the cluster-wise filter module that recognizes user unique interaction patterns merely from interactions of users with similar preferences, making the recognized patterns able to reflect user preference without being influenced by other users with different interaction behaviors, and 2) the globally-aware filter module that serves as a complementary to the cluster-wise filter module to recognize user general interaction patterns more effectively from all user interactions. By linearly combining these two modules, HiGSP can recognize user-matched interaction patterns, so as to model user preference and predict user future interactions more accurately. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HiGSP compared to other GCN-based and GSP-based recommendation methods in terms of efficacy and efficiency.
