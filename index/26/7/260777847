This artifact is applying for an Artifacts Available badge, an Artifacts Functional badge, and an Results Reproduced badge. The artifact primarily consists of two parts: the source code of KLAUS, and the Docker runtime environment for KLAUS. These components encompass the specific implementation of the designs in our paper, and also offer a very user-friendly and convenient mode of operation. KLAUS is a framework for verifying the correctness of Linux kernel patches, mainly composed of a static analysis part (identifying AWRPs as proposed in our paper) and a dynamic fuzz testing part (Fuzzing). Firstly, our open-source source code includes the source code for static analysis, the source code for automatic instrumentation, and the source code for the fuzzer. These source codes have good extensibility and will be beneficial for other researchers to conduct more in-depth research improvements or extensions. Subsequently, we encapsulate the entire KLAUS framework in a Docker image, for the convenience of all researchers and users. In this Appendix, we will provide the necessary explanations and some screenshots to facilitate the evaluation of our academic achievements.
