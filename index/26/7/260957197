Data is pooled across entities (individuals or enterprises) to create machine learning models, and sometimes, the entities that contribute the data also beneﬁt from the models. Consider for instance a recommender system (e.g. Spotify, Insta-gram or YouTube), a health care app that predicts the risk for some disease, or a service built by pooling data across enterprises. In this work we propose a framework to study this value exchange, i.e., we model and measure contributions ( outﬂows ), beneﬁts ( inﬂows ) and the balance between contributions and beneﬁts (the degree of reciprocity ). We show theoretically, and via experiments that under certain distributional assumptions, some classes of models are approximately reciprocal. These results only scratch the surface; we conclude with several open directions.
