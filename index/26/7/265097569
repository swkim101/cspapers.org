We show that feature logic extended by functional uncertainty is decidable, even if one admits cyclic descriptions. We present an algorithm, which solves feature descriptions containing functional uncertainty in two phases, both phases using a set of deterministic and non-deterministic rewrite rules. We then compare our algorithm with the one of Kaplan and Maxwell, that does not cover cyclic feature descriptions.
