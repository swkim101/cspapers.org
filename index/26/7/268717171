The generation of logically coherent dialogues by humans relies on underlying cognitive abilities. Based on this, we redefine the dialogue coherence evaluation process, combining cognitive judgment with the basic text to achieve a more human-like evaluation. We propose a novel dialogue evaluation framework based on Dialogue Cognition Graph (DCGEval) to implement the fusion by in-depth interaction between cognition modeling and text modeling. The proposed Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) based graph structure called DCG aims to uniformly model four dialogue cognitive abilities. Specifically, core-semantic cognition is modeled by converting the utterance into an AMR graph, which can extract essential semantic information without redundancy. The temporal and role cognition are modeled by establishing logical relationships among the different AMR graphs. Finally, the commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet is fused to express commonsense cognition. Experiments demonstrate the necessity of modeling human cognition for
dialogue evaluation, and our DCGEval presents stronger correlations with human judgments compared to other state-of-the-art evaluation metrics.
