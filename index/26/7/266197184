The advantages of cable-driven exoskeleton robots with series elastic actuators can be summarized in twofold: 1) the inertia of the robot joint is relatively low, which is more friendly for human-robot interaction; 2) the elastic element is tolerant to impacts and hence provides structural safety. As trade-offs, the overall dynamic model of such a system is of high order and subject to both unmodelled disturbances (due to the cable-driven mechanism) and external torques (due to the human-robot interaction), opening up challenges for the controller development. This paper proposes a new trajectory-tracking control scheme for cable-driven upper-limb exoskeleton robots with series elastic actuators. The control objectives are achieved in two stages: Stage I is to approximate then compensate for unmodelled disturbances with iterative learning techniques; Stage II is to employ a suboptimal model predictive controller to drive the robot to track the desired trajectory. While controlling such a robot is not trivial, the proposed control scheme exhibits the advantages of force-sensorlessness, high accuracy, and low complexity compared with other methods in the real-world experiments.
