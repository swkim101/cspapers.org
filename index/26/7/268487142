The future of the computer science field is dependent on recruiting computer science educators from all demographics and backgrounds. Pre-service programs that emphasize issues of equity and justice have the potential to broaden participation in CS teacher education programs. In response to calls for a more critical CS education in teacher education programs, many universities' CS teacher education programs now emphasize discussions of the societal impact of technology and encourage students to critically interrogate computer science as they learn to program. This study examined the learning trajectories of seven pre-service teachers enrolled in a Critically Conscious Computer Science teaching licensure program by inductively coding their responses to weekly reflections as well as lesson and unit plans. Novel to this approach was a focus on intermediary moments throughout the course rather than solely final course outcomes. Findings showed that critically conscious computing curricula encouraged teachers to wrestle with the tension of computer science as a powerful force in society. Teachers engaged in thinking expansively about what computer science can look like in their schools by considering multidisciplinary integrations, especially with elementary school teachers. This study shows the nuanced development and learning trajectories of pre-service computer science teachers and demonstrates the need to better understand how teachers engage with and apply discussions of social justice and computer science to their pedagogical practice.
