Phase variable control based on global tibia kinematics holds promise for predicting gait cycle progression to continuously control robotic transtibial prostheses. Calibration of the phase variable is critical to ensure its monotonic behavior, to approach a linear relationship with gait percentage, and to accurately predict the percentage of gait. This paper compares four calibration approaches using data from 22 able-bodied subjects walking at 14 speeds [1]. The typical pure centering (PC) approach employed for thigh-based phase variables is not viable, yielding monotonic phase progression in fewer than half of the cases. An optimization (OPT) approach found monotonic calibrations in 305/308 cases with high linearity (average R2 of 0.91). Critical point centering (CPC) approximates the OPT performance, with 274/308 monotonic calibrations and an average R2 of 0.85, whereas the related vertical weighted average (VWA) approach was only slightly better than PC. All four approaches are similarly accurate in predicting gait percentage, staying within 5% at least 92.7% of the time.
