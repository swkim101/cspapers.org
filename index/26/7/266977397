Smooth and safe speed planning is imperative for the successful deployment of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a mathematical formulation for the optimal speed planning of autonomous driving, which has been validated in high-fidelity simulations and real-road demonstrations with practical constraints. The algorithm explores the inter-traffic gaps in the time and space domain using a breadth-first search. For each gap, quadratic programming finds an optimal speed profile, synchronizing the time and space pair along with dynamic obstacles. Qualitative and quantitative analysis in Carla is reported to discuss the smoothness and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we present a road demonstration result for urban city driving.
