Maximum entropy (Maxent) is useful in many areas. Iterative scaling (IS) methods are one of the most popular approaches to solve Maxent. With many variants of IS methods, it is difficult to understand them and see the differences. In this paper, we create a general and unified framework for IS methods. This framework also connects IS and coordinate descent (CD) methods. Besides, we develop a CD method for Maxent. Results show that it is faster than existing iterative scaling methods.
