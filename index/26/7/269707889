Network embedding plays an important role in a variety of social network applications. Existing network embedding methods, explicitly or implicitly, can be categorized into positional embedding (PE) methods or structural embedding (SE) methods. Specifically, PE methods encode the positional information and obtain similar embeddings for adjacent/close nodes, while SE methods aim to learn identical representations for nodes with the same local structural patterns, even if the two nodes are far away from each other. The disparate designs of the two types of methods lead to an apparent dilemma in that no embedding could perfectly capture both positional and structural information. In this paper, we seek to demystify the underlying relationship between positional embedding and structural embedding. We first point out that the positional embedding can produce the structural embedding with simple transformations, while the opposite direction cannot hold. Based on this finding, a novel network embedding model PACER is proposed, which optimizes the positional embedding with the help of random walk with restart (RWR) proximity distribution, and such positional embedding is then used to seamlessly obtain the structural embedding with simple transformations. Furthermore, two variants of PACER are proposed to handle node classification task on homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Extensive experiments on 17 datasets show that PACER achieves comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-arts.
