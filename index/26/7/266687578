Sampling in discrete spaces, with critical applications in simulation and opti-1 mization, has recently been boosted by significant advances in gradient-based 2 approaches that exploit modern accelerators like GPUs. However, two key chal-3 lenges hinder the further research progress in discrete sampling. First, since there 4 is no consensus on experimental settings, the empirical results in different research 5 papers are often not comparable. Secondly, implementing samplers and target 6 distributions often requires a nontrivial amount of effort in terms of calibration, 7 parallelism, and evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we propose DISCS (DIS-8 Crete Sampling), a tailored package and benchmark that supports unified and 9 efficient implementation and evaluations for discrete sampling in three types of 10 tasks: sampling for classical graphical models, combinatorial optimization, and 11 energy based generative models. Throughout the comprehensive evaluations in 12 DISCS , we acquired new insights into scalability, design principles for proposal 13 distributions, and lessons for adaptive sampling design. DISCS implements rep-14 resentative discrete samplers in existing research works as baselines, and offers a 15 simple interface that researchers can conveniently design new discrete samplers 16 and compare with baselines in a calibrated setup directly. 17
