This proposal introduces an innovative AI-powered learning system designed to address educational disparities worldwide. Focused on developing countries, the system seamlessly translates educational content between English and native languages, breaking down language barriers. Leveraging advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, including transformer models like BERT and GPT-3, the system ensures inclusivity, effectiveness, and engagement.

Built on prior research demonstrating AI's efficacy in language translation and personalized learning, the proposed system draws inspiration from successful projects like Duolingo Language Incubator. By providing inclusive and accessible learning experiences, it empowers individuals to overcome language barriers, fostering global participation.

The potential impact is significant, with the system poised to accelerate learning, enhance literacy rates, and create a more skilled workforce in developing countries. This research reflects a commitment to revolutionize education through technology, aiming for lasting and transformative contributions to global society. Through AI-driven education, a brighter, more inclusive future is envisioned.
