This study examines the leadership structure of an extracurricular robotics team where students from four high schools manage the team's work. Using a qualitative survey tool, it explores the differing role of mentors in student-led teams and investigates the impact of a student mentor model on team success, challenges faced, and skills learned. Preliminary findings indicate that the mentors for this student-led team play a key role in decision making; however, they use a hands-off style to steer students and their leads in the right direction. The study provides insights into how students perceive the role of team mentors and the actual role played by these mentors. A distinguishing feature of this study is the participation of four student members of this team in the design and implementation of this study.
