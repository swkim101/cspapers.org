Algorand has recently grown rapidly as a representative of the new generation of pure-proof-of-stake (PPoS) blockchains. At the same time, Algorand has also attracted more and more users to use it as a trading platform for non-fungible tokens. However, similar to traditional programs, the incorrect way of programming will lead to critical security vulnerabilities in Algorand smart contracts. In this paper, we ﬁrst analyze the semantics of Algorand smart contracts and ﬁnd 9 types of generic vulnerabilities. Next, we propose Panda , the ﬁrst extensible static analysis framework that can automatically detect such vulnerabilities in Algorand smart contracts, and formally deﬁne the vulnerability detection rules. We also construct the ﬁrst benchmark dataset to evaluate Panda . Finally, we used Panda to conduct a vulnerability assessment on all smart contracts on the Algorand blockchain and found 80,515 (10.38%) vulnerable smart signatures and 150,676 (27.73%) vulnerable applications. Of the vulnerable applications, 4,008 (4.04%) are still on the blockchain and have not been deleted.
