A major problem with teaching real-time software development to undergraduate students is finding suitable equipment for assignments and projects. Such equipment must provide problems that are exciting, challenging, cover a broad range of real-time topics, and yet have solutions that can be completed within the time constraints of the semester. This paper describes a successful laboratory for an undergraduate course in real-time software development based on a computer controlled model railroad.
