Personalized recommendation stands as a ubiquitous channel for users to explore information or items aligned with their interests. Nevertheless, prevailing recommendation models predominantly rely on unique IDs and categorical features for user-item matching. While this ID-centric approach has witnessed considerable success, it falls short in comprehensively grasping the essence of raw item contents across diverse modalities, such as text, image, audio, and video. This underutilization of multimodal data poses a limitation to recommender systems, particularly in the realm of multimedia services like news, music, and short-video platforms. The recent surge in pretraining and generation techniques presents both opportunities and challenges in the development of multimodal recommender systems. This tutorial seeks to provide a thorough exploration of the latest advancements and future trajectories in multimodal pretraining and generation techniques within the realm of recommender systems. The tutorial comprises four talks, addressing multimodal pretraining, multimodal fusion, multimodal generation, and presenting successful stories alongside open challenges in the field of recommendation. Our target audience encompasses scholars, practitioners, and other parties interested in this domain. By providing a succinct overview of the field, we aspire to facilitate a swift understanding of multimodal recommendation and foster meaningful discussions on the future development of this evolving landscape.
