Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize both known and novel categories in an unlabeled dataset by leveraging another labeled dataset with only known categories. Without considering knowledge transfer from known to novel categories, current methods usually perform poorly on novel categories due to the lack of corresponding supervision. To mitigate this issue, we propose a unified Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN), which solves two obstacles to knowledge transfer in GCD. First, the mixture of known and novel categories in unlabeled data makes it difficult to identify transfer candidates (i.e., samples with novel categories). For this, we propose an entropy-based method that leverages knowledge in the pre-trained classifier to differentiate known and novel categories without requiring extra data or parameters. Second, the lack of prior knowledge of novel categories presents challenges in quantifying semantic relationships between categories to decide the transfer weights. For this, we model different categories with prototypes and treat their similarities as transfer weights to measure the semantic similarities between categories. On the basis of two treatments, we transfer knowledge from known to novel categories by conducting pre-adjustment of logits and post-adjustment of labels for transfer candidates based on the transfer weights between different categories. With the weighted adjustment, KTN can generate more accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, which helps to learn more discriminative features and boost model performance on novel categories. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on all evaluation metrics across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, different from previous clustering-based methods that can only work offline with abundant data, KTN can be deployed online conveniently with faster inference speed.
