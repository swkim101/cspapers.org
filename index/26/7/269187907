Deep neural networks for classification are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations to input samples lead to incorrect predictions. This susceptibility, combined with the black-box nature of such networks, limits their adoption in critical applications like autonomous driving. Feature-attribution-based explanation methods provide relevance of input features for model predictions on input samples, thus explaining model decisions. However, we observe that both model predictions and feature attributions for input samples are sensitive to noise. We develop a practical method for this characteristic of model prediction and feature attribution to detect adversarial samples. Our method, PASA, requires the computation of two test statistics using model prediction and feature attribution and can reliably detect adversarial samples using thresholds learned from benign samples. We validate our lightweight approach by evaluating the performance of PASA on varying strengths of FGSM, PGD, BIM, and CW attacks on multiple image and non-image datasets. On average, we outperform state-of-the-art statistical unsupervised adversarial detectors on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet by 14% and 35% ROC-AUC scores, respectively. Moreover, our approach demonstrates competitive performance even when an adversary is aware of the defense mechanism.
