Imagine a simulated world where the characters you interact with are almost human - they converse with you in English, they understand the world they are in, can reason about what to do, and they exhibit emotions. Some of these characters may be your friends, while others will oppose you. Unlike current video garnes, being successful in this world won't just be a matter of who is quickest on the draw or most adroit at solving puzzles, instead it will be the person who understands the social fabric and cultural context and can use interpersonal skills most effectively. Such a simulation could open up whole new horizons for education, entertainment and simulation. And, given recent advances in AI and graphics, it may not be too far off. 
 
Virtual humans are computer-generated characters that can take the part of humans in a variety of limited contexts. These can include acting as role-players in simulations and training systems (Johnson, Rickel & Lester 2000; Swartout et al. 2005: Traum et al. 2005; Johnson, Vilhjalmsson & Marsella 2005), where they play a variety of parts, such as acting as friendly or hostile forces, or locals in the environment. Other uses for virtual humans include acting as museum guides (Gustafson & Bell 2000), marketing assistants (Cassell, Bickmore et al. 2000) or characters in entertainment systems, where the advent of video games such as The Sims 2 makes clear the growing interest of the computer game industry in virtual humans (see also (Mateas & Stern 2003)).
