Collaboration between humans and robots is becoming increasingly crucial in our daily life. In order to accomplish efficient cooperation, trust recognition is vital, empowering robots to predict human behaviors and make trust-aware decisions. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a generalized approach to recognize human-robot trust. This study addresses this need by introducing an EEG-based method for trust recognition during human-robot cooperation. A human-robot cooperation game scenario is used to stimulate various human trust levels when working with robots. To enhance recognition performance, the study proposes an EEG Vision Transformer model coupled with a 3-D spatial representation to capture the spatial information of EEG, taking into account the topological relationship among electrodes. To validate this approach, a public EEG-based human trust dataset called EEGTrust is constructed. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving an accuracy of 74.99% in slice-wise cross-validation and 62.00% in trial-wise cross-validation. This outperforms baseline models in both recognition accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, an ablation study demonstrates a significant improvement in trust recognition performance of the spatial representation.
