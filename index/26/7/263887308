This poster presentation illustrates the use of SOM (the IBM System Object Model) for interfacing, different object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Our approach allows classes defined in one OOP language to be used by different (possibly non-OOP) languages—both for subclassing, and for object creation. This extends the utility of OOP class libraries and makes it possible to define “multilanguage” objects, whose supporting methods and instance variables are provided by different languages.
