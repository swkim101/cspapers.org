The Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) framework allows one to grab low-hanging fruit of machine learning techniques and data science, without either much expertise for this sophisticated sphere or provision of specific infrastructures. However, the requirement of revealing all training data to the service provider raises new concerns in terms of privacy leakage, storage consumption, efficiency, bandwidth, etc. In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving MLaaS framework by combining Compressive Sensing (CS) and Generative Networks. Itâ€™s constructed on the favorable facts observed in recent works that general inference tasks could be fulfilled with generative networks and classifier trained on compressed measurements, since the generator could model the data distribution and capture discriminative information which are useful for classification. To improve the performance of the MLaaS framework, the supervised generative models of the server are trained and optimized with prior knowledge provided by the client. In order to prevent the service provider from recovering the original data as well as identifying the queried results, a noise-addition mechanism is designed and adopted into the compressed data domain. Empirical results confirmed its performance superiority in accuracy and resource consumption against the state-of-the-art privacy preserving MLaaS frameworks.
