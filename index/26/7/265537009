Image degradation often occurs during fast camera or object movements, regardless of the exposure modes: global shutter (GS) or rolling shutter (RS). Since these two exposure modes give rise to intrinsically different degradations, two restoration threads have been explored separately, i.e. motion deblurring of GS images and distortion correction of RS images, both of which are challenging restoration tasks, especially in the presence of a single input image. In this paper, we explore a novel in-between exposure mode, called global reset release (GRR) shutter, which produces GS-like blur but with row-dependent blur magnitude. We take advantage of this unique characteristic of GRR to explore the latent frames within a single image and restore a clear counterpart by only relying on these latent contexts. Specifically, we propose a residual spatially-compensated and spectrally-enhanced Transformer (RSS-T) block for row-dependent deblurring of a single GRR image. Its hierarchical positional encoding compensates global positional context of windows and enables order-awareness of the local pixelâ€™s position, along with a novel feed-forward network that simultaneously uses spatial and spectral information for gaining mixed global context. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art GS deblurring and RS correction methods on single GRR input.
