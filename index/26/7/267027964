Implicit user feedback, user emotions and demographic information have shown to be promising sources for improving the accuracy and user engagement of responses generated by dialogue systems. However, the influence of such information on task completion and factual consistency, which are important criteria for task-oriented and document-grounded dialogues, is not yet known. To address this, we introduce FEDI, the first English task-oriented and document-grounded dialogue dataset annotated with this information. Our experiments with Flan-T5, GPT-2 and Llama 2 show a particularly positive impact on task completion and factual consistency. Participants in our human evaluation reported that the responses generated by the feedback-trained models were more informative (Flan-T5 and GPT-2), relevant and factual consistent (Llama 2).
