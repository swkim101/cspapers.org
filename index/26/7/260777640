RESTful APIs have become arguably the most prevalent end-point for accessing web services. Blackbox vulnerability scanners are a popular choice for detecting vulnerabilities in web services automatically. Unfortunately, they suffer from a number of limitations in RESTful API testing. Particularly, existing tools cannot effectively obtain the relations between API operations, and they lack the awareness of the correct sequence of API operations during testing. These drawbacks hinder the tools from requesting the API operations properly to detect potential vulnerabilities. To address this challenge, we propose N AUTILUS , which includes a novel speciÔ¨Åcation annotation strategy to uncover RESTful API vulnerabilities. The annotations encode the proper operation relations and parameter generation strategies for the RESTful service, which assist N AUTILUS to generate meaningful operation sequences and thus uncover vulnerabilities that require the execution of multiple API operations in the correct sequence. We experimentally compare N AUTILUS with four state-of-art vulnerability scanners and RESTful API testing tools on six RESTful services. Evaluation results demonstrate that N AUTILUS can successfully detect an average of 141% more vulnerabilities, and cover 104% more API operations. We also apply N AUTILUS to nine real-world RESTful services, and detected 23 unique 0-day vulnerabilities with 12 CVE
