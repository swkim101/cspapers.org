We present an approach for aligning a 3D deformable model to a single face image. The model consists of a set of sparse 3D points and the view-based patches associated with every point. Assuming a weak perspective projection model, our algorithm iteratively deforms the model and ad- justs the 3D pose to fit the image. As opposed to previous approaches, our algorithm starts the fitting without resort- ing to manual labeling of key facial points. And it makes no assumptions about global illumination or surface prop- erties, so it can be applied to a wide range of imaging con- ditions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively handle unseen faces with a variety of pose and illumination variations.
