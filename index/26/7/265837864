Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affect, i.e. the experience of feelings or emotions. Over the past decade, research has shown the impact of affective states on work performance and team collaboration. Personality, moods, and emotions play crucial roles in software engineering because it involves people in a broad range of activities. For successful software engineering projects, stakeholders need to experience positive affect (such as trust or appreciation), to agree on display rules for emotions, and to hold mutual commitment to project goals. Recently, researchers have started to study the role of affective computing and affective states in software engineering, but contributions to this area are presented and discussed in too many different conferences and workshops. This workshop follows up from the first edition held at ICSE 2016. Its goal is to consolidate research and create an international, sustainable forum for researchers and practitioners interested in the role of affect in software engineering to meet, present, and discuss their work-in-progress. High-quality contributions related to empirical studies, theoretical models, and tools for supporting emotion awareness in software engineering are invited to the workshop, both from academia and industry. Authors of distinguished papers will be invited to submit an extended version to a special issue on "Affect Awareness in Software Engineering" in the Journal of Systems and Software (Elsevier).
