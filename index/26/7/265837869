Welcome to CHASE 2008. We are delighted to present a selection of excellent papers all focusing on the cooperative and human side of software engineering. We received 34 submissions to the workshop, and accepted 28 for presentation. Reflecting the diversity of software engineering research, the 28 accepted papers ranged in topic from data to theory, requirements to testing, ethnography to experiments, and individuals to organizations. The diversity of the papers is interesting in that it shows how broadly the notion of the cooperative and human aspects of software engineering can be applied. As we experience this renaissance in the study of the human and cooperative aspects, we hope that more such research will be produced and integrated successfully into the software engineering discipline. An understanding and accounting for of both the technical and human aspects will be necessary to enhance and progress software engineering research. We look forward to beginning to meet this challenge at CHASE 2008.
