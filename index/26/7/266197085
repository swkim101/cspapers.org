Typical drones with multi rotors are generally less maneuverable due to unidirectional thrust, which may be unfavorable to agile flight in very narrow and confined spaces. This paper suggests a new bio-inspired drone that is empowered with high maneuverability in a lightweight and easy-to-carry way. The proposed flying squirrel inspired drone has controllable foldable wings to cover a wider range of flight attitudes and provide more maneuverable flight capability with stable tracking performance. The wings of a drone are fabricated with silicone membranes and sophisticatedly controlled by reinforcement learning based on human-demonstrated data. Specially, such learning based wing control serves to capture even the complex aerodynamics that are often impossible to model mathematically. It is shown through experiment that the proposed flying squirrel drone intentionally induces aerodynamic drag and hence provides the desired additional repulsive force even under saturated mechanical thrust. This work is very meaningful in demonstrating the potential of biomimicry and machine learning for realizing an animal-like agile drone.
