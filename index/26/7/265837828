Welcome to the Second International Workshop on Emerging Trends in Software Metrics (WETSoM 2011), held in Honolulu, Hawaii, as satellite workshop of the 33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2011). The workshop aims at gathering together researchers and practitioners to discuss the progress of software metrics. 
 
This year we received 26 papers by 70 unique authors from 14 countries. Every paper was reviewed by members of an international programme committee. We accepted 9 full papers (of 20 submitted) and 6 short papers (4 of the 6 submitted as short papers, and two long papers accepted as short papers). The program will feature technical sessions on (i) Software quality, (ii) Changes and defects, and (iii) challenges on software metrics, the latter followed by a working discussion on the topic. 
 
Last, but not least, we are honored to host a keynote by Professor Martin Shepperd, Brunel University, UK, on "Data Quality: Cinderella at the Software Metrics Ball". We would like to thank the authors and reviewers for their time and effort in providing a quality programme. Also, we would like to thank the ICSE 2011 organization for making this event possible, and the ICSE workshop chairs for proactively guiding us in the workshop organization process.
