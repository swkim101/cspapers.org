How do developers shape data protection regulations when they are passed from the policy arena to technical teams for compliance? This study explores data protection compliance work (DPCW) as a sociotechnical process mediated by developers’ attitudes and experiences. We draw on 14 semi-structured interviews with individuals responsible for GDPR and/or CCPA compliance to examine how developers approach DPCW and the resulting implications for user privacy. We highlight three key ways in which developers can shape compliance: by creatively interpreting ambiguous regulatory requirements; by exploiting expectations of technical expertise and low accountability; and by reducing DPCW to a one-time project. We conclude by discussing the implications for both researchers and practitioners and by recommending how to conceptualize and conduct DPCW otherwise. This article adds specificity to understanding why and how developers’ attitudes and experiences affect data protection regulations in the field.
