Tasks where the set of possible actions depend discontinuously on the state pose a significant challenge for current reinforcement learning algorithms. For example, a locked door must be first unlocked, and then the handle turned before the door can be opened. The sequential nature of these tasks makes obtaining final rewards difficult, and transferring information between task variants using continuous learned values such as weights rather than discrete symbols can be inefficient. Our key insight is that agents that act and think symbolically are often more effective in dealing with these tasks. We propose a memory-based learning approach that leverages the symbolic nature of constraints and temporal ordering of actions in these tasks to quickly acquire and transfer high-level information. We evaluate the performance of memory-based learning on both real and simulated tasks with approximately discontinuous constraints between states and actions, and show our method learns to solve these tasks an order of magnitude faster than both model-based and model-free deep reinforcement learning methods.
