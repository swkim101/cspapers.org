In human-robot collaboration, there has been a trade-off relationship between the speed of collaborative robots and the safety of human workers. In our previous paper, we introduced a time-optimal path tracking algorithm designed to maximize speed while ensuring safety for human workers [1]. This algorithm runs in real-time and provides the safe and fastest control input for every cycle with respect to ISO standards [2]. However, true optimality has not been achieved due to inaccurate distance computation resulting from conservative model simplification. To attain true optimality, we require a method that can compute distances 1. at many robot configurations to examine along a trajectory 2. in realtime for online robot control 3. as precisely as possible for optimal control. In this paper, we propose a batched, fast and precise distance checking method based on precomputed link-local SDFs. Our method can check distances for 500 waypoints along a trajectory within less than 1 millisecond using a GPU at runtime, making it suited for time-critical robotic control. Additionally, a neural approximation has been proposed to accelerate preprocessing by a factor of 2. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our method can navigate a 6-DoF robot earlier than a geometric-primitives-based distance checker in a dynamic and collaborative environment.
