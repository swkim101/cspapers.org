Mapping plays a crucial role in location and navigation within automatic systems. However, the presence of dynamic objects in 3D point cloud maps generated from scan sensors can introduce map distortion and long traces, thereby posing challenges for accurate mapping and navigation. To address this issue, we propose ERASOR++, an enhanced approach based on the Egocentric Ratio of Pseudo Occupancy for effective dynamic object removal. To begin, we introduce the Height Coding Descriptor, which combines height difference and height layer information to encode the point cloud. Subsequently, we propose the Height Stack Test, Ground Layer Test, and Surrounding Point Test methods to precisely and efficiently identify the dynamic bins within point cloud bins, thus overcoming the limitations of prior approaches. Through extensive evaluation on open-source datasets, our approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision and efficiency compared to existing methods. Furthermore, the techniques described in our work hold promise for addressing various challenging tasks or aspects through subsequent migration.
