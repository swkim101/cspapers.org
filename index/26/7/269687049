Traditionally, top-level domains (TLDs) are managed by the Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (ICANN), and the domain names under them are managed by registrars. Against such a centralized management, a blockchain naming service (BNS) has been proposed to manage TLDs on blockchains without authority intervention. BNS users can register TLD strings as non-fungible tokens and manage the TLD root zone. However, such a decentralized management results in the introduction of a new security issue, BNS TLD name collision, wherein the same TLD is registered in several different BNSs. In this study, we investigated BNS TLD name collisions by analyzing TLDs registered on two BNSs: Handshake and Decentraweb. Specifically, we collected TLDs registered in Handshake and Decentraweb and the associated data, and analyzed the data registration status of BNS TLDs and BNS TLD name collisions. The analysis of 11,595,406 Handshake and 11,889 Decentraweb TLDs revealed 6,973 BNS TLD name collisions. In particular, lastname TLDs, which are intended for use as person names, yielded a large number of registered domain names. In addition, the analysis identified 10 name collisions between the BNS and operational ICANN TLDs. Further, the ICANN TLD candidates under review also had name collisions against the BNS TLDs. Consequently, based on the characteristics of these name collisions and discussions in BNS communities, we considered countermeasures against BNS TLD name collisions. For the further development of BNSs, we believe that it is essential to discuss with the existing Internet communities and coexist with the existing Internet.
