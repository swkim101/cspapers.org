Software testing is a fundamental part of system development. As software grows, its test suite becomes larger and its execution time may become a problem to software developers. This is especially the case for agile methodologies, which preach a short develop/test cycle. Moreover, due to the increasing complexity of systems, there is the need to test software in a variety of environments. In this paper, we introduce GridUnit, an extension of the widely adopted JUnit testing framework, able to automatically distribute the execution of software tests on a computational grid with minimum user intervention. Experiments conducted with this solution have showed a speed-up of almost 70x, reducing the duration of the test phase of a synthetic application from 24 hours to less than 30 minutes. The solution does not require any source-code modification, hides the grid complexity from the user and provides a cost-effectiveness improvement to the software testing experience.
