To enhance interactions in VR, many techniques introduce offsets between the virtual and real-world position of users’ hands. Nevertheless, such hand redirection (HR) techniques are only effective as long as they go unnoticed by users—not disrupting the VR experience. While several studies consider how much unnoticeable redirection can be applied, these focus on mid-air floating hands that are disconnected from users’ bodies. Increasingly, VR avatars are embodied as being directly connected with the user’s body, which provide more visual cue anchoring, and may therefore reduce the unnoticeable redirection threshold. In this work, we studied more complete avatars and their effect on the sense of embodiment and the detectability of HR. We found that higher avatar completeness increases embodiment, and we provide evidence for the absence of practically relevant effects on the detectability of HR.
