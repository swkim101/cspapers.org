Machine learning-driven human behavior analysis is gaining attention in behavioral/mental health-care, due to its potential to identify behavioral patterns that cannot be recognized by traditional assessments. Real-life applications, such as digital behavioral biomarker identification, often require the discovery of complex spatiotemporal patterns in multimodal data, which is largely under-explored. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model that integrates uniquely designed Deep Temporal Sets (DTS) with Evidential Rein-forced Attentions (ERA). DTS captures complex temporal relationships in the input and generates a set-based representation, while ERA captures the policy networkâ€™s uncertainty and conducts evidence-aware exploration to locate attentive regions in behavioral data. Using child-computer interaction data as a testing platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DTS-ERA in differentiating children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and typically developing children based on sequential multimodal visual and touch behaviors. Comparisons with baseline methods show that our model achieves superior performance and has the potential to provide objective, quantitative, and precise analysis of complex human behaviors.
