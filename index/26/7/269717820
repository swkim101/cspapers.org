AR applications commonly contain diverse interactions among different AR contents. Creating such applications requires creators to have advanced programming skills for scripting interactive behaviors of AR contents, repeated transferring and adjustment of virtual contents from virtual to physical scenes, testing by traversing between desktop interfaces and target AR scenes, and digitalizing AR contents. Existing immersive tools for prototyping/authoring such interactions are tailored for domain-specific applications. To support programming general interactive behaviors of real object(s)/environment(s) and virtual object(s)/environment(s) for novice AR creators, we propose ProInterAR, an integrated visual programming platform to create immersive AR applications with a tablet and an AR-HMD. Users can construct interaction scenes by creating virtual contents and augmenting real contents from the view of an AR-HMD, script interactive behaviors by stacking blocks from a tablet UI, and then execute and control the interactions in the AR scene. We showcase a wide range of AR application scenarios enabled by ProInterAR, including AR game, AR teaching, sequential animation, AR information visualization, etc. Two usability studies validate that novice AR creators can easily program various desired AR applications using ProInterAR.
