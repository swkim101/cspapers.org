ChatGPT has entered classrooms, circumventing typical training and vetting procedures. Unlike other educational technologies, it placed teachers in direct contact with the versatility of generative AI. Consequently, teachers are urgently tasked to assess its capabilities to inform their use of ChatGPT. However, it is unclear what support teachers have and need and whether existing documentation, such as model cards, provides adequate direction for educators in this new paradigm. By interviewing 22 middle- and high-school ELA and Social Studies teachers, we connect the discourse on AI transparency and documentation with educational technology integration, highlighting the information needs of teachers. Our findings reveal that teachers confront significant information gaps, lacking clarity on exploring ChatGPTâ€™s capabilities for bespoke learning tasks and ensuring its fit with the needs of diverse learners. As a solution, we propose a framework for interactive model documentation that empowers teachers to navigate the interplay between pedagogical and technical knowledge.
