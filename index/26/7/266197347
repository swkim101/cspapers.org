This paper studies a novel application of an aerial manipulator (AM)-the contact-based landing on a mobile platform. An AM is inherently unstable, under-actuated, and usually loses some DOFs while contacting environments. Meanwhile, the AM's flight state is susceptible to uncertain movements of the mobile platform, such as acceleration, sudden stopping, and reversing. To accomplish the contact-based landing mission, a robust controller is first designed to maintain a steady contact-based flight. Then a hierarchical control framework is applied, integrating the controllers in free-flight and restricted-flight stages. An AM and a mobile platform are developed for contact-based flight experiments. The proposed scheme is reliable and has good repeatability in experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an AM has been implemented to conduct a contact-based landing, which is also an innovative landing approach for rotorcraft UAVs.
