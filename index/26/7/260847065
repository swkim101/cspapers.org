Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial noise. Denoising model-based defense is a major protection strategy. However, denoising models may fail and induce negative effects in fully white-box scenarios. In this work, we start from the latent inherent properties of adversarial samples to break the limitations. Unlike solely learning a mapping from adversarial samples to natural samples, we aim to achieve denoising by destroying the spatial characteristics of adversarial noise and preserving the robust features of natural information . Motivated by this, we propose a defense based on information discard and robust representation restoration. Our method utilize complementary masks to disrupt adversarial noise and guided denoising models to restore robust-predictive representations from masked samples. Experimental results show that our method has competitive performance against white-box attacks and effectively reverses the negative effect of denoising models.
