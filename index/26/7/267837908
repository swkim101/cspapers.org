The availability of hardware transactional memory (HTM) and the feasibility of persistent hardware transactions make them a natural choice for in-memory database synchronization. However, limitations on the size of hardware transactions and the lack of progress guarantees by modern HTM implementations prevent some applications from obtaining the benefit of hardware transactional memory. In this paper, we study persistent hybrid TM, which allows hardware assisted ACID transactions to execute concurrently with pure software transactions. This allows applications to gain the benefit of persistent HTM while accommodating unbounded transactions with a high degree of concurrency. Our experiments demonstrate that PHyTM is fast and scalable for realistic workloads.
