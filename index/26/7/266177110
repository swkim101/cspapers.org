Asking for clarification is fundamental to effective collaboration. An interactive artificial agent must know when to ask a human instructor for more information in order to ascertain their goals. Previous work bases the timing of questions on supervised models learned from interactions between humans. Instead of a supervised classification task, we wish to ground the need for questions in the acting agentâ€™s predictive uncertainty. In this work, we investigate if ambiguous linguistic instructions can be aligned with uncertainty in neural models. We train an agent using the T5 encoder-decoder architecture to solve the Minecraft Collaborative Building Task and identify uncertainty metrics that achieve better distributional separation between clear and ambiguous instructions. We further show that well-calibrated prediction probabilities benefit the detection of ambiguous instructions. Lastly, we provide a novel empirical analysis on the relationship between uncertainty and dialog history length and highlight an important property that poses a difficulty for detection.
