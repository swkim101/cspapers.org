Empirical research plays an important role in the design of user-interfaces and is frequently included in university courses on human-computer interaction. For instance, the ACM SIGCHI guidelines refer to the importance of empirical research, although they do not specify how this approach to user-interface design should be taught. In an Honours (fourth-year) course at the University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, the theoretical foundation of empirical research is augmented with a real experience of running a simple experiment. This experiment is planned, executed and analysed by the class as a whole. This paper describes the type of empirical studies carried out and discusses the benefits and limitations of such studies in this educational context.
