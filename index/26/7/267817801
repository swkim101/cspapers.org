Disjunctive constraints are widely used to ensure that the time intervals over which two activities require the same resource cannot overlap: if a resource is required by two activities A and B, the disjunctive constraint states that either A precedes B or B precedes A. The \propagation" of disjunctive constraints consists in determining cases where only one of the two orderings is feasible. It results in updating the time-bounds of the two activities. The standard algorithm for propagating disjunctive constraints achieves arc-B-consistency. Two types of methods that provide more precise timebounds are studied and compared. The rst type of method consists in determining whether an activity A must, can, or cannot be the rst or the last to execute among a set of activities that require the same resource. The second consists in comparing the amount of \resource energy" required over a time interval [t1 t2) to the amount of energy that is available over the same interval. The main result of the study is an implementation of the rst method in Ilog Schedule, a generic tool for constraint-based scheduling which exhibits performance in the same range of e ciency as speci c operations research algorithms.
