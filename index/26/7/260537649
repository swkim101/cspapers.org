As the adoption of knowledge graphs grows, more and more non-experts users need to be able to explore and query such graphs. These users are not typically familiar with graph query languages such as SPARQL, and may not be familiar with the knowledge graph's structure. In this extended abstract, we provide a summary of our work on a language and visual interface -- called RDF Explorer -- that help non-expert users to navigate and query knowledge graphs. A usability study over Wikidata shows that users successfully complete more tasks with RDF Explorer than with the existing Wikidata Query Helper interface.
