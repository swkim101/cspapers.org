Automating the learning of causal models from sample data is a key step toward incorporating machine learning into decisionmaking and reasoning under uncertainty. This paper presents a Bayesian approach to the discovery of causal models, using a Minimum Message Length (MML) method. We have developed encoding and search methods for discovering linear causal models. The initial experimental results presented in this paper show that the MML induction approach can recover causal models from generated data which are quite accurate re ections of the original models and compare favorably with those of TETRAD II (Spirtes et al. 1994) even when it is supplied with prior temporal information and MML is not.
