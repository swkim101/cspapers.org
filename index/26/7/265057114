With frame-based cameras, capturing fast-moving scenes without suffering from blur often comes at the cost of low SNR and low contrast. Worse still, the photometric constancy that enhancement techniques heavily relied on is fragile for frames with short exposure. Event cameras can record brightness changes at an extremely high temporal resolution. For low-light videos, event data are not only suitable to help capture temporal correspondences but also provide alternative observations in the form of intensity ratios between consecutive frames and exposure-invariant information. Motivated by this, we propose a low-light video enhancement method with hybrid inputs of events and frames. Specifically, a neural network is trained to establish spatiotemporal coherence between visual signals with different modalities and resolutions by constructing correlation volume across space and time. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
