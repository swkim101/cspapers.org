The feasibility of integrating antennas and required circuits to form wireless interconnects in foundry digital CMOS technologies has been demonstrated. The key challenges including the effects of metal structures associated with integrated circuits, heat removal, packaging, and interaction of transmitted and received signals with nearby circuits appear to be manageable. Besides, on-chip interconnection, this technology can potentially be applied for implementation of true single chip radio and radar, interchip communication systems, RFID tags and others.
