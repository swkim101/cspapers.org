This paper proposes an understandable neural network whose score function is modeled as an additive sum of univariate spline functions. It extends usual understandable models like generative additive models, spline-based models, and neural additive models. It is shown that this neural network can be approximated by a logistic regression whose inputs are obtained with a non-linear preprocessing of input data. This preprocessing depends on the neural network initialization but this paper establishes that it can be replaced by a non random kernel-based preprocessing that no longer depends on the initialization. Hence, the convergence of the training process is guaranteed and the solution is unique for a given training dataset.
