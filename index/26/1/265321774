Diffusion models have shown great potential for vision-related tasks, particularly for image generation. However, their training is typically conducted in a centralized manner, relying on data collected from publicly available sources. This approach may not be feasible or practical in many domains, such as the medical field, which involves privacy concerns over data collection. Despite the challenges associated with privacysensitive data, such domains could still benefit from valuable vision services provided by diffusion models. Federated learning (FL) plays a crucial role in enabling decentralized model training without compromising data privacy. Instead of collecting data, an FL system gathers model parameters, effectively safeguarding the private data of different parties involved. This makes FL systems vital for managing decentralized learning tasks, especially in scenarios where privacy-sensitive data is distributed across a network of clients. Nonetheless, FL presents its own set of challenges due to its distributed nature and privacy-preserving properties. Therefore, in this study, we explore the FL strategy to train diffusion models, paving the way for the development of federated diffusion models. We conduct experiments on various FL scenarios, and our findings demonstrate that federated diffusion models have great potential to deliver vision services to privacy-sensitive domains.
