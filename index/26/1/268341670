Over the past decades, computer science education (CSEd) research has studied the multitude of factors that may impact student success in introductory programming courses (CS0/CS1). The lack of foundational structure behind how these factors interrelate has made it difficult to gain a thorough understanding of this area of CSEd literature. Gaining a deeper understanding and applying structure to these factors would allow CSEd to adopt better teaching practices, study habits, learning environments, course materials, etc. and to better understand the student experience to better foster success among a broader population of students. Our systematic literature review used search criteria for factors that predicted student success in CS0/CS1, which yielded 311 research articles. We then mapped this body of work under the Biggs' 3P (Presage, Process, Product) educational model, which provides a comprehensive framework for how students engage with learning opportunities. We discovered that although many studies focused on the Presage and Product phases of the model, fewer studies mapped to the Process phase, which describes the students' active learning processes. Our study shows there is a potential gap in the literature and future studies should focus more specifically on how students choose to engage with learning opportunities and what factors may be hindering that engagement throughout a learning period.
