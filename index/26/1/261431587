The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) includes no mechanism to verify the correctness of routing information exchanged between networks. To defend against unauthorized use of address space, the IETF developed the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), a cryptographically attested database system that facilitates validation of BGP messages. Networks can use RPKI to check whether the Autonomous System (AS) at the origin of the AS path in a BGP announcement is authorized to originate the IP prefixes being announced.
