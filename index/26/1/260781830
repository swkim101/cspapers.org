In recent years, online search has been playing an increasingly important role in imperfect information games (IIGs). Previous online search is known as common-knowledge subgame solving, which has to consider all the states in a common-knowledge closure. This is only computationally tolerable for medium size games, such as poker. To handle larger games, order-1 Knowledge-Limited Subgame Solving (1-KLSS) only considers the states in a knowledge-limited closure, which results in a much smaller subgame. However, 1-KLSS is unsafe. In this paper, we first extend 1-KLSS to Safe-1-KLSS and prove its safeness. To make Safe-1-KLSS applicable to even larger games, we propose Opponent-Limited Subgame Solving (OLSS) to limit how the opponent reaches a subgame and how it acts in the subgame. Limiting the opponentâ€™s strategy dramatically reduces the subgame size and improves the efficiency of subgame solving while still preserving some safety in the limit. Experiments in medium size poker show that Safe-1-KLSS and OLSS are orders of magnitude faster than previous common-knowledge subgame solving. Also, OLSS significantly improves the online performance in a two-player Mahjong game, whose game size prohibits the use of previous common-knowledge subgame-solving methods.
