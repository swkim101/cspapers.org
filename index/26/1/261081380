The remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technique can estimate pulse-related metrics (e.g. heart rate and respiratory rate) from facial videos and has a high potential for health monitoring. The latest deep rPPG methods can model in-distribution noise due to head motion, video compression, etc., and estimate high-quality rPPG signals under similar scenarios. However, deep rPPG models may not generalize well to the target test domain with unseen noise and distortions. In this paper, to improve the generalization ability of rPPG models, we propose a dual-bridging network to reduce the domain discrepancy by aligning intermediate domains and synthesizing the target noise in the source domain for better noise reduction. To comprehensively explore the target domain noise, we propose a novel adversarial noise generation in which the noise generator indirectly competes with the noise reducer. To further improve the robustness of the noise reducer, we propose hard noise pattern mining to encourage the generator to learn hard noise patterns contained in the target domain features. We evaluated the proposed method on three public datasets with different types of interferences. Under different crossdomain scenarios, the comprehensive results show the effectiveness of our method.
