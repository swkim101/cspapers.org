Answer Set Programming (ASP) has emerged as a promising
paradigm in knowledge representation and automated reason-
ing owing to its ability to model hard combinatorial problems
from diverse domains in a natural way. Building on advances
in propositional SAT solving, the past two decades have wit-
nessed the emergence of well-engineered systems for solv-
ing the answer set satisfiability problem, i.e., finding mod-
els or answer sets for a given answer set program. In re-
cent years, there has been growing interest in problems be-
yond satisfiability, such as model counting, in the context of
ASP. Akin to the early days of propositional model count-
ing, state-of-the-art exact answer set counters do not scale
well beyond small instances. Exact ASP counters struggle
with handling larger input formulas. The primary contribu-
tion of this paper is a new ASP counting framework, called
sharpASP, which counts answer sets avoiding larger input
formulas. This relies on an alternative way of defining answer
sets that allows lifting of key techniques developed in the con-
text of propositional model counting. Our extensive empirical
analysis over 1470 benchmarks demonstrates significant per-
formance gain over current state-of-the-art exact answer set
counters. Specifically, by using sharpASP, we were able to
solve 1062 benchmarks with PAR2 score of 3082 whereas
using prior state-of-the-art, we could only solve 895 bench-
marks with PAR2 score of 4205, all other experimental con-
ditions being the same.
