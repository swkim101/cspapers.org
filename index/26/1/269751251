Proactive voice assistants (VAs) in smart homes predict users’ needs and autonomously take action by controlling smart devices and initiating voice-based features to support users’ various activities. Previous studies on proactive systems have primarily focused on determining action based on contextual information, such as user activities, physiological state, or mobile usage. However, there is a lack of research that considers user agency in VAs’ proactive actions, which empowers users to express their dynamic needs and preferences and promotes a sense of control. Thus, our study aims to explore verbal communication through which VAs can proactively take action while respecting user agency. To delve into communication between a proactive VA and a user, we used the Wizard of Oz method to set up a smart home environment, allowing controllable devices and unrestrained communication. This paper proposes design implications for the communication strategies of proactive VAs that respect user agency.
