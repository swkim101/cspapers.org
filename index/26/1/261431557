The vSwitch, as a critical component for Virtual Machine (VM) network connectivity in cloud environments, has prompted increasing attention towards its forwarding performance. While software optimization schemes have limitations in meeting the expanding network capacity demands [11, 12, 15, 17, 18], hardware offloading architectures leveraging SoC, FPGA, and ASIC have been proposed to transfer the match-action workload [1, 3, 6, 7, 13, 16], addressing the growing need for network capacity.
