Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology enables wireless devices to communicate using very high-frequency signals. Operating at those frequencies provides larger bandwidth which can be used to enable high-data-rate links, and very accurate localization of devices. However, radios operating at high-frequencies consume significant amount of power, making them unsuitable for applications with limited energy sources. This paper presents MilBack, a backscatter network operating at mmWave bands. Backscattering is the most energy-efficient wireless communication technique, where nodes piggyback their data on an access point's signal instead of generating their own signals. Eliminating the need for signal generation significantly reduces the energy-consumption of the nodes. In contrast to past mmWave backscatter work which supports only uplink, MilBack is the first mmWave backscatter network which supports uplink, downlink, and accurate localization. MilBack addresses the key challenges that prevent existing backscatter networks to enable both uplink and downlink at mmWave bands. We implemented MilBack and evaluated its performance empirically. Our results show that MilBack is capable of achieving accurate localization, uplink, and downlink communication at up to 8 m while consuming only 32 mW and 18 mW, respectively.
