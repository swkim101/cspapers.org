For embedded devices, the uncertainty of target physical environments is always a great challenge. With constrained resources and common overloaded uses, they can be more exposed to hardware faults. Other than stability and ordinary security issues, there exist some subtle phenomenons that lead to potential cryptanalysis or secret leakage. In this paper, we present STALKER, a framework to analyze the fragility of libraries under hardware fault models. Compared with existing tools, our framework targets faulty execution outputs, and can flexibly work on different libraries, architectures and support different search schemes. We find dozens of security-sensitive bits that may cause critical issues and provide detailed analysis.
