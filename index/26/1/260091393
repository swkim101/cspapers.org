We show that for any natural number $s$, there is a constant $\gamma$ and a subgraph-closed class having, for any natural $n$, at most $\gamma^n$ graphs on $n$ vertices up to isomorphism, but no adjacency labeling scheme with labels of size at most $s \log n$. In other words, for every $s$, there is a small (even tiny) monotone class without universal graphs of size $n^s$. Prior to this result, it was not excluded that every small class has an almost linear universal graph, or equivalently a labeling scheme with labels of size $(1+o(1))\log n$. The existence of such a labeling scheme, a scaled-down version of the recently disproved Implicit Graph Conjecture, was repeatedly raised [Gavoille and Labourel, ESA '07; Dujmovi\'{c} et al., JACM '21; Bonamy et al., SIDMA '22; Bonnet et al., Comb. Theory '22]. Furthermore, our small monotone classes have unbounded twin-width, thus simultaneously disprove the already-refuted Small conjecture; but this time with a self-contained proof, not relying on elaborate group-theoretic constructions.
