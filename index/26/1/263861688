Welcome to the CHI 2006 Extended Abstracts. We hope that you will enjoy this year's extended abstracts and the changes that we have made. For the first time this year, we encouraged submissions from six different sub-communities of the human-computer interaction (HCI) field: design; education; engineering; management; research and usability. The intent was to make sure that the technical program included elements that would be of interest to the broad HCI world. We especially sought Experience Reports, Panels, SIGs, and HCI Overviews. Submissions to each of these were carefully reviewed by the Conference Committee and their respective Community Chairs. These Extended Abstracts include these new or modified venues as well as materials from other traditional CHI venues.
