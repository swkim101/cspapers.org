This paper introduces an "IPv6-only-Capable resolver" to address the issue of many zones remaining unresolvable due to a lack of IPv6 connectivity in authoritative name servers. The proposed method utilizes NAT64 to transmit packets to IPv4-only authoritative name servers and increases resolution success rates with competitive response times compared to a traditional IPv6-only resolver.
