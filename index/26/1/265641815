The functionalization of copolyfluorenes containing dicyanophenanthrene units by closo-decaborate anion is described. Target copolyfluorenes were analyzed using SEM, UV-vis, luminescence, NMR, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The effect of complexation with the closo-decaborate anion on the photophysical properties was studied both experimentally and theoretically. The PL data indicate an efficient charge transfer from fluorene to the dicyanophenanthrene units coordinated to the closo-decaborate. The coordination of closo-decaborate clusters to the nitrile groups of copolyfluorenes provides an important route to new materials for sensors and light-emitting devices while, at the same time, serving as a platform for further study of the nature of boron clusters.
