Calibration of fixtures in robotic work cells is essential but also time consuming and error-prone, and poor calibration can easily lead to wasted debugging time in down-stream tasks. Contact-based calibration methods let the user measure points on the fixture’s surface with a tool tip attached to the robot’s end effector. Most such methods require the user to manually annotate correspondences on the CAD model, however, this is error-prone and a cumbersome user experience. We propose a correspondence-free alternative: The user simply measures a few points from the fixture’s surface, and our method provides a tight superset of the poses which could explain the measured points. This naturally detects ambiguities related to symmetry and uninformative points and conveys this uncertainty to the user. Perhaps more importantly, it provides guaranteed bounds on the pose. The computation of such bounds is made tractable by the use of a hierarchical grid on SE(3). Our method is evaluated both in simulation and on a real collaborative robot, showing great potential for easier and less error-prone fixture calibration. sites.google.com/view/ttpose
