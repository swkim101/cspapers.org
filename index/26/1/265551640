In this work, we analyze to what extent actors target poorly-secured cloud storage buckets for attack. We deployed hundreds of AWS S3 honeybuckets with different names and content to lure and measure different scanning strategies. Actors exhibited clear preferences for scanning buckets that appeared to belong to organizations, especially commercial entities in the technology sector with a vulnerability disclosure program. Actors continuously engaged with the content of buckets by downloading, uploading, and deleting files. Most alarmingly, we recorded multiple instances in which malicious actors downloaded, read, and understood a document from our honeybucket, leading them to attempt to gain unauthorized server access.
