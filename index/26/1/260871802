Identifying prognostic genes associated with patient survival is an important goal in cancer genomics, as this information could inform treat-ment approaches and improve patient outcomes. However, the identification of prognostic genes is complicated by the high dimensionality of ge-netic data, which makes their identification computationally intensive. Furthermore, most cancer genomics studies lack appropriate low-risk groups against which to compare. To address these issues, we present a framework that identifies candidate prognostic genes by integrating representation learning and statistical analysis approaches. Specifically, we propose a collaborative filtering-derived mechanism to represent patients in order of their survival risk, facilitating their di-chotomization. We also propose a mechanism that allows embedded gene vectors to be polarized on the extremities of, or centered on, both reference axes to facilitate recommendations. Restricting our analysis to a few representative genes within each cluster allowed for the efficient identification of prognostic genes. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of this proposed framework for identifying prognostic genes.
