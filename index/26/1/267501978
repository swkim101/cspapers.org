Electrochemical generator with a zinc electrode comprising a positive electrode, a collector core constituted by a metal grid covered by a material containing zinc, an electrolyte comprising a base aqueous solution of an alkaline polyacid salt and more particularly a phosphate in a concentration such that the pH be maintained at a substantially constant value, the said material being thermo-hardening and having a composition, by weight, of 10 to 100 parts of the said polyacid alkaline salt, 50 to 200 parts of a compound containing zinc, and 2 to 20 parts of at least one oxide of a metal chosen among the elements of columns IIA and IIB of the periodic classification as well as lithium, the said electrolyte comprising, moreover, at least one alkaline halide.
