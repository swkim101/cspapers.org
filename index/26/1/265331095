Smart Camera along with Artificial Intelligence to solve complex social problems is increasingly popular. Security and safety issues are complex and tending to be related to crimes using weapons. Recently, Transformer Architectures have gradually become popular in Computer Vision problems. This paper focuses on training a weapon detection system based on the Swin Transformer model, combined with another method: Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, Mask RepPoints-V2 to create better, faster object recognition solutions. The research focuses on 3 main objects of weapon such as Pistol, Rifle, Knife. Due to the restriction of available dataset, WeaponData_VN dataset were built and described.
