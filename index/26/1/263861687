On behalf of the Technical Program Committee, welcome to the CHI 2005 conference DVD! The Extended Abstracts portion of this disc includes submissions from all conference venues except Papers (which you can find in the Conference Proceedings section). Here you will find a formal record of the discussions, demonstrations, and debates that will occur during the conference. Highlights include: 
short papers from the Late-Breaking Results venue, 
videos of demonstrations from our new Interactivity Chamber, 
case studies in innovation and excellence from the Design Expo, a forum for best practices in HCI, 
ideas that are controversial, innovative, or "hard-to-publish" from alt.chi, 
position papers from the Development Consortium, which looks at SIGCHI's role in serving an increasingly multidisciplinary membership, and 
panels and SIGs that reflect on the foundations of our discipline, and look forward at issues affecting the community today, with topics ranging from outsourcing to the CHI Papers process. 
 
You will also find brief summaries from Workshop organizers, Doctoral Consortium participants, Student Competition teams, and Late Breaking Results posters. If you are viewing this disc at the conference, we invite you to interact with these authors during the Highlights on Posters sessions on Wednesday and Thursday in the Commons; check your conference program for more information.On a personal note: bringing together such a large and diverse program is no small task, and I am grateful to the dedication of our venue chairs and Web master - from developing the Calls for Participation and handling the submission/review process, to dealing with my endless requests for information and scheduling conference sessions. Many, many thanks for volunteering your efforts for over a year to make this conference happen!
