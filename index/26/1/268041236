Diffusion model is a promising approach to image generation and has been employed for Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) with competitive performance. While existing methods simply align the person appearance to the target pose, they are prone to overfitting due to the lack of a high-level semantic understanding on the source person image. In this paper, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Latent Diffusion (CFLD) method for PGPIS. In the absence of image-caption pairs and textual prompts, we de-velop a novel training paradigm purely based on images to control the generation process of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. A perception-refined decoder is designed to progressively refine a set of learnable queries and extract semantic understanding of person images as a coarse-grained prompt. This allows for the decoupling of fine-grained appearance and pose information controls at different stages, and thus circumventing the potential over-fitting problem. To generate more realistic texture details, a hybrid- granularity attention module is proposed to encode multi-scale fine-grained appearance features as bias terms to augment the coarse-grained prompt. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the DeepFashion benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state of the arts for PGPIS.
