In thermal covert channel (TCC) attacks, malicious applications seek to leak private information in a stealthy and hard-to-detect manner. State-of-the-art approaches for TCC detection employ the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) combined with heuristics to identify possible channels. However, as we demonstrate in this paper, these approaches are limited when detecting short-duration attacks, where an attacker intentionally halts the transmission for a time interval to avoid the detection. In order to overcome this limitation of the state-of-the-art solutions, we propose the first detection method for short-duration TCC attacks. Our solution, Dotecca, is a machine learning-based technique that employs short windows of time-domain measurements instead of the DFT to detect TCCs. To evaluate our solution, we introduce a new obfuscated short-duration attack that disguises as a regular application from the perspective of a DFT spectrum. Our experiments show that the new obfuscated attack is able to remain undetected even under advanced DFT-based state-of-the-art detection approaches, reducing their detection accuracy to about 18 %. In contrast, our smart detection approach is able to detect state-of-the-art and new obfuscated attacks with an accuracy of 99 %. Moreover, our solution reduces the overhead of the DFT-based state-of-the-art solution by more than 14 Ã—.
