The notion of shortcut partition, introduced recently by Chang, Conroy, Le, Milenkovi\'c, Solomon, and Than [CCLMST23], is a new type of graph partition into low-diameter clusters. Roughly speaking, the shortcut partition guarantees that for every two vertices $u$ and $v$ in the graph, there exists a path between $u$ and $v$ that intersects only a few clusters. They proved that any planar graph admits a shortcut partition and gave several applications, including a construction of tree cover for arbitrary planar graphs with stretch $1+\varepsilon$ and $O(1)$ many trees for any fixed $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. However, the construction heavily exploits planarity in multiple steps, and is thus inherently limited to planar graphs. In this work, we breach the"planarity barrier"to construct a shortcut partition for $K_r$-minor-free graphs for any $r$. To this end, we take a completely different approach -- our key contribution is a novel deterministic variant of the cop decomposition in minor-free graphs [And86, AGG14]. Our shortcut partition for $K_r$-minor-free graphs yields several direct applications. Most notably, we construct the first optimal distance oracle for $K_r$-minor-free graphs, with $1+\varepsilon$ stretch, linear space, and constant query time for any fixed $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. The previous best distance oracle [AG06] uses $O(n\log n)$ space and $O(\log n)$ query time, and its construction relies on Robertson-Seymour structural theorem and other sophisticated tools. We also obtain the first tree cover of $O(1)$ size for minor-free graphs with stretch $1+\varepsilon$, while the previous best $(1+\varepsilon)$-tree cover has size $O(\log^2 n)$ [BFN19].
