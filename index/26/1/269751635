Personal Informatics (PI) tools are crucial in helping individuals monitor their physical health, mental health, and overall well-being. Many Muslim women use multiple PI tools to support their religious and spiritual well-being alongside their health. We investigate the religious and health-tracking practices of Muslim women living in the United States during the month of Ramadan. We conducted a month-long diary study and semi-structured interviews with nine (9) Muslim women observing Ramadan. Through this research, we uncover their motivations for tracking, discover the complex interplay between their social roles and religious practices, and identify conflicts arising from competing objectives (tracking their spiritual and physical health). Our findings contribute insights into the inclusive design of Personal Informatics tools tailored to the needs of Muslim women of faith and provide a call to the research community to expand tracking technologies to include aspects that support religious health and wellness. We discuss design considerations for supporting Muslim women during Ramadan and beyond.
