The goal of 3D mesh watermarking is to embed the message in 3D meshes that can withstand various attacks imperceptibly and reconstruct the message accurately from watermarked meshes. The watermarking algorithm is supposed to withstand multiple attacks, and the complexity should not grow significantly with the mesh size. Unfortunately, previous methods are less robust against attacks and lack of adaptability. In this paper, we propose a robust and adaptable deep 3D mesh watermarking Deep3DMark that leverages attention-based convolutions in watermarking tasks to embed binary messages in vertex distributions without texture assistance. Furthermore, our Deep3DMark exploits the property that simplified meshes inherit similar relations from the original ones, where the relation is the offset vector directed from one vertex to its neighbor. By doing so, our method can be trained on simplified meshes but remains effective on large size meshes (size adaptable) and unseen categories of meshes (geometry adaptable). Extensive experiments demonstrate our method remains efficient and effective even if the mesh size is 190× increased. Under mesh attacks, Deep3DMark achieves 10%∼50% higher accuracy than traditional methods, and 2× higher SNR and 8% higher accuracy than previous DNN-based methods.
