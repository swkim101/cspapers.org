 In the impartial selection problem, a subset of agents up to a fixed size
 k
 among a group of
 n
 is to be chosen based on votes cast by the agents themselves. A selection mechanism is
 impartial
 if no agent can influence its own chance of being selected by changing its vote. It is
 
 α
 -optimal
 
 if, for every instance, the ratio between the votes received by the selected subset is at least a fraction of
 α
 of the votes received by the subset of size
 k
 with the highest number of votes. We study deterministic impartial mechanisms in a more general setting with arbitrarily weighted votes and provide the first approximation guarantee, roughly 1/⌈2
 n
 /
 k
 ⌉. When the number of agents to select is large enough compared to the total number of agents, this yields an improvement on the previously best known approximation ratio of 1/
 k
 for the unweighted setting. We further show that our mechanism can be adapted to the impartial assignment problem, in which multiple sets of up to
 k
 agents are to be selected, with a loss in the approximation ratio of 1/2.
