It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Fifth International Workshop on Security in Cloud Computing (SCC'17). This year's workshop continues its tradition of being the premier forum for the presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues and challenges of cloud computing security. The mission of the workshop is to share novel solutions that fulfill the needs of secure and privacy-preserving cloud applications and services, and identify new directions for future research and development. SCC'17 gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the topics of cloud security and privacy such as secure cloud architecture, cloud storage security, cloud cryptography, cloud access control and key management, identification and privacy in cloud, secure computation outsourcing, trusted computing, and many others. 
 
The call for papers attracted 27 submissions from total 22 countries and regions. Those submissions were reviewed by 63 program committee members from 16 countries and regions. The program committee reviewed and accepted 11. 
 
We also encourage attendees to attend the keynote talk. The valuable and insightful talk will guide us to a better understanding on the promise of big data analytics in cyber security:
