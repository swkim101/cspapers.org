The exponential growth of large language models (LLMs) has opened up numerous possibilities for multi-modal AGI systems. However, the progress in vision and vision-language foundation models, which are also critical elements of multi-modal AGI, has not kept pace with LLMs. In this work, we design a large-scale vision-language foun-dation model (Intern VL), which scales up the vision foun-dation model to 6 billion parameters and progressively aligns it with the LLM, using web-scale image-text data from various sources. This model can be broadly applied to and achieve state-of-the-art performance on 32 generic visual-linguistic benchmarks including visual perception tasks such as image-level or pixel-level recognition, vision-language tasks such as zero-shot image/video classification, zero-shot image/video-text retrieval, and link with LLMs to create multi-modal dialogue systems. It has powerful visual capabilities and can be a good alternative to the ViT-22B. We hope that our research could contribute to the development of multi-modal large models.
