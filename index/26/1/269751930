Continued social participation is a key determinant of healthy aging and lowers the risks of isolation and loneliness. While online technologies can provide a convenient way for older adults to connect socially, some prefer connecting offline with others in their community, which can pose different challenges, especially for those with disabilities. Yet, we still know little about how older adults with visual disabilities might leverage technology to address their needs for engaging in social events in their communities. We interviewed 16 blind or visually impaired (BVI) adults 60 years or older to understand their experiences engaging in community social activities and the role of technology in the process. We describe the challenges participants faced connecting with others in their community and their use of technology to overcome them. Based on our findings, we discuss design opportunities for technology to help BVI older adults manage the hidden labor social participation.
