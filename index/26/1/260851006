According to theWorld Health Organization, Pneumoconiosis

affects millions of workers globally,

with an estimated 260,000 deaths annually. The

burden of Pneumoconiosis is particularly high in

low-income countries, where occupational safety

standards are often inadequate, and the prevalence

of the disease is increasing rapidly. The reduced

availability of expert medical care in rural areas,

where these diseases are more prevalent, further

adds to the delayed screening and unfavourable outcomes

of the disease. This paper aims to highlight

the urgent need for early screening and detection

of Pneumoconiosis, given its significant impact on

affected individuals, their families, and societies as

a whole. With the help of low-cost machine learning

models, early screening, detection, and prevention

of Pneumoconiosis can help reduce healthcare

costs, particularly in low-income countries. In this

direction, this research focuses on designing AI solutions

for detecting different kinds of Pneumoconiosis

from chest X-ray data. This will contribute

to the Sustainable Development Goal 3 of ensuring

healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all

ages, and present the framework for data collection

and algorithm for detecting Pneumoconiosis

for early screening. The baseline results show that

the existing algorithms are unable to address this

challenge. Therefore, it is our assertion that this

research will improve state-of-the-art algorithms of

segmentation, semantic segmentation, and classification

not only for this disease but in general medical

image analysis literature.
