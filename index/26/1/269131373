Cellular network is the infrastructure of mobile communication. Baseband firmware, which carries the implementation of cellular network, has critical security impact on its vulnerabilities. To handle the inherent complexity in cellular communication, cellular protocols are usually implemented as message-centric systems, containing the common message processing phase and message specific handling phase. Though the latter takes most of the code (99.67%) and exposed vulnerabilities (74%), it is rather under-studied: existing detectors either cannot sufficiently analyze it or focused on analyzing the former phase. To fill this gap, we proposed a novel semantic-enhanced static vulnerability detector named BVFinder focusing on message specific phase vulnerability detection. Generally, it identifies a vulnerability by locating whether a predefined sensitive memory operation is tainted by any attacker-controllable input. Specifically, to reach high automation and preciseness, it made two key improvements: a semantic-based taint source identification and an enhanced taint propagation. The former employs semantic search techniques to identify registers and memory offsets that carry attacker-controllable inputs. This is achieved by matching the inputs to their corresponding message and data types using textual features and addressing patterns within the assemblies. On the other hand, the latter technology guarantees effective taint propagation by employing additional indirect call resolution algorithms. The evaluation shows that BVFinder outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors by detecting three to four times of amount of vulnerabilities in the dataset. Till now, BVFinder has found four zero-day vulnerabilities, with four CVEs and 12,410 USD bounty assigned. These vulnerabilities can potentially cause remote code execution to phones using Samsung shannon baseband, affecting hundreds of millions of end devices.
