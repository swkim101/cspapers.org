Regular pattern matching is pervasive in applications such as text processing, malware detection, network security, and bioinformatics. Recent studies have demonstrated specialized in-memory automata processors with superior energy and memory efficiencies than existing computing platforms. Yet, they lack efficient support for the construct of bounded repetition that is widely used in regular expressions (regexes). This paper presents BVAP, a software-hardware co-designed in-memory Bit Vector Automata Processor. It is enabled by a novel theoretical model called Action-Homogeneous Non-deterministic Bit Vector Automata (AH-NBVA), its efficient hardware implementation, and a compiler that translates regexes into hardware configurations. BVAP is evaluated with a cycle-accurate simulator in a 28nm CMOS process, achieving 67-95% higher energy efficiency and 42-68% lower area, compared to state-of-the-art automata processors (CA, eAP, and CAMA), across a set of real-world benchmarks.
