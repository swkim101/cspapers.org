Engaging with diverse political views is important for reaching better collective decisions, however, users online tend to remain confined within ideologically homogeneous spaces. In this work, we study users who are members of these spaces but who also show a willingness to engage with diverse views, as they have the potential to introduce more informational diversity into their communities. Across four Reddit communities (r/Conservative, r/The_Donald, r/ChapoTrapHouse, r/SandersForPresident), we find that these users tend to use less hostile and more advanced and personable language, but receive fewer social rewards from their peers compared to others. We also find that social sanctions on the discussion community r/changemyview are insufficient to drive them out in the short term, though they may play a role over the longer term.
