The retraining of procedural programmers in objectDetienne (1990), expert programmers establish oriented concepts is a widely acknowledged many abstract knowledge structures called schemas concern. Research shows that previously acquired through the practice of programming. Then, when skills cannot be “unlearned”; therefore, the trainer searching for a solution to a new programming task, must consider these existing knowledge schemas these programmers retrieve and utilize the schemas when attempting to retrain experienced which they believe are appropriate for a new programmers. Furthermore, there is potential for problem’s design and implementation. (Refer to both positive and negative transfer of skills from this Soloway and Ehrlich (1984), Scholtz and procedural knowledge to the desired object-oriented Wiedenbeck (1990), and Campbell et al. (in press) knowledge. It is the responsibility of the trainer to for other examples of the influence of programming manage this transfer process by designing a schemas.) These findings suggest that trainers should retraining program that attempts to discover a not expect procedural programmers to strive to programmer’s existing schemas and to sequence the remove, or “unlearn,” existing schemas. Rather, the concepts in such a way that maximizes the positive programmers are likely to retrieve their proceduraltransfer while minimizing the interference from based knowledge when they are introduced to objectnegative transfer. oriented concepts.
