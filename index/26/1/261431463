Visible light communications (VLC) have gained significant attention as a potential solution for the radio spectrum crunch. To achieve high data rates, emerging transmitter devices like 2D digital micro-mirror devices (DMD) have been proposed, offering significantly faster state flipping rates compared to conventional liquid crystalline shutters. However, previous approaches utilizing DMD suffered from a lack of spatial diversity, as they used all micro-mirrors in the same state. This paper introduces EV-DMD, a novel approach that utilizes DMD as a 2D transmitter, working in tandem with an event-based vision (EV) camera. In this method, multiple bit streams are transmitted in parallel through different mirror blocks of the DMD, while an EV camera simultaneously decodes multiple light blocks, enabling a truly 2D high-speed VLC system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a 2D VLC system that achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art solutions.
