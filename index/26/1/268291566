Programming is a highly demanded skill in both STEM research and the broader economy. Although many life sciences majors are interested in learning how to code, they are nervous to learn and have not been warmly invited into computational fields. While there is much research on entry into computer science broadly, there is limited research on the unique barriers facing life sciences majors as they are introduced to programming. To address this gap, we sought to understand students' motivations to take a new introductory coding class in biology. We conducted focus group interviews with 22 students that revealed a range of motivations for taking the course, ranging from social and career motivation to the ability to be creative or analyze biological datasets. In addition, we probed the expectations for students taking the course, finding a wide range that varied depending on students' progression through college and prior experiences of pursuing opportunities to learn programming skills. Our findings elucidate the reasons students choose to take a discipline-based programming class and have implications of practices for inviting these students into these spaces.
