In this paper we introduce a multi-context variant of Reiter's default logic. The logic provides a syntactical counterpart of Roelofsen and Serafini's information chain approach (IJCAI-05), yet has several advantages: it is closer to standard ways of representing nonmonotonic inference and a number of results from that area come "for free"; it is closer to implementation, in particular the restriction to logic programming gives us a computationally attractive framework; and it allows us to handle a problem with the information chain approach related to skeptical reasoning.
