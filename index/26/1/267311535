Layout generation is a critical step in graphic design to achieve meaningful compositions of elements. Most previous works view it as a sequence generation problem by concatenating element attribute tokens (i.e., category, size, position). So far the autoregressive approach (AR) has achieved promising results, but is still limited in global context modeling and suffers from error propagation since it can only attend to the previously generated tokens. Recent non-autoregressive attempts (NAR) have shown competitive results, which provides a wider context range and the flexibility to refine with iterative decoding. However, current works only use simple heuristics to recognize erroneous tokens for refinement which is inaccurate. This paper first conducts an in-depth analysis to better understand the difference between the AR and NAR framework. Furthermore, based on our observation that pixel space is more sensitive in capturing spatial patterns of graphic layouts (e.g., overlap, alignment), we propose a learning-based locator to detect erroneous tokens which takes the wireframe image rendered from the generated layout sequence as input. We show that it serves as a complementary modality to the element sequence in object space and contributes greatly to the overall performance. Experiments on two public datasets show that our approach outperforms both AR and NAR baselines. Extensive studies further prove the effectiveness of different modules with interesting findings.
