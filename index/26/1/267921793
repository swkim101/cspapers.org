This paper presents Scrash, a system that safeguards user privacy by removing sensitive data from crash reports that are sent to developers after program failures. Remote crash reporting, while of great help to the developer, risks the user's privacy because crash reports may contain sensitive user information such as passwords and credit card numbers. Scrash modifies the source code of C programs to ensure that sensitive data does not appear in a crash report. Scrash adds only a small amount of run-time overhead and requires minimal involvement on the part of the developer.
