Through the efforts of the chairs and members of the technical program committees of the preceding years’ symposiums, ATS has become a technical meeting which is being paid increasing attention by the world testing community. This is manifested by the falct that the number of citations of ATS papers has increased. This is also partly manifested by the fact that the number of countries and regions from which the ATS ‘96 papem were submitted has increased to 19, which includes almost every major country and region of the world. So this year, you would find that we have a good technical program. We believe that, through the continued development and booming in economy in the Asian region, this trend will continue. Through the continued efforts of the sponsoring chairs and organizations in the coming years, ATS will eventually become one of the major technical conferences in testing.
