We look at concatenation hierarchies of classes of regular languages. Each such hierarchy is determined by a single class, its basis: level n is built by applying the Boolean polynomial closure operator "BPol" n times to the basis. An important and challenging open question in automata theory is deciding if a regular language belongs to a given level. For the historical dot-depth hierarchy, the membership problem is only known to be decidable at levels one and two. We give a generic algebraic characterization of the operator BPol. It implies that for any concatenation hierarchy, if n is at least two, membership at level n reduces to a more complex problem, called covering, for the previous level, n - 1. Combined with earlier results on covering, this implies that membership is decidable for dot-depth three and for level two in the main hierarchies of the literature. For instance, we obtain that the levels two in both the modulo hierarchy and the group hierarchy have decidable membership.
