Autonomous assistance of people with motor impairments is one of the most promising applications of autonomous robotic systems. Recent studies have reported encouraging results using deep reinforcement learning (RL) in the healthcare domain. Previous studies showed that assistive tasks can be formulated as multi-agent RL, wherein there are two agents: a caregiver and a care-receiver. However, policies trained in multi-agent RL are often sensitive to the policies of other agents. In such a case, a trained caregiver’s policy may not work for different care-receivers. To alleviate this issue, we propose a framework that learns a robust caregiver’s policy by training it for diverse care-receiver responses. In our framework, diverse care-receiver responses are autonomously learned through trials and errors. In addition, to robustify the care-giver’s policy, we propose a strategy for sampling a care-receiver’s response in an adversarial manner during the training. We evaluated the proposed method using tasks in an Assistive Gym. We demonstrate that policies trained with a popular deep RL method are vulnerable to changes in policies of other agents and that the proposed framework improves the robustness against such changes.
