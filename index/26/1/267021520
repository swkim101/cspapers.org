Accurately reconstructing 3D faces from monocular images and videos is crucial for various applications, such as digital avatar creation. However, the current deep learning-based methods face significant challenges in achieving accurate reconstruction with disentangled facial parameters and ensuring temporal stability in single-frame methods for 3D face tracking on video data. In this paper, we propose TokenFace, a transformer-based monocular 3D face reconstruction model. TokenFace uses separate tokens for different facial components to capture information about different facial parameters and employs temporal transformers to capture temporal information from video data. This design can naturally disentangle different facial components and is flexible to both 2D and 3D training data. Trained on hybrid 2D and 3D data, our model shows its power in accurately reconstructing faces from images and producing stable results for video data. Experimental results on popular benchmarks NoWand Stirling demonstrate that TokenFace achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on all metrics by a large margin.
