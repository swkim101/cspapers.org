Digital health interventions (DHIs) offer promising solutions to the rising global challenges of noncommunicable diseases by promoting behavior change, improving health outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs. However, high churn rates are a concern with DHIs, with many users disengaging before achieving desired outcomes. Churn prediction can help DHI providers identify and retain at-risk users, enhancing the efficacy of DHIs. We analyzed churn prediction models for a weight loss app using various machine learning algorithms on data from 1,283 users and 310,845 event logs. The best-performing model, a random forest model that only used daily login counts, achieved an F1 score of 0.87 on day 7 and identified an average of 93% of churned users during the week-long trial. Notably, higher-dimensional models performed better at low false positive rate thresholds. Our findings suggest that user churn can be forecasted using engagement data, aiding in timely personalized strategies and better health results.
