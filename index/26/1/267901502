Veriﬁable training is a promising research direction for training a robust network. However, most veriﬁable training methods are slow or lack scalability. In this study, we propose a fast and scalable certiﬁable training algorithm based on Lipschitz analysis and interval arithmetic. Our certiﬁable training algorithm provides a tight propagated outer bound by introducing the box constraint propagation (BCP), and it efﬁciently computes the worst logit over the outer bound. In the experiments, we show that BCP achieves a tighter outer bound than the global Lipschitz-based outer bound. Moreover, our certiﬁable training algorithm is over 12 times faster than the state-of-the-art dual relaxation-based method; however, it achieves comparable or better veriﬁcation performance, improving natural accuracy. Our fast certiﬁable training algorithm with the tight outer bound can scale to Tiny ImageNet with veriﬁcation accuracy of 20.1% ( (cid:96) 2 -perturbation of (cid:15) = 36 / 255 ).
