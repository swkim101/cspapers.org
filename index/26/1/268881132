CXL interface is the up-to-date technology that enables effective memory expansion by providing a memory-sharing protocol in configuring heterogeneous devices. However, its limited physical bandwidth can be a significant bottleneck for emerging data-intensive applications. In this work, we propose a novel CXL-based memory disaggregation architecture with a real-world prototype demonstration, which overcomes the bandwidth limitation of the CXL interface using near-data processing. The experimental results demonstrate that our design achieves up to 1.9Ã— better performance/power efficiency than the existing CPU system.
