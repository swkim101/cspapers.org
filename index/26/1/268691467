Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted considerable interest among researchers to leverage these models to enhance Recommender Systems (RSs). Existing work predominantly utilizes LLMs to generate knowledge-rich texts or utilizes LLM-derived embeddings as features to improve RSs. Although the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs generally benefits RSs, the application can only take limited number of users and items as inputs, without adequately exploiting collaborative filtering information. Considering its crucial role in RSs, one key challenge in enhancing RSs with LLMs lies in providing better collaborative filtering information through LLMs. In this paper, drawing inspiration from the in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning in LLMs, we propose the Large Language Models enhanced Collaborative Filtering (LLM-CF) framework, which distils the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into collaborative filtering. We also explored a concise and efficient instruction-tuning method, which improves the recommendation capabilities of LLMs while preserving their general functionalities (e.g., not decreasing on the LLM benchmark). Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-CF significantly enhances several backbone recommendation models and consistently outperforms competitive baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in distilling the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM into collaborative filtering.
