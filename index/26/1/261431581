This demo presents X-AR, an Augmented Reality headset that enables its user to find and retrieve hidden items. X-AR leverages battery-less 3-cent Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags that are already deployed on billions of items. As a user wearing X-AR moves in an environment, the headset transmits RF signals and leverages natural human mobility to locate RFID-tagged items. X-AR then guides the user toward the desired item for retrieval. We built a real-time prototype of this system on a Microsoft Hololens 2 AR headset with a conformal antenna, software radios, and an edge server. Our demo will enable any user to wear our X-AR prototype and use it to find and retrieve hidden items in a warehouse-like setting. Demo Video: youtu.be/bdUN21ft7G0
