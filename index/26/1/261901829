Deployed embedded devices face security risks due to increased ease of physical access to the devices by unauthorized users. Capable adversaries can intercept a device to recover the data in memory, including results of performed sensitive computations. Device owners require data confidentiality on their physically insecure devices. To satisfy this goal we implement a novel method, COPPER (Computation Obfuscation by Producing Permutations for Encoding Randomly), to create data which never exists on the device digitally in plaintext format and which is subsequently used for computation. In this paper we utilize COPPER to calculate a moving average computation on encoded data. 1
