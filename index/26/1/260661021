Performance of downstream NLP tasks on code-switched Hindi-English (aka Hinglish ) continues to remain a signiﬁcant challenge. In-tuitively, Hindi and English corpora should aid improve task performance on Hinglish. We show that meta-learning framework can effectively utilize the the labelled resources of the downstream tasks in the constituent 1 languages. The proposed approach improves the performance on downstream tasks on code-switched language. We experiment with Hinglish code-switching benchmark GLUE-CoS and report signiﬁcant improvements.
