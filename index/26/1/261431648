Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are used to encrypt data, protect privacy, and authenticate. However, the security of SSL/TLS itself depends on its configurations. While some scanning tools are used to measure SSL/TLS configurations, their performance is far from meeting the requirement of large-scale measurements. In this paper, we propose a fast SSL/TLS configuration scanning tool, Q-Scanner, which can generate a lightweight scanning solution based on the characteristics of the configurations to be scanned. The experiment shows Q-Scanner achieves a speedup of over 30,000 times compared to SSL Pulse without loss of accuracy.
