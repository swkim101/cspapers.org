As the exorbitant expense of labeling autopilot datasets and the growing trend of utilizing unlabeled data, semi-supervised segmentation on point clouds becomes increasingly imperative. Intuitively, finding out more ``unspoken words'' (i.e., latent instance information) beyond the label itself should be helpful to improve performance. In this paper, we discover two types of latent labels behind the displayed label embedded in LiDAR and image data. First, in the LiDAR Branch, we propose a novel augmentation, Cylinder-Mix, which is able to augment more yet reliable samples for training. Second, in the Image Branch, we propose the Instance Position-scale Learning (IPSL) Module to learn and fuse the information of instance position and scale, which is from a 2D pre-trained detector and a type of latent label obtained from 3D to 2D projection. Finally, the two latent labels are embedded into the multi-modal panoptic segmentation network. The ablation of the IPSL module demonstrates its robust adaptability, and the experiments evaluated on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art method, LaserMix.
