The need for reliable protection facilities, which allow controlled sharing of data in multi-user data base management systems, is steadily growing. This paper first discusses concepts relevant to such protection facilities, including data security, object grenularity, data incependence, and software certification. Those system characteristics required for reliable security and suitable functiorality are listec. The facilities which an operating system must provide in support of a such date base management system also are outlined. A kernel based data base management system architecture is then presented which supports value independent security and allows various grains of protection down to the size of comains in relations. It is shown that the proposed structure can substantially improve the reliability of protection in data bases.
