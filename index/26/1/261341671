Backup is cumbersome and expensive. Individual users almost never back up their data, and backup is a significant cost in large organizations. This paper presents Pastiche, a simple and inexpensive backup system. Pastiche exploits excess disk capacity to perform peer-to-peer backup with no administrative costs. Each node minimizes storage overhead by selecting peers that share a significant amount of data. It is easy for common installations to find suitable peers, and peers with high overlap can be identified with only hundreds of bytes. Pastiche provides mechanisms for confidentiality, integrity, and detection of failed or malicious peers. A Pastiche prototype suffers only 7.4% overhead for a modified Andrew Benchmark, and restore performance is comparable to cross-machine copy.
