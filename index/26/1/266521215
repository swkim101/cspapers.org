Recently, many carefully designed graph representation learning methods have achieved impressive performance on either strong heterophilic or homophilic graphs, but not both. Therefore, they are incapable of generalizing well across real-world graphs with different levels of homophily. This is attributed to their neglect of homophily in heterophilic graphs, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a two-fold filtering mechanism to mine homophily in heterophilic graphs, and vice versa. In particular, we extend the graph heat equation to perform heterophilic aggregation of global information from a long distance. The resultant filter can be exactly approximated by the Possion-Charlier (PC) polynomials. To further exploit information at multiple orders, we introduce a powerful graph convolution PC-Conv and its instantiation PCNet for the node classification task. Compared to the state-of-the-art GNNs, PCNet shows competitive performance on well-known homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/uestclbh/PC-Conv.
