Event cameras are recent sensors that measure intensity changes in each pixel asynchronously. It is being used due to lower latency and higher temporal resolution compared to traditional frame-based camera. We propose a method of 3D model-based object tracking directly from events captured by event camera. To enable reliable and accurate tracking of objects, we use a new event representation and predict brightness increment images with motion interpolation. Results of object tracking show the new methods significantly improves tracking duration and robustness, both for perspective and fisheye cameras. Our implementation succeeds in tracking objects when the camera speed is reaching 2 m/s.
