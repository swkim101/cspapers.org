We show that the regular separability problem of VASS reachability languages is decidable and FÏ‰-complete. At the heart of our decision procedure are doubly-marked graph transition sequences, a new proof object that tracks a suitable product of the VASS we wish to separate. We give a decomposition algorithm for DMGTS that not only achieves perfectness as known from MGTS, but also a new property called faithfulness. Faithfulness allows us to construct, from a regular separator for the Z-versions of the VASS, a regular separator for the N-versions. Behind faithfulness is the insight that, for separability, it is sufficient to track the counters of one VASS modulo a large number that is determined by the decomposition.
