Basket representation plays an important role in the task of next-basket recommendation. However, existing methods generally adopts pooling operations to learn a basket's representation, from which two critical issues can be identified.

First, they treat a basket as a set of items independent and identically distributed. We find that items occurring in the same basket have much higher correlations than those randomly selected by conducting data analysis on a real dataset.

Second, although some works have recognized the importance of items repeatedly purchased in multiple baskets, they ignore the correlations among the repeated items in a same basket, whose importance is shown by our data analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel Basket Representation Learning (BRL) model by leveraging the correlations among intra-basket items. Specifically, we first connect all the items (in a basket) as a hyperedge, where the correlations among different items can be well exploited by hypergraph convolution operations. Meanwhile, we also connect all the repeated items in the same basket as a hyperedge, whereby their correlations can be further strengthened. We generate a negative (positive) view of the basket by data augmentation on repeated (non-repeated) items, and apply contrastive learning to force more agreements on repeated items. Finally, experimental results on three real datasets show that our approach performs better than eight baselines in ranking accuracy.
