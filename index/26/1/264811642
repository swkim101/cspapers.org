We study stereotypes embedded within one of the most popular text-to-image generators: Stable Diffusion. We examine what stereotypes of gender and nationality/continental identity does Stable Diffusion display in the absence of such information i.e. what gender and nationality/continental identity is assigned to `a person', or to `a person from Asia'. Using vision-language model CLIP's cosine similarity to compare images generated by CLIP-based Stable Diffusion v2.1 verified by manual examination, we chronicle results from 136 prompts (50 results/prompt) of front-facing images of persons from 6 different continents, 27 nationalities and 3 genders. We observe how Stable Diffusion outputs of `a person' without any additional gender/nationality information correspond closest to images of men and least with persons of nonbinary gender, and to persons from Europe/North America over Africa/Asia, pointing towards Stable Diffusion having a concerning representation of personhood to be a European/North American man. We also show continental stereotypes and resultant harms e.g. a person from Oceania is deemed to be Australian/New Zealander over Papua New Guinean, pointing to the erasure of Indigenous Oceanic peoples, who form a majority over descendants of colonizers both in Papua New Guinea and in Oceania overall. Finally, we unexpectedly observe a pattern of oversexualization of women, specifically Latin American, Mexican, Indian and Egyptian women relative to other nationalities, measured through an NSFW detector. This demonstrates how Stable Diffusion perpetuates Western fetishization of women of color through objectification in media, which if left unchecked will amplify this stereotypical representation. Image datasets are made publicly available.
