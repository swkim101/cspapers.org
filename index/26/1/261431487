NextG cellular networks must support diverse applications, such as interactive media streaming or robot control that have strict requirements on throughput, latency and reliability. These requirements must be met via optimizing wireless resources by utilizing application layer information, such as media streaming stall counts or robot pose estimates, along with network information, such as channel qualities and backlogs.
