Some animals exhibit multi-modal locomotion capability to traverse a wide range of terrains and environments, such as amphibians that can swim and walk or birds that can fly and walk. This capability is extremely beneficial for expanding the animal's habitat range and they can choose the most energy efficient mode of locomotion in a given environment. The robotic biomimicry of this multi-modal locomotion capability can be very challenging but offer the same advantages. However, the expanded range of locomotion also increases the complexity of performing localization and path planning. In this work, we present our morphing multi-modal robot, which is capable of ground and aerial locomotion, and the implementation of readily available SLAM and path planning solutions to navigate a complex indoor environment.
