Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based recommender systems have demonstrated promising performance in meeting user expectations by learning to make accurate next-item recommendations from historical user-item interactions. However, existing offline RL-based sequential recommendation methods face the challenge of obtaining effective user feedback from the environment. Effectively modeling the user state and shaping an appropriate reward for recommendation remains a challenge. In this paper, we leverage language understanding capabilities and adapt large language models (LLMs) as an environment (LE) to enhance RL-based recommenders. The LE is learned from a subset of user-item interaction data, thus reducing the need for large training data, and can synthesise user feedback for offline data by: (i) acting as a state model that produces high quality states that enrich the user representation, and (ii) functioning as a reward model to accurately capture nuanced user preferences on actions. Moreover, the LE allows to generate positive actions that augment the limited offline training data. We propose a LE Augmentation (LEA) method to further improve recommendation performance by optimising jointly the supervised component and the RL policy, using the augmented actions and historical user signals. We use LEA, the state and reward models in conjunction with state-of-the-art RL recommenders and report experimental results on two publicly available datasets.
