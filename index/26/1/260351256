Rigorous testing of small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) is crucial to ensure their safe and reliable deployment in the real world. sUAS developers aim to validate the reliability and safety of their applications through simulation testing. However, the dynamic nature of the real-world environment, including factors such as challenging weather conditions and wireless interference, causes unique software faults that may only be revealed through field testing. Considering the high cost and impracticality of conducting field testing in thousands of environmental contexts and conditions, there exists a pressing need to develop automated techniques that can generate high-fidelity, realistic environments enabling sUAS developers to deploy their applications and conduct thorough simulation testing in close- to- reality environmental conditions. To address this need, DroneReqValidator (DRV) offers a comprehensive small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) simulation ecosystem that automatically generates realistic environments based on developer-specified constraints, monitors sUAV activities against predefined safety parameters, and generates detailed acceptance test reports for effective debugging and analysis of sUAV applications. Providing these capabilities, DRV offers a valuable solution for enhancing the testing and development process of sUAS.
