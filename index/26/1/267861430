To prepare an evaluation dataset for textual entailment (TE) recognition, human annotators label rich linguistic phenomena on text and hypothesis expressions. These phenomena illustrate implicit human inference process to determine the relations of given text-hypothesis pairs. This paper aims at understanding what human think in TE recognition process and modeling their thinking process to deal with this problem. At first, we analyze a labelled RTE-5 test set which has been annotated with 39 linguistic phenomena of 5 aspects by Mark Sammons et al., and find that the negative entailment phenomena are very effective features for TE recognition. Then, a rule-based method and a machine learning method are proposed to extract this kind of phenomena from text-hypothesis pairs automatically. Though the systems with the machine-extracted knowledge cannot be comparable to the systems with human-labelled knowledge, they provide a new direction to think TE problems. We further annotate the negative entailment phenomena on Chinese text-hypothesis pairs in NTCIR-9 RITE-1 task, and conclude the same findings as that on the English RTE-5 datasets.
