As a class of fruitful approaches, diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown excellent advantages in high-resolution image reconstruction. On the other hand, masked autoencoders (MAEs), as popular self-supervised vision learners, have demonstrated simpler and more effective image reconstruction and transfer capabilities on downstream tasks. However, they all require extremely high training costs, either due to inherent high temporal-dependence (i.e., excessively long diffusion steps) or due to artificially low spatial-dependence (i.e., human-formulated high mask ratio, such as 0.75). To the end, this paper presents LMD, a faster image reconstruction framework with Latent Masking Diffusion. First, we propose to project and reconstruct images in latent space through a pre-trained variational autoencoder, which is theoretically more efficient than in the pixel-based space. Then, we combine the advantages of MAEs and DPMs to design a progressive masking diffusion model, which gradually increases the masking proportion by three different schedulers and reconstructs the latent features from simple to difficult, without sequentially performing denoising diffusion as in DPMs or using fixed high masking ratio as in MAEs, so as to alleviate the high training time-consumption predicament. Our approach allows for learning high-capacity models and accelerate their training (by 3x or more) and barely reduces the original accuracy. Inference speed in downstream tasks also significantly outperforms the previous approaches.
