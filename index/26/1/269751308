As generative AI rapidly enters everyday life, educational interventions for teaching about AI need to cater to how young people, in particular middle schoolers who are at a critical age for reasoning skills and identity formation, conceptualize and interact with AI. We conducted nine focus groups with 24 middle school students to elicit their interests, conceptions of, and approaches to a popular generative AI tool, ChatGPT. We highlight a) personally and culturally-relevant topics to this population, b) three distinct approaches in students’ open-ended interactions with ChatGPT: AI testing-oriented, AI socializing-oriented, and content exploring-oriented, and 3) an improved understanding of youths’ conceptions and misconceptions of generative AI. While misconceptions highlight gaps in understanding what generative AI is and how it works, most learners show interest in learning about what AI is and what it can do. We discuss the implications of these conceptions for designing AI literacy interventions in museums.
