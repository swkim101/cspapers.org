—Confidential computing is an emerging technique that provides users and third-party developers with an isolated and transparent execution environment. To support this technique, Arm introduced the Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA), which creates multiple isolated address spaces, known as realms, to ensure data confidentiality and integrity in security-sensitive tasks. Arm recently proposed the concept of confidential computing on GPU hardware, which is widely used in general-purpose, high-performance, and artificial intelligence computing scenarios. However, hardware and firmware supporting confidential GPU workloads remain unavailable. Existing studies leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to secure GPU computing on Arm-or Intel-based platforms, but they are not suitable for CCA’s realm-style architecture, such as using incompatible hardware or introducing a large trusted computing base (TCB). Therefore, there is a need to complement existing Arm CCA capabilities with GPU acceleration. To address this challenge, we present CAGE to support confidential GPU computing for Arm CCA. By leveraging the existing security features in Arm CCA, CAGE ensures data security during confidential computing on unified-memory GPUs, the mainstream accelerators in Arm devices. To adapt the GPU workflow to CCA’s realm-style architecture, CAGE proposes a novel shadow task mechanism
