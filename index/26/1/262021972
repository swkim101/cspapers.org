We give a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) to count the number of q-colorings for k-uniform hypergraphs with maximum degree Δ if k≥ 28 and q > 315Δ14/k−14. We also obtain a polynomial-time almost uniform sampler if q>798Δ16/k−16/3. These are the first approximate counting and sampling algorithms in the regime q≪Δ (for large Δ and k) without any additional assumptions. Our method is based on the recent work of Moitra (STOC, 2017). One important contribution of ours is to remove the dependency of k and Δ in Moitra’s approach.
