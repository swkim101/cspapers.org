In our introductory computer science course at a large public university, we embarked on a transformative journey inspired by Grading for Equity. Our goal: to accommodate differential learning, allowing students to attain a fixed level of mastery, albeit over a variable timeframe. Our course has six major project assessments that comprise 46% of the overall grade. In Fall 2022 (n=234), despite warnings, we allowed indefinite extensions on projects and observed a drastic downturn in project completion rates relative to previous terms. The Spring 2023 iteration (n=107) aimed to rectify this. Students could acquire two-week (or a single emergency one month) extensions. Further extensions obligated a student-staff interaction during dedicated support hours. Completion rates and lateness improved compared to fall, but were still poor compared to historical data. We also observed heightened stress. Summer 2023 (n=59) presented unique challenges: a smaller cohort, different demographics, and a halved timeframe. Nonetheless, we further refined our approach: 72-hour extensions were auto-approved, with additional time warranting a conversation with staff. Further, we mandated attendance to ensure students stay on-pace with material. The outcomes were stellar: near-perfect project completion rates, reduced lateness, and rejuvenated student sentiments. Fall 2023 (n=214) was our testbed for this strategy in a standard term, and early results showcase markedly better metrics compared to Fall 2022 and Spring 2023. In conclusion, while embracing a flexible, mastery-learning approach is vital to accommodate differential learning, finding a judicious equilibrium between autonomy and structure can be pivotal in navigating academic outcomes and student well-being.
