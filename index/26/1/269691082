Click-through Rate (CTR) module is the foundation block of recommendation system and used for search, content selection, advertising, video streaming etc. CTR is modelled as a classification problem and extensive research is done to improve the CTR models. However, uncertainty method for these models are still an unexplored area. In this work we analyse popular uncertainty methods in the context of recommendation system. We found that popular uncertainty models fails to capture the predictive uncertainty of the CTR model that exist unique to the recommendation models and is not prevalent in the traditional classification models. We empirical show why a different uncertainty measure is required for the recommendation system CTR prediction models. We propose PRU (Predictive Relevance Uncertainty), a single forward pass uncertainty approach for a sample as a distance from the predictive relevance samples of the training data. We show the efficacy of the proposed predictive relevance uncertainty (PRU) on selective prediction. Further, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework on the downstream task of OOD detection and active learning while maintaining the latency of a single pass deterministic model.
