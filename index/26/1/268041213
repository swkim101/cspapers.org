In this paper, we present an empirical study on image recognition unfairness, i.e., extreme class accuracy disparity on balanced data like ImageNet. We demonstrate that classes are not equal and unfairness is prevalent for image classification models across various datasets, network architectures, and model capacities. Moreover, several intriguing properties of fairness are identified. First, the unfairness lies in problematic representation rather than classifier bias distinguished from long-tailed recognition. Second, with the proposed concept of Model Prediction Bias, we investigate the origins of problematic representation during training optimization. Our findings reveal that models tend to exhibit greater prediction biases for classes that are more challenging to recognize. It means that more other classes will be confused with harder classes. Then the False Positives (FPs) will dominate the learning in optimization, thus leading to their poor accuracy. Further, we conclude that data augmentation and representation learning algorithms improve overall performance by promoting fairness to some degree in image classification.
