A large number of people digitally sign the same document. The signature collectors want to use only a small amount of memory to demonstrate to any third party approximately how many persons have signed it. The scheme described in this paper uses a non-uniform secure hash function to select a small subset of signatures that the collectors store. The size of this subset becomes a verifiable estimate for the logarithm of the number of signers. 
 
Applications for this scheme range from Web page metering, through ranking mechanisms for electronic discussion systems, to the distributed verifiable and scalable delegation of power in jointly-administrated systems.
