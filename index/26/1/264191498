Self-supervised learning is introduced to train graph neural networks (GNNs) by employing propagation-based GNNs designed for semi-supervised learning tasks. Unfortunately, this common choice tends to cause two serious issues. Firstly, global parameters cause the model lack the ability to capture the local property. Secondly, it is difÔ¨Åcult to handle networks beyond homophily without label information. This paper tends to break through the common choice of employing propagation-based GNNs, which aggregate representations of nodes belonging to different classes and tend to lose discriminative information. If the propagation in each ego-network is just between the nodes from the same class, the obtained representation matrix should follow the low-rank characteristic. To meet this requirement, this paper proposes the Low-Rank Decomposition-based GNNs (LRD-GNN-Matrix) by employing Low-Rank Decomposition to the attribute matrix. Furthermore, to incorporate long-distance information, Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition-based GNN (LRD-GNN-Tensor) is proposed by constructing the node attribute tensor from selected similar ego-networks and performing Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition. The employed tensor nuclear norm facilitates the capture of the long-distance relationship between original and selected similar ego-networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and the robustness of LRD-GNNs
