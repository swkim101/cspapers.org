In this paper, we address the problem of relative localization of two mobile agents. Specifically, we consider the Dual-IMU system, where each agent is equipped with one IMU, and employs relative pose observations between them. Previous works, however, typically assumed known ego motion and ignored biases of the IMUs. Instead, we study the most general case of unknown biases for both IMUs. Besides the derivation of dynamic model equations of the proposed system, we focus on the observability analysis, for the observability under general motion and the unobservable directions arising from various special motions. Through numerical simulations, we validate our key observability findings and examine their impact on the estimation accuracy and consistency. Finally, the system is implemented to achieve effective relative localization of an HMD with respect to a vehicle moving in the real world.
