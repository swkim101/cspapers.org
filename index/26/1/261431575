Increasing dynamics and an ever growing number of devices make current and future mobile network infrastructures more and more complex. Managing such networks thus becomes progressively challenging. Introducing more autonomic behavior in network management becomes indispensable to not only handle the growing complexity, but also to make these infrastructures more resilient as they constitute a critical component of overall public infrastructures. Autonomic control planes provide a fundamental set of resilient, autonomic infrastructure services (e.g., connectivity) for higher-level autonomic behavior to build upon. In this demo we show how a first real-world implementation of the routing architecture KIRA provides zero-touch control plane connectivity to enable an autonomic 5G network infrastructure. The demonstrator allows an in-depth view of each step in the process of bootstrapping a 5G infrastructure as well as of KIRA's resilience when challenged by failures and dynamics. Based on this autonomic connectivity solution we present our vision of more dynamic and resilient autonomic control networks toward the future design of 6G core networks.
