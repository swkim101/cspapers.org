Welcome to the fifth ACM International Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental Evaluation and Characterization (WiNTECH 2010). We continue the tradition of being co-located with MobiCom, the premier conference in wireless networking and computing. WiNTECH focuses on systems and experimental aspects of wireless networking. It has been one of the favorite venues for many researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to interactively share and discuss new exciting research results. 
 
This year's program features invited talks, ten paper presentations, and a number of demos and posters. We have received submissions from Asia (China, Japan, and Singapore), Europe (France, Germany, Italia, Sweden, and United Kingdom), Oceania (Australia) and the United States. Each paper was assigned to three independent technical program committee members for review. Based on the reviews, ten papers were accepted that cover the various topics that include virtual testbeds, emulation, optimization, security, sensor networks and mesh WLAN testbeds. The demo session has always been the highlight of WiNTECH and we expect the same this year. There are a number of demos showcasing the novel research work and competing for the WinCool demo award.
