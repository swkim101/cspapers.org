People with mental health issues often stay indoors, reducing their outdoor activities. This situation emphasizes the need for self-tracking technology in homes for mental health research, offering insights into their daily lives and potentially improving care. This study leverages a multimodal smart speaker to design a proactive self-tracking research system that delivers mental health surveys using an experience sampling method (ESM). Our system determines ESM delivery timing by detecting user context transitions and allowing users to answer surveys through voice dialogues or touch interactions. Furthermore, we explored the user experience of a proactive self-tracking system by conducting a four-week field study (n=20). Our results show that context transition-based ESM delivery can increase user compliance. Participants preferred touch interactions to voice commands, and the modality selection varied depending on the userâ€™s immediate activity context. We explored the design implications for home-based, context-aware self-tracking with multimodal speakers, focusing on practical applications.
