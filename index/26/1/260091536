In-Network Computing (INC) has found many applications for performance boosts or cost reduction. However, given heterogeneous devices, diverse applications, and multi-path network typologies, it is cumbersome and error-prone for application developers to effectively utilize the available network resources and gain predictable benefits without impeding normal network functions. Previous work is oriented to network operators more than application developers. We develop ClickINC to streamline the INC programming and deployment using a unified and automated workflow. Click-INC provides INC developers a modular programming abstractions, without concerning to the states of the devices and the network topology. We describe the ClickINC framework, model, language, workflow, and corresponding algorithms. Experiments on both an emulator and a prototype system demonstrate its feasibility and benefits.
