Combinatorial optimization problems prevail in engineering and industry. Some are NP-hard and thus become difficult to solve on edge devices due to limited power and computing resources. Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem is a valuable emerging model that can formulate numerous combinatorial problems, such as Max-Cut, traveling salesman problems, and graphic coloring. QUBO model also reconciles with two emerging computation models, quantum computing and neuromorphic computing, which can potentially boost the speed and energy efficiency in solving combinatorial problems. In this work, we design a neuromorphic QUBO solver composed of a swarm of spiking neural networks (SNN) that conduct a population-based meta-heuristic search for solutions. The proposed model can achieve about x20 40 speedup on large QUBO problems in terms of time steps compared to a traditional neural network solver. As a codesign, we evaluate the neuromorphic swarm solver on a 40nm 25mW Resistive RAM (RRAM) Compute-in-Memory (CIM) SoC with a 2.25MB RRAM-based accelerator and an embedded Cortex M3 core. The collaborative SNN swarm can fully exploit the specialty of CIM accelerator in matrix and vector multiplications. Compared to previous works, such an algorithm-hardware synergized solver exhibits advantageous speed and energy efficiency for edge devices.
