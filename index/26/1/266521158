Identifying speakers of quotations in narratives is an important task in literary analysis, with challenging scenarios including the out-of-domain inference for unseen speakers, and non-explicit cases where there are no speaker mentions in surrounding context. 
In this work, we propose a simple and effective approach SIG, a generation-based method that verbalizes the task and quotation input based on designed prompt templates, which also enables easy integration of other auxiliary tasks that further bolster the speaker identification performance. The prediction can either come from direct generation by the model, or be determined by the highest generation probability of each speaker candidate. Based on our approach design, SIG supports out-of-domain evaluation, and achieves open-world classification paradigm that is able to accept any forms of candidate input. We perform both cross-domain evaluation and in-domain evaluation on PDNC, the largest dataset of this task, where empirical results suggest that SIG outperforms previous baselines of complicated designs, as well as the zero-shot ChatGPT, especially excelling at those hard non-explicit scenarios by up to 17% improvement. Additional experiments on another dataset WP further corroborate the efficacy of SIG.
