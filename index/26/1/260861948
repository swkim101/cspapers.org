Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework represents a comprehensive theoretical effort to identify and outline the variables that determine the outcome in any social interaction. Taking inspiration from it, we define the Action Situation Language (ASL), a machine-readable logical language to express the components of a multiagent interaction, with a special focus on the rules adopted by the community. The ASL is complemented by a game engine that takes an interaction description as input and automatically grounds its semantics as an Extensive-Form Game (EFG), which can be readily analysed using standard game-theoretical solution concepts. Overall, our model allows a community of agents to perform what-if analysis on a set of rules being considered for adoption, by automatically connecting rule configurations to the outcomes they incentivize.
