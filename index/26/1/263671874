Estimating the region of attraction (RoA) for a robot controller is essential for safe application and controller composition. Many existing methods require a closed-form expression that limit applicability to data-driven controllers. Methods that operate only over trajectory rollouts tend to be data-hungry. In prior work, we have demonstrated that topological tools based on Morse Graphs (directed acyclic graphs that combinatorially represent the underlying nonlinear dynamics) offer data-efficient RoA estimation without needing an analytical model. They struggle, however, with high-dimensional systems as they operate over a state-space discretization. This paper presents Morse Graph-aided discovery of Regions of Attraction in a learned Latent Space (MORALS)**. The approach combines auto-encoding neural networks with Morse Graphs. MORALS shows promising predictive capabilities in estimating attractors and their RoAs for data-driven controllers operating over high-dimensional systems, including a 67-dim humanoid robot and a 96-dim 3-fingered manipulator. It first projects the dynamics of the controlled system into a learned latent space. Then, it constructs a reduced form of Morse Graphs representing the bistability of the underlying dynamics, i.e., detecting when the controller results in a desired versus an undesired behavior. The evaluation on high-dimensional robotic datasets indicates data efficiency in RoA estimation.
