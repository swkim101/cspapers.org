We introduce a conceptual framework exploring the learning methods for older adults in navigating automated vehicle interfaces. Through semi-structured interviews, we observed distinct approaches to learning, and based on these, offer a novel conceptualization of a ‘mentorable’ interface to enhance technology education. The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) to transportation has required novel lenses to technology adoption. Although AVs require less demand in cognitive, motor, and sensory acuity, there is an increasing dependence on digital literacy. While technology education has been broadly explored through the lens of learnability, this paradigm does not work well for older adults due to its inherent trial-and-error approach to independent learning. Because older adults rely heavily on additional external support in learning technologies, we present a conceptual framework for ‘mentorability’, where a network of support is emphasized, and mentorship is integrated into the design process for in-vehicle interfaces.
