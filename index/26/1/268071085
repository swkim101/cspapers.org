A defined software process is needed to provide organizations with a consistent framework for performing their work and im- proving the way they do it. An overall framework for modeling simplifies the task of producing process models, permits them to be tailored to individual needs, and facilitates process evolution. This paper outlines the principles of entity process, models and suggests ways in which they can help to address some of the problems with more conventional approaches to modeling software processes.
