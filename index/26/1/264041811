This paper presents a Video Inpainting algorithm that enables monocular-camera-laser-based pipeline inspection robots to capture both color and 3D information using only one video stream. Conventional monocular-camera-laser inspection methods are limited to capture either 2D color images or 3D point clouds since the laser tends to overexpose the actual color of the scanning area. We propose a real-time Video Inpainting method to solve this problem with minimal hardware needs that can be easily integrated with conventional pipeline profiling robots. The algorithm is accelerated by two components: a lightweight network that directly predicts the complete optical flow and simplifies the algorithm pipeline, and the Polar coordinate transformation, which significantly reduces the image processing compexity. Real-world experiments demonstrate that our online algorithm has comparable or better color estimation accuracy against state-of-the-art offline algorithms, while is capable of running at 23 frames per second (FPS) on a laptop computer with a resolution of 1024 Ã— 1024 pixels. In addition, we verify that this method can be used for video pre-processing for downstream tasks that require high-quality visual inputs, such as Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (SLAM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time Video Inpainting algorithm that can be used for in-pipe environments, serving as an important building block for highly compact RGB-D inspection sensors and robots for the pipeline industry.
