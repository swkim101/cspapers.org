A moral planning agent (MPA) seeks to compare two plans or compute an optimal plan in an interactive setting with other agents, where relative ideality and optimality of plans are defined with respect to a prioritized value base. We model MPAs whose values are expressed by formulas of linear temporal logic (LTL) and define comparison for both joint plans and individual plans. We introduce different evaluation criteria for individual plans including an optimistic (risk-seeking) criterion, a pessimistic (risk-averse) one, and two criteria based on the use of anticipated responsibility. We provide complexity results for a variety of MPA problems.
