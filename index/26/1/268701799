Designing accurate reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) has long been challenging. Preference-based RL (PbRL) offers a promising approach by using human preferences
to train agents, eliminating the need for manual reward design. While successful in single-agent tasks, extending PbRL to complex multi-agent scenarios is nontrivial. Existing PbRL methods lack the capacity to comprehensively capture both temporal and cooperative aspects, leading to inadequate reward functions. This work introduces an advanced multi-agent preference learning framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Based on a cascading Transformer architecture, our approach captures both temporal and cooperative dependencies, alleviating issues related to reward uniformity and intricate interactions among agents. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements in multi-agent cooperative tasks, and the reconstructed reward function closely resembles expert-defined reward functions.
