Previous theoretical results pertaining to meta-learning on sequences build on contrived assumptions and are somewhat convoluted. We introduce new information-theoretic tools that lead to an elegant and very general decomposition of error into three components: irreducible error, meta-learning error, and intra-task error. These tools unify analyses across many meta-learning challenges. To illustrate, we apply them to establish new results about in-context learning with transformers. Our theoretical results characterizes how error decays in both the number of training sequences and sequence lengths. Our results are very general; for example, they avoid contrived mixing time assumptions made by all prior results that establish decay of error with sequence length.
