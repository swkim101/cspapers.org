Recent advancements in the study of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic scenes often involve explicit modeling of scene dynamics. However, this approach faces challenges in modeling scene dynamics in urban environments, where moving objects of various categories and scales are present. In such settings, it becomes crucial to effectively eliminate moving objects to accurately reconstruct static backgrounds. Our research introduces an innovative method, termed here as Entity-NeRF, which combines the strengths of knowledge-based and statistical strategies. This approach utilizes entity-wise statistics, leveraging entity segmentation and stationary entity classification through thing/stuff segmentation. To assess our methodology, we created an urban scene dataset masked with moving objects. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Entity-NeRF notably outperforms existing techniques in removing moving objects and reconstructing static urban backgrounds, both quantitatively and qualitatively. 11Our project page is available at https://otonari726.github.io/entitynerf/
