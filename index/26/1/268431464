Computer Science (CS) classes teach technical skills, topics and knowledge areas - often without context where they will be used in future classes. Often times, students routinely struggle and ask questions like ''Why am I learning this?'' and ''What value does it hold?''. In addition to not seeing the correlation on topics, students fail to see what applications these concepts could lead to in the future. When asked what they see themselves doing in the future, we have observed that a significant majority of CS majors respond, ''software developer''. In this paper, we discuss an ongoing project called Pathways that provides information about their program's CS courses. Upon selecting a course, it will display prerequisites and paths to courses that open with this course, as well as topics covered, skills learned and potential careers tied to these skills. The overall goal is to provide motivation for learning and career planning, with the added benefit of retention, progress, and graduation.
