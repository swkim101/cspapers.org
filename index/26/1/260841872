We make a connection between multicalibration and property elicitation and show that (under mild technical conditions) it is possible to produce a multicalibrated predictor for a continuous scalar property Γ if and only if Γ is elicitable . On the negative side, we show that for non-elicitable continuous properties there exist simple data distributions on which even the true distributional predictor is not calibrated. On the positive side, for elicitable Γ , we give simple canonical algorithms for the batch and the online adversarial setting, that learn a Γ -multicalibrated predictor. This generalizes past work on multicalibrated means and quantiles, and in fact strengthens existing on-line quantile multicalibration results. To further counter-weigh our negative result, we show that if a property Γ 1 is not elicitable by itself, but is elicitable conditionally on another elicitable property Γ 0 , then there is a canonical algorithm that jointly multicalibrates Γ 1 and Γ 0 ; this generalizes past work on mean-moment multicalibration. Finally, as applications of our theory, we provide novel algorithmic and impossibility results for fair (multicalibrated) risk assessment.
