Visual representation plays an important role in visual object tracking. However, few works study the tracking-specified representation learning method. Most trackers directly use ImageNet pre-trained representations. In this paper, we propose masked appearance transfer, a simple but effective representation learning method for tracking, based on an encoder-decoder architecture. First, we encode the visual appearances of the template and search region jointly, and then we decode them separately. During decoding, the original search region image is reconstructed. However, for the template, we make the decoder reconstruct the target appearance within the search region. By this target appearance transfer, the tracking-specified representations are learned. We randomly mask out the inputs, thereby making the learned representations more discriminative. For sufficient evaluation, we design a simple and lightweight tracker that can evaluate the representation for both target localization and box regression. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is effective, and the learned representations can enable the simple tracker to obtain state-of-the-art performance on six datasets. https://github.com/difhnp/MAT
