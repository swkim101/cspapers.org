Existing LLM-based systems for writing long-form stories or story outlines frequently suffer from unnatural pacing, whether glossing over important events or over-elaborating on insignificant details, resulting in a jarring experience for the reader. We propose a CONCrete Outline ConTrol (CONCOCT) system to improve pacing when automatically generating story outlines. We first train a concreteness evaluator to judge which of two events is more concrete (low-level-detailed). This evaluator can then be used to control pacing in hierarchical outline generation; in this work, we explore a vaguest-first expansion procedure that aims for uniform pacing. We further use the evaluator to filter new outline items based on predicted concreteness. Compared to a baseline hierarchical outline generator, humans judge CONCOCT's pacing to be more consistent over 57% of the time across multiple outline lengths; the gains also translate to downstream stories. All code, data, and models are open-sourced.
