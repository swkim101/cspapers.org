Visualization of network simulation is an essential tool for network practitioners. However, the front-end of existing network simulators often fails to deliver satisfactory performance when dealing with modern network scales and interface speed. In this paper, we propose NetVision, an efficient visualization front-end of network simulation based on the Unity engine, which is commonly used for video game and virtual reality development. NetVision offers flow-level visualization of network behavior and performances. Then, through parallel optimization, NetVision supports real-time visualization for large-scale high-speed networks.
