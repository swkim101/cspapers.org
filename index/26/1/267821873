This paper discusses the concept of the working set for data-flow machines in order to establish one of the criteria for the realization of cost effective data-flow machines. The characteristics of program execution in conventional machines and data-flow machines are compared. Then, a definition of the working set for data-flow machines is proposed, based on the simultaneity of execution and the principle of locality. Several segmentation, fetch, and removal policies are described. Evaluation is made in terms of feasibility, efficiency, and performance, through computer simulations.
