Underwater Optical Wireless Communication (UOWC) enables high-speed data transmission among Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). However, due to cost and weight constraints, AUVs can only carry a limited number of directional optical transceivers. This implies that each AUV can communicate with only 1 to 2 neighbors simultaneously, complicating the establishment of an Underwater Optical Wireless Communication Network (UOWN). To address the networking problem with the degree constraint, we propose a topology generation method based on Hamiltonian paths. The topology achieves improved global connectivity at the cost of local optimality while satisfying the communication device limitations of AUVs. Preliminary results show that the generated topology can reduce the average communication overhead.
