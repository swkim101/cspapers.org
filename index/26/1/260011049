â€” In hazardous and uncertain sites, teleoperation is often utilized to execute scheduled procedures from a safe location. A visualization interface, which provides the remote operator with visual information to enhance spatial awareness, is essential to understand site information and receive feedback from the robot. To be effective, the interface must convey contextual information in an intuitive way. The provision of excessive or non-intuitive information not only reduces the operator's performance but also increases the cognitive load. In this study, the impact of different visual interface settings on workers' performance and their presence perception with perceived workload during a teleoperation task is examined and explored with eye gaze data. The results suggest that the development of human-centric interfaces for remote manipulation of construction robots is crucial, which allows to create intuitive and informative interfaces.
