Accurate identification of protein nucleic acid binding residues poses a significant challenge with important implications for various biological processes and drug design. Many typical computational methods for protein analysis rely on a single model that could ignore either the semantic context of the protein or the global 3D geometric information. Consequently, these approaches may result in incomplete or inaccurate protein analysis. To address the above issue, in this paper, we present CrossBind, a novel collaborative cross modal approach for identifying binding residues by exploiting both protein geometric structure and its sequence prior knowledge extracted from a large scale protein language model. Specifically, our multi modal approach leverages a contrastive learning technique and atom wise attention to capture the positional relationships between atoms and residues, thereby incorporating fine grained local geometric knowledge, for better binding residue prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the next best state of the art methods, GraphSite and GraphBind, on DNA and RNA datasets by 10.8/17.3% in terms of the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1 Score) and 11.9/24.8% in Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), respectively.
