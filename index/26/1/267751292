Path planning for multiple non-holonomic robots in continuous domains constitutes a difficult robotics challenge with many applications. Despite significant recent progress on the topic, computationally efficient and high-quality solutions are lacking, especially in lifelong settings where robots must continuously take on new tasks. In this work, we make it possible to extend key ideas enabling state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for multi-robot planning in discrete domains to the motion planning of multiple Ackerman (car-like) robots in lifelong settings, yielding high-performance centralized and decentralized planners. Our planners compute trajectories that allow the robots to reach precise SE(2) goal poses. The effectiveness of our methods is thoroughly evaluated and confirmed using both simulation and real-world experiments.
