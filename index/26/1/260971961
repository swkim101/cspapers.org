New cyberattacks grow in an exponential rate. However, the state-of-the-art in cyber defense efforts cannot keep pace with the sophisticated cybersecurity threats and attacks. The industry relies excessively on anti-virus software which is effective for known malware signatures, but not sustainable for the massive amount of malware samples released daily, and its inefficiency in handling cyberattacks such as zero-day or polymorphic/metamorphic malware. Machine learning (ML) has been extensively studied with a good performance in identifying and extracting knowledge from a big dataset. This can be an alternative to the signature-based approach. Currently, many schools offer courses on topics in ML and cybersecurity (MLC), individually. It is believed that cybersecurity professionals require a deep understanding on ML in order to cope with the growing cyberattacks. Research has shown that authentic learning will create an engaging and motivating learning environment in learning emerging technologies. We propose to develop cyber workforce using authentic learning on machine learning in cybersecurity through a set of real-world cybersecurity learning modules, including a Pre/Lab/Post model focusing on real-world problem solving skills. Our goal is to integrate developed resources into existing curriculum, disseminate the resources through webinars and faculty workshops, and assess the effectiveness of authentic learning of MLC for fostering cybersecurity workforce.
