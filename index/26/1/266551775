Gaze estimation has become a subject of growing interest in recent research. Most of the current methods rely on single-view facial images as input. Yet, it is hard for these approaches to handle large head angles, leading to potential inaccuracies in the estimation. To address this issue, adding a second-view camera can help better capture eye appearance. However, existing multi-view methods have two limitations. 1) They require multi-view annotations for training, which are expensive. 2) More importantly, during testing, the exact positions of the multiple cameras must be known and match those used in training, which limits the application scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 1-view-to-2-views (1-to-2 views) adaptation solution in this paper, the Unsupervised 1-to-2 Views Adaptation framework for Gaze estimation (UVAGaze). Our method adapts a traditional single-view gaze estimator for flexibly placed dual cameras. Here, the "flexibly" means we place the dual cameras in arbitrary places regardless of the training data, without knowing their extrinsic parameters. Specifically, the UVAGaze builds a dual-view mutual supervision adaptation strategy, which takes advantage of the intrinsic consistency of gaze directions between both views. In this way, our method can not only benefit from common single-view pre-training, but also achieve more advanced dual-view gaze estimation. The experimental results show that a single-view estimator, when adapted for dual views, can achieve much higher accuracy, especially in cross-dataset settings, with a substantial improvement of 47.0%.
