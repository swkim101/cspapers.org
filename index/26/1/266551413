Instruction tuning is a standard technique employed to align large language models to end tasks and user preferences after the initial pretraining phase. Recent research indicates the critical role of data engineering in instruction tuning -- when appropriately selected, only limited data is necessary to achieve superior performance. However, we still lack a principled understanding of what makes good instruction tuning data for alignment, and how we should select data automatically and effectively. In this work, we delve deeply into automatic data selection strategies for alignment. We start with controlled studies to measure data across three dimensions: complexity, quality, and diversity, along which we examine existing methods and introduce novel techniques for enhanced data measurement. Subsequently, we propose a simple strategy to select data samples based on the measurement. We present deita (short for Data-Efficient Instruction Tuning for Alignment), a series of models fine-tuned from LLaMA and Mistral models using data samples automatically selected with our proposed approach. Empirically, deita performs better or on par with the state-of-the-art open-source alignment models with only 6K SFT training data samples -- over 10x less than the data used in the baselines. When further trained with direct preference optimization (DPO), deita-Mistral-7B + DPO trained with 6K SFT and 10K DPO samples achieve 7.55 MT-Bench and 90.06% AlpacaEval scores. We anticipate this work to provide tools on automatic data selection, facilitating data-efficient alignment. We release our models as well as the selected datasets for future researches to effectively align models more efficiently.
