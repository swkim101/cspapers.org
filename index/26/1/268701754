We present the CoachAI Badminton Environment, a reinforcement learning (RL) environment tailored for AI-driven sports analytics. In contrast to traditional environments using rule-based opponents or simplistic physics-based randomness, our environment integrates authentic opponent AIs and realistic randomness derived from real-world matches data to bridge the performance gap encountered in real-game deployments. This novel feature enables RL agents to seamlessly adapt to genuine scenarios. The CoachAI Badminton Environment empowers researchers to validate strategies in intricate real-world settings, offering: i) Realistic opponent simulation for RL training; ii) Visualizations for evaluation; and iii) Performance benchmarks for assessing agent capabilities. By bridging the RL environment with actual badminton games, our environment is able to advance the discovery of winning strategies for players.
