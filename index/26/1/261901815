Designing reliable computing systems for autonomous driving is extremely challenging, as the performance and reliability of the systems have to be thoroughly evaluated under an extremely large amount of driving scenarios. Physically constructing scenarios and conducting testing for autonomous driving systems is time-consuming and expensive. To minimize the need for physical testing and improve development efficiency, we developed a digital-twin-based simulation, which can generate an integral, precise, and comprehensive representation of physical scenarios. In this paper, we share our experiences with the digital-twin-based simulation for autonomous driving, particularly the design requirements and components demanded to facilitate virtual environment construction and design verification, which could greatly improve development efficiency.
