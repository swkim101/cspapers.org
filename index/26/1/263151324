Constrained robot motion planning is a ubiquitous need for robots interacting with everyday environments, but it is a notoriously difficult problem to solve. Many sampled points in a sample-based planner need to be rejected as they fall outside the constraint manifold, or require significant iterative effort to correct. Given this, few solutions exist that present a constraint-satisfying trajectory for robots, in reasonable time and of low path cost. In this work, we present a transformer-based model for motion planning with task space constraints for manipulation systems. Vector Quantized-Motion Planning Transformer (VQ-MPT) is a recent learning-based model that reduces the search space for unconstrained planning for sampling-based motion planners. We propose to adapt a pre-trained VQMPT model to reduce the search space for constraint planning without retraining or finetuning the model. We also propose to update the neural network output to move sampling regions closer to the constraint manifold. Our experiments show how VQ-MPT improves planning times and accuracy compared to traditional planners in simulated and real-world environments. Unlike previous learning methods, which require task-related data, our method uses pre-trained neural network models and requires no additional data for training and finetuning the model making this a one-shot process. We also tested our method on a physical Franka Panda robot with real-world sensor data, demonstrating the generalizability of our algorithm. We anticipate this approach to be an accessible and broadly useful for transfering learned neural planners to various robotic-environment interaction scenarios.
