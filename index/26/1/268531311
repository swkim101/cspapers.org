The exceptional mobility and long endurance of air-ground robots are raising interest in their usage to navigate complex environments (e.g., forests and large buildings). However, such environments often contain occluded and unknown regions, and without accurate prediction of unobserved obstacles, the movement of the air-ground robot often suffers a sub-optimal trajectory under existing mapping-based and learning-based navigation methods. In this work, we present AGRNav, a novel framework designed to search for safe and energy-saving air-ground hybrid paths. AGRNav contains a lightweight semantic scene completion network (SCONet) with self-attention to enable accurate obstacle predictions by capturing contextual information and occlusion area features. The framework subsequently employs a query-based method for low-latency updates of prediction results to the grid map. Finally, based on the updated map, the hierarchical path planner efficiently searches for energy-saving paths for navigation. We validate AGRNavâ€™s performance through benchmarks in both simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating its superiority over classical and state-of-the-art methods.
