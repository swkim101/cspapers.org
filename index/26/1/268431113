In response to the enrollment surge that started in many CS depart- ments around 2006, the Computing Research Association published a report on "Generation CS", which named a pervasive theme in computing education: more and a greater diversity of students are seeking computing education, even if not as traditional CS ma- jors. However, our curricula and departments have stayed much the same. We still mostly prepare students for software develop- ment jobs in the technology industry, while we rarely identify the damage that same industry has caused in our democratic societies. How do we do better? How do we change to meet the needs of a changing society? What strategies should we apply? We know that large-scale change will require structural shifts, but such shifts are likely to be slow and expensive, whereas smaller, "boots on the ground" initiatives can positively impact individuals but do little to change the systems that underlie the deeper-seated problems in computing. Navigating this paradox is imperative to our success as a field. Our panel will address the big questions about how to make structural changes in computing education in order to meet the greater needs of Generation CS.
