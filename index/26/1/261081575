For learning-based binary descriptors, the binarization process has not been well addressed. The reason is that the binarization blocks gradient back-propagation. Existing learning-based binary descriptors learn real-valued output, and then it is converted to binary descriptors by their proposed binarization processes. Since their binarizaiion processes are not a component of the network, the learning-based binary descriptor cannot fully utilize the advances of deep learning. To solve this issue, we propose a model-agnostic plugin binary transformation layer (BTL), making the network directly generate binary descriptors. Then, we present the first self-supervised, direct-learned binary descriptor, dubbed DLBD. Furthermore, we propose ultra-wide temperature-scaled crossentropy loss to adjust the distribution of learned descriptors in a larger range. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed BTL can substitute the previous binarization process. Our proposed DLBD outperforms SOTA on different tasks such as image retrieval and classification11Our code is available at: https://github.com/CQUPT-CV/DLBD.
