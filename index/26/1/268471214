Recently, a workshop was convened with the goal of creating a vision for computing education for the next 15 years. The first part of the workshop involved 43 members of the computing education community meeting virtually to enumerate themes within the discipline. Those themes included: diversity, equity, inclusion, ethics, broadening participation, teaching, learning, K-12, research to practice, computing's connection to other fields, and computing education research disciplinary issues. Within each of those areas, interesting and provocative questions emerged that led the organizers to dig deeper into some hard questions for the field and probe further into where the field should be heading and what difficult questions we need to tackle. Thus, a final report that probes the issues of curricular bloat, teaching and pedagogy, infusing humanities in computing, improving pathways into the discipline, and integrating social justice into the discipline has been created. This talk will introduce the main themes of the report and point the audience towards where it is available. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2039833 and 2039848. The report and other resources can be found at https://cerfutureworkshop.org.
