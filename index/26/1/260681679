Data-driven approaches have been proven effective in solving combinatorial optimization problems over graphs such as the traveling salesman problems and the vehicle routing problem. The rationale behind such methods is that the input instances may follow distributions with salient patterns that can be leveraged to overcome the worst-case computational hardness. For optimization problems over graphs, the common practice of neural combinatorial solvers consumes the inputs in the form of adjacency matrices. In this paper, we explore a vision-based method that is conceptually novel: can neural models solve graph optimization problems bytaking a look at the graph pattern - Our results suggest that the performance of such vision-based methods is not only non-trivial but also comparable to the state-of-the-art matrix-based methods, which opens a new avenue for developing data-driven optimization solvers.
