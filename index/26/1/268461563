BBC micro:bits have long been used in informal and pre-college educational environments. With a wealth of sensors and a rich ecosystem of add-ons, it provides an engaging platform for teaching basic computer science. The use of block programming separates the learning of Computational Thinking and coding from the challenges students face with language syntax. In addition, the physicality of the device increases student engagement as they see code interact with the real world. Typical university CS1 courses are already struggling to cover the content required for CS1 and CS2 courses. Adding yet another task to the lecture component is not tenable. However, implementing the micro:bit in the lab component to complement the lecture allows the student to enjoy the engagement provided by the micro:bit in the lab to motivate learning in the lecture. This is particularly important as overall student engagement has declined post-COVID. Creation of a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game on the micro:bit introduces the concepts of variables and conditional statements using a block language, and allows automatic conversion to Python. Based on our experience with the use of the micro:bit in informal education settings, we know that student engagement with the device is high. Students will shift to using the MakeCode Python block components and add functionality manually as they become more familiar with Python syntax. The workshop will provide lesson plans and assignments for a full sequence of labs to use in CS1 and how they relate to the lecture sequence.
