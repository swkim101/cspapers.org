Design rule checking (DRC) is an essential procedure in physical verification, yet few open-source DRC tools are accessible in academia. To fill in the gap, we present OpenDRC, an open-source DRC engine that aims for extremely high efficiency. OpenDRC maintains hierarchical layouts with layer-wise bounding volume hierarchies and performs adaptive row-based partition to identify independent regions for check pruning and/or parallel processing. For common design rules, OpenDRC provides a sequential mode that runs cell-level sweeplines, and a parallel mode that launches edge-based GPU check kernels. Experiments demonstrate that OpenDRC outperforms state-of-the-art multi-threading and GPU-accelerated design rule checkers. The source code is available at https://github.com/opendrc/opendrc.
