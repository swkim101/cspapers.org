In this paper, the electrochemical non-enzymatic detection of Riboflavin (RF) was proposed based on its catalytic reduction in a Thionine-coated Cadmium Selenide Quantum dots (TH@CdSe QDs)-modified paraffin wax-impregnated graphite electrode (PIGE) that was prepared using a novel approach. The synthesized TH@CdSe QDs were confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Confocal Raman Microscopy and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) studies. The electrochemical response of the TH@CdSe QDs-modified PIGE was studied by cyclic voltammetry. The voltammetric response of RF at the TH@CdSe QDs-modified PIGE showed higher current than the bare PIGE. Under optimum conditions, the electrocatalytic reduction currents of RF was found to be linearly related to its concentration over the range of 1.6 × 10−7 M to 1.4 × 10−4 M with a detection limit of 53 × 10−9 M (S/N = 3). The TH@CdSe QDs-modified PIGE was utilized as an amperometric sensor for the detection of RF in flow systems was performed by carrying out hydrodynamic and chronoamperometric experiments. The TH@CdSe QDs-modified PIGE showed very good stability and a longer shelf life. The applicability of the fabricated electrode was justified by the quantification of RF in commercial tablets.
