We study ways of evaluating the performance of losing projects in participatory budgeting (PB) elections by seeking actions that would make them win. We focus on lowering their costs, obtaining additional approvals, and removing approvals for competing projects: The larger a change is needed, the less successful is the given project. We seek efficient algorithms for computing our measures and we analyze them experimentally, focusing on GreedyAV, Phragmen, and Equal-Shares PB rules.
