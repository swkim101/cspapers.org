With the proliferation of VR and a metaverse on the horizon, many multi-user activities are migrating to the VR world, calling for effective collaboration support. As one key feature, traditional collaborative systems provide users with undo mechanics to reverse errors and other unwanted changes. While undo has been extensively researched in this domain and is now considered industry standard, it is strikingly absent for VR systems in research and industry. This work addresses this research gap by exploring different undo techniques for basic object manipulation in different collaboration modes in VR. We conducted a study involving 32 participants organized in teams of two. Here, we studied users’ performance and preferences in a tower stacking task, varying the available undo techniques and their mode of collaboration. The results suggest that users desire and use undo in VR and that the choice of the undo technique impacts users’ performance and social connection.
