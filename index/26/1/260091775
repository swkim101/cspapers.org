In this study, we introduce an online monocular lane mapping approach that solely relies on a single camera and odometry for generating spline-based maps. Our proposed technique models the lane association process as an assignment issue utilizing a bipartite graph, and assigns weights to the edges by incorporating Chamfer distance, pose uncertainty, and lateral sequence consistency. Furthermore, we meticulously design control point initialization, spline parameterization, and optimization to progressively create, expand, and refine splines. In contrast to prior research that assessed performance using self-constructed datasets, our experiments are conducted on the openly accessible OpenLane dataset. The experimental outcomes reveal that our suggested approach enhances lane association and odometry precision, as well as overall lane map quality. We have open-sourced out code11https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/MonoLaneMapping for this project.
