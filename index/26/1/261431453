Traditional datacenter networks have been designed primarily using packet switches. However, due to the end of Moore's Law and Denard Scaling, packet switches face increasing difficulty in scaling to meet network demands without consuming unnecessarily large amounts of power, both within high-density racks[14] and throughout the datacenter[1]. As a result, many emerging network designs have intentionally avoided using packet switches [5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16]. Circuit switches present an exciting alternative to packet switches due to their reduced power consumption[1, 14], and potential to scale to arbitrary bandwidth (in the case of optical switches). While slow reconfiguration times have historically made circuit switches unable to support low-latency traffic, recent circuit switch design have emerged that are capable of nanosecond-scale reconfiguration times, including both electrical [11] and optical [3, 4, 6] switches. Unfortunately, conventional, dynamically-reconfiguring circuit-switched network designs have inherent latencies both for computing which circuits to deploy and for coordinating switches and nodes, limiting the benefits of this new capability.
