The SIGCSE Committee "Expanding the Women-in-Computing Community" will bring together all SIGCSE attendees interested in addressing the gender disparity in computing. Our discussion leaders connect to three of the most important organizations that relate to underrepresentation: ACM-W (Ruth Lennon), CRA-WP (Tracy Camp), and NCWIT (Lecia Barker). The forum provides an important annual meeting for a large group of people who work to increase the representation of women in computing in their separate organizations and who do not customarily have an opportunity to share ideas face-to-face.
