We study existence and computability of finite bases for ideals of polynomials over infinitely many variables. In our setting, variables come from a countable logical structure A, and embeddings from A to A act on polynomials by renaming variables. First, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for A to guarantee the following generalisation of Hilbert's Basis Theorem: every polynomial ideal which is equivariant, i.e. invariant under renaming of variables, is finitely generated. Second, we develop an extension of classical Buchberger's algorithm to compute a Gr√∂bner basis of a given equivariant ideal. This implies decidability of the membership problem for equivariant ideals. Finally, we sketch upon various applications of these results to register automata, Petri nets with data, orbitfinitely generated vector spaces, and orbit-finite systems of linear equations.
