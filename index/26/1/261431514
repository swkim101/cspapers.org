The Domain Name System (DNS) is a key component of Internet-based communication and its privacy has been neglected for years. Recently, DNS over HTTPS has improved the situation by fixing the issue of in-path middleboxes. Further progress has been made with proxy-based solutions such as Oblivious DoH, which separate a user's identity from their DNS queries. However, these solutions rely on non-collusion between DNS resolvers and proxy networks. This paper instead proposes PDNS, a new DNS extension that uses Private Information Retrieval to allow DNS resolvers to operate on blind queries, thereby eliminating any privacy leaks.
