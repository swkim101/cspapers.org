We present EgoTAP, a heatmap-to-3D pose lifting method for highly accurate stereo egocentric 3D pose estimation. Severe self-occlusion and out-of-view limbs in egocentric camera views make accurate pose estimation a challenging problem. To address the challenge, prior methods employ joint heatmaps-probabilistic 2D representations of the body pose, but heatmap-to-3D pose conversion still remains an inaccurate process. We propose a novel heatmap-to-3D lifting method composed of the Grid ViT Encoder and the Propagation Network. The Grid ViT Encoder summarizes joint heatmaps into effective feature embedding using self-attention. Then, the Propagation Network estimates the 3D pose by utilizing skeletal information to better estimate the position of obscure joints. Our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated by a 23.9% reduction of error in an MPJPE metric.
