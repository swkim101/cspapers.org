We develop LeMon for real-time detection of route leaks and explain how we resolved the shortcomings in previous approaches. We perform extensive evaluations of LeMon on heuristically derived datasets as well as on live BGP traffic demonstrating its performance and accuracy. We also confirm the events identified by LeMon with survey of network operators. We provide access1 to our implementation of LeMon and to the datasets.
