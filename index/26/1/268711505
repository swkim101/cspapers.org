The Model AI Assignments session seeks to gather and dis-
seminate the best assignment designs of the Artificial In-
telligence (AI) Education community. Recognizing that as-
signments form the core of student learning experience, we

here present abstracts of five AI assignments from the 2024
session that are easily adoptable, playfully engaging, and

flexible for a variety of instructor needs. Assignment spec-
ifications and supporting resources may be found at http://modelai.gettysburg.edu.
