The sense of belonging among 285 students was explored at four post-secondary institutions in the United States in introductory courses in Computer Science (one course) and Chemistry (three courses). In all four courses instructors employed Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL), a collaborative and student-centered teaching approach. To assess students' sense of belonging, they were asked to complete surveys of seven Likert-scale questions and two open-response questions at the beginning and the end of the Spring'23 semester. The results were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. For the Likert questions, no statistically significant differences were found between pre and post scores. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a sense of belonging at the end of the semester and enrollment in the next course of the sequence. The cohort as a whole indicated that social interaction(s) is the main factor that contributed to their sense of belonging, while course characteristics and perceived self-competence contributed most to feelings of unbelonging. In addition, in the CS course, the sentiment about career goals appeared more frequently than in chemistry classes.
