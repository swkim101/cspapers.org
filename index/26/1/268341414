In this experience paper, we present ALAN, a framework to automate the generation of authentic assessment tasks in networking courses (NC). Using ALAN, all students in a cohort complete a set of assessment tasks generated from the same skeleton, with each student having their own parameters as input. The way we run ALAN assessments fosters students' self-regulation and peer learning and activates students' engagement in learning through assessment. We present three different ALAN assessments. We finally report on student perceptions and satisfaction and reflect on our experience.
