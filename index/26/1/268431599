The COVID-19 pandemic caused many institutions to radically alter the way in which they delivered and evaluated their educational models and frameworks. In the subsequent 3 years, a great deal of research has been conducted in the CS Education community as to the changes that were made and how they impacted learners, educators, and institutions. Building on our existing framework for an interim literature map, this work seeks to provide a systematic and complete mapping of the relevant literature, providing both a tool for practitioners to easily find and synthesize literature, and the basis for researchers to perform a more detailed literature review. This work represents a systematic search, categorization, refinement and validation of a literature mapping on three axes: Intervention, Measurement, and Population. An accompanying bibliography and mapping data file is also available for download.
