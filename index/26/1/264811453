We present a scalable combined localization infrastructure deployment and task planning algorithm for underwater assembly. Infrastructure is autonomously modified to suit the needs of manipulation tasks based on an uncertainty model on the infrastructureâ€™s positional accuracy. Our uncertainty model can be combined with the noise characteristics from multiple sensors. For the task planning problem, we propose a layer-based clustering approach that completes the manipulation tasks one cluster at a time. We employ movable visual fiducial markers as infrastructure and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for manipulation tasks. The proposed task planning algorithm is computationally simple, and we implement it on AUV without any offline computation requirements. Combined hardware experiments and simulations over large datasets show that the proposed technique is scalable to large areas.
