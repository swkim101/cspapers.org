We propose a novel framework PROVEN to PRO babilistically VE rify N eural network’s robustness with statistical guarantees. PROVEN provides probability certiﬁcates of neural network robustness when the input perturbation follow distributional characterization. Notably, PROVEN is derived from current state-of-the-art worst-case neural network robustness veriﬁ-cation frameworks, and therefore it can provide probability certiﬁcates with little computational overhead on top of existing methods such as Fast-Lin , CROWN and CNN-Cert . Experiments on small and large MNIST and CIFAR neural network models demonstrate our probabilistic approach can tighten up robustness certiﬁcate to around 1 : 8 (cid:2) and 3 : 5 (cid:2) with at least a 99 : 99% conﬁdence compared with the worst-case robustness certiﬁcate by CROWN and CNN-Cert .
