With the great success of text-conditioned diffusion models in creative text-to-image generation, various text-driven image editing approaches have attracted the attentions of many researchers. However, previous works mainly focus on discreteness-sensitive instructions such as adding, removing or replacing specific objects, background elements or global styles (i.e., “hard editing”), while generally ignoring subject-binding but semantically fine-changing continuity-sensitive instructions such as actions, poses or adjectives, and so on (i.e., “soft editing”), which hampers generative AI from generating user-customized visual contents. To mitigate this predicament, we propose a spatio-temporal guided adaptive editing algorithm AdapEdit, which realizes adaptive image editing by introducing a soft-attention strategy to dynamically vary the guiding degree from the editing conditions to visual pixels from both temporal and spatial perspectives. Note our approach has a significant advantage in preserving model priors and does not require model training, fine-tuning, extra data, or optimization. We present our results over a wide variety of raw images and editing instructions, demonstrating competitive performance and showing it significantly outperforms the previous approaches.
