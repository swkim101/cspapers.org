Drawing upon theories from communication studies and cognitive psychology, this research develops a multitheoretical model that identifies human and technological factors that predict social media distraction engagement and explains how social media distractions can lead to negative consequences across various tasks. This model is empirically tested using data from a survey of U.S. mobile phone users (N = 1,026). The results from a structural equation modeling analysis support the model’s predictions that a person’s age, fear of missing out, smartphone checking habit strength, and the number of social media applications with notifications enabled all impact a variety of distraction behaviors and consequences. The findings show that communication technology distraction behavior is influenced by a complex intertwining of goal-driven communication and information-seeking behaviors, automatic processes in the brain, and technology affordances.
