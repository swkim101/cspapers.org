Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has become a promising solution for constructing a multi-agent autonomous driving system (MADS) in complex and dense scenarios. But most methods consider agents acting selfishly, which leads to conflict behaviors. Some existing works incorporate the concept of social value orientation (SVO) to promote coordination, but they lack the knowledge of other agents' SVOs, resulting in conservative maneuvers. In this paper, we aim to tackle the mentioned problem by enabling the agents to understand other agents' SVOs. To accomplish this, we propose a two-stage system framework. Firstly, we train a policy by allowing the agents to share their ground truth SVOs to establish a coordinated traffic flow. Secondly, we develop a recognition network that estimates agents' SVOs and integrates it with the policy trained in the first stage. Experiments demonstrate that our developed method significantly improves the performance of the driving policy in MADS compared to two state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.
