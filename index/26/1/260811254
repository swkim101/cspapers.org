In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) shows great promise for a trade-off between independent Q-learning and joint action learning. However, vanilla CTDE methods assumed a fixed number of agents could hardly adapt to real-world scenarios where dynamic team compositions typically suffer from dramatically variant partial observability. Specifically, agents with extensive sight ranges are prone to be affected by trivial environmental substrates, dubbed the “distracted attention” issue; ones with limited observation can hardly sense their teammates, degrading the cooperation quality. In this paper, we propose Complementary Attention for Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (CAMA), which applies a divide-and-conquer strategy on input entities accompanied with the complementary attention of enhancement and replenishment. Con-cretely, to tackle the distracted attention issue, highly contributed entities’ attention is enhanced by the execution-related representation extracted via action prediction with an inverse model. For better out-of-sight-range cooperation, the lowly contributed ones are compressed to brief messages with a conditional mutual information estimator. Our CAMA facilitates stable and sustainable teamwork, which is justified by the impressive results reported on the challenging Star-CraftII, MPE, and Traffic Junction benchmarks.
