Gaze interaction is a promising interaction method to increase variety, challenge, and fun in games.We present “Shed Some Fear”, a 2D platform game including numerous eye-gaze-based interactions. “Shed Some Fear” includes control with eye-gaze and traditional keyboard input. The eye-gaze interactions are partially based on eye exercises reducing digital eye strain but also on employing peripheral vision. By employing eye-gaze as a necessary input mechanism, we explore the effects on and tradeoffs between user enjoyment and digital eye strain in a five-day longitudinal between-subject study (N=17) compared to interaction with a traditional mouse. We found that perceived competence was significantly higher with eye gaze interaction and significantly higher internal eye strain. With this work, we contribute to the not straightforward inclusion of eye tracking as a useful and fun input method for games.
