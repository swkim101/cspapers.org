Affective computing improves rapidly, allowing systems to process human emotions. This enables systems such as conversational agents or social robots to show empathy toward users. While there are various established methods to measure the empathy of humans, there is no reliable and validated instrument to quantify the perceived empathy of interactive systems. Thus, we developed the Perceived Empathy of Technology Scale (PETS) to assess and compare how empathic users perceive technology. We followed a standardized multi-phase process of developing and validating scales. In total, we invited 30 experts for item generation, 324 participants for item selection, and 396 additional participants for scale validation. We developed our scale using 22 scenarios with opposing empathy levels, ensuring the scale is universally applicable. This resulted in the PETS, a 10-item, 2-factor scale. The PETS allows designers and researchers to evaluate and compare the perceived empathy of interactive systems rapidly.
