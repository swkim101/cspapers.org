The theme of the MDMKDD'13 workshop is\mining large scale rich content in a networked society." The workshop brought together experts in computational analysis on digital media content and multimedia databases, as well as knowledge engineers and domain experts from different applied disciplines with potential in multimedia data mining. The new theme of this year's workshop highlights the integration of multimedia in people's daily lives. With the rapid growth of mobile devices and personalized data, we wanted the workshop to focus on mining large scale rich content which is abundant in today's networked societies. 
 
Vast amount of multimedia data are produced, shared, and accessed everyday in various social platforms. These multimedia objects (images, videos, texts, tags, etc.) represent rich, multifaceted recordings of human behavior in the networked society, which lead to a range of social applications such as consumer behavior forecasting, social driven advertising / business, local knowledge discovery (e.g., for tourism or shopping), detection of emergent news events and trends, and so on. In addition to techniques for mining single media items, all of these applications require new methods for extracting robust features and discovering stable relationships among different media modalities and the users, in a dynamic, social context rich, and likely noisy environment. 
 
Multimedia is designed to stimulate the human senses beyond text. Using the rich content in multiple media types, we can capture the full experience of an event. Mining the data within media rich platforms and immersive environments (such as online communities, blogs, social networks, and virtual worlds) integrates the digital and physical experiences and information. The aim of the MDMKDD'13 workshop is to explore the role that multimedia data mining can play to enhance virtual society experiences.
