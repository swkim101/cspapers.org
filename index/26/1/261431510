Despite the central importance of DNS, numerous attacks and vulnerabilities are regularly discovered. The root of the problem is the ambiguity and tremendous complexity of DNS protocol specifications, amid a rapidly evolving Internet infrastructure. To counteract the vicious break-and-fix cycle for improving DNS infrastructure, we instigate a foundational approach: we construct the first formal semantics of end-to-end name resolution, a collection of components for the formal analyses of both qualitative and quantitative properties, and an automated tool for discovering DoS attacks. Our formal framework represents an important step towards a substantially more secure and reliable DNS infrastructure.
