Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising technique for underwater acoustic communications due to its high spectral efficiency and robustness to multipath fading. However, OFDM systems are sensitive to timing and frequency synchronization errors. This paper proposes a novel scheme for joint time and frequency synchronization in OFDM-based underwater acoustics communication systems. The proposed scheme is based on the application of a conventional pilot and a special pilot, which is named Carrier Frequency Pilot, to detect the information of carrier frequency offset, and the sampling position. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by using computer simulations. The results show that the proposed scheme can provide accurate time and frequency synchronization results. It significantly outperforms the conventional schemes in terms of symbol error rate.
