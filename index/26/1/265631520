In this research article we report the potentials of chitin-based silver nanoparticles (chitin AgNPs) derived from Indian mimic goatfish (Mulloidichthys ayliffe) scales as an effective food preservation agent. The study comprehensively presents the multifaceted attributes of chitin AgNPs, including their synthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial properties. Chitin yield from M. ayliffe scales and three-spot swimming crab (P. sanguinolentus) exoskeleton was determined, with the insoluble content quantified. FTIR analysis unveiled distinct absorption peaks for chitin, and scanning electron microscopy revealed the ultrastructure of chitin from both the sources. Using UV–visible spectroscopy, the biosynthesis of AgNPs was accomplished and characterized, with the color shift of the solution serving as proof of a successful synthesis. UV–vis spectra provided insights into nanoparticle size and shape. SEM micrographs exhibited spherical particle morphology, while FTIR spectra indicated amino group interactions contributing to AgNP stabilization. The antimicrobial potential of chitin AgNPs was assessed against the food pathogen, Vibrio spp. Chitin films displayed significant antimicrobial activity, particularly AgNP-synthesized chitin from M. ayliffe scales, demonstrated the highest Vibrio spp. inhibition activity. Furthermore, chitin AgNPs were incorporated into the common chili, Capsicum annuum and the tomato, Solanum lycopersicum to extend their shelf life at room temperature. This study reveals the efficacy of chitin AgNPs from M. ayliffe scales as potent agents for food preservation, offering insights into their physical, mechanical, and antimicrobial attributes. The application of chitin AgNPs to perishable food items highlights their potential in enhancing shelf life and quality, opening innovative avenues for sustainable food preservation.
