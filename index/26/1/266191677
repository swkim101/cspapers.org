As a critical clue of video super-resolution (VSR), inter-frame alignment significantly impacts overall performance. However, accurate pixel-level alignment is a challenging task due to the intricate motion interweaving in the video. In response to this issue, we introduce a novel paradigm for VSR named Semantic Lens, predicated on semantic priors drawn from degraded videos. Specifically, video is modeled as instances, events, and scenes via a Semantic Extractor. Those semantics assist the Pixel Enhancer in understanding the recovered contents and generating more realistic visual results. The distilled global semantics embody the scene information of each frame, while the instance-specific semantics assemble the spatial-temporal contexts related to each instance. Furthermore, we devise a Semantics-Powered Attention Cross-Embedding (SPACE) block to bridge the pixel-level features with semantic knowledge, composed of a Global Perspective Shifter (GPS) and an Instance-Specific Semantic Embedding Encoder (ISEE). Concretely, the GPS module generates pairs of affine transformation parameters for pixel-level feature modulation conditioned on global semantics. After that the ISEE module harnesses the attention mechanism to align the adjacent frames in the instance-centric semantic space. In addition, we incorporate a simple yet effective pre-alignment module to alleviate the difficulty of model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing state-of-the-art VSR methods.
