Knowing the physical location of users is a prerequisite for location-aware computing. Much work has gone into the user location problem in the context of wireless networks and mobile hosts. In this paper, we argue that location-aware computing is also relevant for stationary, wireline Internet hosts. We present and evaluate several algorithms for determining the geographic location of Internet hosts. The rst algorithm infers location based on the DNS names of the host of interest or other nearby network nodes. The second uses network delay measurements from geographically distributed locations to triangulate the coordinates of the host. The third couples partial host-tolocation mapping information obtained (indirectly) from Web sites with BGP routing information to infer location of the host of interest. In each case, we analyze the accuracy of the algorithm and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. We also combine these individual algorithms to obtain a composite algorithm that builds on the strengths of each.
