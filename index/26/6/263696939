Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging technique that has been applied to more and more areas such as gaming, remote conference, and education. Since VR user interface has very different characteristics compared with traditional graphic user interface (GUI), VR applications also require new testing techniques for quality assurance. Recently, some frameworks (e.g., VRTest) have been proposed to automate VR user interface testing by automatically controlling the player camera. However, their testing strategies are not able to address VR-specific testing challenges such as object occlusion and movement. In this paper, we propose a novel testing technique called VRGuide to explore VR scenes more efficiently. In particular, VRGuide adapts a computer geometry technique called Cut Extension to optimize the camera routes for covering all interact-able objects. We compared the testing strategy with VRTest on eight top VR software projects with scenes. The results show that VRGuide is able to achieve higher test coverage upon testing timeout in two of the projects, and achieve saturation coverage with averagely 31% less testing time than VRTest on the remaining six projects. Furthermore, VRGuide detected and reported four unknown bugs confirmed by developers, only one of which is also detected by VRTest.
