The goal of selective prediction is to allow an a model to abstain when it may not be able to deliver a reliable prediction, which is important in safety-critical contexts. Existing approaches to selective prediction typically require access to the internals of a model, require retraining a model or study only unimodal models. However, the most powerful models (e.g. GPT-4) are typically only available as black boxes with inaccessible internals, are not retrainable by end-users, and are frequently used for multimodal tasks. We study the possi-bility of selective prediction for vision-language models in a realistic, black-box setting. We propose using the principle of neighborhood consistency to identify unreliable responses from a black-box vision-language model in question answering tasks. We hypothesize that given only a visual question and model response, the consistency of the model's responses over the neighborhood of a visual question will indicate re-liability. It is impossible to directly sample neighbors in feature space in a black-box setting. Instead, we show that it is possible to use a smaller proxy model to approximately sample from the neighborhood. We find that neighborhood consistency can be used to identify model responses to vi-sual questions that are likely unreliable, even in adversarial settings or settings that are out-of-distribution to the proxy model.
