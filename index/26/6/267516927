Machine unlearning is an emerging need that aims to remove the influence of deleted data from a learned model in a timely manner. Thus, unlearning is important for privacy and security in data management. Nevertheless, existing machine unlearning methods fail to perform exactly and efficiently in a federated setting. In this paper, we study the unlearning problem in federated learning, which provides a data deletion mechanism in the federated setting. First of all, a quantized federated learning (Q-FL) algorithm is developed to facilitate exact unlearning. Based on the quantized federated learning system, an exact and efficient federated unlearning (Exact-Fun) algorithm is designed to realize the goal of data deletion. Through theoretic analysis and experimental evaluation, our proposed methods not only have the desired unlearning effectiveness but also achieve high unlearning efficiency compared with the existing works.
