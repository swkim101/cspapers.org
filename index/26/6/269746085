ml-machine.org is a web- and micro:bit-based educational tool for building machine learning models designed to enable more widespread teaching of AI literacy in secondary education. It has been designed as a research product in collaboration with partners from the educational sector, including the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and the Micro:bit Educational Foundation. ml-machine.org currently has more than 5000 unique users and is used in schools and teacher training. It is publicly available and promoted on the broadcasting corporationâ€™s platforms. We describe the two-year process of developing and disseminating ml-machine.org. Based on interviews with partners and educators, we report on how ml-machine.org supports inquiry into the adoption and appropriation of such educational tools. We also provide insights on working with formal education infrastructures in order to scale and integrate a research product into teacher practices. Based on these experiences, we propose infrastructure as a novel quality of research products.
