Retrofitting techniques, which inject external resources into word representations, have compensated for the weakness of distributed representations in semantic and relational knowledge between words. However, the previous methods require additional external resources and strongly depend on the lexicon. To address the issues, we propose a simple extension of extrofitting, self-supervised extrofitting: ex-trofitting by its own word vector distribution. Our methods improve the vanilla embeddings on all of word similarity tasks without any ex-ternal resources. Moreover, the method is also e ff ective in various languages, which implies that our method will be useful in lexicon-scarce languages. As downstream tasks, we show its benefits in dialogue state tracking and text classification tasks, reporting better and generalized results compared to other word vector specialization methods. 1
