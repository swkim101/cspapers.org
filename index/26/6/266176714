Text image machine translation (TIMT) which translates source language text images into target language texts has attracted intensive attention in recent years. Although the end-to-end TIMT model directly generates target translation from encoded text image features with an efficient architecture, it lacks the recognized source language information resulting in a decrease in translation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Cross-lingual Interactive Model (CCIM) to incorporate source language information by synchronously generating source language and target language results through an interactive attention mechanism between two language de-coders. Extensive experimental results have shown the interactive decoder significantly out-performs end-to-end TIMT models and has faster decoding speed with smaller model size than cascade models. 1
