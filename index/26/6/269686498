Conditional graph generation is crucial and challenging since the conditional distribution of graph topology and feature is complicated and the semantic information is hard to capture by the generative model. In this work, we propose a novel graph conditional generative model, Graph Principal Flow Network (GPrinFlowNet), which enables us to progressively generate high-quality graphs from low- to high-frequency components for a given graph label. We show that GPrinFlowNet follows a coarse-to-fine resolution generation curriculum, which enables it to capture subtle semantic information by generating intermediate graphs with high mutual information relative to the graph label. Extensive experiments and ablation studies showcase that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing conditional graph generation models.
