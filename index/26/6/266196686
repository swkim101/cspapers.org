Legged animals have developed a variety of modes of locomotion to adapt to the diverse and unknown terrain challenges posed in the natural world. Legged robots, however, have been largely limited to specializing in one domain, with few that have endeavored to bridge the gap between two. In this work we present the Scansorial, Terrestrial, and Aquatic Robot Quadruped (STARQ), a novel legged robot capable of bridging three different domains with three modes of locomotion: walking, climbing, and swimming. In this study we describe model-based design techniques as well as design innovations that have made multimodal locomotion possible including waterproof hips for 2-DOF high torque legs, legs capable of effective power transmission in three modes, and bi-directionally compliant feet for walking and attaching to vertical surfaces. To demonstrate the robot's capabilities we present locomotion test data including speed and cost of transport in each of these domains. We also demonstrate the capability to transition from walking to swimming in a natural environment.
