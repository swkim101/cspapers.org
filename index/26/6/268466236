In 2022, the IEEE Computer Society provided funding for a hardware-security based Capture the Flag competition. This paper reports my experiences orchestrating the CTF and draws comparisons to two software-security based CTFs at the same institution in adjacent semesters. Much of the literature in this area is focused on selecting problems to enhance the skills of the attendees or generate outcomes that persist. In contrast, this paper is intended to provide tips, warnings, and other general advice for first time, or niche CTF organizers.
