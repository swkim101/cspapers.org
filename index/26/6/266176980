In Psychotherapy, maladaptive schemas – negative perceptions that an individual has of the self, others, or the world that endure despite ob-jective reality – often lead to resistance to treatments and relapse of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks etc. Identification of early maladaptive schemas (EMS) is thus a crucial step during Schema Therapy-based counseling sessions, where patients go through a detailed and lengthy EMS questionnaire. However, such an approach is not practical in ‘offline’ counseling scenarios, such as community QA forums which are gaining popularity for people seeking mental health support. In this paper, we investigate both LLM (Large Language Models) and non-LLM approaches for identifying EMS labels using resources from Schema Therapy. Our evaluation indicates that recent LLMs can be effective for identifying EMS but their predictions lack explainability and are too sensitive to precise ‘prompts’. Both LLM and non-LLM methods are unable to reliably address the null cases, i.e. cases with no EMS labels. However, we posit that the two approaches show complementary properties and together, they can be used to further devise techniques for EMS identification.
