Acoustic foundation models, fine-tuned for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), suffer from performance degradation in wild acoustic test settings when deployed in real-world scenarios. Stabilizing online Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) under these conditions remains an open and unexplored question. Existing wild vision TTA methods often fail to handle speech data effectively due to the unique characteristics of high-entropy speech frames, which are unreliably filtered out even when containing crucial semantic content. Furthermore, unlike static vision data, speech signals follow short-term consistency, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this work, we propose a novel wild acoustic TTA method tailored for ASR fine-tuned acoustic foundation models. Our method, Confidence-Enhanced Adaptation, performs frame-level adaptation using a confidence-aware weight scheme to avoid filtering out essential information in high-entropy frames. Additionally, we apply consistency regularization during test-time optimization to leverage the inherent short-term consistency of speech signals. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines under various wild acoustic test settings, including Gaussian noise, environmental sounds, accent variations, and sung speech.
