We seek to enable classic processing of continuous ultra-sparse spatiotemporal data generated by event-based sensors with dense machine learning models. We propose a novel hybrid pipeline composed of asynchronous sensing and synchronous processing that combines several ideas: (1) an embedding based on PointNet models -- the ALERT module -- that can continuously integrate new and dismiss old events thanks to a leakage mechanism, (2) a flexible readout of the embedded data that allows to feed any downstream model with always up-to-date features at any sampling rate, (3) exploiting the input sparsity in a patch-based approach inspired by Vision Transformer to optimize the efficiency of the method. These embeddings are then processed by a transformer model trained for object and gesture recognition. Using this approach, we achieve performances at the state-of-the-art with a lower latency than competitors. We also demonstrate that our asynchronous model can operate at any desired sampling rate.
