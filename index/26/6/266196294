Human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) methods actively integrate human knowledge to create reward functions for various robotic tasks. Learning from preferences shows promise as alleviates the requirement of demonstrations by querying humans on state-action sequences. However, the limited granularity of sequence-based approaches complicates temporal credit assignment. The amount of human querying is contingent on query quality, as redundant queries result in excessive human involvement. This paper addresses the often-overlooked aspect of query selection, which is closely related to active learning (AL). We propose a novel query selection approach that leverages variational autoencoder (VAE) representations of state sequences. In this manner, we formulate queries that are diverse in nature while simultaneously taking into account reward model estimations. We compare our approach to the current state-of-the-art query selection methods in preference-based RL, and find ours to be either on-par or more sample efficient through extensive benchmarking on simulated environments relevant to robotics. Lastly, we conduct an online study to verify the effectiveness of our query selection approach with real human feedback and examine several metrics related to human effort.
