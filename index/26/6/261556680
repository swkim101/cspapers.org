Online Continual Learning (OCL) addresses the problem of training neural networks on a continuous data stream where multiple classification tasks emerge in sequence. In contrast to offline Continual Learning, data can be seen only once in OCL, which is a very severe constraint. In this context, replay-based strategies have achieved impressive results and most state-of-the-art approaches heavily depend on them. While Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been extensively used in offline Continual Learning, it remains under-exploited in OCL, despite its high potential. In this paper, we analyze the challenges in applying KD to OCL and give empirical justifications. We introduce a direct yet effective methodology for applying Momentum Knowledge Distillation (MKD) to many flagship OCL methods and demonstrate its capabilities to enhance existing approaches. In addition to improving existing state-of-the-art accuracy by more than $10\%$ points on ImageNet100, we shed light on MKD internal mechanics and impacts during training in OCL. We argue that similar to replay, MKD should be considered a central component of OCL. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Nicolas1203/mkd_ocl}.
