The use of register transfer level (RTL) simulation is critical for hardware design in various aspects including verification, debugging, and design space exploration. Among various RTL simulation techniques, cycle-accurate software RTL simulation is the most prevalent approach due to its easy accessibility and high flexibility. The current state-of-the-art cycle-accurate simulators mainly use full-cycle RTL simulation that models RTL as a directed acyclic computational graph and traverses the graph in each simulation cycle. However, the adoption of full-cycle simulation makes them mainly focus on optimizing the logic evaluation within one simulation cycle, neglecting temporal optimization opportunities.In this work, we propose Khronos, a cycle-accurate software RTL simulation tool that optimizes the memory accesses to improve simulation speed. RTL simulation often involves a large number of register buffers, making memory access one of the performance bottlenecks. The key insight of Khronos is that a large number of memory accesses across consecutive clock cycles exhibit temporal localities, by fusing those accesses we can reduce the memory traffic and thus improve the overall performance. In order to do this, we first propose a queue-connected operation graph to capture temporal data dependencies. After that, we reschedule the operations and fuse the state access across cycles, reducing the pressure on the host memory hierarchy. To minimize the number of memory accesses, we formulate a linear-constraint non-linear objective integer programming problem and solve it by linearizing to a minimum-cost flow problem iteratively. Experiments show that Khronos can save up to 88% of cache access and achieve an average acceleration of 2.0x (up to 4.3x) for various hardware designs compared to state-of-the-art simulators.CCS CONCEPTS• Hardware → Simulation and emulation.
