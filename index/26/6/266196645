Due to the high complexity of a football match, the opponents' strategies are variable and unknown. Thus predicting the opponents' future intentions accurately based on current situation is crucial for football players' decision-making. To better anticipate the opponents and learn more effective strategies, a deconfounded opponent intention inference (DOII) method for football multi-player policy learning is proposed in this paper. Specifically, opponents' intentions are inferred by an opponent intention supervising module. Furthermore, for some confounders which affect the causal relationship among the players and the opponents, a decon-founded trajectory graph module is designed to mitigate the influence of these confounders and increase the accuracy of the inferences about opponents' intentions. Besides, an opponent-based incentive module is designed to improve the players' sensitivity to the opponents' intentions and further to train reasonable players' strategies. Representative results indicate that DOII can effectively improve the performance of players' strategies in the Google Research Football environment, which validates the superiority of the proposed method.
