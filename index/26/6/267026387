Multi-view hierarchical clustering (MCHC) plays a pivotal role in comprehending the structures within multi-view data, which hinges on the skillful interaction between hierarchical feature learning and comprehensive representation learning across multiple views. However, existing methods often overlook this interplay due to the simple heuristic agglomerative strategies or the decoupling of multi-view representation learning and hierarchical modeling, thus leading to insufficient representation learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Multi-view Hierarchical Clustering Network (MHCN) model by performing simultaneous multi-view learning and hierarchy modeling. Specifically, to uncover efficient tree-like structures among all views, we derive multiple hyperbolic autoencoders with latent space mapped onto the Poincar√© ball. Then, the corresponding hyperbolic embeddings are further regularized to achieve the multi-view representation learning principles for both view-common and view-private information, and to ensure hyperbolic uniformity with a well-balanced hierarchy for better interpretability. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic multi-view datasets have demonstrated that our method can achieve state-of-the-art hierarchical clustering performance, and empower the clustering results with good interpretability.
