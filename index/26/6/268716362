Aspect prediction (AP) and sentiment prediction (SP) are representative applications in fine-grained sentiment anal- ysis. They can be considered as sequential tasks, where AP identifies mentioned aspects in a sentence, and SP infers fine-grained sentiments for these aspects. Recent models perform the aspect-sentiment prediction in a joint man-ner, but heavily rely on the feature interactions of aspect and sentiment. One drawback is that they ignore correlation strength varies between aspect features and sentiment fea- tures across different sentences, and employ a fixed feature interaction strategy may limit effective knowledge transfer across tasks. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Inter-task Feature Interaction framework, AIFI, for joint aspect-sentiment prediction. Specifically, we introduce a novel contrast-based alignment method based on contrastive learning. Our approach considers the AP-specific and SP-specific representations of a given sentence as a positive pair, while representation of another random sentence serves as a negative example. Moreover, we propose an inter-task feature correlation network to predict the contrast strength, which is determined by the temperature coefficient in the InfoNCE loss. This dynamic correlation adjustment enhances modelâ€™s ability to capture proper feature interactions more efficiently. Experimental results on three datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.
