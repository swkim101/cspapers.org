Fair division is a topic that has significant social and industrial value. In this work, we study allocations that simultaneously satisfy definitions of fairness and efficiency: EFx and PO. First, we prove that the problem of finding such allocations is NP-hard for two agents. Then, we propose a concept for an ILP-based solving algorithm, the running time of which depends on the number of EFx allocations. We generate input data and analyze algorithm's running time based on the results obtained.
