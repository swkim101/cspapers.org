Spontaneous neural activity, crucial in memory, learning, and spatial navigation, often manifests itself as repetitive spatiotemporal patterns. Despite their importance, analyzing these patterns in large neural recordings remains challenging due to a lack of efficient and scalable detection methods. Addressing this gap, we introduce convSeq, an unsupervised method that employs backpropagation for optimizing spatiotemporal filters that effectively identify these neural patterns. Our method's performance is validated on various synthetic data and real neural recordings, revealing spike sequences with unprecedented scalability and efficiency. Significantly surpassing existing methods in speed, convSeq sets a new standard for analyzing spontaneous neural activity, potentially advancing our understanding of information processing in neural circuits.
