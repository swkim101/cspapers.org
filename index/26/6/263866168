The combinatorial space of translation derivations in phrase-based statistical machine translation is given by the intersection between a translation lattice and a target language model. We replace this intractable intersection by a tractable relaxation which incorporates a low-order upperbound on the language model. Exact optimisation is achieved through a coarseto-fine strategy with connections to adaptive rejection sampling. We perform exact optimisation with unpruned language models of order 3 to 5 and show searcherror curves for beam search and cube pruning on standard test sets. This is the first work to tractably tackle exact optimisation with language models of orders higher than 3.
