In this paper, we present a novel clothoid-based visual servoing method for controlling the shape of a variable length continuum manipulator. Clothoids are curves with linearly changing curvature. They allow us to obtain a smooth representation of a continuum manipulator's shape in a compact form with few parameters. Using this curve model, we generate image features that are used in an adaptive visual servoing method to drive the robot to a desired shape. The adaptive algorithm estimates and updates a local interaction matrix that maps the rate of change in clothoid features to actuator velocities of the continuum manipulator. As such, the method does not require any robot model or even actuator encoder measurements and only uses the visual clothoid features to control the robot shape. A unique advantage of using our clothoid representation is being able to generate reference shape curves without the need for taking images of the robot at the desired shapes. Experiments demonstrate successful shape and end effector pose convergence for a diverse set of references. Our repeatability tests demonstrate that the system performance is consistent. Notably, we also present the first results in the literature for the vision-based shape control of a variable length continuum robot, extending and contracting to achieve the desired shape.
