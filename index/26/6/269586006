Underlying humanity’s social abilities is the brain’s capacity to interpersonally synchronize. Experimental, lab-based neuropsychological studies have demonstrated that inter-brain synchrony can be technologically mediated. However, knowledge in deploying these technologies in-the-wild and studying their user experience, an area HCI excels in, is lacking. With advances in mobile brain sensing and stimulation, we identify an opportunity for HCI to investigate the in-the-wild augmentation of inter-brain synchrony. We designed “PsiNet,” the first wearable brain-to-brain system aimed at augmenting inter-brain synchrony in-the-wild. Participant interviews illustrated three themes that describe the user experience of modulated inter-brain synchrony: hyper-awareness; relational interaction; and the dissolution of self. We contribute these three themes to assist HCI theorists’ discussions of inter-brain synchrony experiences. We also present three practical design tactics for HCI practitioners designing inter-brain synchrony, and hope that our work guides a HCI future of brain-to-brain experiences which fosters human connection.
