The 3SUM problem represents a class of problems conjectured to require fi(n2) time to solve, where n is the size of the input. Given two polygons P and Q in IR2, we show that some variants of the decision problem: whether there exists a transformation of P that makes it contained in Q, are 3suM-hard. We also show that finding the translation that minimizes the Hausdorff distance between two segment sets is 3sUM-hard.
