Developing a full coreference system able to run all the way from raw text to semantic interpretation is a considerable engineering effort, yet there is very limited availability of off-the shelf tools for researchers whose interests are not in coreference, or for researchers who want to concentrate on a specific aspect of the problem. We present BART, a highly modular toolkit for developing coreference applications. In the Johns Hopkins workshop on using lexical and encyclopedic knowledge for entity disambiguation, the toolkit was used to extend a reimplementation of the Soon et al. (2001) proposal with a variety of additional syntactic and knowledge-based features, and experiment with alternative resolution processes, preprocessing tools, and classifiers.
