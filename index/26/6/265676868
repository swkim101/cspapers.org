On behalf of SEKE'02 Organizing Committee, we welcome you to the fourteenth International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering. Since its first edition, dating back to 1989, the conference has acquired momentum, and it is the premier international meeting for people working in this interdisciplinary field. The general focus is on that common ground between Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering where it is possible to share methods and results, and there is the perspective of sketching directions for future research.The program of this edition is especially rich. Along with the regular sessions, it includes 4 keynote addresses, 2 theme workshops, and a tutorial. A European session is also planned as an occasion for representatives of the EU to illustrate the guidelines for the preparation of projects for the VI Framework Program of the Union.After ten years, we have been pleased to organize the SEKE conference in Italy for the second time. Just like the former edition that we held in Capri, we have carefully chosen the enchanted location offered by the isle of Ischia to allow participants to enjoy their stay and provide a unique scenario for scientific discussion.
