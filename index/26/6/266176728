End-to-end multilingual entity linking (MEL) is concerned with identifying multilingual entity mentions and their corresponding entity IDs in a knowledge base. Prior efforts assume that entity mentions are given and skip the entity mention detection step due to a lack of high-quality multilingual training corpora. To overcome this limitation, we propose mReFinED, the first end-to-end MEL model. Additionally, we propose a bootstrapping mention detection framework that enhances the quality of training corpora. Our experimental results demonstrated that mReFinED outperformed the best existing work in the end-to-end MEL task while being 44 times faster.
