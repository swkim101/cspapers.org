Freedom to innovate is one of the key motivators for many technical workers. Unfortunately, although innovation is often trumpeted as a key company attribute, it seems that many organizations struggle to provide the necessary environment - even those organizations whose original claim to fame lay in their ability to innovate. This panel will look at the barriers to innovation that occur in a variety of environments: large, well-established organizations, start-ups, academia, standards bodies and the open source community. Panelists will propose a set of technical and non-technical techniques that can be used to foster innovation in even the most lethargic or hostile environment.
