Security courses often focus on individual attacks and defenses, and lack practical experience with secure system design. Consequently, such courses rarely address the societal implications of security breaches. We propose an inductive teaching approach to address these challenges in teaching security engineering. To this end, we design a course that focuses on electronic voting (e-voting) as a practical application of security engineering. Our course integrates relevant technical content through experiential learning, adversarial thinking skills through a group project, and societal factors with a student debate. Our approach has seen success in engaging students in both distance-learning and in-person teaching while preparing them for real-world security challenges.
