In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the field of digital avatar research, towards modeling, animating and reconstructing clothed human representations, as a key step towards creating realistic avatars. However, current 3D cloth generation methods are garment specific or trained completely on synthetic data, hence lacking fine details and realism. In this work, we make a step to-wards automatic realistic garment design and propose De-sign2Cloth, a high fidelity 3D generative model trained on a real world dataset from more than 2000 subject scans. To provide vital contribution to the fashion industry, we developed a user-friendly adversarial model capable of gener-ating diverse and detailed clothes simply by drawing a 2D cloth mask. Under a series of both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we showcase that Design2Cloth outper-forms current state-of-the-art cloth generative models by a large margin. In addition to the generative properties of our network, we showcase that the proposed method can be used to achieve high quality reconstructions from single in-the-wild images and 3D scans. Dataset, code and pre-trained model will become publicly available.11Project Page: https://jiali-zheng.github.io/Design2Cloth/
