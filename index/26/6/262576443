Many ubiquitous computing technologies have been developed, but we are not yet living in the world Mark Weiser envisioned---seamless integration of electronics into everyday objects. One of the reasons is that the systems being developed have various energy constraints. I propose one approach to solve this problem, a concept called Compute-proximal Energy Harvesting, and applied it to the automobiles. In carrying out this work, I realized various barriers associated with energy harvesting, and I propose a comprehensive energy harvesting tools to overcome them.
