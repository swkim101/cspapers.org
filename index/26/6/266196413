Recent studies show that some security features that blockchains grant to decentralized networks on the internet can be ported to swarm robotics. Although the integration of blockchain technology and swarm robotics shows great promise, thus far, research has been limited to proof-of-concept scenarios where the blockchain-based mechanisms are tailored to a particular swarm task and operating environment. In this study, we propose a generic framework based on a blockchain smart contract that enables robot swarms to achieve secure consensus in an arbitrary observation space. This means that our framework can be customized to fit different swarm robotics missions, while providing methods to identify and neutralize Byzantine robots, that is, robots which exhibit detrimental behaviours stemming from faults or malicious tampering.
