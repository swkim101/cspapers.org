Operating in narrow spaces is an important challenge in the development of robots. Redundant manipulators are one way to solve this problem, but their mechanism design and control method still have much room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a coiled cable-conduit-driven hyper-redundant manipulator (C-CDHRM) with great slenderness and flexibility. In terms of mechanism design, it considers both compactness and operability. By imitating the structure and behavior of a constricting snake, it can be uncoiled sequentially from a coiled storage state, led by the head. In terms of control methods, we propose a multi-layer control system that can make remote operations more accurate and reliable. On the one hand, guiding, segmenting, and following the path overcome the planning ambiguity caused by redundancy. On the other hand, conduit transmission modeling and cable length correction overcome the nonlinear mapping of cable-driven joints and were verified in experiments. Through tests, the mobile integrated system composed of C-CDHRM has an excellent performance in operation precision and accuracy, ensuring safety and accessibility in narrow spaces. Finally, in field experiments, the inspection and cleaning of various types of electrical equipment have been successfully completed, showing excellent application prospects.
