We present Poprawa, a library to help instructors who use alternative grading techniques prepare and securely disseminate progress reports to their students. Alternative grading techniques such as mastery grading, specifications grading, and "ungrading'' are becoming increasingly popular. However, they are not well-supported by many learning management systems (LMS). Given the current state of LMS gradebooks, many instructors prefer to track student progress using a spreadsheet. Doing so presents two challenges: (1) It can be tedious and time-consuming to generate progress reports that reflect the instructor's unique grading criteria, and (2) it can be difficult to securely provide students with electronic access to those reports. The Poprawa library addresses both issues. (1) It provides a simple means of accessing data in an Excel spreadsheet so that instructors can quickly and easily write code to construct progress reports customized for the course; and (2) it utilizes git and GitHub Classroom to provide a workflow that automatically uploads progress reports to a each student's private repository where he or she can conveniently and securely view it. Poprawa also provides hooks to allow instructors to disseminate progress reports without using git and/or GitHub.
