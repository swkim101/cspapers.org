This paper explores Deployment Authorization (DPA) as a means of restricting the generalization capabilities of vision models on certain domains to protect intellectual property. Nevertheless, the current advancements in DPA are predominantly confined to fully supervised settings. Such settings require the accessibility of annotated images from any unauthorized domain, rendering the DPA approaches impractical for real-world applications due to its exorbitant costs.To address this issue, we propose Source-Only Deployment Authorization (SDPA), which assumes that only authorized domains are accessible during training phases, and the model’s performance on unauthorized domains must be suppressed in inference stages. Drawing inspiration from distributional robust statistics, we present a lightweight method called Domain-Specified Optimization (DSO) for SDPA that degrades the model’s generalization over a divergence ball. DSO comes with theoretical guarantees on the convergence property and its authorization performance. As a complementary of SDPA, we also propose Target-Combined Deployment Authorization (TPDA), where unauthorized domains are partially accessible, and simplify the DSO method to a perturbation operation on the pseudo predictions, referred to as Target-Dependent Domain-Specified Optimization (TDSO). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DSO and TDSO methods through extensive experiments on six image benchmarks, achieving dominant performance on both SDPA and TDPA settings.
