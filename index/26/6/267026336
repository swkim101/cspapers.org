In this paper, we focus on the mural-restoration task, which aims to detect damaged regions in the mural and repaint them automatically. Different from traditional image restoration tasks like in/out/blind-painting and image renovation, the corrupted mural suffers from more complicated degradation. However, existing mural-restoration methods and datasets still focus on simple degradation like masking. Such a significant gap prevents mural-restoration from being applied to real scenarios. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a systematic framework to simulate the physical process for damaged murals and provide a new benchmark dataset for mural-restoration. Limited by the simplification of the data synthesis process, the previous mural-restoration methods suffer from poor performance in our proposed dataset. To handle this problem, we propose the Attention Diffusion Framework (ADF) for this challenging task. Within the framework, a damage attention map module is proposed to estimate the damage extent. Facing the diversity of defects, we propose a series of loss functions to choose repair strategies adaptively. Finally, experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of both mural synthesis and restoration.
