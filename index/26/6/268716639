An exoplanet is a planet, which is not a part of our solar system.
Whether life exists in one or more of these exoplanets
has fascinated humans for centuries. NASAâ€™s Kepler Space
Telescope has discovered more than 70% of known exoplanets
in our universe. However, manually determining whether a
Kepler light curve indicates an exoplanet or not becomes infeasible
with the large volume of data. Due to this, we propose
a deep learning-based strategy to automatically classify
a Kepler light curve. More specifically, we first convert the
light curve time series into its corresponding Markov Transition
Field (MTF) image and then classify it. Results show
that the accuracy of the proposed technique is 99.39%, which
is higher than all current state-of-the-art approaches.
