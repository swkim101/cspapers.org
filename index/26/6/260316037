When making recommendations, there is an apparent trade-off between the goals of accuracy (to recommend items a user is most likely to want) and diversity (to recommend items representing a range of categories). As such, real-world recommender systems often explicitly incorporate diversity into recommendations, at the cost of accuracy. We study the accuracy-diversity trade-off by bringing in a third concept: user utility. We argue that accuracy is misaligned with user utility because it fails to incorporate a user's consumption constraints: at any given time, users can typically only use at most a few recommended items (e.g., dine at one restaurant, or watch a couple of movies). In a theoretical model, we show that utility-maximizing recommendations---when accounting for consumption constraints---are naturally diverse due to diminishing returns of recommending similar items. Therefore, while increasing diversity may come at the cost of accuracy, it can also help align accuracy-based recommendations toward the more fundamental objective of user utility. Our theoretical results yield practical guidance into how recommendations should incorporate diversity to serve user ends.
