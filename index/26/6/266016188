It is our great pleasure to welcome everyone to the 2015 ACM Workshop on Novel Web Search Interfaces and Systems (NWSearch'15) in Melbourne, Australia. 
 
The workshop started out of the need for a venue to discuss the latest research and development in the area of novel Web search interfaces. Given the diversity of the topics involved and the fact that the topic of the workshop overlaps with the areas of information retrieval, user interfaces, Web search and maybe databases, our goal has been to gather researchers and practitioners in those diverse fields to tackle and discuss the problems of common interest as they relate to the topic of this workshop. 
 
The call for papers attracted 6 submissions from Australia, China, Czech Republic, Greece, and United States. Each submission was reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Based on those reviews, four submissions were selected to be included in the program. 
 
We are also pleased to have two insightful keynotes by leading researchers in our field. These talks set the tone and directions for possible future work in the area.
