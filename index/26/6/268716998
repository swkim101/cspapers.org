Artificial intelligence system architects can increase user trust by designing systems that are inherently transparent. We propose the idea of representing an AI system as an amalgamation of the AI Model (algorithms), data (input and output, including outcomes), and the user interface with visual interpretations (e.g. graphs, Venn diagrams). By designing human controls and feedback mechanisms for AI systems that allow users to exert control over them we can integrate transparency into existing user interfaces. Our plan is to design prototypes of transparent user interfaces for AI systems using well-known usability principles. By conducting surveys we will study their impact to see if these principles help the user to work with the AI system with confidence and if the user perceives the system to be adequately transparent.
