In this workshop, participants will learn to use physical Java memory models to help students develop a deep conceptual understanding of Java variables (see www.csteachingtips.org/3D). These physical models use the metaphor of a "remote control" to introduce references. Using table-top versions of the physical models, participants will discuss and be prepared to use physical objects to help students understand: (1) how primitive variables and references variables behave in similar and different ways, (2) how reference variables that both reference an object or array can both modify its content, (3) how calling a method with an argument creates a local variable within that method, and (4) inside an object method, the variable this references the object we called the method on. Participants will receive a set of these physical models to use in their classroom.
