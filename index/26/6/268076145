A hot research topic in Genome Science is to analyze the interactions between genes by systematic gene disruptions and gene overexpressions. This paper analyzes the problem of identifying a gene regulatory network from data obtained by multiple gene disruptions and overexpressions in regard to the number of experiments and the complexity of experiments. An experiment consists of a parallel gene disruptions and overexpressions and the complexity of an experiment is the number of genes disrupted or overexpressed. We define a gene regulatory network as a boolean network and show a series of algorithms which describe methods for identifying the underlying gene regulatory network by such experiments. Some lower bounds on the number of experiments required for the identification are also proved for some cases. Our research group has installed a systematic experimental method which allows both multiple gene disruptions and multiple gene overexpressions. By using this method, we have launched a project whose purpose is to reveal the gene regulatory networks between the 6,200 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae while many laboratories have also started similar projects. This project consists of two different tasks in addition to the task of experiments. One is to develop algorithms for constructing gene regulatory networks from experimental data and testing the consistency of data with already known gene regulatory networks. The second is to construct a knowledge base of gene regulatory networks which have been already known for various organisms. By combining the results of these two tasks, our project will determine a rough figure of the gene regulatory network of Saccharomyces cerevdsiae.
