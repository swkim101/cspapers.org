LiDAR-based 3D detection has made great progress in recent years. However, the performance of 3D detectors is considerably limited when deployed in unseen environments, owing to the severe domain gap problem. Existing domain adaptive 3D detection methods do not adequately consider the problem of the distributional discrepancy in feature space, thereby hindering generalization of detectors across domains. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptive 3D detection framework, namely Geometry-aware Prototype Alignment (GPA-3D), which explicitly leverages the intrinsic geometric relationship from point cloud objects to reduce the feature discrepancy, thus facilitating cross-domain transferring. Specifically, GPA-3D assigns a series of tailored and learnable prototypes to point cloud objects with distinct geometric structures. Each prototype aligns BEV (birdâ€™s-eye-view) features derived from corresponding point cloud objects on source and target domains, reducing the distributional discrepancy and achieving better adaptation. The evaluation results obtained on various benchmarks, including Waymo, nuScenes and KITTI, demonstrate the superiority of our GPA-3D over the state-of-the-art approaches for different adaptation scenarios.
