In this paper, we describe a formal semantic model that applies to many "classical" planning systems. This gives a unifying framework in which to study diverse planners, and motivates formal logics that can be used to study their properties. As an example of the model's utility, we present a general truth criterion which tests for the necessary truth of a proposition at arbitrary points in the planning process.
