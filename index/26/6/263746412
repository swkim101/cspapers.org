From the Publisher: 
This book, the first on the subject in English, gives a readable but rigorous introduction to the theory of term rewriting systems. These are a technique used in computer science, especially functional programming, for abstract data type specification and automatic theorem-proving. The book is self-contained, and begins with a discussion of elementary systems and progresses to the most general cases that involve concepts such as second-order lambda calculus. Exercises are included throughout, and solutions to a selection of them are provided. Complete proofs of results that are often buried in the literature are also given, so researchers in functional programming, theoretical computer science, and logic will find this book useful.
