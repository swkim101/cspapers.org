Category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) aims to predict keypoints for arbitrary classes given a few support images annotated with keypoints. Existing methods only rely on the features extracted at support keypoints to predict or refine the keypoints on query image, but a few support feature vectors are local and inadequate for CAPE. Considering that human can quickly perceive potential keypoints of arbitrary objects, we propose a novel framework for CAPE based on such potential keypoints (named as meta-points). Specifically, we maintain learnable embeddings to capture inherent information of various keypoints, which interact with image feature maps to produce meta-points without any support. The produced meta-points could serve as meaningful potential keypoints for CAPE. Due to the inevitable gap between inherency and annotation, we finally utilize the identities and details offered by support key-points to assign and refine meta-points to desired keypoints in query image. In addition, we propose a progressive deformable point decoder and a slacked regression loss for better prediction and supervision. Our novel framework not only reveals the inherency of key points but also outperforms existing methods of CAPE. Comprehensive experiments and in-depth studies on large-scale MP-100 dataset demon-strate the effectiveness of our framework. Code is avaiable at https://github.com/chenbys/MetaPoint
