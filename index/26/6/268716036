Abstractive text summarization uses the summarizerâ€™s own words to capture the main information of a source document in a summary. While it is more challenging to automate than extractive text summarization, recent advancements in deep learning approaches and pre-trained language models have improved its performance. However, abstractive text summarization still has issues such as unfaithfulness. To address this problem, we propose a new approach that utilizes important Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) to guide BART-based text summarization. Our approach showed the improvement in truthfulness and source document coverage in comparison to some previous studies.
