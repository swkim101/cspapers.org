Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have always been the common goal for the developing countries and for the fast-paced development of ride-sharing services. It is essential to have an accurate traffic profile for the existing infrastructure to predict behaviour of the traffic and its structure for the efficient operation of the ITS. The most common technology, developed nowadays for the traffic monitoring, is Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) which allows detection of the current location, speed and motion direction of the vehicles. This paper presents the case study of Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam using Global Positioning System (GPS) with data collected on both motorbike and car transportation services. The study demonstrates different geographical characteristics of the selected city areas based on the traffic behaviours, surrounding areal infrastructure and GPS signal characteristics, such as strengths, stability, and continuity. The outcome suggests appropriate implementation for GPS-driven application in traffic monitoring, control and potential benefits for network distribution in expanding urban areas. This research also provides a persistence methodology applicable for other cities with similar transportation profile within South East Asia countries.
