In this paper, the succinctness of various ML models is studied. To be more precise, the existence of polynomial-time and polynomial-space translations between representation languages for classifiers is investigated. The languages that are considered include decision trees, random forests, several types of boosted trees, binary neural networks, Boolean multilayer perceptrons, and various logical representations of binary classifiers. We provide a complete map indicating for every pair of languages C, C' whether or not a polynomial-time / polynomial-space translation exists from C to C'. We also explain how to take advantage of the resulting map for XAI purposes.
