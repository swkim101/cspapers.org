We consider the detection of faults in robotic manipulators, with particular emphasis on faults that have not been observed or identified in advance, which naturally includes those that occur very infrequently. Recent studies indicate that the reward function obtained through Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can help detect anomalies caused by faults in a control system (i.e. fault detection). Current IRL methods for fault detection, however, either use a linear reward representation or require extensive sampling from the environment to estimate the policy, rendering them inappropriate for safety-critical situations where sampling of failure observations via fault injection can be expensive and dangerous. To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot and exogenous fault detector based on an approximate variational reward imitation learning (AVRIL) structure. The fault detector recovers a reward signal as a function of externally observable information to describe the normal operation, which can then be used to detect anomalies caused by faults. Our method incorporates expert knowledge through a customizable reward prior distribution, allowing the fault detector to learn the reward solely from normal operation samples, without the need for a simulator or costly interactions with the environment. We evaluate our approach for exogenous partial fault detection in multi-stage robotic manipulator tasks, comparing it with several baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our method more effectively identifies unseen faults even when they occur within just three controller time steps.
