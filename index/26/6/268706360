The integration of advances from machine learning and computer vision with the classical autonomy stack has brought successful robot deployments in fulfilment, manufacturing, and transportation. However, unstructured and dynamic environments such as pedestrian spaces and streets, workplaces, and homes pose additional challenges such as modeling human behavior, understanding user perceptions, and ensuring human safety and comfort. My work addresses such challenges to enable robots to fluently work with and around people to increase productivity and assist users.
