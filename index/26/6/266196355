The assistive profile of an active back support exoskeleton is strongly dependent on the manual tuning of controller gains based on previous experience and trial-and-error. Human-in-the-loop (HIL) optimization allows for automatic tuning of assistive profiles to different subjects. Most HIL methods make use of intrusive sensors that could affect out-of-the-lab exoskeleton adoption. Therefore, we propose a HIL-based assistive controller architecture using only one single IMU that can be easily embedded in any exoskeleton system. To validate our algorithm we recruited 3 subjects and asked them to perform a series of successive load liftings. Meanwhile, we analysed the back-muscles activations focusing on cumulative activation (iEMG), and median activation. We also monitored the total torque generated by the exoskeleton. With respect to an assistance-less condition, the proposed controller resulted in up to 19% reduction of the back-muscles activity. Moreover, compared to a state-of-the-art controller that produced up to 15% reduction of the back-muscles activity, the new controller also required generation of 4% less exoskeleton torque.
