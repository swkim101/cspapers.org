Anomaly detection on graphs has recently attracted considerable attention due to its broad range of high-impact applications, including cybersecurity, financial transactions, and recommendation systems. Although many efforts have thus far been made, how to effectively handle the high inconsistency between users' behavior and labels, a fundamental issue in anomaly detection, has not yet received sufficient concern. Moreover, the inconsistency problem is hard to investigate and even deteriorates the performance of anomaly detectors. To this end, we propose a novel graph self-supervised learning framework, Capsule Graph Infomax (termed CapsGI), to overcome the inconsistency of anomaly detection. Inspired by the recent advances of capsules on images, we explore another possibility of reforming the node embedding by capsule ideas to represent the unique node's properties. Concretely, by disentangling heterogeneous factors underlying each node representation, we can establish node capsules such that their representation can reflect intrinsic node properties. To strengthen the connection among normal nodes, CapsGI further represents the part-whole contrastive learning between lower-level capsules (part) and higher-level capsules (whole) by explicitly considering the context graph relations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.
