In this paper, we investigate that the normalized co-ordinate expression is a key factor as reliance on hand-crafted components in query-based detectors for tempo-ral action detection (TAD). Despite significant advancements towards an end-to-end framework in object detection, query-based detectors have been limited in achieving full end-to-end modeling in TAD. To address this is-sue, we propose TE-TAD, a full end-to-end temporal action detection transformer that integrates time-aligned co-ordinate expression. We reformulate coordinate expression utilizing actual time line values, ensuring length-invariant representations from the extremely diverse video duration environment. Furthermore, our proposed adaptive query selection dynamically adjusts the number of queries based on video length, providing a suitable solution for varying video durations compared to a fixed query set. Our approach not only simplifies the TAD process by eliminating the needfor hand-crafted components but also significantly improves the performance of query-based detectors. Our TE-TAD outperforms the previous query-based detectors and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets.
