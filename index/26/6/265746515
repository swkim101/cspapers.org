Welcome to AST 2008 -- The Third International Workshop on Automation of Software Test which is to be held in conjunction with The 30th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE.08) in Leipzig, Germany on May 11, 2008. In software development practice, as much as 50% of the total cost is spent on testing to ensure its quality. To reduce such cost, it is imperative to have a solution to automate the testing process. This year we have a special theme on "Model-Based Testing for Test Automation." The objective is to narrow the gap between the theory and practice of this important topic. The workshop provides an opportunity for academic researchers and industry participants to exchange ideas and experiences, understand the challenges, explore possible solutions, and discuss future directions. It not only allows the academic community to understand areas vital to the software industry, but it also gives practitioners an opportunity to express their needs. 
 
We received 24 submissions from 11 countries. Each paper was carefully evaluated by three reviewers. These reviews were then used for selecting papers to be presented at the conference. Nine papers (37.5% of submissions) were accepted as regular papers. In addition, we have also accepted six short papers. These papers cover a broad spectrum including model-based, risk-based, and requirement-based test generation and specification, conformance testing, coverage testing and measurement, test minimization, and simulation. Authors of selected best papers presented at the workshop will be invited to submit extended and revised versions of their papers for possible publication in a special issue of the Journal of Information and Software Technology.
