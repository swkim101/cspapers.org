Terrestrial and aerial bimodal vehicles have gained widespread attention due to their cross-domain maneuverability. Nevertheless, their bimodal dynamics significantly increase the complexity of motion planning and control, thus hindering robust and efficient autonomous navigation in unknown environments. To resolve this issue, we develop a model-based planning and control framework for terrestrial aerial bi-modal vehicles. This work begins by deriving a unified dynamic model and the corresponding differential flatness. Leveraging differential flatness, an optimization-based trajectory planner is proposed, which takes into account both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, we design a tracking controller using nonlinear model predictive control based on the proposed unified dynamic model to achieve accurate trajectory tracking and smooth mode transition. We validate our framework through extensive benchmark comparisons and experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in terms of planning quality and control performance.
