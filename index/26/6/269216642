Email service has increasingly been outsourced to cloud-based providers and so too has the task of filtering such messages for potential threats. Thus, customers will commonly direct that their incoming email is first sent to a third-party email filtering service (e.g., Proofpoint or Barracuda) and only the "clean" messages are then sent on to their email hosting provider (e.g., Gmail or Microsoft Exchange Online). However, this loosely coupled approach can, in theory, be bypassed if the email hosting provider is not configured to only accept messages that arrive from the email filtering service. In this paper we demonstrate that such bypasses are commonly possible. We document a multi-step methodology to infer if an organization has correctly configured its email hosting provider to guard against such scenarios. Then, using an empirical measurement of edu and com domains as a case study, we show that 80% of such organizations making use of popular cloud-based email filtering services can be bypassed in this manner. We also discuss reasons that lead to such misconfigurations and outline challenges in hardening the binding between email filtering and hosting providers.
