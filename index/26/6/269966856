The aim of this study is to predict the distribution of temperature at various positions on silver-coated firefighter protective clothing when subjected to external radiant heat flux. This will be helpful in the determination of thermal protective performance. Firefighter clothing consists of three layers, i.e., the outer shell, moisture barrier and thermal liner. The outer shell is the exposed surface, which was coated with silver particles through a physical vapor deposition process called magnetron sputtering. Afterwards, these uncoated and silver-coated samples were exposed to radiant heat transmission equipment at 10 kW/m2 as per the ISO 6942 standard. Silver-coated samples displayed better thermal protective performance as the rate of temperature rise in silver-coated samples slowed. Later, a numerical approach was employed, contemplating the impact of metallic coating on the exterior shell. The finite difference method was utilized for solving partial differential equations and the implicit method was employed to discretize the partial differential equations. The numerical model displayed a good prediction of the distribution of temperature at different nodes with respect to time. The comparison of time vs. temperature graphs at different nodes for uncoated and silver-coated samples acquired from numerical solutions showed similar patterns, as witnessed in the experimental results.
