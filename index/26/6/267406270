Accurate robotic control over interactions with the environment is fundamentally grounded in understanding tactile contacts. In this paper, we introduce MagicTac, a novel high-resolution grid-based tactile sensor. This sensor employs a 3D multi-layer grid-based design, inspired by the Magic Cube structure. This structure can help increase the spatial resolution of MagicTac to perceive external interaction contacts. Moreover, the sensor is produced using the multi-material additive manufacturing technique, which simplifies the manufacturing process while ensuring repeatability of production. Compared to traditional vision-based tactile sensors, it offers the advantages of i) high spatial resolution, ii) significant affordability, and iii) fabrication-friendly construction that requires minimal assembly skills. We evaluated the proposed MagicTac in the tactile reconstruction task using the deformation field and optical flow. Results indicated that MagicTac could capture fine textures and is sensitive to dynamic contact information. Through the grid-based multi-material additive manufacturing technique, the affordability and productivity of MagicTac can be enhanced with a minimum manufacturing cost of Â£4.76 and a minimum manufacturing time of 24.6 minutes.
