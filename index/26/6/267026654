Combined with the generative prior of pre-trained models and the flexibility of text, text-driven generative domain adaptation can generate images from a wide range of target domains. However, current methods still suffer from overfitting and the mode collapse problem. In this paper, we analyze the mode collapse from the geometric point of view and reveal its relationship to the Hessian matrix of generator. To alleviate it, we propose the spectral consistency regularization to preserve the diversity of source domain without restricting the semantic adaptation to target domain. We also design granularity adaptive regularization to flexibly control the balance between diversity and stylization for target model. We conduct experiments for broad target domains compared with state-of-the-art methods and extensive ablation studies. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to preserve the diversity of source domain and generate high fidelity target images.
