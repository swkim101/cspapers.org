End-to-end approaches have shown promising results for speech translation (ST), but they suffer from its data scarcity compared to machine translation (MT). To address this, progressive training has become a common practice, of using external MT data during the fine-tuning phase. Despite of its prevalence and computational overhead, its validity is not extensively corroborated yet. This paper conducts an empirical investigation and finds that progressive training is ineffective. We identify learning-forgetting trade-off as a critical obstacle, then hypothesize and verify that consistency learning (CL) breaks the dilemma of learning-forgetting. The proposed method, which combines knowledge distillation (KD) and CL, outperforms the previous methods on MuST-C dataset (Di Gangi et al., 2019) even without additional data, and our proposed consistency-informed KD achieves additional improvements against KD+CL.
