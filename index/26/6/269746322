Toolkits are an important means of sharing expertise and influencing practice. However, the work of making and sustaining toolkits is not well understood. We address this gap by conducting 20 semi-structured interviews with toolkit designers, focusing on toolkits intended to help practitioners such as librarians, teachers, and community workers. We analyze these interviews to surface key aspects of participants’ design journeys: (1) how their projects began; (2) how they conceptualized use; (3) how they collaborated with users; (4) and what happened once their toolkit was released. We illustrate these aspects through three narratives, and discuss our findings to provide considerations for designers and scholars. We highlight how designers co-construct communities alongside their toolkits, helping us form a more nuanced understanding of the social aspects underpinning toolkit projects. Collectively, these contributions can help us identify challenges and opportunities in this design space, laying the groundwork to increase toolkits’ social impact.
