Non-isometric shape correspondence remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Traditional methods using Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO) eigenmodes face limitations in characterizing high-frequency extrinsic shape changes like bending and creases. We propose a novel approach of combining the non-orthogonal extrinsic basis of eigenfunctions of the elastic thin-shell hessian with the intrinsic ones of the LBO, creating a hybrid spectral space in which we construct functional maps. To this end, we present a theoretical framework to effectively integrate non-orthogonal basis functions into descriptor- and learning-based functional map methods. Our approach can be in-corporated easily into existing functional map pipelines across varying applications and can handle complex de-formations beyond isometries. We show extensive evaluations across various supervised and unsupervised settings and demonstrate significant improvements. Notably, our approach achieves up to 15% better mean geodesic error for non-isometric correspondence settings and up to 45% improvement in scenarios with topological noise.
