This paper presents a design and characterization of a micropositioning stage driven by a reluctance actuator. The stage is constructed with a C-core reluctance actuator and four compression springs. The design of the stage is presented using a CAD model, followed by the fabrication process of the prototype. The mathematical model is formulated to present the interaction among the stage's electrical, magnetic, and mechanical dynamic behaviour. Next, the force-current and force-gap characteristics are obtained by measuring the force under different applied currents and air gaps. After that, the system is analyzed to determine the maximum applied voltage that stabilizes the system in an open-loop configuration, followed by the time-domain and frequency-domain response. Finally, the feedforward controller is presented to linearize the dynamic behavior of the stage over a specific range of motion. The experimental results under the feedforward controller show a linear characteristic between the desired force and the output displacement.
