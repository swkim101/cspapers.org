I am delighted to present you the technical program for Micro-45. This yearâ€™s program consists of 40 technical papers and two keynote speeches. In addition to appearing in the mostly-online proceedings, the papers will be presented in three different forms during the conference: as a 100-second key idea presentation during the opening lightning (or, teaser) session, a full 25-minute length presentation during paper sessions, and as a poster in the poster session. We hope this format will allow the benefits of having parallel sessions while giving the authors an opportunity to reach out to most of the Micro attendees during the lightning and poster sessions, and allowing the attendees to delve into the presented works at different levels of depth.
