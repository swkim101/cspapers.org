In this work we present a performance study of modified Dynamic Beta RED (mDBetaRED), a new Active Queue Management (AQM) RED-type algorithm based on dynamical variants with the ability to adapt to the characteristics of mixed networks. As well, we rely on real campus traffic traces to build a traffic model on which we evaluate our proposal under the NS3 simulator. The parameters of our AQM algorithm are dynamically adjusted so that the queue length remains stable around a predetermined reference value and according to changing network traffic conditions. We present a performance comparison of mDBetaRED with other AQM algorithms and diverse flows of Internet. Of all the AQM algorithms compared, the mDBetaRED algorithm offers the best throughput while effectively controlling delay and stability.
