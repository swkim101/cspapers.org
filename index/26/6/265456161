Given two n-element structures, A and ℬ, which can be distinguished by a sentence of k-variable first-order logic (ℒk), what is the minimum f(n) such that there is guaranteed to be a sentence Φ ∈ ℒk with at most f(n) quantifiers, such that A ⊨ Φ but ℬ ⊭ Φ? We will present various results related to this question obtained by using the recently introduced QVT games [14]. In particular, we show that when we limit the number of variables, there can be an exponential gap between the quantifier depth and the quantifier number needed to separate two structures. As a consequence, we show that ℒk+1 is exponentially more succinct that ℒk. We also show, in the setting of the existential-positive fragment, how to lift quantifier depth lower bounds to quantifier number lower bounds. This leads to almost tight bounds.
