While software plagiarism detectors have been used for decades, the assumption that evading detection requires programming proficiency is challenged by the emergence of automated pla-giarism generators. These generators enable effortless obfus-cation attacks, exploiting vulnerabilities in existing detectors by inserting statements to disrupt the matching of related programs. Thus, we present a novel, language-independent de-fense mechanism that leverages program dependence graphs, rendering such attacks infeasible. We evaluate our approach with multiple real-world datasets and show that it defeats plagiarism generators by offering resilience against automated obfuscation while maintaining a low rate of false positives.
