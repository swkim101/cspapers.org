The World Wide Web has limited interactive capabilities, and does not support animated graphics well. To allow real-time interaction and animated graphics that are both pedagogically and commercially motivating, we must extend the Web. A new tool called CandleWeb is presented. CandleWeb works together with standard HTML browsers, and uses the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP). The tool has been implemented for X11, and interprets a language called Å (awe) which combines a simple C-like syntax with standardized graphics objects to provide a programming environment in which presentations including animation can be produced efficiently. An authoring tool called Å (awe) Composer allows programmers to save considerable time in implementing animated presentations, compared to text-based programming, using graphics libraries. The CandleWeb client for X11 V1.0beta and the Å (awe) language are openly available on the Internet at the site http://www.oslonett.no/~candle/.
