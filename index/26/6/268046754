Virtual reality (VR) offers various opportunities for innovative therapeutic approaches, especially regarding self-related mind-body interventions. We introduce a VR body swap system enabling multiple users to swap their perspectives and appearances and evaluate its effects on virtual sense of embodiment (SoE) and perception- and cognition-based self-related processes. In a self-compassion-framed scenario, twenty participants embodied their personalized, photorealistic avatar, swapped bodies with an unfamiliar peer, and reported their SoE, interoceptive awareness (perception), and self-compassion (cognition). Participantsâ€™ experiences differed between bottom-up and top-down processes. Regarding SoE, their agency and self-location shifted to the swap avatar, while their top-down self-identification remained with their personalized avatar. Further, the experience positively affected interoceptive awareness but not self-compassion. Our outcomes offer novel insights into the SoE in a multiple-embodiment scenario and highlight the need to differentiate between the different processes in intervention design. They raise concerns and requirements for future research on avatar-based mind-body interventions.
