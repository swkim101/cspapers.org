Solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is an essential task for many industrial applications. Although VRPs have been traditionally studied in the operations research (OR) domain, they have lately been the subject of extensive work in the machine learning (ML) community. Both the OR and ML communities have begun to integrate ML into their meth-ods, but in vastly different ways. While the OR community primarily relies on simplistic ML methods, the ML community generally uses deep learning, but fails to outperform OR baselines. To address this gap, the EURO Meets NeurIPS 2022 Vehicle Routing Competition brought together the OR and ML communities as a joint effort of several previous competitions to solve a challenging VRP variant on real-world data provided by ORTEC, a leading provider of vehicle routing software. The challenge focuses on both a “classic” deterministic VRP with time windows (VRPTW) and a dynamic version in which new orders arrive over the course of a day. Over 50 teams submitted solutions over a 13-week submission period, battling for not only the best performance on the competition problems, but also for the longest dominance of the leaderboard. The goals of the competition were achieved, with both state-of-the-art techniques in OR and ML playing a significant role in several of the winning submissions.
