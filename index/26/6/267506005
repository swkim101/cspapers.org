Medical tests are crucial for treatment decision making. However, over-testing can often occur in any medical speciality or level of expertise. Since over-testing usually results in a financial burden for patients and is also a waste of medical resources, this naturally leads to the question: which medical test items (MTIs) are necessary and should be prioritized for the target patients? It is a nontrivial task to identify the right MTIs due to the diversified health status of patients and the complicated prerequisites of therapies. To this end, in this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to evaluate the priority which should be given to MTIs by modeling the relationships between MTIs and therapies. Specifically, we first develop a dual hierarchical topic model (DHTM), which views the adopted hierarchical therapies as labeled topics and the MTI reports, i.e., the set of hierarchical attribute-value pairs (AVPs), as documents. Then, with the therapy-AVP distribution and the partial MTI reports of the target patient, we can scope the candidate therapies, which are further utilized to evaluate the accumulated gain of MTIs to be tested. Moreover, the next MTI recommendation is conducted based on the gains. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world medical data validate the effectiveness of our approach, and some interesting observations are also provided.
