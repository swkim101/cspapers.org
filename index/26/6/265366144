 The nexus of two relatively recent technologies, additive manufacturing and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), has enabled new and unique capabilities that have only started to be realized in integrated systems. This paper explores and quantifies the impact of 3D printing parts for UAS, or entire UAS systems, on an agent platform while it travels to multiple locations as part of a mission objective. The printed or enhanced UAS can then be released at launch points farther away from the goal locations. This, in turn, can accelerate mission completion times and reduce travel costs. The methodology and optimization problem are developed by making use of Apollonius circles extensively with interesting examples presented of the integration of these two technologies. Results indicate that based on the print capability and agent travel speed, using the sequence provided by a Traveling Salesmanâ€™s problem solution is not always optimal. Thousands of scenarios are optimized across the design space with some interesting phenomena discussed in the analysis.
