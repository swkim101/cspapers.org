After 4 years of rapid deployment in the US, 5G is expected to have significantly improved the performance and overall user experience of mobile networks. However, recent measurement studies have focused either on static performance or a single aspect (e.g., handovers) under driving conditions of 5G, and do not provide a complete picture of cellular network performance today under driving conditions - a major use case of mobile networks. Through a cross-continental US driving trip (from LA to Boston, 5700km+), we conduct an in-depth measurement study of user-perceived experience (network coverage/performance and QoE of a set of major latency-critical 5G "killer'' apps) To understand the root cause of the observed network performance, while collecting low-level 5G statistics and signaling messages. Our study shows disappointingly low coverage of 5G networks today under driving and highly fragmented coverage by cellular technologies. More importantly, network and application performance are often poor under driving even in areas with full 5G coverage. We also examine the correlation of technology-wise coverage and performance with geo-location and the vehicle's speed and analyze the impact of a number of lower layer KPIs on network performance.
