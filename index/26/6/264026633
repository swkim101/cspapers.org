Commercialization of desktop milling machines has made rapid Printed Circuit Board (PCB) fabrication accessible. Unfortunately, PCB design for embedded and robotic systems is still a tedious and time consuming activity. In this paper, we present a technique, Just In Time Printed Circuit Board (JITPCB) for designing PCB systems at speeds commensurate with the capability of desktop PCB milling machines. We propose designing boards by writing software circuit generators that wire together and lay out circuit components in a hierarchical and reusable fashion. We have developed a declarative design mechanism allowing users to specify desired input and output peripherals and well as application code. Given this input, our system produces a complete working circuit board design, along with necessary initialization and networking code. Our system is an open framework that allows users to create a set of highly reusable parametric hardware/software modules. We demonstrate our approach by showing some common robotics applications designed with JITPCB to show its utility and generality.
