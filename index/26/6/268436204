The traditional way to publish scientific research is to design, conduct, analyse and write-up the study before submitting to any kind of peer review. However, some issues with studies (such as the choice of data to collect) can only be fixed at the design stage. Therefore some reviewer comments (and rejections) reveal a huge waste of time: the authors cannot fix the issue without re-designing and re-running the study, so the authors', participants' and reviewers' time was wasted. Registered Reports are a new way to publish where the peer review is done after the design stage, but before the study is conducted. This allows design issues to be corrected early in the research process, when it is still possible to do so. At this point, a decision is made to reject the paper, or accept it in-principle. This means that authors can know if their study will be published before they have even begun data collection. This is beneficial for authors, and reduces incentives to fish for significant results or fudge the analysis. In this talk I will explain the registered reports process, as well as why and how authors of computer science education research studies can participate in this new way of publishing.
