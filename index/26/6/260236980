Cyberattacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, and investigating them becomes more challenging. Prove-nance graphs are the primary data source to support forensics analysis. Because of system complexity and long attack duration, provenance graphs can be huge, and efﬁciently storing them remains a challenging problem. Existing works typically use relational or graph databases to store provenance graphs. These solutions suffer from high storage overhead and low query efﬁciency. Recently, researchers leveraged Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in storage system design and achieved promising results. We observe that DNNs can embed given inputs as context-aware numerical vector representations, which are compact and support parallel query operations. In this paper, we propose to learn a DNN as the storage system for provenance graphs to achieve storage and query efﬁciency. We also present novel designs that leverage domain knowledge to reduce provenance data redundancy and build fast-query processing with indexes. We built a prototype L EONARD and evaluated it on 12 datasets. Compared with the relational database Quickstep and the graph database Neo4j, L EONARD reduced the space overhead by up to 25.90x and boosted up to 99.6% query executions.
