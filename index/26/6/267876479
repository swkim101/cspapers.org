A one-way hashing algorithm is a deterministic algorithm that compresses an arbitrary long message into a value of speciied length. The output value represents the ngerprint or digest of the message. A cryptographically useful property of a one-way hashing algorithm is that it is infeasible to nd two distinct messages that have the same ngerprint. This paper proposes a one-way hashing algorithm called HAVAL. HAVAL compresses a message of arbitrary length into a ngerprint of 128, 160, 192, 224 or 256 bits. In addition, HAVAL has a parameter that controls the number of passes a message block (of 1024 bits) is processed. A message block can be processed in 3, 4 or 5 passes. By combining output length with pass, we can provide fteen (15) choices for practical applications where diierent levels of security are required. The algorithm is very eecient and particularly suited for 32-bit computers which predominate the current workstation market. Experiments show that HAVAL is 60% faster than MD5 when 3 passes are required, 15% faster than MD5 when 4 passes are required, and as fast as MD5 when full 5 passes are required. It is conjectured that nding two collision messages requires the order of 2 n=2 operations, where n is the number of bits in a ngerprint.
