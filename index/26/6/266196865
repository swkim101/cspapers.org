In the last decade, researchers have been trying to develop many microrobots that mimic the extraordinary abilities of bionts in complex environments. How to fabricate the biomimetic microrobot with satisfying deformability and complex shapes to realize desired precise motion is the key issue. In this paper, we proposed an efficient programable fabrication method of the magnetic soft micro-robot through an on-chip photopolymerization system. The superparamagnetic nanoparticles were compiled according to the magnetic anisotropy and assembled in the micro-robot. Then these nanoparticles were immobilized by photopolymerization of the hydrogel polymer. With this fabrication method, a joint rotation mechanism was first fabricated to characterize the deformation performance under the magnetic field control. Besides, the snake-like micro-robot were also fabricated, and the desired motions were achieved. The experimental results show that the proposed programable on-chip fabrication of magnetic soft micro-robot has the potential to facilitate the development of magnetic microrobots and their applications in the biomedical field.
