While Wardrop (1952) had introduced the concept of Nash equilibrium to describe user behavior in traffic networks, traffic engineers have proposed to utilize user equilibria in route-guidance systems to prescribe user behavior. Yet, Nash equilibria in general and user equilibria in particular are known to be inefficient and critics favored in principle the difficult-to-implement system optimum, which guarantees tha t the average travel t ime is minimal. Hence, the recent result tha t user equilibria are near optimal (Roughgarden and Tardos 2002) came as a welcome surprise, which helped to justify the use of user equilibria in retrospect. In this paper, we extend the work of Roughgarden and Tardos in two directions. First, we introduce and analyze user equilibria in capaci tated networks. In contrast to uncapaci tated networks (the framework of Roughgarden and Tardos' work), the set of user equilibria is no longer convex and an equilibrium can be arbitrari ly worse than the system optimum, even if arc latency functions are linear. Yet, we show tha t adding capacities does not change the worstpossible ratio between the best user equilibrium and the system opt imum, given a fixed but arbi t rary class of allowable latency functions. Second, it is well known tha t the system opt imum can assign some drivers to paths having a significantly higher latency compared to other paths between the same origin-destination pair. For tha t reason, system opt ima are often considered inadequate for purposes of traffic planning. We propose to compare user equilibria to a more restricted definition of a system optimum, which is fairer in a certain sense and which therefore promises improved general acceptance. We study the quality of user equilibria in this setting and analyze the resulting improvement of their performance.
