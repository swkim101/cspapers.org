Detecting fraud users, who fraudulently promote certain target items, is a challenging issue faced by e-commerce platforms. Generally, many fraud users have different spam behaviors simultaneously, e.g. spam transactions, clicks, reviews and so on. Existing solutions have two main limitations: 1) the correlations among multiple spam behaviors are neglected; 2) large-scale computations are intractable when dealing with an enormous user set. To remedy these problems, this work proposes a collaboration based multi-label propagation (CMLP) algorithm. We first introduce a general-purpose version that involves collaboration technique to exploit label correlations. Specifically, it breaks the final prediction into two parts: 1) its own prediction part; 2) the prediction of others, i.e. collaborative part. Then, to accelerate it on large-scale e-commerce data, we propose a heterogeneous graph based variant that detects communities on the user-item graph directly. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results clearly validate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposals.
