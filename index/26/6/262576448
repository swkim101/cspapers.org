The proliferation of mobile sensing devices due to advances in the Internet of Things has the potential to transform the individual-centric health monitoring to community-scaled health monitoring. Contrary to the state-of-the-art mobile health sensing, which focuses on individuals, my research focuses on scaling mobile health technologies to community scale, where we monitor the health of an entire community or population of users. The benefits of adopting community-scale sensing are two folds; firstly, it enables aggregate public health monitoring of large groups which can answer broader health problems; secondly, it improves personalized health monitoring with fine-grain monitoring of individuals.
