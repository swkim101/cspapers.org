The increasing penetration of the real world with embedded and globally networked sensors enables the formation of a Web of Things (WoT), where high-level state information derived from sensors is embedded into Web representations of real-world entities (e.g. places, objects, creatures). A key service for the WoT is searching for entities which exhibit a certain dynamic state at the time of the query, which is a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of the sought state information and due to the potentially huge scale of the WoT. Below we report on our initial efforts to construct such a search engine and the underlying WoT.
