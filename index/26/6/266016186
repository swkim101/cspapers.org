It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 1st International Workshop on Cloud Data Management (CloudDB 2009). 
 
Cloud computing is set to revolutionize the IT industry, and database services are at the core of cloud computing, since no information system can be built without database services. Cloud data management holds many promises and challenges. It is our hope that CloudDB will bring together researchers and practitioners from a wide range of areas including services computing, data management, programming language, parallel and distributed systems, mobile computing, scientific and social systems, and brainstorm on the future of database centric cloud computing. 
 
CloudDB attracted 11 submissions from Asia, Europe, and North America. The program committee accepted 8 papers, including 5 full papers and 3 short papers. These papers cover a variety of topics, including Cloud-based indexing, query processing and Cloud system application. We hope that they will serve as a valuable start point for much brilliant thinking in cloud data management.
