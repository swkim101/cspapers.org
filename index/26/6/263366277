Astronomy datasets are generally terabytes in size and contain hundreds of millions of objects separated into millions of files-factors which makes many analyses impractical to perform on small computers. The key question we answer in this paper is: "How can we leverage Grid resources to make the analysis of large astronomy datasets a reality for the astronomy community?" To address this question, we have developed a Web Services-based system, AstroPortal, that uses grid computing to federate large computing and storage resources for dynamic analysis of large datasets. Building on the GT4, we have built a prototype and implemented a first analysis, "stacking," that sums multiple regions of the sky, a function that can help both identify variable sources and detect faint objects. AstroPortal gives the astronomy community a new tool to advance their research and to open new doors to opportunities never before possible on such a large scale.
