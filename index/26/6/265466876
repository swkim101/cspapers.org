Language has emerged as a natural interface for image editing. In this paper, we introduce a method for region- based image editing driven by textual prompts, without the need for user-provided masks or sketches. Specifically, our approach leverages an existing pre-trained text-to-image model and introduces a bounding box generator to iden-tify the editing regions that are aligned with the textual prompts. We show that this simple approach enables flex-ible editing that is compatible with current image generation models, and is able to handle complex prompts featuring multiple objects, complex sentences, or lengthy para- graphs. We conduct an extensive user study to compare our method against state-of-the-art methods. The experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our method in manipulating images with high fidelity and realism that correspond to the provided language descriptions.
