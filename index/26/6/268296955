This paper proposes a high-performance and energy-efficient optical near-sensor accelerator for vision applications, called Lightator. Harnessing the promising efficiency offered by photonic devices, Lightator features innovative compressive acquisition of input frames and fine-grained convolution operations for low-power and versatile image processing at the edge for the first time. This will substantially diminish the energy consumption and latency of conversion, transmission, and processing within the established cloud-centric architecture as well as recently designed edge accelerators. Our device-to-architecture simulation results show that with favorable accuracy, Lightator achieves 84.4 Kilo FPS/W and reduces power consumption by a factor of ~24x and 73x on average compared with existing photonic accelerators and GPU baseline.
