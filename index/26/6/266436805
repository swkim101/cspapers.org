This volume contains the proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2010), held in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, on June 7-9, 2010, in conjunction with the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data. 
 
The proceedings include one paper based on the keynote address by Joe Hellerstein, two papers based on the invited tutorials, the first by Gerhard Weikum and Martin Theobald, and the second by T. S. Jayram, and 27 contributed papers that were selected by the Program Committee from 113 submissions. Most of these papers are preliminary reports on work in progress. While they have been read by program committee members, they have not been formally refereed. Many of them will probably appear in more polished and detailed form in scientific journals. 
 
The program committee selected the paper "An Optimal Algorithm for the Distinct Elements Problem" by Daniel M. Kane, Jelani Nelson, and David P. Woodruff for the PODS 2010 Best Paper Award. In addition, the announcement of the 2010 ACM PODS Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award also appears in the proceedings. This year, two papers were given this award: "Typechecking for XML Transformers" by Tova Milo, Dan Suciu, and Victor Vianu, and "Integrity Constraints for XML" by Wenfei Fan and Jerome Simeon. Warmest congratulations to the authors of these papers. 
 
I thank all authors who submitted papers to the symposium, and the members of the program committee for the enormous amount of work they have done. The program committee did not meet in person, but carried out extensive discussions during the electronic PC meeting.
