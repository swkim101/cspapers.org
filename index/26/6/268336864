In the United States (US), the value Black women bring to their classrooms is critical, yet research examining their experiences as computer science (CS) teachers has been underexplored. Using a theoretical framework grounded in Black feminist thought, this paper highlights the important role of this subgroup of the teaching population by illuminating the unique intersectional experiences and perspectives of four Black, women, high school, CS (BWHSCS) teachers in the southern US. We center the voices of BWHSCS teachers to better understand their unique experiences and assets as Black women, allowing us to examine the extent to which historical context and issues of race and gender inform their pedagogical practice.
