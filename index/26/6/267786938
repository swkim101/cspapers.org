We present a model for designing wormhole routing algorithms that arc deadlock free. livclock free, minimal or nonminimd, and maximally adaptive. A unique feature of this model is that it is not based on adding phyaicd or virtual channela to network topolo8ics (though it can be applied to networks with extra channels). Instead. the model is based on andyzing the directiona in which packets can turn in a network and the cycles that the tuma can form. Prohibiting just enough turns to break all of the cycla producca routing algorithms that are deadlock free, livelock free. minimd or nonminimal,and maximally adaptive for the network. In this paper, we focus on the two most common network topologies for wormhole routing, n-dimensional meshes and k-ary n-cubes, without extrachannels. In an n-dimensional mesh, jut a quarter of the turns must be prohibited to prevent deadlock. The mndning three quarters of the turns permit partid adaptivcnas in routing. Partially adaptive routing algorithms arc described for PD maha, n-dimcnsiond maha, k-ary n-cubes, and hypercubes. Siuiations of partially adaptive and nonadaptive routing algorithms for 2D maha and hypcrcuba show that which algorithm has the lowest latcncia and highest sustainable throughput depends on the pattern of mcesage traffic. For nonuniform tra&, partially adaptive routing algorithms perform better than nonadaptive on‚Äù.
