Current few-shot segmentation (FSS) approaches have made tremendous achievements based on prototypical learning techniques. However, due to the scarcity of the support data provided, FSS methods still suffer from the intra-class and inter-class gaps. In this paper, we propose a uniform network to fill both the gaps, termed FGNet. It consists of the novel design of a Self-Adaptive Module (SAM) to emphasize the query feature to generate an enhanced prototype for self-alignment. Such a prototype caters to each query sample itself since it contains the underlying intra-instance information, which gets around the intra-class appearance gap. Moreover, we design an Inter-class Feature Separation Module (IFSM) to separate the feature space of the target class from other classes, which contributes to bridging the inter-class gap. In addition, we present several new losses and a method termed B-SLIC, which help to further enhance the separation performance of FGNet. Experimental results show that FGNet reduces both the gaps for FSS by SAM and IFSM respectively, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets compared with previous top-performing approaches.
