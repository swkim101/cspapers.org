This volume contains the proceedings of the Twenty-first ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2002), held at Madison, Wisconsin on June 3-5, 2002 in conjunction with the 2002 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data. It consists of a paper based on the invited talk by Rajeev Motwani, two papers based on the invited tutorials by Maurizio Lenzerini and Dennis Shasha, and 24 contributed papers that were selected by the program committee for presentation at the symposium.The contributed papers were selected from 109 submissions. Most of the papers are "extended abstracts" and are preliminary reports on work in progress. While they have been read by program committee members, they have not been formally refereed. It is expected that much of the research described in these papers will be publihsed in detail in computer science journals.The program committee selected "Monadic Datalog over Trees and the Expressive Power of Languages for Web Information Extraction" by Georg Gottlob and Christoph Koch for the PODS 2002 Best Paper Award and "From Discrepancy to Declustering: Near optimal multidimensional declustering strategies for range queries" by Chung-Min Chen and Christine T. Cheng for the PODS 2002 Best Newcomer Award. Warmest congratulations to the authors of these papers.
