The discovery of ocean worlds such as Enceladus, Titan, and Europa motivates the development of versatile autonomous mobility systems to enable the next era of space exploration where there is large uncertainty in terrain specifications due to a lack of prior surface reconnaissance missions. To explore these environments, we propose Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS): the first large-scale (4 lm long with 400 Nm peak torque) snake robot. The large scale is achieved by using a screw-based active skin mechanism to decouple motion and shape control. Autonomous mobility for such a system remains an open problem due to its many Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), complex terrain interactions, and intermittent localization failures in GPS-denied perceptually degraded environments due to the presence of fog, dust, featureless terrains, etc. We propose NEO, an autonomy architecture that scales to large DoFs to generate a versatile set of gaits to achieve mobility in unknown extreme environments. We also discuss the resilience capabilities of NEO that achieves closed-loop tracking performance by leveraging exteroception when available but can also operate with proprioception only, leading to resiliency against localization failures via graceful degradation in performance rather than unsafe behaviors. A quantitative hardware evaluation of exteroceptive leader-follower gait is performed indoors on synthetic ice along with qualitative results of field deployment of the proprioceptive leader-follower and sidewinding gaits in extreme environments of icy and sandy terrains with mobility-stressing elements such as trenches, undulations, and steep slopes (up to 35 degrees). We present a set of lessons learned from field deployments with a summary of challenges and open research problems. Video: www.rohanthakker.in/eels-neo-autonomy.html
