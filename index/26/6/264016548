This panel will provide a forum for analyzing the dominant research themes in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work. The panelists were all involved in organizing CSCW '86, the first Conference on this topic, held in Austin, Texas on December 3-5, 1986. The meeting was interdisciplinary -the panelists represent several of contributing fields of research. They will debate the relative importance of contributions from their own fields and will also respond to a set of questions from the moderator focusing on whether or not CSCW is proving to be a research field with its own unique contributions.
