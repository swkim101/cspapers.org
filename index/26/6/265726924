Software clones are identical or similar pieces of code or design. Clones are known to be closely related to various issues on software engineering, such as software quality, complexity, architecture, refactoring, evolution, licensing, plagiarism, and so on. Various characteristics of software systems can be uncovered through the clone analysis, and system restructuring can be performed by merging clones. 
 
The purpose of this workshop is to continue to solidify and give shape to this research/application area and community. More specifically, the goals are to bring together researchers and practitioners from around the world to evaluate the current state of research and applications, discuss common problems, discover new opportunities for collaboration, exchange ideas, and envision new areas of research and applications. 
 
This workshop should be highly relevant to industrial participants as well as academic researchers. This is because software clones are now closely related to many issues in software practice such as software quality, architecture design, maintenance, and so on. 
 
In this, the 4th international clone workshop, we will intensively discuss on broader topics of software clones.
