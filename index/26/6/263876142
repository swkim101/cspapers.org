A central vision of the Internet of Things is the representation of the physical world in a consistent virtual environment. Especially in the context of smart factories the connection of the different, heterogeneous production modules through a digital shop floor promises faster conversion rates, data-driven maintenance or automated machine configurations for use cases which haven't been recognized at design time. Nevertheless, these scenarios demand IoT representations of all participating machines and components, which requires high installation efforts and hardware adjustments. We propose an incremental process for bringing the shop floor closer to the IoT vision. Currently the majority of systems, components or parts are not yet connected with the internet and might not even provide the possibility to be technically equipped with sensors. However, those could be essential parts for a realistic digital shop floor representation. We therefore propose Virtual Representations, which are capable of independently calculating a physical object's condition by dynamically collecting and interpreting already available data through RESTful Web APIs. The internal logic of such Virtual Representations are further adjustable at runtime since changes to its respective physical object, its environment or updates to the resource itself should not cause any downtime.
