Human-robot interaction (HRI) is a rapidly growing field that encompasses social and industrial applications. Machine learning plays a vital role in industrial HRI by enhancing the adaptability and autonomy of robots in complex environments. However, data privacy is a crucial concern in the interaction between humans and robots, as companies need to protect sensitive data while machine learning algorithms require access to large datasets. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling the distributed training of models without sharing raw data. Despite extensive research on Federated learning (FL) for tasks such as natural language processing (NLP) and image classification, the question of how to use FL for HRI remains an open research problem. The traditional FL approach involves transmitting large neural network parameter matrices between the server and clients, which can lead to high communication costs and often becomes a bottleneck in FL. This paper proposes a communication-efficient FL framework for human-robot interaction (CEFHRI) to address the challenges of data heterogeneity and communication costs. The framework leverages pre-trained models and introduces a trainable spatiotemporal adapter for video understanding tasks in HRI. Experimental results on three human-robot interaction benchmark datasets: HRI30, InHARD, and COIN demonstrate the superiority of CEFHRI over full fine-tuning in terms of communication costs. The proposed methodology provides a secure and efficient approach to HRI federated learning, particularly in industrial environments with data privacy concerns and limited communication bandwidth.
