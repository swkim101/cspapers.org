Modern deep learning methods have long been considered black boxes due to the lack of insights into their decision-making process. However, recent advances in explainable machine learning have turned the tables. Post-hoc explanation methods enable precise relevance attribution of input features for otherwise opaque models such as deep neural networks. This progression has raised expectations that these techniques can uncover attacks against learning-based systems such as adversarial examples or neural backdoors. Unfortunately, current methods are not robust against manipulations themselves. In this paper, we set out to systematize attacks against post-hoc explanation methods to lay the groundwork for developing more robust explainable machine learning. If explanation methods cannot be misled by an adversary, they can serve as an effective tool against attacks, marking a turning point in adversarial machine learning. We present a hierarchy of explanation-aware robustness notions and relate existing defenses to it. In doing so, we uncover synergies, research gaps, and future directions toward more reliable explanations robust against manipulations.
