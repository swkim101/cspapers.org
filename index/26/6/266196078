Obtaining reliable detections of a human is crucial for many safety-related robotic tasks. This can be done by human pose estimation methods, which predict the position of several different keypoints of the human body. In most cases, recent approaches based on neural networks produce ‘good’ results, i.e. predictions with small localization errors, however, large errors do also occur. For an individual keypoint prediction, the magnitude of the error is unknown, posing a risk to safety. In this work, we extend a neural network architecture for single-person 2D human pose estimation, so that it predicts not only the keypoints of the human body, but also corresponding upper bounds for their localization errors. These upper bounds correspond to the neural network's confidence in its output, and are obtained by one of two general strategies based on (i) a direct estimation of the localization error or (ii) the predicted standard deviations of a 2D Gaussian. We propose several approaches employing these strategies and evaluate them on the MPII Human Pose dataset. In addition, we consider two quality criteria for the results: closeness of the predicted keypoint position to the actual one, and closeness of the predicted upper bound to the localization error. The best results are achieved by a Gaussian-based approach, which predicted correct upper bounds in 94.7% of the cases, while also sufficiently fulfilling the quality criteria.
