We present a new approach to effectively detect and prioritize malicious beaconing activities in large campus networks by profiling the server activities through aggregated signals across multiple traffic protocols and networks. Key components of our system include a novel time-series analysis algorithm that uncovers hidden periodicity in aggregated signals, and a ranking-based detection pipeline that utilizes self-training and active-learning techniques. We evaluate our detection system on 10 months of real-world traffic collected at two large campus networks, comprising over 75 billion connections. On a daily average, we detect 43% more periodic domains by aggregating signals across multiple networks compared to single-network analysis. Furthermore, our ranking pipeline successfully identifies 1,387 unique malicious domains, out of which 781 (56%) were unknown to the major online threat intelligence platform, VirusTotal, at the time of our detection.
