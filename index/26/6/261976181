Human activity recognition is an essential task for robots to effectively and efficiently interact with the end users. Many machine learning approaches for activity recognition systems have been proposed recently. Most of these methods are built upon a strong assumption that the labels in the training data are noise-free, which is often not realistic. In this paper, we incorporate the uncertainty of labels into a max-margin learning algorithm, and the algorithm allows the labels to deviate over iterations in order to find a better solution. This is incorporated with a hierarchical approach where we jointly estimate activities at two different levels of granularity. The model is tested on two datasets, i.e., the CAD-120 dataset and the Accompany dataset, and the proposed model shows outperforming results over the state-of-the-art methods.
