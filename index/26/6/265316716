This paper presents a comparative study on additive manufacturing technologies. A 4th order waveguide filter in the K band at 24 GHz is designed to be manufactured using Stereolithography (SLA) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM). The filter is made of conical resonant cavities and the entire structure was designed to ease the post processing after the 3D manufacturing step. The comparison between simulation and measured results lead to a discussion on the final machining in post processing steps.
