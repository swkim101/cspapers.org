Information diffusion prediction is a critical task for many social network applications. However, current methods are mainly limited by the following aspects: user relationships behind resharing behaviors are complex and entangled. To address these issues, we propose MHGFormer, a novel multi-channel hypergraph transformer framework, to better decouple complex user relations and obtain fine-grained user representations. First, we employ designed triangular motifs to decouple user relations into three different level hypergraphs. Second, a position-aware hypergraph transformer is used to refine user relation and obtain high-quality user representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two social datasets demonstrate that MHGFormer outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models across several settings.
