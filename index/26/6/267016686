Exploring good generalization ability is essential in deep metric learning (DML). Most existing DML methods focus on improving the model robustness against category shift to keep the performance on unseen categories. However, in addition to category shift, domain shift also widely exists in real-world scenarios. Therefore, learning better generalization ability for the DML model is still a challenging yet realistic problem. In this paper, we propose a new self-expanded equalization (SEE) method to effectively generalize the DML model to both unseen categories and domains. Specifically, we take a ‘min-max’ strategy combined with a proxy-based loss to adaptively augment diverse out-of-distribution samples that vastly expand the span of original training data. To take full advantage of the implicit cross-domain relations between source and augmented samples, we introduce a domain-aware equalization module to induce the domain-invariant distance metric by regularizing the feature distribution in the metric space. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks and a large-scale multi-domain dataset demonstrate the superiority of our SEE over the existing DML methods.
