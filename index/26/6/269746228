InkBrush is a new sketch-based 3D drawing tool for creating 3D ink paintings using free-form 3D ink strokes. It offers a digital calligraphy brush and various editing tools to generate realistic ink-like brush strokes with attributes like hairy edges, ink drips, and scattered dots. Users can adjust parameters such as moisture, color, darkness, dryness, and stroke style to customize the appearance of the brush strokes. The development of InkBrush was guided by a design study involving artists and designers. It was developed as a plugin for Blender, a popular 3D modeling tool, and its effectiveness and usability were evaluated through a user study involving 75 participants. Preliminary feedback from the participants was overwhelmingly positive, indicating that InkBrush was intuitive and easy to use. Following this, we also sought in-depth assessments from experts in ink painting and 3D design. Their evaluations further demonstrated the effectiveness of InkBrush.
