Bilingual machine-readable dictionaries are knowledge resources useful in many automatic tasks. However, compared to monolingual computational lexicons like WordNet, bilingual dictionaries typically provide a lower amount of structured information such as lexical and semantic relations, and often do not cover the entire range of possible translations for a word of interest. In this paper we present Cycles and Quasi-Cycles (CQC), a novel algorithm for the automated disambiguation of ambiguous translations in the lexical entries of a bilingual machine-readable dictionary.
