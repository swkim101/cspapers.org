Data augmentation methods are commonly integrated into the training of anomaly detection models.
Previous approaches have primarily focused on replicating real-world anomalies or enhancing diversity, without considering that the standard of anomaly varies across different classes, potentially leading to a biased training distribution. This paper analyzes crucial traits of simulated anomalies that contribute to the training of reconstructive networks and condenses them into several methods, thus creating a comprehensive framework by selectively utilizing appropriate combinations. Furthermore, we integrate this framework with a reconstruction-based approach and concurrently propose a split training strategy that alleviates the overfitting issue while avoiding introducing interference to the reconstruction process. The evaluations conducted on the MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach, particularly in terms of object classes. We also generate a simulated dataset comprising anomalies with diverse characteristics, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits promising potential for generalizing effectively to various unseen anomalies encountered in real-world scenarios.
