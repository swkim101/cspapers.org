Reconfigurable physical interfaces empower users to swiftly adapt to tailored design requirements or preferences. Shape-changing interfaces enable such reconfigurability, avoiding the cost of refabrication or part replacements. Nonetheless, reconfigurable interfaces are often bulky, expensive, or inaccessible. We propose a reversible shape-changing mechanism that enables reconfigurable 3D printed structures via translations and rotations of parts. We investigate fabrication techniques that enable reconfiguration using magnets and the thermoplasticity of heated polymer. Proposed interfaces achieve tunable haptic feedback and adjustment of different user affordances by reconfiguring input motions. The design space is demonstrated through applications in rehabilitation, embodied communication, accessibility, safety, and gaming.
