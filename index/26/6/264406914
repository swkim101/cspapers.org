In this paper we propose the use of large language models (LLMs) for characterizing, clustering, and fingerprinting raw text obtained from network measurements. To this end, We first train a transformer-based masked language model, namely RoBERTa, on a dataset containing hundreds of millions of banners obtained from Internet-wide scans. We further fine-tune this model using a contrastive loss function (driven by domain knowledge) to produce temporally stable numerical representations (embeddings) that can be used out-of-the-box for downstream learning tasks. Our embeddings are robust, resilient to small random changes in the content of a banner, and maintain proximity between embeddings of similar hardware/software products. We further cluster HTTP banners using a density-based approach (HDBSCAN), and examine the obtained clusters to generate text-based fingerprints for the purpose of labeling raw scan data. We compare our fingerprints to Recog, an existing database of manually curated fingerprints, and show that we can identify new IoT devices and server products that were not previously captured by Recog. Our proposed methodology poses an important direction for future research by utilizing state-of-the-art language models to automatically analyze, interpret, and label the large amounts of data generated by Internet scans.
