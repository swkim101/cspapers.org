AlmostCorrect is an educational tool for working with combinational logic. Combinational logic can have several different, but correct solutions, and many more solutions that are almost, but not quite, correct. However, existing solutions typically generate one correct solution. AlmostCorrect instead generates all possible correct solutions and all solutions that have minor mistakes, such as missing a simplification step or reading the table incorrectly. These ''almost'' solutions can be used to either provide distractors for multiple choice questions or as a rubric for assigning partial credit.
