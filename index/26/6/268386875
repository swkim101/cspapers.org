While recent work explores novel tools to make electronics and device design easier and more accessible, these tend to be either highly automated (great for novices, but limiting for more advanced users) or highly manual (suitable for experts, but imposes a higher skill barrier to entry). In this work, we examine a middle ground: user-guided design space exploration to bridge an intuitive-but-ambiguous high-level representation to a fully-specified, fabrication-ready circuit. Our system helps users understand and make design choices by sweeping the design space of alternatives for electronics parts (e.g., choice of microcontroller), marking invalid options, and plotting points to visualize trade-offs (e.g., for power and size). We discuss the overall system and its structure, report on the results of a small but in-depth user study with participants from a wide range of electronics backgrounds, and draw insights on future directions for improving electronics design for everyone.
