On behalf of the conference organizing committee, it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 23rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2014). 
 
CIKM is a top-tier ACM conference in Databases, Information Retrieval, and Knowledge Management. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future research directions through the publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. The 23rd edition of CIKM continues the tradition of promoting collaboration among multiple areas. 
 
The conference this year has attracted 838 valid full paper submissions, 260 valid poster submissions, 73 valid demonstration submissions, and 15 valid workshop proposals. Among them, we accepted 175 full papers, 57 posters, 29 demonstrations, and 9 workshops. On top of the regular track, the conference has an outstanding keynote program, an exciting industry event, and six tutorials of contemporary topics. This time again, the conference is standing out among the many of its peers in its ability to attract researchers to exchange ideas and to interact, and the sheer numbers are a testament of the vitality of the three research areas and their interactions. 
 
We are honored to present three distinguished keynote speakers: Jeff Dean of Google, Qi Lu of Microsoft, and Gerhard Weikum of Max-Planck Institute for Informatics. We are also honored to present six industry event invitees to share their deep knowledge and insights: Soumen Chakrabarti, Chih Jen Lin, Wei-Ying Ma, Alex J. Smola, Limsoon Wong, and Tong Zhang. 
 
At CIKM 2014, we inaugurate a programming competition, sponsored by Baidu Inc. The competition has attracted 571 teams to sign up from around the world, with top-ranked teams achieving significant results on the task given.
