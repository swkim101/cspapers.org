This paper introduces SKiT, a fast Key information Transformer for phase recognition of videos. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex models to capture long-term temporal information, SKiT accurately recognizes high-level stages of videos using an efficient key pooling operation. This operation records important key information by retaining the maximum value recorded from the beginning up to the current video frame, with a time complexity of ${\mathcal{O}}\left( 1 \right)$. Experimental results on Cholec80 and AutoLaparo surgical datasets demonstrate the ability of our model to recognize phases in an online manner. SKiT achieves higher performance than state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 92.5% and 82.9% on Cholec80 and AutoLaparo, respectively, while running the temporal model eight times faster (7ms v.s. 55ms) than LoViT, which uses ProbSparse to capture global information. We highlight that the inference time of SKiT is constant, and independent from the input length, making it a stable choice for keeping a record of important global information, that appears on long surgical videos, essential for phase recognition. To sum up, we propose an effective and efficient model for surgical phase recognition that leverages key global information. This has an intrinsic value when performing this task in an online manner on long surgical videos for stable real-time surgical recognition systems.
