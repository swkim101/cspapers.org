Algorithmic estimations of worker behavior are gaining popularity. Passive Sensing–enabled AI (PSAI) systems leverage behavioral traces from workers’ digital tools to infer their experience. Despite their conceptual promise, the practical designs of these systems elicit tensions that lead to workers resisting adoption. This paper teases apart the monolithic representation of PSAI by investigating system components that maximize value and mitigate concerns. We conducted an interactive online survey using the Experimental Vignette Method. Using Linear Mixed-effects Models we found that PSAI systems were more acceptable when sensing digital time use or physical activity, instead of visual modes. Inferences using language were only acceptable in work-restricted contexts. Compared to insights into performance, workers preferred insights into mental wellbeing. However, they resisted systems that automatically forwarded these insights to others. Our findings provide a template to reflect on existing systems and plan future implementations of PSAI to be more worker-centered.
