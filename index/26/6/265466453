Existing super-resolution (SR) models primarily focus on restoring local texture details, often neglecting the global semantic information within the scene. This oversight can lead to the omission of crucial semantic details or the intro-duction of inaccurate textures during the recovery process. In our work, we introduce the Cognitive Super-Resolution (CoSeR) framework, empowering SR models with the ca-pacity to comprehend low-resolution images. We achieve this by marrying image appearance and language under-standing to generate a cognitive embedding, which not only activates prior information from large text-to-image diffusion models but also facilitates the generation of high-quality reference images to optimize the SR process. To fur-ther improve image fidelity, we propose a novel condition injection scheme called “Ali-in-Attention ”, consolidating all conditional information into a single module. Conse-quently, our method successfully restores semantically cor-rect and photorealistic details, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
