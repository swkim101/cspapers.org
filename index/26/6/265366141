 The design of vehicular components is often complicated by the presence of many conflicting goals, such as improved energy absorption for safety, mass reduction for increased fuel economy, and so on. The uncertainties associated with the manufacturing processes involved in realizing the components impact vehicular performance. Hence, the design of vehicular components needs to account for many conflicting goals and associated uncertainties to ensure performance. We look at managing the uncertainties involved by exploring the design space and seeking a ranged set of ‘satisficing robust solutions’ that are relatively insensitive to uncertainties while still meeting the requirements of the designers.
 In this paper, we present a robust design exploration framework that combines the robust concept exploration framework with a machine learning-based visualization technique called interpretable Self-Organizing Map (iSOM) to support the design exploration and visualization for problems with many (more than three) conflicting goals. In the framework presented, we examine uncertainty associated with the design variables that define the many conflicting goals. A robust goal formulation using the Design Capability Index (DCI) construct is employed in the framework to account for the design variable uncertainties. The use of iSOM for visualization of design spaces allows designers to overcome the limitation of conventional ternary plot-based visualization, where designers are limited to visualizing a maximum of 3 goals at a time. The framework presented supports designers in efficiently visualizing and exploring high-dimensional robust design spaces and identifying satisficing robust solutions, which was not possible previously.
