This volume contains the proceedings of the Twenty-second ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2003), held at San Diego, California on June 9-11, 2003 in conjunction with the 2003 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data and as part of the Federated Computing Research Conference FCRC 2003. It consists of a paper based on the invited talk by Rick Hull, a paper based on the invited tutorial by Rakesh Agrawal, and 27 contributed papers that were selected by the program committee for presentation at the symposium.The contributed papers were selected from 136 submissions. Most of the papers are "extended abstracts" and are preliminary reports on work in progress. While they have been read by program committee members, they have not been formally refereed. It is expected that much of the research described in these papers will be published in detail in computer science journals.The program committee selected \An Information-Theoretic Approach to Normal Forms for Relational and XML Data" by Marcelo Arenas and Leonid Libkin for the PODS 2003 Best Paper Award and "Algorithms for Data Migration with Cloning" by Samir Khuller, Yoo-Ah Kim, Yung-Chun (Justin) Wan for the PODS 2003 Best Newcomer Award. Warmest congratulations to the authors of these papers.
