Understanding nutrition labels remains challenging for consumers; however, digital shopping environments offer opportunities to explore how interactive nutrition labels may be used to enhance comprehension. We conducted an A/B study with 24 participants, comparing their ability to interpret and apply nutrition information using conventional, static labels versus interactive labels. We evaluated interactive nutrition labels’ impact through quantitative metrics and qualitative insights from interviews and think-aloud sessions. Our findings reveal a statistically significant improvement in assessing nutrient amounts and interpreting numerical information when users engage with interactive labels. These results underscore the potential interactivity has on promoting public understanding of nutritional content and highlight opportunities for refinement. Based on our findings, we propose new design directions and discuss technology’s role in making nutrition labels more effective for decision-making and nutrition education.
