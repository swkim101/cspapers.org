We investigate relations between average case complexity and the complexity of approximation. Our preliminary findings indicate that this is a research direction that leads to interesting insights. Under the assumption that refuting 3SAT is hard on average on a natural distribution, we derive hardness of approximation results for min bisection, dense k-subgraph, max bipartite clique and the 2-catalog segmentation problem. No NP-hardness of approximation results are currently known for these problems.
