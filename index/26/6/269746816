The sound produced when touching fabrics, like a blanket, often provides information regarding the fabric’s texture properties (e.g., its roughness). Fabric roughness is one of the most important aspects of assessing fabric tactile properties. Prior research has demonstrated that touch-related sounds can alter the perception of textures. However, understanding touch-related sound of digital fabric textures, and how they could convey affective responses remain a challenge. In this study, we mapped digital fabric textures using mid-air haptics stimuli and examined how auditory manipulation influences people’s roughness perception. Through qualitative interviews, participants detailed that while rubbing sounds smoothen fabric texture perception, pure tone sounds of 450Hz and 900Hz accent roughness perception. The rubbing sound of fabric evoked associations with soft-materials and led to more calming experiences. In addition, we discussed how haptic interaction can be extended to multisensory modes, revealing a new perspective of mapping multisensory experiences for digital fabrics.
