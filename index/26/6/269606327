Feeling haptics with our fingerpads is how we achieve manual tasks (e.g., operate a needle or press buttons). Following this, research started adding actuators atop the users’ fingerpads to render haptic feedback for interactive virtual environments. Recently, many have moved away from thick actuators (e.g., vibration motors) and turned to electrode-films with electrotactile stimulation—allowing users to still feel some sensations through the devices when touching physical objects (e.g., compliance or some macro features). However, we argue & demonstrate that thin devices are not enough to maximize the user's dexterity. We evaluate how adding small holes to electrotactile films can allow direct contact and thus increase haptic permeability, resulting in: (1) improved perception of tactile features; and (2) improved force control in grasping tasks. Finally, we observed participants in interactive experiences and found that holes can preserve dexterity with physical tasks while still benefiting from haptic feedback.
