Welcome to the International Workshop on Multicore Software Engineering (IWMSE 2008), the first workshop to focus on the software engineering challenges of chip-multiprocessors, or multi/manycore computers. With the emergence of multi/manycore, parallelism has become affordable at all levels, and software engineers now face the challenge of parallelizing performance-critical applications of all sorts, not just numeric applications. 
 
The workshop is intended to bring together researchers and practitioners with diverse backgrounds to advance the state of the art in software engineering for multi/manycore parallel applications. It aims to establish a community interested in advancing tools and methods for the cost-effective development of a broad spectrum of parallel applications, to start and extend a significant research dialog, and to push the boundaries of multicore software. 
 
The call for papers attracted 14 submissions from Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Russia, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States. The program committee accepted eight papers that cover a variety of topics, including parallel libraries, programming models and fault detection, multicore applications, and experience reports. In addition, the program includes a tutorial on IntelÂ® Threading Building Blocks -- an open source library that was designed to simplify programming for multi-core platforms -- and a tutorial on parallel computing with X10, a language that supports a variety of concurrent programming idioms. Capturing an initial state of research and practice, we hope that these proceedings serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers.
