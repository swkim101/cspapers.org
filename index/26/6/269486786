As artificial intelligence gains new capabilities, it

becomes important to evaluate it on real-world

tasks. In particular, the fields of robotics and reinforcement learning (RL) are lacking in standardized benchmarking tasks on real hardware. To

facilitate reproducibility and stimulate algorithmic

advancements, we held an AI Olympics competition at IJCAI 2023 conference based on the double

pendulum system in the RealAIGym project where

the participants were asked to develop a controller

for the swing up and stabilization task. This paper

presents the methods and results from the top participating teams and provides insights into the real-world performance of RL algorithms with respect

to a baseline time-varying LQR controller.
