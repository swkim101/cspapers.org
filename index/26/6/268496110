Circuit Tiles is a constructionist kit that utilizes children's curiosity about mosaics to explore STEAM skills and topics. The kit, targeted to children ages six or older, aims to discover basic circuits and electronics through modular circuit tiles by presenting them in a different context. Utilizing an artistic context, drawing from Spanish-style tiles and mosaic art traditions in Latin American and Hispanic countries allows an underrepresented group in STEAM to experience essential ideas differently. The design aims to increase the diversity of low-floor tangible electronic materials.
