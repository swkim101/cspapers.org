Heart anomalies, also known as congenital heart disorders, are structural aberrations in the heart that emerge during fetal development. This paper describes a method for categorizing ECG signals. After processing the input ECG signal, significant features are extracted to represent the signal. Then, a machine learning model, specially, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) is utilized to classify the signal into arrhythmia or normal one. According to the experimental results, the proposed strategy yields accuracies equivalent to those of the most advanced techniques described in the literature. The LGBM model used in this study has a remarkable ECG classification accuracy of 97%.
