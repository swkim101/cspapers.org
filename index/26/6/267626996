The development of cancer is difficult to express on a simple and intuitive level due to its complexity. Since cancer is so widespread, raising public awareness about its mechanisms can help those affected cope with its realities, as well as inspire others to make lifestyle adjustments and screen for the disease. Unfortunately, studies have shown that cancer literature is too technical for the general public to understand. We found that musification, the process of turning data into music, remains an unexplored avenue for conveying this information. We explore the pedagogical effectiveness of musification through the use of an algorithm that manipulates a piece of music in a manner analogous to the development of cancer. We conducted two lab studies and found that our approach is marginally more effective at promoting cancer literacy when accompanied by a text-based article than text-based articles alone.
