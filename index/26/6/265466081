High-resolution image generation with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAl) has immense potential but, due to the enormous capital investment required for training, it is increasimgly centralised to a few large corporations, and hidden behind paywalls. This paper aims to democratise high-resolution GenAl by advancing the frontier of high-resolution generation while remaining accessible to a broad audience. We demonstrate that existing Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) possess untapped potential for higher-resolution image generation. Our novel DemoFusion framework seamlessly extends open-source GenAl models, employing Progressive Upscaling, Skip Residual, and Di-lated Sampling mechanisms to achieve higher-resolution image generation. The progressive nature of DemoFusion requires more passes, but the intermediate results can serve as “previews”, facilitating rapid prompt iteration.
