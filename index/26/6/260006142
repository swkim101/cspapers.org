Radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting is a promising technology for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to power sensors and prolong battery life. In this paper, we present a novel side-channel attack that leverages RF energy harvesting signals to eavesdrop mobile app activities. To demonstrate this novel attack, we propose AppListener , an automated attack framework that recognizes ﬁne-grained mobile app activities from harvested RF energy. The RF energy is harvested from a custom-built RF energy harvester which generates voltage signals from ambient Wi-Fi transmissions, and app activities are recognized from a three-tier classiﬁcation algorithm. We evaluate AppListener with four mobile devices running 40 common mobile apps (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, and What-sApp) belonging to ﬁve categories (i.e., video, music, social media, communication, and game); each category contains ﬁve application-speciﬁc activities. Experiment results show that AppListener achieves over 99% accuracy in differentiating four different mobile devices, over 98% accuracy in classifying 40 different apps, and 86 . 7% accuracy in recognizing ﬁve sets of application-speciﬁc activities. Moreover, a comprehensive study is conducted to show AppListener is robust to a number of impact factors, such as distance, environment, and non-target connected devices. Practices of integrating Ap-pListener into commercial IoT devices also demonstrate that it is easy to deploy. Finally, countermeasures are presented as the ﬁrst step to defend against this novel attack.
