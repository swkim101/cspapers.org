Instructional videos are becoming increasingly popular among computer science students. Over 78% of students frequently visit YouTube to find videos as supplement to their textbook or classroom instruction[1]. Recent surveys show that on average, 73% of students prefer having their instructors curate a supplemental video library to aid in their learning. Now, the emergence of generative AI is revolutionizing supplemental video instruction, enabling instructors to generate slides, recording scripts, and produce high-quality videos with deep search and embedded interactive activities. Generative AI also takes the student video learning to a new level by providing AI-generated video summaries, on-demand questions, and exploration of topics in greater depth. Integrating AI into standard videos greatly expands the possibilities of video-based learning. This workshop demonstrates how educators can enhance their existing video playlists by incorporating AI to increase student engagement and establish safety measures for AI use in education. By using dynamic dashboards, scheduled content, and gamified questions, instructors can maintain student focus. Drawing on insights from computer science courses taught at Princeton and Rutgers Universities, we will highlight the transformative potential of AI-enhanced videos in promoting active learning, particularly in large classes. We will discuss engagement strategies and real-time data visualizations applicable to any video platform. We will utilize the cubits.ai[2] platform, a Princeton University initiative that enhances the impact of computer science courses. The platform is free, and participants are encouraged to bring their own video playlists to curate them into AI-enabled collections by enhancing the student experience through integrated generative AI.
