Many researchers studying the performance tuning of systolic arrays have based their works on oversimplified assumptions like considering only divisors for loop tiling or pruning based on off-chip data communication to reduce the design space. In this paper, we present a comprehensive design space exploration tool named Odyssey for systolic array optimization. Odyssey results show that limiting tiling factors to only divisors of the problem size can cause up to 39% performance loss, and pruning the design space based on off-chip data movement can miss optimal designs. We tested Odyssey using various matrix multiplication and convolution kernels and validated the results with FPGA implementations.
