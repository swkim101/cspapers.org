This paper considers the unlabeled sparse recovery under multiple measurements, i.e., Y = ⇧ \ XB \ + W , where Y 2 R n ⇥ m , ⇧ \ 2 R n ⇥ n , X 2 R n ⇥ p , B \ 2 R p ⇥ m , W 2 R n ⇥ m represents the observations, missing (or incomplete) correspondence information, sensing matrix, sparse signals, and additive sensing noise, respectively. Different from the previous works on multiple measurements ( m > 1 ) which all focus on the sufﬁcient samples regime, namely, n > p , we consider a sparse matrix B \ and investigate the insufﬁcient samples regime (i.e., n ⌧ p ) for the ﬁrst time. To begin with, we establish the lower bound on the sample number and signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) for the correct permutation recovery. Then, we present a simple yet effective estimator. Under mild conditions, we show that our estimator can restore the correct correspondence information with high probability. Numerical experiments are presented to corroborate our theoretical claims.
