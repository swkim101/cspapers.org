Real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in-terventions are significantly impacted by material compatibility problems and size constraints in the MRI bore. Limited physi-cian access to patients within the bore of the MRI necessitates iterative positioning and imaging, which prolongs the duration of the procedure and increases patient risk. We present a passive MR-safe haptic teleoperation device for prostate needle biopsy inside an MRI machine. The device uses a low-friction hydrostatic transmission based on paired rolling diaphragm actuators, linear and rotary. The device has two degrees of freedom, allowing needle insertion and rotation. The robot produces negligible MR imaging artifacts, has effective positioning tracking, and can reliably detect needle punctures in the clinically relevant range. We describe the design components, system transparency, and perform a needle insertion test.
