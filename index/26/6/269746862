In contrast to dialogue, wherein the exchange of completed messages occurs through turn-taking, synlogue is a mode of conversation characterized by co-creative processes, such as mutually complementing incomplete utterances and cooperative overlaps of backchannelings. Such co-creative conversations have the potential to alleviate social divisions in contemporary information environments. This study proposed the design concept of a synlogue based on literature in linguistics and anthropology and explored features that facilitate synlogic interactions in computer-mediated interfaces. Through an experiment, we focused on aizuchi, an important backchanneling element that drives synlogic conversation, and compared the speech and perceptual changes of participants when a bot dynamically uttered aizuchi or otherwise silent in a situation simulating an online video call. Consequently, we discussed the implications for interaction design based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis of the experiment. The synlogic perspective presented in this study is expected to facilitate HCI researchers to achieve more convivial forms of communication.
