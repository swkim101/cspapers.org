Formal logic can be used as a tool for representing complex and heterogeneous data such as beliefs, knowledge and preferences. This study proposes an approach for defining clustering methods that deal with bases of propositional formulas in classical logic, i.e., methods for dividing formula bases into meaningful groups. We first use a postulate-based approach for introducing an intuitive framework for formula clustering. Then, in order to characterize interesting clustering forms, we introduce additional properties that take into consideration different notions, such us logical consequence, overlapping, and consistent partition. Finally, we describe our approach that shows how the inconsistency

measures can be involved in improving the task of formula clustering. The main idea consists in using the measures for quantifying the quality of the inconsistent clusters. In this context, we propose further properties that allow characterizing interesting aspects related to the amount of inconsistency.
