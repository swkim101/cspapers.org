We propose a camera that measures static gradients instead of static intensities. Quantizing sensed intensity differences between adjacent pixel values permits an ordinary A/D converter to measure detailed high contrast (HDR) scenes. We measure alternating 'cliques' of sensors (small groups) that locally determine their own best exposure, and reconstruct the image using a Poisson solver. This intrinsically differential design suppresses common-mode noise, hides and smoothes quantization, and can correct for its own saturated sensors. Simulations demonstrate these capabilities in side-by-side comparisons.
