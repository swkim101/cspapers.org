In this poster, we introduce a set of modules designed to enhance security education in introductory programming courses. The modules cover a range of prevalent security concerns, including topics such as integer overflow, buffer overflow, and user input validation. These critical security problems are addressed to equip students with essential knowledge and skills in secure coding. The modules feature code examples within sandbox environments, as well as presented using the Python Tutor code visualizer. The eight modules align seamlessly with chapters found in popular introductory programming courses. Each example has been implemented in C++, Java, and Python, ensuring broad applicability across different programming languages.
