Since mobile apps’ privacy policies are usually complex, various tools have been developed to examine whether privacy policies have contradictions and verify whether privacy policies are consistent with the apps’ behaviors. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work answers whether the personal data collection practices (PDCPs) in an app’s privacy policy are necessary for given purposes ( i.e. , whether to comply with the principle of data minimization ). Though deﬁned by most existing privacy regulations/laws such as GDPR, the principle of data minimization has been translated into different privacy practices depending on the different contexts ( e.g. , various developers and targeted users). In the end, the developers can collect personal data claimed in the privacy policies as long as they receive authorizations from the users. Currently, it mainly relies on legal experts to manually audit the necessity of personal data collection according to the spe-ciﬁc contexts, which is not very scalable for millions of apps. In this study, we aim to take the ﬁrst step to automatically investigate whether PDCPs in an app’s privacy policy are over-broad from the perspective of counterpart comparison . Our basic insight is that, if an app claims to collect much more personal data in its privacy policy than most of its counterparts, it is more likely to be conducting overbroad collection. To achieve this, P OLICY C OMP , an automatic framework for detecting overbroad PDCPs is proposed. We use P OLICY C OMP to perform a large-scale analysis
