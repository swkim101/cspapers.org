Given the high-stakes nature of healthcare decision-making, we aim to improve the efficiency of human annotators rather than re-placing them with fully automated solutions. We introduce a new comprehensive resource, S YMPTOMIFY , a dataset of annotated vaccine adverse reaction reports detailing individual vaccine reactions. The dataset, consisting of over 800 k reports, surpasses previous datasets in size. Notably, it features reasoning-based explanations alongside background knowledge obtained via language model knowledge harvesting. We assess data quality, and evaluate performance across various methods and learning paradigms, paving the way for future comparisons and benchmarking. 1
