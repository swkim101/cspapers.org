Sliding mode control (SMC) of a system which is linear with respect to control and its application to robotic manipulator control system design is presented. The controller is designed to provide sliding mode motion on selected manifolds in the state space. These manifolds are selected as a linear combination of the state coordinates. This selection allows the formulation of the path tracking control, force control, and impedance control problems to be very similar. The control is selected to satisfy selected Lyapunov function and stability criteria.
