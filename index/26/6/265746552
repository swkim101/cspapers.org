Welcome to WETSoM2012, the 3rd International Workshop on Emerging Trends in Software Metrics. Since its start, WETSoM attracted a blend of academic and industrial researchers, creating a stimulating atmosphere to discuss the progresses of software metrics. A key motivation for this workshop is to help overcoming the low impact that software metrics has on current software development. This is pursued by critically examining the evidence for the effectiveness of existing metrics and identifying new directions for metrics. Evidence for existing metrics includes how the metrics have been used in practice and studies showing their effectiveness. Identifying new directions includes use of new theories, such as complex network theory, on which to base metrics.
