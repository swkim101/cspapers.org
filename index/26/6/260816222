INSPECTOR is a proprietary software system that is designed to be used in an information retrieval environment. Specifically, it is oriented toward the on-line retrieval of microfilmed documents through the indexing of certain key terms relating to the document itself. Items such as date, account number, name, customer name or number, purchase order number, etc. might be considered as key descriptive terms. Thus by indexing these elements on a randomly accessible disk drive, the location of the filmed image of all original documents pertaining to a particular descriptive term may be quickly located by the computer and the location displayed to the operator. Alternatively, if used in conjunction with the Eastman Kodak IC-5/PR-1 microfilm retrieval unit, the computer system will cause the film display unit to automatically advance to the correct frame(s), keeping operator intervention to an absolute minimum.
