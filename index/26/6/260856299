AllDifferent constraint is widely used in Constraint Programming to model real world problems. Existing Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC) algorithms map an AllDifferent constraint onto a bipartite graph and utilize the structure of Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in the graph to filter values. Calculating SCCs is time-consuming in the existing algorithms, so we propose a novel GAC algorithm for AllDifferent constraint in this paper, which eliminates the computation of SCCs. We prove that all redundant edges in the bipartite graph point to some alternating cycles. Our algorithm exploits this property and uses a more efficient method to filter values, which is based on breadth-first search. Experimental results on the XCSP3 benchmark suite show that our algorithm considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art GAC algorithms.
