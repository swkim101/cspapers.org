We present ShapeScaffolder, a structure-based neural network for generating colored 3D shapes based on text input. The approach, similar to providing scaffolds as internal structural supports and adding more details to them, aims to capture finer text-shape connections and improve the quality of generated shapes. Traditional text-to-shape methods often generate 3D shapes as a whole. However, humans tend to understand both shape and text as being structure-based. For example, a table is interpreted as being composed of legs, a seat, and a back; similarly, texts possess inherent linguistic structures that can be analyzed as dependency graphs, depicting the relationships between entities within the text. We believe structure-aware shape generation can bring finer text-shape connections and improve shape generation quality. However, the lack of explicit shape structure and the high freedom of text structure make cross-modality learning challenging. To address these challenges, we first build the structured shape implicit fields in an unsupervised manner. We then propose the part-level attention mechanism between shape parts and textual graph nodes to align the two modalities at the structural level. Finally, we employ a shape refiner to add further detail to the predicted structure, yielding the final results. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our approaches outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both shape fidelity and shape-text matching. Our methods also allow for part-level manipulation and improved part-level completeness.
