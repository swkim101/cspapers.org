In this work, we exploit the recent notion of closed-loop state sensitivity to critically compare three typical controllers for a quadrotor UAV with the goal of evaluating the impact of controller choice, gain tuning and shape of the reference trajectory in minimizing the sensitivity of the closed-loop system against uncertainties in the model parameters. To this end, we propose a novel optimization problem that takes into account both the shape of the reference trajectory and the controller gains. We then run a large statistical campaign for comparing the performance of the three controllers which provides some interesting insight for the goal of increasing closed-loop robustness against parametric uncertainties.
