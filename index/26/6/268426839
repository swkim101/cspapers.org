Delivering meaningful and inspiring cyber security education for younger audiences can often be a challenge due to limited expertise and resources. Key to any outreach activity is that it both develops a learner's curiosity, as well as providing educational objectives. To address this need, we developed a novel learning and awareness activity that addresses the Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) Security knowledge area as mapped by the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK). At the core of our activity is the integration of the Raspberry Pi device with LEGO SPIKE kits. LEGO SPIKE is part of the LEGO Education system that combines colourful LEGO building blocks with motors and sensors, creating an adaptable and engaging learning environment. This hands-on approach allows participants to witness the tangible consequences of cyber and network actions in a physical and engaging format. To evaluate the effectiveness of the activity, we used the activity as part of an outreach activity day attended by approximately 300 students aged between 12-14 from schools across the West of England. Participants of the activity were surveyed and the results showed an increase in understanding of CPS specific and wider cyber security for over 90% of respondents. Activity engagement was also well received with no negative feedback. We report on our survey findings and discuss best practices to support other practitioners in developing hands-on interactive experiences for engaging and educational cyber security activities.
