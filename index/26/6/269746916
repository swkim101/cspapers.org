As designers and researchers, it is our duty to ensure information accessibility for all, irrespective of cognitive abilities. Currently, Easy-to-Read (ETR) is commonly used to simplify text for individuals with cognitive impairments. Although design aspects of text comprehensibility have recently gained attention, digital design patterns remain relatively unexplored. Our understanding of how ETR users interact with digital media, and how to design specifically for their needs, is still limited. Our study involved observing 20 German ETR users engaging with a digital PDF and a website designed in a participatory process. We collected data on their access to digital media, personal use and workarounds, and their interaction with digital design patterns. Tasks on the smartphone were completed mostly successfully, while only 50% could navigate a digital PDF. In both cases, visual cues played a significant role. Our findings contribute recommendations for beneficial digital design patterns and future research.
