The fingerprint assignment is tailored for the Fundamentals of Computer Programming I and II courses, a.k.a. CS1 and CS2, with a primary focus on teaching the principles of two-dimensional arrays and object-oriented using Java. While these concepts are core to CS1, the assignment is divided into three sections that delve into introductory computing topics, emphasizing cybersecurity and data analytics to captivate students' interest in CS1. This approach is driven by industry recommendations and education agencies. The assignment has been effectively implemented in both CS1 and CS2 classes within a two-year computer science program offered at an HSI community college. It serves a diverse range of audiences, including traditional CS1 and CS2 assessments, acting as a remedial tool for CS2, a project for CS1 honors students, and a summative assessment for Competency-Based Education (CBE). The assignment aligns with specific Student Learning Outcomes outlined in three distinct ACM curricular guidelines, including the ACM/IEEE-CS/AAAI CS2023. Additionally, it leverages "Bloom's for Computing: Enhancing Bloom's Revised Taxonomy with Verbs for Computing Disciplines" to stimulate various levels of cognitive understanding throughout the assignment. Furthermore, it consolidates topics typically covered in CS1, synthesizing these concepts into a single, comprehensive activity. This assignment also recognizes Competency-Based Education (CBE) as a formative assessment method suitable for a wide range of technical and non-technical programs. Lastly, it offers a flexible delivery structure, allowing educators to seamlessly integrate it into their classrooms in a modular fashion.
