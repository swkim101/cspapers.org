Secure two-party computation (2PC) in the RAM model has attracted huge attention in recent years. Most existing results only support semi-honest security, with the exception of Keller and Yanai (Eurocrypt 2018) with very high cost. In this paper, we propose an efficient RAM-based 2PC protocol with active security and one-bit leakage.1)We propose an actively secure protocol for distributed point function (DPF), with one-bit leakage, that is essentially as efficient as the state-of-the-art semi-honest protocol. Compared with previous work, our protocol takes about 50Ã— less communication for a domain with 220 entries, and no longer requires actively secure generic 2PC.2)We extend the dual-execution protocol to allow reactive computation, and then build a RAM-based 2PC protocol with active security on top of our new building blocks. The protocol follows the paradigm of Doerner and shelat (CCS 2017). We are able to prove that the protocol has end-to-end one-bit leakage.3)Our implementation shows that our protocol is almost as efficient as the state-of-the-art semi-honest RAM-based 2PC protocol, and is at least two orders of magnitude faster than prior actively secure RAM-based 2PC without leakage, providing a realistic trade-off in practice.
