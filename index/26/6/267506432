Nowadays there are a wealth of devices and cameras at sports venues and facilities that collect different forms of data. Mining useful insights from such data are crucial for improving the performance of professional athletes. In this paper, we introduce a new interactive tennis analytics framework that can realistically simulate tennis matches using parameters mined from past match data and help reveal in-depth knowledge about tennis strategies. Our approach uses probabilistic model checking to formally evaluate the effectiveness of various strategies and tactics and recommend the best ones for improving playersâ€™ chances of winning. Our framework is easily understandable and actionable by players and coaches at any level. We have performed evaluations on tennis matches over the past decade to show the effectiveness of our strategy analytics framework.
