In this paper, we proposes a trilateration-based positioning model for constructing a real-time 2D map for wireless sensor network, that is help users real-time tracking the sensor node via an application without the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) module equipped on the sensor node. For building up the system, there are three anchor nodes whose locations are known, the receiver based on the received signal strengths (RSS) sending from three anchor nodes estimates its location and then uses that location information. The simulation and experimental results show that, with proposed model, it provides location information for a wireless sensor network with low positioning error in a real-life scenario, especially in indoor environment with obstacles. This proposed model can be applied for various wireless applications, such as tour guidance, asset tracking and management, fire escape guidance and so on with high accuracy and low cost.
