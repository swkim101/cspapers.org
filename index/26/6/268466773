This Birds of a Feather will begin with a high-level overview of the SIGCSE Reads 2024 books and then quickly move to discussion about mentoring students in the era of large language models and ChatGPT, including how students may value the curriculum differently, how learning outcomes may change, and how we can support students and alumni/ae as they work with rapidly changing job and learning expectations. We expect that many of the sessions at SIGCSE will address the radical shifts in learning outcomes and curricular changes due to LLMs. We will not focus on the particulars of these changes, but rather on mentoring in this time with Sister Resisters: Mentoring Black Women on Campus by Janie Victoria Ward and Tracy L. Robinson-Wood as a resource. How do we guide our students through the curriculum upheaval triggered by shifting learning outcomes? How do we help them prepare for the new instantiation of computer science? This BOF is the primary session for SIGCSE Reads. We encourage discussion of this year's fiction works The Lifecycle of Software Objects by Ted Chiang and "Dolly" by Elizabeth Bear, as well as past Reads, throughout the conference.
