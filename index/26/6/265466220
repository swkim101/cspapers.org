Realistic 3D human generationfrom text prompts is a de-sirable yet challenging task. Existing methods optimize 3D representations like mesh or neural fields via score distil-lation sampling (SDS), which suffers from inadequate fine details or excessive training time. In this paper, we pro-pose an efficient yet effective framework, HumanGaussian, that generates high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our key insight is that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with peri-odic Gaussian shrinkage or growing, where such adaptive density control can be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. Specifically, 1) we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that simultaneously optimizes human appear-ance and geometry. The multi-modal score function from both RGB and depth space is leveraged to distill the Gaus-sian densification and pruning process. 2) Moreover, we devise an Annealed Negative Prompt Guidance by decom-posing SDS into a noisier generative score and a cleaner classifier score, which well addresses the over-saturation issue. The floating artifacts are further eliminated based on Gaussian size in a prune-only phase to enhance generation smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the supe-rior efficiency and competitive quality of our framework, rendering vivid 3D humans under diverse scenarios.
