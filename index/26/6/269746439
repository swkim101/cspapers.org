Intergenerational communication can enhance well-being and family cohesion, but stereotypes and low empathy can be barriers to achieving effective communication. VR perspective-taking is a potential approach that is known to enhance understanding and empathy toward others by allowing a user to take another’s viewpoint. In this study, we introduce LegacySphere, a novel VR perspective-taking experience leveraging the combination of embodiment, role-play, and storytelling. To explore LegacySphere’s design and impact, we conducted an observational study involving five dyads with a one-generation gap. We found that LegacySphere promotes empathetic and reflexive intergenerational dialogue. Specifically, avatar embodiment encourages what we term “relationship cushioning,” fostering a trustful, open environment for genuine communications. The blending of real and embodied identities prompts insightful questions, merging both perspectives. The experience also nurtures a sense of unity and stimulates reflections on aging. Our work highlights the potential of immersive technologies for enhancing empathetic intergenerational relationships.
