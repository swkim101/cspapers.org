The label noise in real-world scenarios is unpredictable and can even be a mixture of different types of noise. To meet this challenge, we develop an adaptive textual label noise learning framework based on pre-trained models, which consists of an adaptive warm-up stage followed by a hybrid training stage. Specifically, an early stopping method, relying solely on the training set, is designed to dynamically terminate the warm-up process based on the modelâ€™s fit level to different noise scenarios. The hybrid training stage incorporates several generalization strategies to gradually correct mislabeled instances, thereby making better use of noisy data. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach performs on-par with or even better than the state-of-the-art methods in various noise scenarios, including scenarios with the mixture of multiple types of noise.
