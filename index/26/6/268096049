Regular expressions (REs) offer one-shot solutions for many networking tasks, e.g., network intrusion detection. However, REs purely rely on expert knowledge and cannot learn from massive ubiquitous network data for automatic management. Today, neural networks (NNs) have shown superior accuracy and flexibility, thanks to their ability to learn from rich labeled data. Nevertheless, NNs are often incompetent in cold-start scenarios and too complex for deployment on network devices. In this paper, we propose Metis, a general framework that converts REs to network device affordable models for superior accuracy and throughput by taking advantage of REs’ expert knowledge and NNs’ learning ability. In Metis, we convert REs to byte-level recurrent neural networks (BRNNs) without training. The BRNNs preserve expert knowledge from REs and offer adequate accuracy in cold-start scenarios. When rich labeled data is available, the performance of BRNNs can be improved by training. Furthermore, we design a semi-supervised knowledge distillation to transform the BRNNs into pooling soft random forests (PSRFs) that can be deployed on network devices. We collect network traffic data on a large data center for three weeks and evaluate Metis on them. Experimental results show that Metis is more accurate than original REs and other baselines, achieving superior throughput when deployed on network devices.
