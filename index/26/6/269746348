Fallback authentication, the process of re-establishing access to an account when the primary authenticator is unavailable, holds critical significance. Approaches range from secondary channels like email and SMS to personal knowledge questions (PKQs) and social authentication. A key difference to primary authentication is that the duration between enrollment and authentication can be much longer, typically months or years. However, few systems have been studied over extended timeframes, making it difficult to know how well these systems truly help users recover their accounts. We also lack meaningful comparisons of schemes as most prior work examined two mechanisms at most. We report the results of a long-term user study of the usability of fallback authentication over 18 months to provide a fair comparison of the four most commonly used fallback authentication methods. We show that users prefer email and SMS-based methods, while mechanisms based on PKQs and trustees lag regarding successful resets and convenience.
