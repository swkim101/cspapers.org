The simulation and evaluation of diverse 360° video streaming systems present inherent challenges due to the varied design objectives, streaming strategies, and evaluation metrics. This poster introduces E3PO, a versatile and extensible simulation and evaluation platform for 360° video streaming systems. E3PO excels in simulating all proposed variations of 360° video streaming methods, while also generating the precise view that users experience. We have implemented E3PO and developed a variety of examples that simulate different streaming approaches. The promising results from our evaluation of these simulated scenarios demonstrate E3PO's substantial potential to assist researchers in testing new designs, fine-tuning parameters, and comparing performance with their counterparts.
