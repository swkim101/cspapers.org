Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models like Transformers is vital for their safe and ethical use. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of a one-layer Transformer model trained for integer addition. We reveal that the model divides the task into parallel, digit-specific streams and employs distinct algorithms for different digit positions. Our study also finds that the model starts calculations late but executes them rapidly. A rare use case with high loss is identified and explained. Overall, the model's algorithm is explained in detail. These findings are validated through rigorous testing and mathematical modeling, contributing to the broader works in Mechanistic Interpretability, AI safety, and alignment. Our approach opens the door for analyzing more complex tasks and multi-layer Transformer models.
