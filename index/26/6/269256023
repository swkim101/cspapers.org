The advancement of both porous materials and nanomaterials has brought about porous nanomaterials. These new materials present advantages both due to their porosity and nano-size: small size apt for micro/nano device integration or in vivo transport, large surface area for guest/target molecule adsorption and interaction, porous channels providing accessibility to active/surface sites, and exposed reactive surface/active sites induced by uncoordinated bonds. These properties prove useful for the development of different porous composition types (metal oxides, silica, zeolites, amorphous oxides, nanoarrays, precious metals, non-precious metals, MOFs, carbon nanostructures, MXenes, and others) through different synthetic procedures—templating, colloidal synthesis, hydrothermal approach, sol-gel route, self-assembly, dealloying, galvanostatic replacement, and so—for different applications, such as catalysis (water-splitting, etc.), biosensing, energy storage (batteries, supercapacitors), actuators, SERS, and bio applications. Here, these are presented according to different material types showing the evolution of the structure design and development towards the formation of hierarchical porous structures, emphasizing that the formation of porous nanostructures came about out of the desire and need to form hierarchical porous nanostructures. Common trends observed across these different composition types include similar (aforementioned) applications and the use of porous nanomaterials as templates/precursors to create novel ones. Towards the end, a discussion on the link between technological advancements and the development of porous nanomaterials paves the way to present future perspectives on these nanomaterials and their hierarchical porous architectures. Together with a summary, these are given in the conclusion.
