As K-12 computer science education grows, so does the imperative for universities to prepare highly qualified computer science teachers. An increasing number of SIGCSE participants either have developed programs at their universities to credential CS teachers in their states, or are interested in doing so. This BOF provides an opportunity to build community, share best practices, and address challenges in creating CS teacher preparation programs. We particularly welcome participants from Colleges of Education.
