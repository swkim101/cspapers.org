Wheeled mobile robots need the ability to estimate their motion and the effect of their control actions for navigation planning. In this paper, we present ST-VIO, a novel approach which tightly fuses a single-track dynamics model for wheeled ground vehicles with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Our method calibrates and adapts the dynamics model online to improve the accuracy of forward prediction conditioned on future control inputs. The single-track dynamics model approximates wheeled vehicle motion under specific control inputs on flat ground using ordinary differential equations. We use a singularity-free and differentiable variant of the single-track model to enable seamless integration as dynamics factor into VIO and to optimize the model parameters online together with the VIO state variables. We validate our method with real-world data in both indoor and outdoor environments with different terrain types and wheels. In experiments, we demonstrate that ST-VIO can not only adapt to wheel or ground changes and improve the accuracy of prediction under new control inputs, but can even improve tracking accuracy.
