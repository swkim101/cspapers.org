This paper addresses the problem of obtaining complete, detailed reconstructions of shiny textureless objects. We present an algorithm which uses silhouettes of the object, as well as images obtained under varying illumination conditions. In contrast with previous photometric stereo techniques, ours is not limited to a single viewpoint and produces accurate reconstructions in full 3D. A number of images of the object are obtained from multiple viewpoints, under varying lighting conditions. Starting from the silhouettes, the algorithm recovers camera motion and constructs the objectâ€™s visual hull. This is then used to recover the illumination and initialise a multi-view photometric stereo scheme to obtain a closed surface reconstruction. The contributions of the paper are twofold: Firstly we describe a robust technique to estimate light directions and intensities and secondly, we introduce a novel formulation of photometric stereo which combines multiple viewpoints and hence allows closed surface reconstructions. The algorithm has been implemented as a practical model acquisition system. Here, a quantitative evaluation of the algorithm on synthetic data is presented together with a complete reconstruction of a challenging real object.
