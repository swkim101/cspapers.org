To optimize the preparation process for educators in academic lectures and associated question-and-answer sessions, this paper presents E-QGen, a lecture abstract-based question generation system. Given a lecture abstract, E-QGen generates potential student inquiries. The questions suggested by our system are expected to not only facilitate teachers in preparing answers in advance but also enable them to supply additional resources when necessary.
