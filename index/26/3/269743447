This paper discusses the findings from a cross-sector research project investigating how a digital score created using AI and robotics might stimulate new creative opportunities and relationships within the practices of an inclusive music ensemble. Through the concept of a digital score [65], AI and a robotic arm were introduced into an ensemble’s musical practice to evaluate the impact and benefits of using autonomous systems to challenge barriers around a disabled musician’s access to creative music-making. Throughout the development process we placed an emphasis on involvement and togetherness of not only the AI and robots’ contribution to shared creativity amongst the ensemble, but also to the social aspects of the creative process across the team of musicians, developers, researchers and supporting organisations. The findings were surprising with many aspects of the project exceeding the expectations of the original aims. In short, all the musicians benefited from the introduction of these unfamiliar technologies with practices enhanced and relationships transformed.
