Learning personalized self-management routines is pivotal for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), particularly early in diagnosis. Context-aware technologies, such as hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin pumps, are important tools for diabetes self-management. However, clinicians have observed that practices using these technologies involve significant individual differences. We conducted interviews with 20 adolescents and young adults who use HCL insulin pump systems for managing T1D, and we found that these individuals leverage both technological and non-technological means to maintain situational awareness about their condition. We discuss how these practices serve to infrastructure their self-management routines, including medical treatment, diet, and glucose measurement-monitoring routines. Our study provides insights into adolescents’ and young adults’ lived experiences of using HCL systems and related technology to manage diabetes, and contributes to a more nuanced understanding of how the HCI community can support the contextualized management of diabetes through technology design.
