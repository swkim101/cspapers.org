This paper presents a new approach to detecting abnormal situations in computer systems basing on an integrated monitoring, which covers performance parameters as well as other operational reports or logs. It takes into account different time perspectives and analysis goals. The presented methodology was implemented in Windows based systems. Its usefulness has been illustrated with some examples and statistics related to real production systems.
