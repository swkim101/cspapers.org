Natural motion mapping enhances the gaming experience by reducing the cognitive burden and increasing immersion. However, many players still use the keyboard and mouse in recent commercial PC games. To solve the conflict between complex avatar motion and the limited interaction system, we introduced CamTroller, an auxiliary tool for commercial one-to-one avatar mapping PC games following the concept of a NUI (natural user interface). To validate this concept, we selected PUBG as the application scenario and developed a proof-of-concept system to help players achieve a better experience by naturally mapping selected human motions to the avatars in games through an RGB webcam. A within-subject study with 18 non-professional players practiced common operation (Basic), professional playerâ€™s operation (Pro), and CamTroller. Results showed that the performance of CamTroller was as good as the Pro and significantly higher than Basic. Also, the subjective evaluation showed that CamTroller achieved significantly higher intuitiveness than Basic and Pro.
