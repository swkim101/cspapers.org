Jerk-constrained trajectories offer a wide range of advantages that collectively improve the performance of robotic systems, including increased energy efficiency, durability, and safety. In this paper, we present a novel approach to jerk-constrained time-optimal trajectory planning (TOTP), which follows a specified path while satisfying up to third-order constraints to ensure safety and smooth motion. One significant challenge in jerk-constrained TOTP is a non-convex formulation arising from the inclusion of third-order constraints. Approximating inequality constraints can be particularly challenging because the resulting solutions may violate the actual constraints. We address this problem by leveraging convexity within the proposed formulation to form conservative inequality constraints. We then obtain the desired trajectories by solving an n-dimensional Sequential Linear Program (SLP) iteratively until convergence. Lastly, we evaluate in a real robot the performance of trajectories generated with and without jerk limits in terms of peak power, torque efficiency, and tracking capability.
