Cross-document event coreference resolution (CD-ECR) is a task of clustering event mentions across multiple documents that refer to the same real-world events. Previous studies usually model the CD-ECR task as a pairwise similarity comparison problem by using different event mention features, and consider the highly similar event mention pairs in the same cluster as coreferent. In general, most of them only consider the local context of event mentions and ignore their implicit global information, thus failing to capture the interactions of long-distance event mentions. To address the above issue, we regard discourse structure as global information to further improve CD-ECR. First, we use a discourse rhetorical structure constructor to construct tree structures to represent documents. Then, we obtain shortest dependency paths from the tree structures to represent interactions between event mention pairs. Finally, we feed the above information to a multi-layer perceptron to capture the similarities of event mention pairs for resolving coreferent events. Experimental results on the ECB+ dataset show that our proposed model outperforms several baselines and achieves the competitive performance with the start-of-the-art baselines.
