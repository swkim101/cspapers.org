Most CS1 classes are designed to teach programming and computational thinking using a specific programming language such as Python or Java. This type of in-depth study leaves little room for creative exploration by students. In particular, at large colleges and universities, the programming assignments are usually autograded to keep up with expanding enrollment. This lightning talk will introduce the idea that simply adding three creative labs that do not use the actual course material, but instead expose students to other computing concepts, can give the students who are struggling a chance to catch up, while also offering them a much-needed breather doing something in computing that is individually directed and creative. Over the last few years, my Teaching Assistants (TAs) and I have developed three simple web development labs as assignments for our large CS1 classes. These three labs are usually given around each of the exam weeks and provide a much-needed break for the students from the regular class material that continues to build upon prior learning. Many students report that the labs were their favorite part of the course because they were creative and self-directed. This lightning talk aims to gather feedback on this concept and assess its potential for integration into advanced CS courses. I'm also keen to hear suggestions for alternative labs in a CS1 class that would both introduce students to further CS principles and allow them to showcase their creativity.
