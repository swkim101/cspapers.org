Topic segmentation aims to detect topic boundaries and split automatic speech recognition transcriptions (e.g., meeting transcripts) into segments that are bounded by thematic meanings. In this work, we propose M 3 Seg, a novel Maximum-Minimum Mutual information paradigm for linear topic segmentation without using any parallel data. Specifically, by employing sentence representations provided by pre-trained language models, M 3 Seg first learns a region-based segment encoder based on the maximization of mutual information be-tween the global segment representation and the local contextual sentence representation. Secondly, an edge-based boundary detection module aims to segment the whole by topics based on minimizing the mutual information between different segments. Experiment re-sults on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of M 3 Seg, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods by a significant (18%â€” 37% improvement) margin.
