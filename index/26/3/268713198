Social summarization aims to provide summaries for a large number of social texts (called posts) about a single topic. To extract a summary, both the representation of post and summary selection method are crucial. Previous methods introduce social relation to enhance post embedding to mitigate the sparse representation due to its brief and informal expression. However, they ignore that there are multiple relations between posts. Besides, existing graph-based centrality calculation approaches tend to select posts from one aspect. This leads to facet bias especially when there are multiple viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a model named MultiSum to improve social summarization. Specifically, 1) We use graph convolutional networks to fuse text content with social and semantic relations to improve post representation; 2) The similarity between the summary and all aspects is incorporated into the centrality score during the selection phase, encouraging the model to pay attention to different facets. Experimental results on English and Chinese corpora support the effectiveness of this model. Furthermore, external evaluations by human experts and large language models demonstrate the validity of MultiSum in facet coverage and redundancy reduction.
