With the increasing popularity of live streaming, the interactions from viewers during a live streaming can provide more specific and constructive feedback for both the streamer and platform. In such scenario, the primary and most direct feedback method from the audience is through comments. Thus, mining these live streaming comments to unearth the intentions behind them and, in turn, aiding streamers to enhance their live streaming quality is significant for the well development of live streaming ecosystem. To this end, we introduce the MMLSCU dataset, containing 50,129 intention-annotated comments across multiple modalities (text, images, vi-deos, audio) from eight streaming domains. Using multimodal pretrained large model and drawing inspiration from the Chain of Thoughts (CoT) concept, we implement an end-to-end model to sequentially perform the following tasks: viewer comment intent detection ➛ intent cause mining ➛ viewer comment explanation ➛ streamer policy suggestion. We employ distinct branches for video and audio to process their respective modalities. After obtaining the video and audio representations, we conduct a multimodal fusion with the comment. This integrated data is then fed into the large language model to perform inference across the four tasks following the CoT framework. Experimental results indicate that our model outperforms three multimodal classification baselines on comment intent detection and streamer policy suggestion, and one multimodal generation baselines on intent cause mining and viewer comment explanation. Compared to the models using only text, our multimodal setting yields superior outcomes. Moreover, incorporating CoT allows our model to enhance comment interpretation and more precise suggestions for the streamers. Our proposed dataset and model will bring new research attention on multimodal live streaming comment understanding.
