Approximate message passing (AMP) is a family of iterative algorithms that generalize matrix power iteration. AMP algorithms are known to optimally solve many average-case optimization problems. In this paper, we show that a large class of AMP algorithms can be simulated in polynomial time by local statistics hierarchy semidefinite programs (SDPs), even when an unknown principal minor of measure 1/polylog(dimension) is adversarially corrupted. Ours are the first robust guarantees for many of these problems. Further, our results offer an interesting counterpoint to strong lower bounds against less constrained SDP relaxations for average-case max-cut-gain (a.k.a. “optimizing the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian”) and other problems.
