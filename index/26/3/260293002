In this paper, we investigate how to complete human body shape models by combining shape and flow estimation given two consecutive depth images. Shape completion is a challenging task in computer vision that is highly under-constrained when considering partial depth observations. Besides model based strategies that exploit strong priors, and consequently struggle to preserve fine geometric details, learning based approaches build on weaker assumptions and can benefit from efficient implicit representations. We adopt such a representation and explore how the motion flow between two consecutive frames can contribute to the shape completion task. In order to effectively exploit the flow information, our architecture combines both estimations and implements two features for robustness: First, an all-to-all attention module that encodes the correlation between points in the same frame and between corresponding points in different frames; Second, a coarse-dense to fine-sparse strategy that balances the representation ability and the computational cost. Our experiments demonstrate that the flow actually benefits human body model completion. They also show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for shape completion on 2 benchmarks, considering different human shapes, poses, and clothing.
