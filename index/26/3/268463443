In a previous Birds of a Feather discussion, we delved into the nascent applications of generative AI, contemplating its potential and speculating on future trajectories. Since then, the landscape has continued to evolve revealing the capabilities and limitations of these models. Despite this progress, the computing education research community still faces uncertainty around pivotal aspects such as (1) academic integrity and assessments, (2) curricular adaptations, (3) pedagogical strategies, and (4) the competencies students require to instill responsible use of these tools. The goal of this Birds of a Feather discussion is to unravel these pressing and persistent issues with computing educators and researchers, fostering a collaborative exploration of strategies to navigate the educational implications of advancing generative AI technologies. Aligned with this goal of building an inclusive learning community, our BoF is led by globally distributed leaders to facilitate multiple coordinated discussions that can lead to a broader conversation about the role of LLMs in CS education.
