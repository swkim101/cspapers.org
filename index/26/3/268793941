We introduce a new notion of information complexity for multi-pass streaming problems and use it to resolve several important questions in data streams. In the coin problem, one sees a stream of n i.i.d. uniformly random bits and one would like to compute the majority with constant advantage. We show that any constant-pass algorithm must use Ω(logn) bits of memory, significantly extending an earlier Ω(logn) bit lower bound for single-pass algorithms of Braverman-Garg-Woodruff (FOCS, 2020). This also gives the first Ω(logn) bit lower bound for the problem of approximating a counter up to a constant factor in worst-case turnstile streams for more than one pass. In the needle problem, one either sees a stream of n i.i.d. uniform samples from a domain [t], or there is a randomly chosen needle α ∈[t] for which each item independently is chosen to equal α with probability p, and is otherwise uniformly random in [t]. The problem of distinguishing these two cases is central to understanding the space complexity of the frequency moment estimation problem in random order streams. We show tight multi-pass space bounds for this problem for every p < 1/√n log3 n, resolving an open question of Lovett and Zhang (FOCS, 2023); even for 1-pass our bounds are new. To show optimality, we improve both lower and upper bounds from existing results. Our information complexity framework significantly extends the toolkit for proving multi-pass streaming lower bounds, and we give a wide number of additional streaming applications of our lower bound techniques, including multi-pass lower bounds for ℓp-norm estimation, ℓp-point query and heavy hitters, and compressed sensing problems.
