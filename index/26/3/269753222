Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have been integrated into group music therapy, providing therapists with alternative ways to engage in musical dialogues with their clients. However, existing DMIs used in group settings are primarily designed for individual use and often overlook the social dynamics inherent in group therapy. Recognizing the crucial role of social interaction in the effectiveness of group therapy, we argue that Collaborative Digital Musical Instruments (CDMIs), seamlessly integrating social interaction with musical expression, hold significant potential to enhance group music therapy. To better tailor CDMIs for group music therapy, we engaged in a co-design process with music therapists, designing and practicing group therapy sessions involving the prototype ComString. In the end, we reflected on the co-design case to suggest future directions for designing CDMIs in group music therapy.
