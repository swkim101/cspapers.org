Open-domain multi-turn dialogue generation encounters the significant challenge of lacking various types of knowledge from diverse sources. Existing models typically focus on identifying specific types of dialogue knowledge and utilize corresponding datasets for training. However, this approach often leads to limited generalization capabilities and increased computational resource requirements. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on natural language processing tasks. To harness the knowledge storage of LLMs, we propose a framework named KnowEE that explores multi-source multi-type knowledge from LLMs by leveraging diverse datasets and then exploits the obtained knowledge for response generation. Our framework comprises two phases: First, we leverage five external datasets encompassing various types of knowledge to extract the most relevant samples to the dialogue context which are served as prompts to generate corresponding type of knowledge; Second, we inject the acquired knowledge into the ongoing dialogue context in fine-grained and coarse-grained man-ners, which is then fed into LLMs to generate the final dialogue response. Both automatic and manual evaluation results validate the effectiveness of our framework in exploring and exploiting multi-source multi-type knowledge to generate coherent, informative, and fluent responses. 1
