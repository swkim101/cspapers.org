This paper presents GRASP, a novel benchmark to evaluate the language grounding and physical understanding capabilities of video-based multimodal large language models (LLMs). This evaluation is accomplished via a two-tier approach leveraging Unity simulations. The first level tests for language grounding by assessing a model's ability to relate simple textual descriptions with visual information. The second level evaluates the model's understanding of "Intuitive Physics" principles, such as object permanence and continuity. In addition to releasing the benchmark, we use it to evaluate several state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs. Our evaluation reveals significant shortcomings in the language grounding and intuitive physics capabilities of these models. Although they exhibit at least some grounding capabilities, particularly for colors and shapes, these capabilities depend heavily on the prompting strategy. At the same time, all models perform below or at the chance level of 50% in the Intuitive Physics tests, while human subjects are on average 80% correct. These identified limitations underline the importance of using benchmarks like GRASP to monitor the progress of future models in developing these competencies.
