Office hour utilization in computer science courses can spike near deadlines, producing long wait times, frustrated students, and over-worked staff. To address this problem, a large CS1 course implemented a split deadlines policy. Students were randomly divided into two groups with staggered release and due dates. Each group had the same amount of time to complete assignments, but the number of students with each due date was reduced by half. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of this policy. We measure office hour utilization and staff efficiency near deadlines, examine the policy's impact on student performance, and investigate student perception of the policy's fairness and effectiveness. Overall we found that the split deadline policy increased office hour efficiency, resulted in no significant difference in performance between groups, and was considered fair and effective by most students. Our experience report includes reflections and student feedback indicating how to implement and further improve similar policies.
