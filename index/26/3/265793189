The paper presents a new model for collaborative design. The model is analogous to electrical circuits with current (rate of design artifact synthesis and analysis), voltage (knowledge that drives the design process), and resistance (barriers to the exchange of design information). The resistances are identified from a collaborative design taxonomy. This model is illustrated through a simple example. Extensions and an assessment of the model are provided.Copyright Â© 2004 by ASME
