Fisheye image rectification is hindered by synthetic models producing poor results for real-world correction. To address this, we propose a Dual Diffusion Architecture (DDA) for fisheye rectification that offers better practicality. The DDA leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to gradually introduce bidirectional noise, allowing the synthesized and real images to develop into a consistent noise distribution. As a result, our network can perceive the distribution of unlabelled real fisheye images without relying on a transfer network, thus improving the performance of real fisheye correction. Additionally, we design an unsupervised one-pass network that generates a plausible new condition to strengthen guidance and address the non-negligible indeterminacy between the prior condition and the target. It can significantly affect the rectification task, especially in cases where radial distortion causes significant artifacts. This network can be regarded as an alternate scheme for fast producing reliable results without iterative inference. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves superior performance in both synthetic and real fisheye image corrections.
