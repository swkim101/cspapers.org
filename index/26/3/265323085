In this work, an integrated workflow for electromagnetic interference (EMI) for radio frequency (RF) boards is introduced which combines 3D full-wave EM simulation for layout and circuit level using EM simulation software. Through isolation, insertion loss, and E-field, the performance of the electronic system could be predicted and estimated in the development phase. The workflow is applied for a 4T4R power amplifier and the process needs files such as the components model, PCB layout, and 3-D enclosures to predict system performance.
