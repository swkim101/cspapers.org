The recommender systems on online platforms assist users in finding personalized information, yet this also leads to the issue of limited diversity, potentially giving rise to societal issues such as filter bubbles. Despite significant progress in diversified recommendation algorithms, they have not been extensively experimented with and evaluated for effectiveness in large-scale, full-stage industrial recommender systems. Specifically, industrial recommenders usually consist of three stages of matching, ranking, and re-ranking, in which specific characteristics lead to critical challenges for promoting both recommendation diversity and user engagement. First, user interests are partially observed due to only relevance maximization. Second, item-side feature-aware bias causes imbalanced recommendations. Last, the impact of diversity perception on user engagement stresses the necessity of explicit diversity modeling. To address these challenges in industrial systems, in this work, we deploy several existing diversified algorithms in a real-world short-video platform, including exploration-exploitation, feature-aware debiasing, and diversity optimization. We conduct large-scale online A/B testing for evaluation via online metrics of user engagement and recommendation diversity. Performance improvement across full stages demonstrates the effectiveness of these simple solutions. From comparing performance across different stages and algorithms, we identify that the ranking stage is the most suitable for real-world deployment, and the combination of debiasing and diversity optimization is a promising direction in terms of diversified recommendations. This work provides experiential guidance for the large-scale deployment of diversified algorithms and the construction of a more inclusive platform on the Web.
