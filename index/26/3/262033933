This paper presents practical, high-level topological navigation tasks, making use of our general purpose landmark learning and detection system, which includes the possibility of reading text or icons inside detected landmarks. Room identification from inside, without any initialization, is achieved through its landmark signature. Room search along a corridor is done by reading the content of room nameplates placed around for human use; this allow the robot to take high-level decisions, and results in a higher integration degree of mobile robotics in real life.
