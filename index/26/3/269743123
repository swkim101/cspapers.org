Tagnoo is a computational plywood augmented with RFID tags, aimed at empowering woodworkers to effortlessly create room-scale smart environments. Unlike existing solutions, Tagnoo does not necessitate technical expertise or disrupt established woodworking routines. This battery-free and cost-effective solution seamlessly integrates computation capabilities into plywood, while preserving its original appearance and functionality. In this paper, we explore various parameters that can influence Tagnooâ€™s sensing performance and woodworking compatibility through a series of experiments. Additionally, we demonstrate the construction of a small office environment, comprising a desk, chair, shelf, and floor, all crafted by an experienced woodworker using conventional tools such as a table saw and screws while adhering to established construction workflows. Our evaluation confirms that the smart environment can accurately recognize 18 daily objects and user activities, such as a user sitting on the floor or a glass lunchbox placed on the desk, with over 90% accuracy.
