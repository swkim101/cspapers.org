Transparent objects are common in daily life. However, depth sensing for transparent objects remains a challenging problem. While learning-based methods can leverage shape priors to improve the sensing quality, the labor-intensive data collection in real world and the sim-to-real domain gap restrict these methods' scalability. In this paper, we propose a method to finetune a stereo network with sparse depth labels automatically collected using a probing system with tactile feedback. We present a novel utility function to evaluate the benefit of touches. By approximating and optimizing the utility function, we can optimize the probing locations given a fixed touching budget to better improve the network's performance on real objects. We further combine tactile depth supervision with a confidence-based regularization to prevent over-fitting during finetuning. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we construct a real-world dataset including both diffuse and transparent objects. Experimental results on this dataset show that our method can significantly improve real-world depth sensing accuracy, especially for transparent objects.
