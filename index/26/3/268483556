There is growing consensus that focused attention on increasing the computer science (CS) certification of Black and Brown teachers is needed. More certified CS Black and Brown teachers can propel equity-based CS principles, support diverse CS classrooms, and diffuse culturally relevant teaching practices. The Computing Educator Diversity Initiative (CEDI) is a tailored in-person and online professional development program that supports the growth and development of CS knowledge and inclusive pedagogy for educators. CEDI specifically recruits teachers who reflect the racial and ethnic identities of the student populations in their schools. Through a Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) that facilitated use of improvement science tools, culturally relevant professional development, and collaboration, CEDI assisted aspiring CS teachers to become certified. Findings from two cohorts of CS teachers revealed that engaging within a cohesive community of practice led to the cultivation of CS expertise, pedagogical proficiencies, and equitable teaching methodologies.
