[Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1991] introduced simple disjunctive logic programs and defined the answer set semantics called GL-semantics. We observed that the requirement of GL-semantics, i.e., an answer set should be a minimal model of the GL-reduct may be too strong and exclude some answer sets that would be reasonably acceptable. To address this, we present a novel and more permissive semantics, called determining inference semantics.
