We present LoLKV, a novel logless replicated key-value storage system. LoLKV follows a fundamentally different approach for designing a linearizable key-value storage system compared to state-of-the-art systems. LoLKV forgoes the classical log-based design and uses lock-free approach to allow multiple threads to concurrently update objects. It presents a novel leader election and consolidation approach to handle complex failure scenarios. LoLKV’s followers are passive, reducing their overall CPU usage. Our evaluation shows that LoLKV achieves 1 . 7–10 × higher throughput and 20–92% lower tail latency than other state-of-the-art low-latency key-value stores.
