This paper introduces hot potato high level synthesis transformation techniques. These techniques add deflection operations in a computation in such a way that a specific goal is optimized. We demonstrate how the requirements for two important components of the final implementation cost, registers and interconnects, are significantly reduced using new technique. It is also demonstrated how hot potato techniques can be effectively used during high level synthesis to minimize the partial scan overhead to make the synthesized design testable.
