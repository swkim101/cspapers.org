Cryptocurrencies, while revolutionary, have become a magnet for malicious actors. With numerous reports underscoring cyberattacks and scams in this domain, our paper takes the lead in characterizing visual scams associated with cryptocurrency wallets---a fundamental component of Web3. Specifically, scammers capitalize on the omission of vital wallet interface details, such as token symbols, wallet addresses, and smart contract function names, to mislead users, potentially resulting in unintended financial losses. Analyzing Ethereum blockchain transactions from July 2022 to June 2023, we uncovered a total of 24,901,115 visual scam incidents, which include 3,585,493 counterfeit token attacks, 21,281,749 zero-transfer attacks, and 33,873 function name attacks, orchestrated by 6,768 distinct attackers. Shockingly, over 28,414 victims fell prey to these scams, with losses surpassing 27 million USD. This alarming data underscores the pressing need for robust protective measures. By profiling the typical victims and attackers, we are able to propose mitigation strategies informed by our findings.
