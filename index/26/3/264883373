Ontology-based data management aims at accessing and using data by means of an ontology, i.e., a conceptual representation of the domain of interest in the underlying information system. This new paradigm provides several interesting features, many of which have been already proved effective in managing complex information systems. On the other hand, several important issues remain open, and constitute stimulating challenges for the research community. In this talk we first provide an introduction to ontology-based data management, illustrating the main ideas and techniques for using an ontology to access the data layer of an information system, and then we discuss several important issues that are still the subject of extensive investigations, including the need of inconsistency tolerant query answering methods, and the need of supporting update operations expressed over the ontology.
