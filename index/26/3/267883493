ISSS'99 is the 12th in a very successful series of symposia oriented towards professionals in design automation and system level design. As a student, I have had the opportunity to participate in the first event in the series (which was called the International High Level Synthesis Workshop) held in Catalina Island, CA in 1984. Back then, many of the "high level" research issues were more related to what is now referred to as logic and physical synthesis. Architectural synthesis was purely a research topic, and system synthesis was not even on the horizon. In 1994, the Workshop became a symposium, and was renamed in 1995 the International Symposium on System Synthesis. The aim of these changes was to recognize both the increased importance of the area, as well as the emergence of system level design as the next level of abstraction in the quest to design more and more complex systems-on-a-chip. The pervasiveness of such systems is not only witnessed in interactive computing but also in the much broader market of embedded systems. Today, over 96% of the 4 Billion Microprocessor/Microcontrollers shipped can be found in embedded systems. As these processors are integrated with memory, peripherals, ASIC blocks, and even MEMS components on a single die, the need for new tools and design paradigms at this level of abstraction becomes much more pronounced.
