As natural language models like ChatGPT become increasingly prevalent in applications and services, the need for robust and accurate methods to detect their output is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present GPT Reddit Dataset (GRiD), a novel Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)-generated text detection dataset designed to assess the performance of detection models in identifying generated responses from ChatGPT. The dataset consists of a diverse collection of context-prompt pairs based on Reddit, with human-generated and ChatGPT-generated responses. We provide an analysis of the dataset's characteristics, including linguistic diversity, context complexity, and response quality. To showcase the dataset's utility, we benchmark several detection methods on it, demonstrating their efficacy in distinguishing between human and ChatGPT-generated responses. This dataset serves as a resource for evaluating and advancing detection techniques in the context of ChatGPT and contributes to the ongoing efforts to ensure responsible and trustworthy AI-driven communication on the internet. Finally, we propose GpTen, a novel tensor-based GPT text detection method that is semi-supervised in nature since it only has access to human-generated text and performs on par with fully-supervised baselines.
