Marking menus are designed to overcome these problems. Using a marking menu with a pen based computer works as follows. A user presses down on the screen with the pen and waits approximately 1/3 second (we refer to this as "press-and-wait"). A radial menu [2] [12] then appears directly under the tip of the pen. A user then highlights an item by keeping the pen pressed and making a stroke towards the desired item (see Figure 1a). The alternate way of selecting an item is by drawing a mark. This relies on the user recalling the location of the item in the menu. A mark is drawn by pressing the pen down and immediately moving in the direction of the desired menu item (see Figure 1b). 1 ABSTRACT A marking menu is designed to allow a user to perform a menu selection by either popping-up a radial (or pie) menu, or by making a straight mark in the direction of the desired menu item without popping-up the menu. Previous evaluations in laboratory settings have shown the potential of marking menus. This paper reports on a case study of user behavior with marking menus in a real work situation. The study demonstrates the following: First, marking menus are used as designed. When users become expert with the menus, marks are used extensively. However, the transition to using marks is not one way. Expert users still switch back to menus to refresh their memory of menu layout. Second, marking is an extremely efficient interaction technique. Using a mark on average was 3.5 times faster than selection using the menu. Finally, design principles can be followed that make menu item/mark associations easier to learn, and interaction efficient.
