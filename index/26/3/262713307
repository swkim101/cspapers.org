Trajectory similarity computation is a core problem in the field of trajectory data queries. However, the high time complexity of calculating the trajectory similarity has always been a bottleneck in real-world applications. Learning-based methods can map trajectories into a uniform embedding space to calculate the similarity of two trajectories with embeddings in constant time. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory representation learning framework Traj2SimVec that performs scalable and robust trajectory similarity computation. We use a simple and fast trajectory simplification and indexing approach to obtain triplet training samples efficiently. We make the framework more robust via taking full use of the sub-trajectory similarity information as auxiliary supervision. Furthermore, the framework supports the point matching query by modeling the optimal matching relationship of trajectory points under different distance metrics. The comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms all existing approaches.
