Legged robots are becoming increasingly agile in exhibiting dynamic behaviors such as running and jumping. Usually, such behaviors are either optimized and engineered offline (i.e. the behavior is designed for before it is needed), either through model-based trajectory optimization, or through deep learning-based methods involving millions of timesteps of simulation interactions. Notably, such offline-designed locomotion controllers cannot perfectly model the true dynamics of the system, such as the motor dynamics. In contrast, in this paper, we consider a quadruped jumping task that we rapidly optimize online. We design foot force profiles parameterized by only a few parameters which we optimize for directly on hardware with Bayesian Optimization. The force profiles are tracked at the joint level, and added to Cartesian PD impedance control and Virtual Model Control to stabilize the jumping motions. After optimization, which takes only a handful of jumps, we show that this control architecture is capable of diverse and omnidirectional jumps including forward, lateral, and twist (turning) jumps, even on uneven terrain, enabling the Unitree Go1 quadruped to jump 0.5 m high, 0.5 m forward, and jump-turn over 2 rad.
