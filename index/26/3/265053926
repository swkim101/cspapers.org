Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an access control service employed within cloud platforms. Customers must configure IAM to establish secure access control rules for their cloud organizations. However, IAM misconfigurations can be exploited to conduct Privilege Escalation (PE) attacks, resulting in significant financial losses. Consequently, addressing these PEs is crucial for improving security assurance for cloud customers. Nevertheless, the area of repairing IAM PEs due to IAM mis-configurations is relatively underexplored. To our knowledge, the only existing IAM repair tool called IAM-Deescalate focuses on a limited number of IAM PE patterns, indicating the potential for further enhancements. We propose a novel IAM Privilege Escalation Repair Engine called IAMPERE that efficiently generates an approximately minimal patch for repairing a broader range of IAM PEs. To achieve this, we first formulate the IAM repair problem into a MaxSAT problem. Despite the remarkable success of modern MaxSAT solvers, their scalability for solving complex repair problems remains a challenge due to the state explosion. To improve scalability, we employ deep learning to prune the search space. Specifically, we apply a carefully designed GNN model to generate an intermediate patch that is relatively small, but not necessarily minimal. We then apply a MaxSAT solver to search for a minimum repair within the space defined by the intermediate patch, as the final approximately minimum patch. Experimental results on both synthesized and real-world IAM misconfigurations show that, compared to IAM-Deescalate, IAMPERE repairs a significantly larger number of IAM misconfigurations with markedly smaller patch sizes.
