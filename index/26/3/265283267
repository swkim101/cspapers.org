Model-based 3D human mesh recovery aims to reconstruct a 3D human body mesh by estimating its parameters from monocular RGB images. Most of recent works adopt the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model to regress relative rotations for each body joint along the kinematics chain. This pipeline needs to transform each relative rotation matrix into a global rotation matrix to articulate the canonical mesh, and suffers from accumulated errors along the kinematics chain. This paper proposes to directly estimate the global rotation of each joint to avoid error accumulation and pursue better accuracy. The proposed Sequentially Global Rotation Estimation (SGRE) directly predicts the global rotation matrix of each joint on the kinematics chain. SGRE features a residual learning module to leverage complementary features and previously predicted rotations of parent joints to guide the estimation of subsequent child joints. Thanks to this global estimation pipeline and residual learning module, SGRE alleviates error accumulation and produces more accurate 3D human mesh. It can be flexibly integrated into existing regression-based methods and achieves superior performance on various benchmarks. For example, it improves the latest method 3DCrowdNet by 3.3 mm MPJPE and 5.0 mm PVE on 3DPW dataset and 3.0 AP on COCO dataset, respectivelyâ€ .
