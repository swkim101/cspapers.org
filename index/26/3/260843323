Certiﬁed Watermarks is the ﬁrst to provide a watermark certiﬁcate against l 2 -norm watermark removal attacks, by leveraging the randomized smoothing techniques for certiﬁed robustness to adversarial attacks. However, the randomized smoothing techniques suffer from hardness of certiﬁed robustness in high-dimensional space against l p -norm attacks for large p ( p > 2 ). The certiﬁed watermark method based on the randomized smoothing is no exception, i.e., fails to provide meaningful certiﬁcates in high-dimensional space against the l p -norm watermark removal attacks ( p > 2 ). By leveraging molliﬁer theory, this paper proposes a molliﬁer smoothing method with dimension-independent certiﬁed radius of our proposed smooth classiﬁer, for conducting the certiﬁed watermark problem against the l p - norm watermark removal attacks ( 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ ) for high parameter dimension d . Based on partial differential equation (PDE) theory, an approximation of molliﬁer smoothing is developed to alleviate the inefﬁciency of sampling and prediction in the randomized smoothing as well as numerical integration in the molliﬁer smoothing, while maintaining the certiﬁed watermark against the l p - norm watermark removal attacks ( 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ ).
