3D point cloud semantic segmentation has a wide range of applications. Recently, weakly supervised point cloud segmentation methods have been proposed, aiming to alleviate the expensive and laborious manual annotation process by leveraging scene-level labels. However, these methods have not effectively exploited the rich geometric information (such as shape and scale) and appearance information (such as color and texture) present in RGB-D scans. Furthermore, current approaches fail to fully leverage the point affinity that can be inferred from the feature extraction network, which is crucial for learning from weak scene-level labels. Additionally, previous work overlooks the detrimental effects of the long-tailed distribution of point cloud data in weakly supervised 3D semantic segmentation. To this end, this paper proposes a simple yet effective scene-level weakly supervised point cloud segmentation method with a newly introduced multi-modality point affinity inference module. The point affinity proposed in this paper is characterized by features from multiple modalities (e.g., point cloud and RGB), and is further refined by normalizing the classifier weights to alleviate the detrimental effects of long-tailed distribution without the need of the prior of category distribution. Extensive experiments on the ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art by ~4% to ~ 6% mIoU.
