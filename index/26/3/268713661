Recently, lots of works that incorporate external lexicon information into character-level Chinese named entity recognition(NER) to overcome the lackness of natural delimiters of words, have achieved many advanced performance. However, obtaining and maintaining high-quality lexicons is costly, especially in special domains. In addition, the entity boundary bias caused by high mention coverage in some boundary characters poses a significant challenge to the generalization of NER models but receives little attention in the existing literature. To address these issues, we propose SENCR, a Span Enhanced Two-stage Network with Counterfactual Rethinking for Chinese NER, that contains a boundary detector for boundary supervision, a convolution-based type classifier for better span representation and a counterfactual rethinking(CR) strategy for debiased boundary detection in inference. The proposed boundary detector and type classifier are jointly trained with the same contextual encoder and then the trained boundary detector is debiased by our proposed CR strategy without modifying any model parameters in the inference stage. Extensive experiments on four Chinese NER datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
