While there are multiple standards bodies that define characteristics of high-quality, there are limited guidelines on conducting equity-enabling research, particularly in the context of high quality and in computing education. As part of an ACM ITiCSE Working Group in 2023, we engaged in a concept analysis and structured literature review to identify high-impact practices for conducting both high-quality and equity-enabling education research. As a result of this work, we produced a set of guidelines across each major phase of research that integrates characteristics of high-quality education research with those that are necessary for producing research that is designed to honor and meet the needs of various subgroups of learners. Special emphasis is given to the role that the researcher plays in shaping the research based upon how the researcher's lived experiences, perspectives, and training influences their work. During this special session, we will review each set of guidelines and engage attendees in reflection and discussion of them and how they can use the guidelines to enhance their education research.
