3D Single Object Tracking (SOT) stands a forefront task of computer vision, proving essential for applications like autonomous driving. Sparse and occluded data in scene point clouds introduce variations in the appearance of tracked objects, adding complexity to the task. In this research, we unveil M3SOT, a novel 3D SOT framework, which synergizes multiple input frames (template sets), multiple receptive fields (continuous contexts), and multiple solution spaces (distinct tasks) in ONE model. Remarkably, M3SOT pioneers in modeling temporality, contexts, and tasks directly from point clouds, revisiting a perspective on the key factors influencing SOT. To this end, we design a transformer-based network centered on point cloud targets in the search area, aggregating diverse contextual representations and propagating target cues by employing historical frames. As M3SOT spans varied processing perspectives, we've streamlined the network—trimming its depth and optimizing its structure—to ensure a lightweight and efficient deployment for SOT applications. We posit that, backed by practical construction, M3SOT sidesteps the need for complex frameworks and auxiliary components to deliver sterling results. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that M3SOT achieves state-of-the-art performance at 38 FPS.
