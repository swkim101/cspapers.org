In [2] we claimed that max clique is hard to approximate within iV1j29 assuming NP Q BPP, and within N1j24 assuming NEXP Q BPEXP. We were off by one (in the denominator of the exponent)— the correct factors are iV1130 and IV1i25 respectively. Thanks to David Zuckerman for pointing this out. We had implied that the same hardness of approximation factors could be shown for the chromatic number as for max clique. Here we were off by a bit more— the correct results are that the chromatic number is hard to approximate within lV1/146 assuming NP ~ BPP, and within If11121 assuming NEXP ~ BPEXP. Thanks to Madhu Sudan for pointing this out. We had said that the best known value of the constant error c achievable for the result NP C MIP1[O(logn), 2, O(l), O(logn), c] was a value close to 1, namely c = 1 – l/(2t) where t is the number of bits queried in the [1] proof. However [5] could be used to bring c to any constant greater than 1/2. Thanks to Uri Feige for pointing this out.
