In digital photography, autofocus is a key feature that aids high-quality image capture, and modern approaches use the phase patterns arising from dual-pixel sensors as important focus cues. However, dual-pixel data is prone to multiple error sources in its image capturing process, including lens shading or distortions due to the inherent optical characteristics of the lens. We observe that, while these degradations are hard to model using prior knowledge, they are correlated with the spatial position of the pixels within the image sensor area, and we propose a learning-based autofocus model with positional encodings (PE) to capture these patterns. Specifically, we introduce RoI-PE, which encodes the spatial position of our focusing region-of-interest (RoI) on the imaging plane. Learning with RoI-PE allows the model to be more robust to spatially-correlated degradations. In addition, we also propose to encode the current focal position of lens as lens-PE, which allows us to significantly reduce the computational complexity of the autofocus model. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of using the proposed position encodings for automatic focusing based on dual-pixel data.
