Digital platforms often require users to select from a limited set of options that may force them to misrepresent their gender identities and sexual orientation, which disproportionately affects the LGBTQ+ population. To provide digital product teams with a feasible industry-focused tool to ensure the inclusion of this population, we surveyed 151 participants, including 81 who identify as LGBTQ+; conducted five interviews with LGBTQ+ participants and 11 interviews with product managers in the technology industry; and analyzed the user account creation processes of 45 digital platforms commonly used or mentioned in survey responses to understand LGBTQ+ users’ wants, needs, and pain points in navigating user account sign-up. Participants recounted instances of microaggressions or micro-affirmations, and often had strong feelings about companies based on their account creation experience. Based on these results, we present a ‘Playbook’ of design recommendations, which is online at bit.ly/LGBTInclusive_UAGuide.
