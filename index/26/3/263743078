Single Input Functionality (SIF) is a special case of MPC, where only one distinguished party called dealer holds the secret input. SIF allows the dealer to complete a computation task and send to other parties their respective outputs without revealing any additional information about its secret input. SIF has many applications, including multiple-verifier zero-knowledge and verifiable relation sharing, etc. Recently, several works devote to round-efficient realization of SIF, and achieve 2-round communication in the honest majority setting (Applebaum et al., Crypto 2022; Baum et al., CCS 2022; Yang and Wang, Asiacrypt 2022). In this work, we focus on concrete efficiency and propose the first practical construction for SIF against a dishonest majority in the preprocessing model; moreover, the online phase of our protocol is only 2-round and is highly efficient, as it requires no cryptographic operations and achieves information theoretical security. For SIF among 5 parties, our scheme takes 152.34ms (total) to evaluate an AES-128 circuit with 7.36ms online time. Compared to the state-of-the-art (honest majority) solution (Baum et al., CCS 2022), our protocol is roughly 2 Ã— faster in the online phase, although more preprocessing time is needed. Compared to the state-of-the-art generic MPC against a dishonest majority (Wang et al., CCS 2017; Cramer et al., Crypto 2018), our protocol outperforms them with respect to both total running time and online running time.
