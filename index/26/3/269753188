Professional designers often struggle to apply insights from HCI research in their work. To make academic knowledge more accessible to practitioners, HCI researchers have created translational design tools, such as design cards, that support the translation of research insights into design practice. Prior work explored design cards for behavior change, interaction design, personal health informatics, and the sharing economy. Our work complements prior research by exploring the design and use of translational design cards for social aspects of societal resilience through a two-stage study with 14 student designers and eight professional designers. Our findings provide an empirical understanding of the design cardsâ€™ generative value for incorporating research insights into the design process. Additionally, we discuss recommendations and highlight opportunities to enhance the design and use of the cards beyond societal resilience.
