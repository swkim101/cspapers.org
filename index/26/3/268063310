Monocular 3D detection (M3D) aims for precise 3D object localization from a single-view image which usually involves labor-intensive annotation of 3D detection boxes. Weakly supervised M3D has recently been studied to obviate the 3D annotation process by leveraging many existing 2D annotations, but it often requires extra training data such as LiDAR point clouds or multi-view images which greatly degrades its applicability and usability in various applications. We propose SKD-WM3D, a weakly supervised monocular 3D detection framework that exploits depth information to achieve M3D with a single-view image exclusively without any 3D annotations or other training data. One key design in SKD-WM3D is a self-knowledge distillation framework, which transforms image features into 3D-like representations by fusing depth information and effectively mitigates the inherent depth ambiguity in monocular scenarios with little computational overhead in inference. In addition, we design an uncertainty-aware distillation loss and a gradient-targeted transfer modulation strategy which facilitate knowledge acquisition and knowledge transfer, respectively. Extensive experiments show that SKD-WM3D surpasses the state-of-the-art clearly and is even on par with many fully supervised methods.
