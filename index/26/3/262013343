Towards flexible object-centric visual perception, we propose a one-shot instance-aware object keypoint (OKP) extraction approach, AnyOKP, which leverages the powerful representation ability of pretrained vision transformer (ViT), and can obtain keypoints on multiple object instances of arbitrary category after learning from a support image. An off-the-shelf petrained ViT is directly deployed for generalizable and transferable feature extraction, which is followed by training-free feature enhancement. The best-prototype pairs (BPPs) are searched for in support and query images based on appearance similarity, to yield instance-unaware candidate keypoints. Then, the entire graph with all candidate keypoints as vertices are divided into sub-graphs according to the feature distributions on the graph edges. Finally, each sub-graph represents an object instance. AnyOKP is evaluated on real object images collected with the cameras of a robot arm, a mobile robot, and a surgical robot, which not only demonstrates the cross-category flexibility and instance awareness, but also show remarkable robustness to domain shift and viewpoint change.
