With the rising emphasis on computer science (CS) education, many states, school districts, and schools have grappled with how to address computing in the K-12 curriculum. While some approaches dedicate classroom time to specific CS topics, others are attempting to infuse computing curriculum into other subjects like math and science. Preparing educators without prior CS experience to teach this integrated content is challenging. In this paper, we share programming-integrated mathematics learning (PML) modules that we developed to support teachers in learning to use programming in mathematics classrooms through argumentation. To test the effectiveness of the modules, we implemented them in a mathematics content course for elementary education majors and a mathematics pathway course for non-STEM majors. We assessed both courses as study contexts for evaluating potential PML modules to enhance teachers' knowledge and students' learning outcomes in mathematics and computer programming. This paper focuses on student-written reflections as data to investigate how education and non-STEM majors describe their learning through the PML modules. According to our analysis, the study participants found the PML modules to be useful in enhancing their understanding of mathematical concepts. They also described the value of learning programming in mathematics classrooms through argumentation, learning different perspectives, and helping each other understand. However, most of our student participants displayed a relatively low level of confidence in their programming abilities, specifically regarding the creation of text-based programs. Future study is needed to explore how to increase the programming self-efficacy while students learn mathematics through programming.
