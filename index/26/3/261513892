Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can be used 
to solve a variety of machine learning problems. However, as
the number of trees and their individual size can be large,
their decision making process is often incomprehensible.
We show that their decision process can be naturally represented 
as an argumentation problem, which allows creating global explanations 
via argumentative reasoning. We generalize sufficient and necessary 
argumentative explanations using a Markov network encoding, discuss 
the relevance of these explanations and establish relationships to
families of abductive explanations from the literature. As the complexity 
of the explanation problems is high, we present an efficient approximation algorithm with probabilistic approximation guarantees.
