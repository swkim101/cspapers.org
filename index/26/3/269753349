Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) has emerged as a key wearable haptic feedback technology capable of simulating a wide range of force feedback, such as the impact force of boxing punches, the weight of virtual objects, and the reaction force from pushing on a wall. To simulate these external forces, EMS stimulates the muscles that oppose (i.e. antagonistic to) the actual muscles that users activate, causing involuntary muscle contraction and haptic sensations that differ from real-world experiences. In this work, we propose Paired-EMS which simultaneously stimulates both the muscles that users activate and that prior EMS stimulates (i.e. antagonistic muscle pairs) to enhance the external force feedback experience. We first conducted a small formative study (n=8) to help design the stimulation intensity of muscle pairs, then conducted a user experience study to evaluate Paired-EMS vs. prior EMS approaches for both isometric and isotonic user actions. Study results (n=32) showed that Paired-EMS significantly improved realism, harmony, and entertainment (p<.05) with similar comfort (p>.36), and was overall preferred by 78% of participants (p<.01).
