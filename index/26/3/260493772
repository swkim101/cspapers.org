We propose Dual-CES â€“ a novel unsupervised, query-focused, multi-document extractive summarizer. Dual-CES builds on top of the Cross Entropy Summarizer (CES) and is designed to better handle the tradeoff between saliency and focus in summarization. To this end, Dual-CES employs a two-step dual-cascade optimization approach with saliency-based pseudo-feedback distillation. Overall, Dual-CES significantly outperforms all other state-of-the-art unsupervised alternatives. Dual-CES is even shown to be able to outperform strong supervised summarizers.
