Eliminating image blur produced by various kinds ofmotion has been a challenging problem. Dominant approaches rely heavily on model capacity to remove blurring by reconstructing residual from blurry observation in feature space. These practices not only prevent the capture of spatially variable motion in the real world but also ignore the tai-lored handling of various motions in image space. In this paper, we propose a novel real-world deblurring filtering model called the Motion-adaptive Separable Collaborative (MISC) Filter. In particular, we use a motion estimation net-work to capture motion information from neighborhoods, thereby adaptively estimating spatially-variant motion flow, mask, kernels, weights, and offsets to obtain the MISC Fil-ter. The MISC Filter first aligns the motion-induced blur-ring patterns to the motion middle along the predicted flow direction, and then collaboratively filters the aligned image through the predicted kernels, weights, and offsets to generate the output. This design can handle more general-ized and complex motion in a spatially differentiated man-ner. Furthermore, we analyze the relationships between the motion estimation network and the residual reconstruction network. Extensive experiments on four widely used bench-marks demonstrate that our method provides an effective solution for real-world motion blur removal and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
