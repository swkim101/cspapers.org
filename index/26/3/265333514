Electronic Shelf Label (ESL) is currently replacing traditional paper prices with advantages such as flexible update time, ease of management, environmental friendliness, etc. This paper presents the research and design of the optimal ESL device based on LoRa technology and electronic screen technology (Epaper). With a screen size of 2.13 inches, the device can display product information in two black-white colors. Based on analysis and design, the ESL device will get low energy consumption, long lifetime, and long communication range. In addition, this paper proposes an optimal operation flow for devices when released into a system. From the measurement results, the lifespan of the ESL device can be longer than 5 years. Using LoRaWAN to implement an ESL system that is efficient in energy consumption and communication distance.
