In the realm of computer vision, Neural Fields have gained prominence as a contemporary tool harnessing neural networks for signal representation. Despite the remarkable progress in adapting these networks to solve a variety of problems, the field still lacks a comprehensive theoretical framework. This article aims to address this gap by delving into the intricate interplay between initialization and activation, providing a foundational basis for the robust optimization of Neural Fields. Our theoretical insights reveal a deep-seated connection among network initialization, architectural choices, and the optimization process, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach when designing cutting-edge Neural Fields.
