Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial images, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical tasks. Sparse adversarial attacks, which limit the number of modified pixels, have shown to be highly effective in causing DNNs to misclassify. However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously minimize the number of modified pixels and the size of the modifications, often requiring a large number of queries and assuming unrestricted access to the targeted DNN. In contrast, other methods that limit the number of modified pixels often permit unbounded modifications, making them easily detectable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-objective sparse attack algorithm that efficiently minimizes the number of modified pixels and their size during the attack process. Our algorithm draws inspiration from evolutionary computation and incorporates a mechanism for prioritizing objectives that aligns with an attacker's goals. Our approach outperforms existing sparse attacks on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet trained DNN classifiers while requiring only a small query budget, attaining competitive attack success rates while perturbing fewer pixels. Overall, our proposed attack algorithm provides a solution to the limitations of current sparse attack methods by jointly minimizing the number of modified pixels and their size. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in restricted scenarios, highlighting its potential to enhance DNN security.
