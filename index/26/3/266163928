State-of-the-art grammatical error correction (GEC) systems rely on parallel training data (ungrammatical sentences and their manually corrected counterparts), which are expensive to construct. In this paper, we employ the Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI) method to build an un-supervised GEC system. The BIFI framework generates parallel data from unlabeled text us-ing a fixer to transform ungrammatical sentences into grammatical ones, and a critic to predict sentence grammaticality. We present an unsupervised approach to build the fixer and the critic, and an algorithm that allows them to iteratively improve each other. We evaluate our unsupervised GEC system on English and Chinese GEC. Empirical results show that our GEC system outperforms previous unsupervised GEC systems, and achieves performance comparable to supervised GEC systems without ensemble. Furthermore, when combined with labeled training data, our system achieves new state-of-the-art results on the CoNLL-2014 and NLPCC-2018 test sets. 1
