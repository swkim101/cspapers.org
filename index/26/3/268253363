Artificial Intelligence for Theorem Proving (AITP) has given
rise to a plethora of benchmarks and methodologies, particularly in Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP). Research in the
area is fragmented, with a diverse set of approaches being
spread across several ITP systems. This presents a significant challenge to the comparison of methods, which are often
complex and difficult to replicate.
Addressing this, we present BAIT, a framework for the fair
and streamlined comparison of learning approaches in ITP.
We demonstrate BAITâ€™s capabilities with an in-depth comparison, across several ITP benchmarks, of state-of-the-art
architectures applied to the problem of formula embedding.
We find that Structure Aware Transformers perform particularly well, improving on techniques associated with the original problem sets. BAIT also allows us to assess the end-to-end proving performance of systems built on interactive
environments. This unified perspective reveals a novel end-to-end system that improves on prior work. We also provide
a qualitative analysis, illustrating that improved performance
is associated with more semantically-aware embeddings. By
streamlining the implementation and comparison of Machine
Learning algorithms in the ITP context, we anticipate BAIT
will be a springboard for future research.
