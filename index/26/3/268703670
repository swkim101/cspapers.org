Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly becoming pervasive in everyday life of everyone.
In this setting, developing correct AI conception since childhood is not only a need to 
be addressed in educational curricula, but is also a children right.

Accordingly, several initiatives at national and international levels aim at promoting AI
and emerging technology literacy, supported also by a proliferation in the literature 
of learning courses covering a variety of topics, learning objectives and targeted ages.
Schools are therefore pushed to introduce innovative activities for children in their
curricula.

In this paper, we report the results of a case study where we tested the contribution 
of an AI block-based course in developing computational thinking, and human 
and AI minds understanding in fifth and sixth grade children.
