In this work, we aimed to analyze the impact of extracts prepared from dried Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) flowers and leaves on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) (wherein the shape and size of AgNPs and the efficiency of the process were analyzed) and to prove the possibility of transferring the AgNPsâ€™ properties into a polymer matrix. An ex situ method was used to incorporate AgNPs and prepare polymer matrix composite (PVP-AgNPs) films (via casting) and fibers (via electrospinning). We used UV-vis absorption spectrophotometry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to analyze and characterize the AgNPs and prepared composites. The results of FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of phytochemicals that can reduce silver ions from Ag+ to Ag0 in both extracts. The presence of spherical nanoparticles was confirmed via TEM regardless of the type of extract used. However, leaf extract caused the formation of AgNPs with a narrower size interval (an average size of 20 nm), and with higher efficiency, compared to the nanoparticles prepared using the flower extract. The nanoparticles prepared using the leaf extract were then incorporated into the polymer matrix, and thin polymer composite films and fibers were successfully prepared. The anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs colloids and prepared polymer nanocomposites against green algae Chlorella kessleri was studied. The anti-biofilm properties of the AgNPs were proved, along with the efficient transfer of their toxic properties into nontoxic polymer.
