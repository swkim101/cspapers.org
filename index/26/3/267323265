Predicting the state evolution of ultra high-dimensional, time-reversible fluid dynamic systems is a crucial but computationally expensive task. Existing physics-informed neural networks either incur high inference cost or cannot preserve the time-reversible nature of the underlying dynamics system. We propose a model-based approach to identify low-dimensional, time reversible, nonlinear fluid dynamic systems. Our method utilizes the symplectic structure of reduced Eulerian fluid and use stochastic Riemann optimization to obtain a low-dimensional bases that minimize the expected trajectory-wise dimension-reduction error over a given distribution of initial conditions. We show that such minimization is well-defined since the reduced trajectories are differentiable with respect to the subspace bases over the entire Grassmannian manifold, under proper choices of timestep sizes and numerical integrators. Finally, we propose a loss function measuring the trajectory-wise discrepancy between the original and reduced models. By tensor precomputation, we show that gradient information of such loss function can be evaluated efficiently over a long trajectory without time-integrating the high-dimensional dynamic system. Through evaluations on a row of simulation benchmarks, we show that our method reduces the discrepancy by 50-90 percent over conventional reduced models and we outperform PINNs by exactly preserving the time reversibility.
