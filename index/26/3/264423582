We propose an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) method by making use of Energy-Based Learning (EBL) and demonstrate 1. EBL can be used to improve the instance selection for a self-training task on the unlabelled target domain, and 2. alignment and normalizing energy scores can learn domain-invariant representations. For the former, we show that an energy-based selection criterion can be used to model instance selections by mimicking the joint distribution between data and predictions in the target domain. As per learning domain invariant representations, we show that stable domain alignment can be achieved by a combined energy alignment and an energy normalization process. We implement our method in consistent with the vision-transformer (ViT) backbone and show that our proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art ViT based UDA methods on diverse benchmarks (DomainNet, Office-Home, and VISDA2017).
