Sketch-based drawing assessments are useful in understanding individuals' cognitive and psychological states, such as cognitive impairment or mental disorders. Hence, these assessments have been developed and applied on a large scale, such as in schools and workplaces, to screen individuals who may require further clinical examination. However, the interpretation of a large number of drawing assessments solely relies on human experts, requiring much time and cost. To address this issue, we introduce a novel scene-level sketch dataset, SceneDAPR, which can be used to automatically analyze the drawing assessment, Draw-A-Person-in-the-Rain (DAPR), a popular psychological drawing assessment used for identifying stressful experiences and coping behavior. The proposed dataset consists of 6,420 objects depicted in 1,399 scene sketches drawn by humans, along with detailed supplementary information about the participants. SceneDAPR includes free-hand drawings from different age groups: children & adolescents, adults, and seniors. Leveraging the proposed SceneDAPR, we develop a web-based drawing assessment system. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our system shows a robust performance across the different age groups in the object detection task as well as a considerable performance compared to human experts. We believe that the proposed new sketch dataset can be used to develop an automatic system for psychological drawing assessments, which can support human experts by reducing the time and cost of analyzing the drawing assessments for a large population.
