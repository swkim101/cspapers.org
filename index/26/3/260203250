Simulating camera sensors is a crucial task in autonomous driving. Although neural radiance fields are exceptional at synthesizing photorealistic views in driving simulations, they still fail to generate extrapolated views. This paper proposes to incorporate map priors into neural radiance fields to synthesize out-of-trajectory driving views with semantic road consistency. The key insight is that map information can be utilized as a prior to guiding the training of the radiance fields with uncertainty. Specifically, we utilize the coarse ground surface as uncertain information to supervise the density field and warp depth with uncertainty from unknown camera poses to ensure multi-view consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can produce semantic consistency in deviated views for vehicle camera simulation.
