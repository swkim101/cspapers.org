AI's pervasive role in various fields highlights the imperative for the workforce to adeptly leverage its potential. While numerous courses cater to developers, there exists a discernible void for the wider community of AI users. To address this, our study introduces 'AI User'-a suite of interactive modules hosted on the Sail() platform, designed specifically for non-technical individuals utilizing Goal-Based Scenario (GBS) learning. We conducted a controlled experiment to ascertain whether GBS offers superior learning gains in AI literacy compared to traditional deliberate practice using multiple choice questions.
