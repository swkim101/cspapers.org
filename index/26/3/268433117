Scalable Game Design (SGD) instruction, vetted and researched over more than a decade, enables educators with little or no programming experience to teach students to program games with AgentCubes. SGD has been used successfully with learners from upper elementary grades to high school to motivate and teach computer science and STEM topics, including sophisticated techniques such as Artificial Intelligence. The concepts of Scalable Game Design (SGD), and the tools for Computational Thinking Patterns (CTPs), and Computational Thinking Pattern Assessment (CTPA) are directly applicable to satisfying Upper Elementary and Middle School CS and Science Standards. Common roadblocks teachers encounter with transitioning from game design to simulation programming will be explained with solutions, including classroom management tools, tutorial materials, and pedagogy will be presented.
