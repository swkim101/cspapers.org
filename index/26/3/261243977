1983: The first CHI called CHI - computers just processed data and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) just supported users in their work tasks.Twenty years on, broadband servers and mobile devices now outnumber desktop office machines. With them come joy, persuasion, outrage, delight, faith, campaigns, satire, fun, learning, identity, communities, and passion. Now, increasingly, we interact to be, not just to do. Interaction no longer just changes things, it changes people. HCI is headed for New Horizons.CHI 2003 recognised this sea of change in HCI and addressed all forms of interactive digital communication, with a focus on three special areas: mass communication and interaction, e-learning, and emotion. Many presentations addressed these special areas. Still, CHI 2003 has not abandoned established HCI for New Horizons! Everything you'd expect to find in a CHI conference is still here.These Conference Proceedings contain the papers accepted for presentation at CHI 2003. Competition was fierce. 470 submissions were received, and 75 were accepted. Many of these accepted papers address the challenge of supportive effective and enjoyable communication via interactive digital media.A CD containing the extended abstracts for short talks, demonstrations, design and usability in practice papers, special interest group descriptions, interactive posters, student posters and doctoral consortiumpresentations accompanies these proceedings. Video figures and demonstrations are provided on an additional DVD. These complete the record of CHI 2003 as the meeting place for an inclusive community, The CHI conference is the annual gathering of the world's HCI community. There is something for everyone. Students, researchers, professionals, and educators are spoiled for choice.
