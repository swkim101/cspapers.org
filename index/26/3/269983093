Understanding the nature of high-quality summaries is crucial to further improve the performance of multi-document summarization. We propose an approach to characterize human-written summaries using partial information decomposition, which decomposes the mutual information provided by all source documents into union, redundancy, synergy, and unique information. Our empirical analysis on different MDS datasets shows that there is a direct dependency between the number of sources and their contribution to the summary.
