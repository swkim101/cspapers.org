Web browsers isolate web origins, but do not provide direct abstractions to isolate sensitive data and control computation over it within the same origin. As a result, guaranteeing security of sensitive web content requires trusting all code in the browser and client-side applications to be vulnerability-free. In this paper, we propose a new abstraction, called Crypton, which supports intra-origin control over sensitive data throughout its life cycle. To securely enforce the semantics of Cryptons, we develop a standalone component called Crypton-Kernel, which extensively leverages the functionality of existing web browsers without relying on their large TCB. Our evaluation demonstrates that the Crypton abstraction supported by the Crypton-Kernel is widely applicable to popular real-world applications with millions of users, including webmail, chat, blog applications, and Alexa Top 50 websites, with low performance overhead.
