This paper poses the challenge of developing and evaluating integrated
systems for computational scientific discovery. We note some distinguishing
characteristics of discovery tasks, examine eight component abilities,
review previous successes at partial integration, and consider hurdles
the AI research community must leap to transform the vision for
integrated discovery into reality. In closing, we discuss promising
scientific domains in which to test such computational artifacts.
