All-optical circuit-switched (OCS) core is the holy grail for the future generation datacenter architectures. However, such proposals consist of a common operational abstraction termed as round-robin circuit scheduling, which heavily suffers from a) high traffic skewness, and b) high volume of inter-rack traffic. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture: round-robin OCS-core equipped with OCS-based reconfigurable edge for joint Skewness and Inter-rack traffic Volume (SV) minimization. Our architecture significantly improves the performance of all-optical cores, making it very close to a non-blocking network.
