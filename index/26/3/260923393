Determining candidates' views on important issues is critical in deciding whom to support and vote for; but finding their statements and votes on an issue can be laborious. In this paper we present PSST, (Political Statement and Support Tracker), a search engine to facilitate analysis of political statements and votes over time. We show that prior tools for text analysis can be combined with minimal manual processing to provide a first step in the full automation of this process.
