The explosive popularity of smart manufacturing has caught the attention of researchers in terms of intelligent mold processing and management. Machining mold components is a crucial step in the mold production process for many industries, which creates (e.g., cutting, drilling, and shaping a metal) the individual parts (e.g., core pins, ejector pins, cavities, slides, and lifters) that make up a mold used in manufacturing. We present IMPsys, an AI-based system that automatically explores machining jobs, infers their processing time and schedules them on machines, given numerous 3D modelling files of mold components.
