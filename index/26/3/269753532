Dedicated handheld controllers facilitate haptic experiences of virtual objects in mixed reality (MR). However, as mobile MR becomes more prevalent, we observe the emergence of controller-free MR interactions. To retain immersive haptic experiences, we explore the use of mobile devices as a substitute for specialised MR controller. In an exploratory gesture elicitation study (n = 18), we examined users’ (1) intuitive hand gestures performed with prospective mobile devices and (2) preferences for real-time haptic feedback when exploring haptic object properties. Our results reveal three haptic exploration modes for the mobile device, as an object, hand substitute, or as an additional tool, and emphasise the benefits of incorporating the device’s unique physical features into the object interaction. This work expands the design possibilities using mobile devices for tangible object interaction, guiding the future design of mobile devices for haptic MR experiences.
