We revisit the opinion susceptibility problem that was proposed by Abebe et al. [1], in which agents influence one another's opinions through an iterative process. Each agent has some fixed innate opinion. In each step, the opinion of an agent is updated to some convex combination between its innate opinion and the weighted average of its neighbors' opinions in the previous step. The resistance of an agent measures the importance it places on its innate opinion in the above convex combination. Under non-trivial conditions, this iterative process converges to some equilibrium opinion vector. For the unbudgeted variant of the problem, the goal is to select the resistance of each agent (from some given range) such that the sum of the equilibrium opinions is minimized. Contrary to the claim in the aforementioned KDD 2018 paper, the objective function is in general non-convex. Hence, formulating the problem as a convex program might have potential correctness issues. We instead analyze the structure of the objective function, and show that any local optimum is also a global optimum, which is somehow surprising as the objective function might not be convex. Furthermore, we combine the iterative process and the local search paradigm to design very efficient algorithms that can solve the unbudgeted variant of the problem optimally on large-scale graphs containing millions of nodes.
