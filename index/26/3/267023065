Although previous works on traffic scene understanding have achieved great success, most of them stop at a low-level perception stage, such as road segmentation and lane detection, and few concern high-level understanding. In this paper, we present Visual Traffic Knowledge Graph Generation (VTKGG), a new task for in-depth traffic scene understanding that tries to extract multiple kinds of information and integrate them into a knowledge graph. To achieve this goal, we first introduce a large dataset named CASIA-Tencent Road Scene dataset (RS10K) with comprehensive annotations to support related research. Secondly, we propose a novel traffic scene parsing architecture containing a Hierarchical Graph ATtention network (HGAT) to analyze the heterogeneous elements and their complicated relations in traffic scene images. By hierarchizing the heterogeneous graph and equipping it with cross-level links, our approach exploits the correlation among various elements completely and acquires accurate relations. The experimental results show that our method can effectively generate visual traffic knowledge graphs and achieve state-of-the-art performance. The dataset RS10K is available at http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/RS10K.html.
