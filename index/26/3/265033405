This paper introduces a novel approach to improve robotic grasping in dynamic environments by integrating Gaussian Process Distance Fields (GPDF), SE(3) equivariant networks, and Riemannian Mixture Models. The aim is to enable robots to grasp moving objects effectively. Our approach comprises three main components: object shape reconstruction, grasp sampling, and implicit grasp pose selection. GPDF accurately models the shape of objects, which is essential for precise grasp planning. SE(3) equivariance ensures that the sampled grasp poses are equivariant to the objectâ€™s pose changes, enhancing robustness in dynamic scenarios. Riemannian Gaussian Mixture Models are employed to assess reachability, providing a feasible and adaptable grasping strategies. Feasible grasp poses are targeted by novel task or joint space reactive controllers formulated using Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Processes. This method resolves the challenge of discrete grasp pose selection, enabling smoother grasping execution. Experimental validation confirms the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible grasp poses and achieving successful grasps in dynamic environments. By integrating these advanced techniques, we present a promising solution for enhancing robotic grasping capabilities in real-world scenarios.
