This paper describes a study in which a computer terminology translation activity was implemented in a CS1 class using a specially designed web application. Students translated an English technical term into their native language and wrote an accompanying definition of the term. These completed translations were then reviewed anonymously by their peers. Finally, students voted on the most highly rated translations to compose a glossary of translations. These activities were developed to prompt students to enhance their understanding of English computing terms, thereby aiding their academic pursuits. The activity, along with the web based application, was tested in a CS1 class comprising 90 non-native English speaking students. Additionally, a significant number of students voluntarily participated in a computer terminology test that had been administered to previous cohorts within the same class. Among the students who engaged in the translation activity, the average performance on this test was 8% higher. At the conclusion of the class, a survey was conducted to capture students' perceptions of the activity. Out of the total students, 67 completed the survey. The feedback received indicated that the majority of students recognized the advantageous impact of the translation activity on their programming learning. A considerable number of students expressed a keen interest in participating in another translation activity during their upcoming courses.
