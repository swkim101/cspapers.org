Software systems are increasingly expected to cope with variable workloads, component failures and other uncertainties through self-adaptation. As such, self-adaptive software has been the subject of intense research over the past decade. Our work focuses on the use of self-adaptive software in applications with strict functional and non-functional requirements. These applications need compelling assurances that the software continues to meet its requirements while it reconfigures its architecture and parameters at runtime. To address this need, we introduce an end-to-end methodology for the ENgineering of TRUstworthy Self-adaptive sofTware (ENTRUST).
