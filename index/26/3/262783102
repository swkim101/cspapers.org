In this paper we introduce an approach to exploit knowledge represented in an ontology in answers to queries to an information base. We assume that the ontology is embedded in a knowledge base covering the domain of the information base. The ontology is first of all to influence ranking of objects in answers to queries as measured by similarity to the query. We consider a generative framework where an ontology in combination with a concept language defines a set of well-formed concepts. Wellformed concepts is assumed to be the basis for an indexing of the information base in the sense that these concepts appear as descriptors attached to objects in the base. Concepts are thus applied to obtain a means for descriptions that generalizes simple word-based information base indexing. In effect query evaluation is generalized to be a matter of comparison at the level of concepts rather than words.
