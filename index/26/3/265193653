This research article provides a comprehensive investigation into the optoelectronic characteristics of three distinct types of cadmium sulfide (CdS) thin films, namely: (a) conventionally prepared CdS thin films using chemical bath deposition (CBD-CdS), (b) CdS thin films produced via chemical bath deposition with the inclusion of zinc (CBD-Cd(1−x)ZnxS, x = 0.3), and (c) CdS thin films synthesized using a seed-assisted approach, treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and incorporating zinc (ED/CBD + EDTA-Cd(1−x)ZnxS). The investigation reveals that the crystallite size of these thin films decreases upon the addition of EDTA to the reaction solution, leading to an increase in the inter-planar spacing and dislocation density. Furthermore, a blue shift in the transmittance edge of the ED/CBD + EDTA-Cd(1−x)ZnxS samples compared to CBD-CdS implies modifications in the band gaps of the deposited films. The incorporation of Zn2+ into the reaction solution results in an increased band gap value of up to 2.42 eV. This suggests that Cd(1−x)ZnxS thin films permit more efficient photon transmission compared to conventional CdS. Among the three types of films studied, ED/CBD + EDTA-Cd(1−x)ZnxS exhibits the highest optical band gap of 2.50 eV. This increase in the optical band gap is attributed to the smaller crystallite size and the splitting of the tail levels from the band structure. Additionally, the increment in the optical band gap leads to reduced light absorption at longer wavelengths, thereby enhancing the electrical properties. Notably, ED/CBD + EDTA-Cd(1−x)ZnxS thin films demonstrate improved photovoltaic performance in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, characterized by enhanced open-circuit voltage (363 mV, VOC), short-circuit current (35.35 μA, ISC), and flat-band voltage (−692 mV, Vfb). These improvements are attributed to the better adhesion of CdS to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate and improved inter-particle connectivity.
