A significant amount of research has recently been conducted on user performance in so-called temporal pointing tasks, in which a user is required to perform a button input at the timing required by the system. Consecutive temporal pointing (CTP), in which two consecutive button inputs must be performed while satisfying temporal constraints, is common in modern interactions, yet little is understood about user performance on the task. Through a user study involving 100 participants, we broadly explore user performance in a variety of CTP scenarios. The key finding is that CTP is a unique task that cannot be considered as two ordinary temporal pointing processes. Significant effects of button input method, motor limitations, and different hand use were also observed.
