Visible light communication(VLC) is currently attracting attention toward the realization of 6th generation mobile communication systems (6G). Optical camera communication (OCC), which is one of the realizations of VLC, can be constructed using general-purpose commercial devices such as display or LEDs as the transmitter and optical camera as the receiver. It can be seen as a promising alternative of electromagnetic-wave-based wireless communications especially in underwater or aerial communications to extend network coverage. OCC has variety of challenges to expand its application region: communication coverage, capacity, and stability. In this paper, we propose a method to optimize imaging parameters such as exposure time and gain for crosstalk compensation in the nonlinear region of the image-sensor inputs to improve the communication quality of OCC.
