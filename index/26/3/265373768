 Additive manufacturing facilitates the realization of previously infeasible designs. Amongst them are 3D-printed textiles and specifically 3D-printed weaves. Textile designs can be spatially tuned in their mechanical properties by changing the pattern and material locally, when printed on a multi-material 3D printer. To inversely design weaves with desired mechanical properties, an efficient simulation of the mechanical behavior of textiles is essential. State-of-the-art textile models are predominantly set up for nonrecurring simulations. They are accurate but slow. Textile simulations designed for efficiency are seldom capable of capturing nonlinear yarn interaction effects. In this work, we propose a textile model consisting of 1D truss elements with strain and shear dependent stiffness. The truss member properties are defined individually based on the local weave design. The properties are tuned for each textile design by matching load-extension curves and sample deformations of virtual tensile tests to test data of real tensile tests. The simulation approach is validated by tuning the algorithm for two configurations and simulating three designs not previously used for tuning. The simulation can estimate the load-extension curve of all validation samples with high accuracy and shows runtimes of under 40s on an Intel Core i7-10750H for structures with more than 3500 elements. These results pave the way towards a simulation-based approach to synthesize and optimize architected 3D-printed textiles.
