These proceedings contain the papers selected for presentation at the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2008), held October 27 to October 31, 2008 in Alexandria, VA, USA. 
 
In response to the call for papers 280 papers were submitted to the conference. These papers were evaluated on the basis of their significance, novelty, and technical quality. Each paper was reviewed by at least four members of the program committee. Reviewing was double-blind, meaning that the program committee was not able to see the names and affiliations of the authors, and the authors were not told which committee members reviewed which papers. After the reviews were written, the program committee met online for three weeks of intensive discussion. Of the papers submitted, 51 were selected for presentation at the conference, yielding in an acceptance rate of about 18%.
