Event cameras, with their high temporal and dynamic range and minimal memory usage, have found applications in various fields. However, their potential in static traffic monitoring remains largely unexplored. To facil-itate this exploration, we present eTraM - a first-of-its- kind, fully event-based traffic monitoring dataset. eTraM offers 10 hr of data from different traffic scenarios in various lighting and weather conditions, providing a compre-hensive overview of real-world situations. Providing 2M bounding box annotations, it covers eight distinct classes of traffic participants, ranging from vehicles to pedestri-ans and micro-mobility. eTraM's utility has been assessed using state-of-the-art methods for traffic participant detection, including RVT, RED, and YOLOv8. We quantitatively evaluate the ability of event-based models to gener-alize on nighttime and unseen scenes. Our findings sub-stantiate the compelling potential of leveraging event cam-eras for traffic monitoring, opening new avenues for research and application. eTraM is available at https://eventbasedvision.github.io/eTraM.
