It is our pleasure to welcome you to the 22nd ACM International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS'08). ICS took place, for the first time, in Athens, Greece in the summer of 1987. Its purpose was to bring together the people who designed and built supercomputers, developed the software, algorithms and applications that made use of them and, over the years, helped advance several fields of science and engineering. This year, ICS returns to Greece and will be held on the island of Kos, one of the main Greek islands with rich history and many monuments, such as the Asclepieion, one of the biggest healing temples in Ancient Greece, sacred to the god of medicine Asclepius. Kos is also known around the world as one of the most splendid vacation destinations of Europe. 
 
The Technical Program includes 37 papers on topics in architecture, compilers, operating systems, and large-scale parallel computing applications. The papers reflect recent significant advances in some of the most exciting areas of high-performance computing and identify promising directions for future progress. This dual perspective is also seen in the topics of the workshops and the three keynote addresses. The workshops and Mark Harris' keynote concern the effective exploitation of current high-performance computing systems, David Keyes' keynote discusses the algorithmic approaches required to achieve a sustained petaflop/s on practical applications in the near future and Tilak Agerwala's keynote identifies the challenges to be overcome on the way to exascale computing.
