We address the problem of improving the worst-case efficiency of pure Nash equilibria (aka, the price of anarchy) in affine congestion games, through a novel use of signalling. We assume that, for each player in the game, a most preferred strategy is publicly signalled. This can be done either distributedly by the players themselves, or be the outcome of some centralized algorithm. We apply this signalling scheme to two well-studied scenarios: games with partially altruistic players and games with resource taxation. We show a significant improvement in the price of anarchy of these games, whenever the aggregate signalled strategy profile is a good approximation of the game social optimum.
