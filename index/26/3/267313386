Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly gaining significance for enduser programmer (EUP) applications. However, machine learning end-user programmers (ML-EUPs) without the right background face a daunting learning curve and a heightened risk of mistakes and flaws in their models. In this work, we designed a conversational agent named “Newton” as an expert to support ML-EUPs. Newton's design was shaped by a comprehensive review of existing literature, from which we identified six primary challenges faced by ML-EUPs and five strategies to assist them. To evaluate the efficacy of Newton's design, we conducted a Wizard of Oz within-subjects study with 12 ML-EUPs. Our findings indicate that Newton effectively assisted ML-EUPs, addressing the challenges highlighted in the literature. We also proposed six design guidelines for future conversational agents, which can help other EUP applications and software engineering activities.
