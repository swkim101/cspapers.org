This study focuses on the wear effects of nano-sized titania as a potential engine lubricant additive. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles have promising wear-reducing properties and significant tribological potential. In this article, titania nanoparticles were homogenized in Group III automotive oil at five different concentrations (0.1; 0.2 … 0.5 wt%). The nanodoped oil samples were tested on a linear oscillating tribometer with oil circulation. Based on the tribological results, titania nanoparticles increased friction by 20–32% but can reduce the wear area by up to 32%. According to the confocal microscopic examination, wear volume can be reduced by up to 57% with titania nanoparticles. Titania nanoparticles improved the repeatability of tribological measurements. A scanning electron microscopy examination of the wear track revealed that the characteristic wear of the tribological system was abrasive, but a significant amount of adhesive wear was also observed. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis found that the nanoparticles fill the deeper trenches of the wear. The worn surface uniformly contains TiO2 particles and the quantified normalized titanium concentration was between 0.56 and 0.62%.
