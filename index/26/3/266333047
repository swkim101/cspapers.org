Most existing data center network (DCN) ﬂow scheduling solutions aim to minimize ﬂow completion times (FCT). However, these solutions either require precise ﬂow information (e.g., per-ﬂow size), which is challenging to implement on commodity switches (e.g., pFab-ric [7]), or no prior ﬂow information at all, which is at the cost of performance (e.g., PIAS [10]). In this work, we present QCLIMB, a new ﬂow scheduling solution designed to minimize FCT by utilizing imprecise ﬂow information . Our key observation is that although obtaining precise ﬂow information can be challenging, it is possible to accurately estimate each ﬂow’s lower and upper bounds with machine learning techniques. QCLIMB has two key parts: i) a novel scheduling algorithm that leverages the lower bounds of different ﬂows to prioritize small ﬂow over large ﬂows from the beginning of transmission, rather than at later stages; and ii) an efﬁcient out-of-order handling mechanism that addresses practical reordering issues resulting from the al-gorithm. We show that QCLIMB signiﬁcantly outperforms PIAS (88% lower average FCT of small ﬂows) and is surprisingly close to pFabric (around 9% gap) while not requiring any switch modiﬁcations.
