North Salem Central School District (North Salem) has worked with researchers as part of a larger Research Practice Partnership (RPP) to design and implement an inclusive PK-12 computing pathway in their district. This poster describes how teachers used Generative AI (GenAI) tools in three areas: (1) the development of sample computational thinking (CT) lesson plans; (2) initial brainstorming; and (3) professional learning. As North Salem reflected on their use of GenAI tools, they named two AI tools specifically: OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 and Bing's Image Creator. Teachers also describe ethical dilemmas that they faced when integrating GenAI tools as well as other concerns that will be described below. This work builds on the growing literature on the use of Generative AI tools to support the day-to-day work of teachers.
