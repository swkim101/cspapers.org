The DESERE Workshop, our First Workshop on Decentralised Search and Recommendation, offers a platform for researchers to explore and share innovative ideas on decentralised web services, mainly focusing on three major topics: (i) societal impact of decentralised systems: their effects on privacy, policy, and regulation; (ii) decen- tralising applications: algorithmic and performance challenges that arise from decentralisation; and (iii) infrastructure to support de- centralised systems and services: peer-to-peer networks, routing, and performance evaluation tools.
