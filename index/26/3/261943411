In this paper, we consider a new definition of abduction that makes it depend on an underlying formal model of belief. In particular, different models of belief will give rise to different forms of abductive reasoning. Based on this definition, we then prove three main theorems: first, that when belief is closed under logical implication, the corresponding form of abduction is precisely what is performed by the ATMS as characterized by Reiter and de Kleer; second, that with the more limited "explicit" belief defined by Levesque, the required abduction is computationally tractable in certain cases where the ATMS is not; and finally, that something is believed in the implicit sense iff repeatedly applying a limited abduction operator eventually yields something that is believed in the explicit sense. This last result relates deduction and abduction as well as limited and unlimited reasoning all within the context of a logic of belief.
