We understand a sociotechnical system as a microsociety in which autonomous parties interact with and about technical objects. We define governance as the administration of such a system by its participants. We develop an approach for governance based on a computational representation of norms. Our approach has the benefit of capturing stakeholder needs precisely while yielding adaptive resource allocation in the face of changes both in stakeholder needs and the environment. We are currently extending this approach to address the problem of secure collaboration and to contribute to the emerging science of cybersecurity.
