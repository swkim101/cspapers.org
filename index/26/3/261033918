This paper presents a text classiﬁcation algorithm inspired by the notion of superposition of states in quantum physics. By regarding text as a superposition of words, we derive the wave function of a document and we compute the transition probability of the document to a target class according to Born’s rule. Two complementary implementations are presented. In the ﬁrst one, wave functions are calculated explicitly. The second implementation embeds the classiﬁer in a neural network architecture. Through analysis of three benchmark datasets, we illustrate several aspects of the proposed method, such as classiﬁcation performance, explainability, and computational efﬁciency. These ideas are also applicable to non-textual data.
