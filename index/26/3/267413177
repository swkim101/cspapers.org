In the field of resource-constrained robots and the need for effective place recognition in multi-robotic systems, this article introduces RecNet, a novel approach that concurrently addresses both challenges. The core of RecNetâ€™s methodology involves a transformative process: it projects 3D point clouds into range images, compresses them using an encoder-decoder framework, and subsequently reconstructs the range image, restoring the original point cloud. Additionally, RecNet utilizes the latent vector extracted from this process for efficient place recognition tasks. This approach not only achieves comparable place recognition results but also maintains a compact representation, suitable for sharing among robots to reconstruct their collective maps. The evaluation of RecNet encompasses an array of metrics, including place recognition performance, the structural similarity of the reconstructed point clouds, and the bandwidth transmission advantages, derived from sharing only the latent vectors. Our proposed approach is assessed using both a publicly available dataset and field experiments1 confirming its efficacy and potential for real-world applications.
