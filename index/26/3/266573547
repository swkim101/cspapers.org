Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, exhibit strong image-text comprehension abilities, facilitating advances in several downstream tasks such as zero-shot image classification, image-text retrieval, and text-to-image generation. However, the compositional reasoning abilities of existing VLMs remains subpar. The root of this limitation lies in the inadequate alignment between the images and captions in the pretraining datasets. Additionally, the current contrastive learning objective fails to focus on fine-grained grounding components like relations, actions, and attributes, resulting in “bag-of-words” representations. We introduce a simple and effective method to improve compositional reasoning in VLMs. Our method better leverages available datasets by refining and expanding the standard image-text contrastive learning framework. Our approach does not require specific annotations and does not incur extra parameters. When integrated with CLIP, our technique yields notable improvement over state-of-the-art baselines across five vision-language compositional benchmarks.11We open-source our code at https://github.com/lezhang7/Enhance-FineGrained.
