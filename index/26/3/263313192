Fine-tuning is an increasingly common technique that leverages transfer learning to dramatically expedite the training of huge, high-quality models. Critically, ﬁne-tuning holds the potential to make giant state-of-the-art models pre-trained on high-end super-computing-grade systems readily available for users that lack access to such costly resources. Unfortunately, this potential is still difﬁcult to realize because the models often do not ﬁt in the memory of a single commodity GPU, making ﬁne-tuning a challenging problem. We present FTPipe, a system that explores a previously unexplored dimension of pipeline model parallelism, making multi-GPU execution of ﬁne-tuning tasks for giant neural networks readily accessible. A key novel concept, called Mixed-pipe, allows balancing the compute-and memory-load on the GPUs by partitioning the model into computational blocks of any granularity while relaxing model topology constraints. Our system goes beyond topology limitations of previous pipeline-parallel approaches, efﬁciently training a new family of models, including the current state-of-the-art. Our extensive experiments on giant NLP models (BERT-340M, GPT2-1.5B, and T5-3B) show that FTPipe achieves up to 3 × speedup and state-of-the-art accuracy when ﬁne-tuning giant transformers with billions of parameters. These models require from 12GB to 59GB of GPU memory, and FTPipe executes them on 8 commodity RTX2080-Ti GPUs, each with 11GB memory and standard PCIe. FTPipe will be publicly released on GitHub.
