While large-scale pre-trained text-to-image models can synthesize diverse and high-quality human-centered images, novel challenges arise with a nuanced task of “identity fine editing” -precisely modifying specific features of a subject while maintaining its inherent identity and context. Existing personalization methods either require time-consuming optimization or learning additional encoders, adept in “identity re-contextualization”. However, they often struggle with detailed and sensitive tasks like human face editing. To address these challenges, we introduce DreamSalon, a noise-guided, staged-editing framework, uniquely focusing on de-tailed image manipulations and identity-context preservation. By discerning editing and boosting stages via the frequency and gradient of predicted noises, DreamSalon first performs detailed manipulations on specific features in the editing stage, guided by high-frequency information, and then employs stochastic denoising in the boosting stage to improve image quality. For more precise editing, DreamSa-lon semantically mixes source and target textual prompts, guided by differences in their embedding covariances, to direct the model's focus on specific manipulation areas. Our experiments demonstrate DreamSalon's ability to efficiently and faithfully edit fine details on human faces, outperforming existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
