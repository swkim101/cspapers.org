The “doorway effect” predicts that crossing an environmental boundary affects memory negatively. In virtual reality (VR), we can design the crossing and the appearance of such boundaries in non-realistic ways. However, it is unclear whether locomotion techniques like teleportation, which avoid crossing the boundary altogether, still induce the effect. Furthermore, it is unclear how different appearances of a doorway act as a boundary and thus induce the effect. To address these questions, we conducted two lab studies. First, we conceptually replicated prior doorway effect studies in VR using natural walking and teleportation. Second, we investigated the effect of five doorway visualizations, ranging from doors to portals. The results show no difference in object recognition performance due to the presence of a doorway, locomotion technique, or doorway visualization. We discuss the implications of these findings on the role of boundaries in event-based memory and the design of boundary interactions in VR.
