Read mapping is a crucial task in computational genomics. Recently, there has been a significant paradigm shift from sequence-to-sequence mapping (S2S) to sequence-to-graph mapping (S2G). The S2G mapping incurs high graph processing overheads and leads to an unnoticed shift of performance hotspots. This presents a substantial challenge to current software implementations and hardware accelerators. This paper introduces Harp, a novel S2G mapping acceleration system. Harp leverages the structural similarities between genome graphs and sequences, significantly reducing graph processing overhead by exploiting their quasi-sequential characteristic. The Harp accelerator is co-designed with two main algorithmic components: (1) HarpTree, a compact data structure that explicitly reveals the quasi-sequential characteristic, enabling simplifications of graph processing algorithms in S2G mapping, and (2) HarpExt, a multi-stage seed-extension algorithm that mitigates graph operation overhead while maintaining the sight of S2G mapping. Harp achieves an average 140× speedup over the latest S2G mapping software and outperforms the state-of-the-art S2G accelerator by 23.6× while reducing the chip area by 72% in S2G mapping of long reads.
