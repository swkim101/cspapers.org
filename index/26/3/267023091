Point cloud oversegmentation is a challenging task since it needs to produce perceptually meaningful partitions (i.e., superpoints) of a point cloud. Most existing oversegmentation methods cannot efficiently generate superpoints from large-scale LiDAR point clouds due to complex and inefficient procedures. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient end-to-end LiDAR oversegmentation network, which segments superpoints from the LiDAR point cloud by grouping points based on low-level point embeddings. Specifically, we first learn the similarity of points from the constructed local neighborhoods to obtain low-level point embeddings through the local discriminative loss. Then, to generate homogeneous superpoints from the sparse LiDAR point cloud, we propose a LiDAR point grouping algorithm that simultaneously considers the similarity of point embeddings and the Euclidean distance of points in 3D space. Finally, we design a superpoint refinement module for accurately assigning the hard boundary points to the corresponding superpoints. Extensive results on two large-scale outdoor datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, show that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in LiDAR oversegmentation. Notably, the inference time of our method is 100Ã— faster than that of other methods. Furthermore, we apply the learned superpoints to the LiDAR semantic segmentation task and the results show that using superpoints can significantly improve the LiDAR semantic segmentation of the baseline network.
