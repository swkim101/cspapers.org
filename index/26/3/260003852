Many people are concerned about how their personal data is used for online behavioral advertising (OBA). Ad targeting explanations have been proposed as a way to reduce this concern by improving transparency. However, it is unclear when and why people might want ad targeting explanations. Without this insight, we run the risk of designing explanations that do not address real concerns. To bridge this gap, we conducted a four-week, mixed-methods field study with 60 participants to understand when and why people want targeting explanations for the ads they actually encountered while browsing the web. We found that users wanted explanations for around 30% of the 4,251 ads we asked them about during the study, and that subjective perceptions of how their personal data was collected and shared were highly correlated with when users wanted ad explanations. Often, users wanted these explanations to confirm or deny their own preconceptions about how their data was collected or the motives of advertisers. A key upshot of our work is that one-size-fits-all approaches to ad explanations are likely to fail at addressing peopleâ€™s lived concerns about ad targeting; instead, more personalized explanations are needed.
