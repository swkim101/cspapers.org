It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Third International Workshop on Cloud Data Management (CloudDB 2011). This year's workshop continues its tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on the challenges of large-scale data management based on the cloud computing infrastructure. The mission of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from cloud computing, distributed storage, query processing, parallel algorithms, data mining, and system analysis, and identify new directions for future research and development. CloudDB gives them a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of cloud data management. 
 
The call for papers attracted 14 submissions from Asia, North America and Europe. The program committee accepted 6 papers that cover a variety of topics, including cloud-based storage, machine learning, query processing, distributed algorithms, security and privacy. In addition, the program includes two exciting keynote speeches by Prof. Malcolm Atkinson and Prof. Paul Watson. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for cloud data management researchers and developers.
