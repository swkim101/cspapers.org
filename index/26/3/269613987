We present a new multimodal face image generation method that converts a text prompt and a visual input, such as a semantic mask or scribble map, into a photorealistic face image. To do this, we combine the strengths of Generative Adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs) by employing the multimodal features in the DM into the latent space of the pretrained GANs. We present a simple mapping and a style modulation network to link two models and convert meaningful representations in feature maps and attention maps into latent codes. With GAN inversion, the estimated latent codes can be used to generate 2D or 3D-aware facial images. We further present a multi-step training strategy that reflects textual and structural representations into the generated image. Our proposed network produces realistic 2D, multi-view, and stylized face images, which align well with inputs. We validate our method by using pretrained 2D and 3D GANs, and our results outperform existing methods. Our project page is available at https://github.com/1211sh/Diffusion-driven_GAN-Inversion/.
