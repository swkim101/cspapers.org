This paper aims to explain the generalization of deep-fake detectors from the novel perspective of multi-order interactions among visual concepts. Specifically, we propose three hypotheses: 1. Deepfake detectors encode multi-order interactions among visual concepts, in which the low-order interactions usually have substantially negative contributions to deepfake detection. 2. Deepfake detectors with better generalization abilities tend to encode low-order interactions with fewer negative contributions. 3. Generalized deepfake detectors usually weaken the negative contributions of low-order interactions by suppressing their strength. Accordingly, we design several mathematical metrics to evaluate the effect of low-order interaction for deepfake detectors. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify the soundness of our hypotheses. Based on the analyses, we further propose a generic method, which directly reduces the toxic effects of low-order interactions to improve the generalization of deepfake detectors to some extent.
