Multi-label learning is widely applied in many tasks, where an object possesses multiple concepts with each represented by a class label. Previous studies on multi-label learning have focused on a fixed set of class labels, i.e., the class label set of test data is the same as that in the training set. In many applications, however, the environment is open and new concepts may emerge with previously unseen instances. In order to maintain good predictive performance in this environment, a multi-label learning method must have the ability to detect and classify those instances with emerging new labels. To this end, we propose a new approach called Multi-label learning with Emerging New Labels (MuENL). It builds models with three functions: classify instances on currently known labels, detect the emergence of a new label in new instances, and construct a new classifier for each new label that works collaboratively with the classifier for known labels. Our empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of MuENL.
