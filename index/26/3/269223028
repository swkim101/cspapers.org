In-Network Aggregation (INA) offloads the gradient aggregation in distributed training (DT) onto programmable switches, where the switch memory could be allocated to jobs in either synchronous or statistical multiplexing mode. Statistical INA has advantages in switch memory utilization, control-plane simplicity, and management safety, but it faces the problem of cross-layer resource efficiency in job placement. This paper presents a job placement system NetPack for clusters with statistical INA, which aims to maximize the utilization of both computation and network resources. NetPack periodically batches and places jobs into the cluster. When placing a job, NetPack runs a steady state estimation algorithm to acquire the available resources in the cluster, heuristically values each server according to its available resources (GPU and bandwidth), and runs a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently search for servers with the highest value for the job. Our prototype of NetPack and the experiments demonstrate that NetPack outperforms prior job placement methods by 45% in terms of average job completion time on production traces.
