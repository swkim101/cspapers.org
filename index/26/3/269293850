Tackling image degradation due to atmospheric turbu-lence, particularly in dynamic environments, remains a challenge for long-range imaging systems. Existing techniques have been primarily designed for static scenes or scenes with small motion. This paper presents the first segment-then-restore pipeline for restoring the videos of dy-namic scenes in turbulent environments. We leverage mean optical flow with an unsupervised motion segmentation method to separate dynamic and static scene components prior to restoration. After camera shake compensation and segmentation, we introduce foreground/background en-hancement leveraging the statistics of turbulence strength and a transformer model trained on a novel noise-based procedural turbulence generator for fast dataset augmen-tation. Benchmarked against existing restoration meth-ods, our approach restores most of the geometric distortion and enhances the sharpness of videos. We make our code, simulator, and data publicly available to ad-vance the field of video restoration from turbulence: riponcs.github.io/TurbSegRes
