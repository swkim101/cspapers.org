In this paper, we propose a new approach for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation based on the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm with virtual antenna in 2D Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. Moreover, DOA estimation is separating operated on azimuth and elevation domains. The proposed algorithm can reduce computational complexity by estimating the azimuth angle horizontally and the elevation angle vertically. However, this approach requires that the number of antennas in each direction is greater than the number of users, otherwise, it is impossible to estimate the DOA. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach that uses virtual antenna placement to obtain additional received signals. By using these virtual data, we can estimate DOA even when the number of users exceeds the number of antennas in each direction. We demonstrate through simulation that our proposed approach can achieve low computational complexity while maintaining the higher DOA estimation accuracy. Moreover, since the estimation accuracy varies depending on the location of the virtual antenna placement, this paper also demonstrates the optimal placement of the virtual antenna through simulations.
