Creating resources such as tools, curricula, and assessments is an important aspect of educational work, but dissemination and adoption of these resources is often hard. Surprisingly few papers have been written about reusing resources and replicating corresponding research results for an individual lesson of 30-60 minutes. This poster describes our reuse of an instructional resource on conditional refactoring and our attempts to partially replicate the results reported in the paper that originally described the resource. We describe what parts were easy to replicate and what parts were more difficult to replicate. We hope to help others who wish to promote adoption of new instructional materials and replication of their research results.
