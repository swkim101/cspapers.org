This study addresses two currently open questions about how behaviors of online community members influence others’ responses to misinformation. First, in contrast to prior work, it directly measures norm perception to address whether (1) norm perception actually acts as a mediator, (2) others’ behaviors directly influence individuals’ responses to misinformation, (3) both direct and mediated effects occur. Second, it investigates norm perceptions about a behavior that is not readily observable in online communities, but is prone to misinformation, specifically, vaccination. To do so, it experimentally manipulates the prevalence of communicating about vaccination (an unobservable behavior) within an online community. The results demonstrate no evidence of a direct effect—the causal relationship between prevalence of communicating a behavior and intentions to respond to misinformation only occurs via norm perception as a mediator. The paper highlights implications of these findings for designing community-centered interventions to influence perceived norms, thereby mitigating misinformation spread and impacts.
