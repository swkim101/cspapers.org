We present a simple Ceteris Paribus Logic (CP) and study its relationship with existing logics that deal with the representation of choice and power in games in normal form including atemporal STIT, Coalition Logic of Propositional Control (CL-PC) and Dynamic Logic of Propositional Assignments (DL-PA). Thanks to the polynomial reduction of the satisfiability problem for atemporal STIT in the satisfiability problem for CP, we obtain a complexity result for the latter problem.
