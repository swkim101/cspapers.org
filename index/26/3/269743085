Community-based social programs, such as interest groups and outings, provide valuable ways for older adults to maintain social connectedness. To understand how technology can be designed to support older adults in such programs, we conducted a four-month field study with a local community centre, involving: (1) observations of social program sessions, (2) interviews with staff, and (3) co-design workshops with staff and program participants. We found that staff used technologies in a situated way to make social programs more inclusive for older adults. Technology promoted incidental social interactions and group learning, but also excluded participants from some activities. Participants believed that future technologies to support community-based social programs should be designed to enable efficient communication, promote flexible interactions, and maintain the flow of social activities. We argue that technology interventions in this setting should not become the focus of an activity but instead support social interactions triggered by existing activities.
