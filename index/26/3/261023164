While 3D-based GAN techniques have been successfully applied to render photo-realistic 3D images with a variety of attributes while preserving view consistency, there has been little research on how to fine-control 3D images without limiting to a specific category of objects of their properties. To fill such research gap, we propose a novel image manipulation model of 3D-based GAN representations for a fine-grained control of specific custom attributes. By extending the latest 3D-based GAN models (e.g., EG3D), our user-friendly quantitative manipulation model enables a fine yet normalized control of 3D manipulation of multi-attribute quantities while achieving view consistency. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed technique both qualitatively and quantitatively through various experiments.
