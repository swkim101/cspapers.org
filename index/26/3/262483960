Weblogs or blogs collectively constitute the Blogosphere, form- ing an influential and interesting subset on the Web. As with most Internet-enabled applications, the ease of content cre- ation and distribution makes the blogosphere spam prone. Spam blogs or splogs are blogs hosting spam posts, created using machine generated or hijacked content for the sole pur- pose of hosting ads or raising the PageRank of target sites. These splogs make up the splogosphere, and are now inun- dating blog search engines and update ping servers. In this work we characterize splogs by comparing them against au- thentic blogs. Our analysis is based on a dataset made pub- licly available by BlogPulse, and employs a machine learn- ing model that detects splogs with an accuracy of 90%. To round off this analysis and to better understand splogs, we also present our study of a popular blog update ping server, and show how they are overwhelmed by pings sent by splogs. This overall study will facilitate finding effective new tech- niques to detect and weed out splogs from the blogosphere.
