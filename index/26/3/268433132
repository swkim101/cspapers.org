In 2017 the STEMcoding project was launched, which aimed to develop and disseminate free content that mixes content from science, math and computer science standards. Early work focused on ''physics of video games'' activities for high school physical science and physics while later work has ventured into content for astronomy and high school mathematics. Some of these activities appear on hourofcode.com and in ''instructional supports'' for physical science in Ohio. An important component of our efforts is creating high quality videos that walk through our activities on the STEMcoding youtube channel (http://youtube.com/STEMcoding). These videos frequently feature women and students from underrepresented groups. Ultimately our goal is to encourage high school science and math teachers to integrate computer science and data science content into their subjects, even if they do not have the credentials to teach computer science. This can enhance science and math classes, and as these teachers become comfortable with this approach, some go on to become certified to teach computer science.
