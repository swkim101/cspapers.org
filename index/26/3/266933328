The rise of generative AI has led many companies to hire freelanc-ers to harness its potential. However, this technology presents unique challenges to developers who have not previously engaged with it. Freelancers may find these challenges daunting due to the absence of organizational support and their reliance on positive client feedback. In a study involving 52 freelance developers, we identified multiple challenges associated with developing solutions based on generative AI. Freelancers often struggle with as-pects they perceive as unique to generative AI such as unpredict-ability of its output, the occurrence of hallucinations, and the in-consistent effort required due to trial-and-error prompting cycles. Further, the limitations of specific frameworks, such as token lim-its and long response times, add to the complexity. Hype-related issues, such as inflated client expectations and a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem, further exacerbate the difficulties. To address these issues, we propose Software Engineering for Generative AI (SE4GenAI) and Hype-Induced Software Engineering (HypeSE) as areas where the software engineering community can provide effective guidance. This support is essential for freelancers working with generative AI and other emerging technologies.
