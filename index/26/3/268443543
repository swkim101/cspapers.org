Algorithm design is a vital skill developed in most undergraduate Computer Science (CS) programs, but few research studies focus on pedagogy related to Algorithms coursework. To understand the work that has been done in the area, we present a systematic survey and characterization of existing studies in the CS Education literature related to the teaching of algorithm design at the undergraduate level. Across all papers in the ACM Digital Library, we only find 97 applicable papers. We classify these papers by topic, evaluation metric, evaluation methods, and intervention target. We present the results of these classifications alongside insights about existing knowledge, rigor, and contribution rates. We hope that this work not only provides a detailed representation of the current corpus of CS Education work related to algorithm design but also demonstrates that the body of knowledge is sparse and supports further research in the area. For future work, we intend to investigate and synthesize the conclusions reached by these papers.
