Software Engineering is an undergraduate course designed to prepare students to program in the workplace by teaching them the importance of process, analysis, and design. One approach to teaching this course is to have the students use an all-Java framework to develop an application. Java, however, is not as prevalent as it previously was, so a more modern web-based framework could have more practical applications. The goal of this project was to develop and test a web-based, cloud framework for students to use to develop an application in a Software Engineering course. To achieve this goal, the team researched a React-based framework and built a sample application using it to prove its utility. The application was then deployed on the cloud using AWS EC2 and RDS. During development, the team created a series of useful resources and collected online resources to help future students learn the technology stack quickly, allowing them to focus on software methodologies, software design, and best practices.
