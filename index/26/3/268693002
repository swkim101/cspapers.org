We consider the NP-hard problem of finding a smallest decision tree
representing a classification instance in terms of a partially defined
Boolean function. Small decision trees are desirable to provide an
interpretable model for the given data. We show that the problem is
fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the rank-width of the
incidence graph of the given classification instance. Our algorithm
proceeds by dynamic programming using an NLC decomposition obtained
from a rank-width decomposition. The key to the algorithm is a
succinct representation of partial solutions. This allows us to limit
the space and time requirements for each dynamic programming step in
terms of the parameter.
