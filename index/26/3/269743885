Robots are embodied agents that act under several sources of uncertainty. When assisting humans in a collaborative task, robots need to communicate their uncertainty to help inform decisions. In this study, we examine the use of visualising a robot’s uncertainty in a high-stakes assisted decision-making task. In particular, we explore how different modalities of uncertainty visualisations (graphical display vs. the robot’s embodied behaviour) and confidence levels (low, high, 100%) conveyed by a robot affect the human decision-making and perception during a collaborative task. Our results show that these visualisations significantly impact how participants arrive to their decision as well as how they perceive the robot’s transparency across the different confidence levels. We highlight potential trade-offs and offer implications for robot-assisted decision-making. Our work contributes empirical insights on how humans make use of uncertainty visualisations conveyed by a robot in a critical robot-assisted decision-making scenario.
