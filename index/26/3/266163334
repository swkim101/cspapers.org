Recent research in self-supervised contrastive learning of music representations has demonstrated remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks. However, a prevailing trend in existing methods involves representing equally-sized music clips in either waveform or spectrogram formats, often overlooking the intrinsic part-whole hierarchies within music. In our quest to comprehend the bottom-up structure of music, we introduce MART, a hierarchical music representation learning approach that facilitates feature interactions among cropped music clips while considering their part-whole hierarchies. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical part-whole transformer to capture the structural relationships between music clips in a part-whole hierarchy. Furthermore, a hierarchical contrastive learning objective is crafted to align part-whole music representations at adjacent levels, progressively establishing a multi-hierarchy representation space. The effectiveness of our music representation learning from part-whole hierarchies has been empirically validated across multiple downstream tasks, including music classification and cover song identification.
