More than 50% of Computer Science (CS) students at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) experienced academic probation over a 10-year span. Particularly concerning, underrepresented groups (URG) faced an even higher probation rate, and probation students were twice as likely to leave the CS program. We conducted a comprehensive survey involving 308 CS1 students at UCI to delve further into their past and present academic experiences. Specifically, we studied (1) the role of academic preparedness and computing participation in CS students' success, and (2) to what extent these factors impact the academic success of URG students. Our findings reveal significant correlations between underperformance in CS1 and inadequate pre-college math preparation, consistent with existing literature. Moreover, our results show that most URG students also lack prior programming exposure and peer communities within their field (study groups or clubs). These insights highlight the urgency to consider curriculum and academic preparation modifications to establish a strong math and programming foundation for all students, which can guide them toward greater success in CS.
