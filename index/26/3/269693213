Asking multi-turn clarifying questions has been applied in various conversational search systems to help recommend people, commodities, and images to users. However, its importance is still not emphasized in the Web search. In this paper, we make a step to extend the multi-turn clarification generation to Web search for clarifying users' ambiguous or faceted intents. Compared with other conversational search scenarios, Web search queries are more complicated, so clarification should be generated instead of being selected which is commonly applied in current studies. To this end, we first define the whole process of multi-turn Web search clarification composed of clarification candidate generation, optimal clarification selection, and document retrieval. Due to the lack of multi-turn open-domain clarification data, we first design a simple yet effective rule-based method to fit the above three components. After that, by utilizing the in-context learning and zero-shot instruction ability of large language models (LLMs), we implement clarification generation and selection by prompting LLMs with demonstrations and declarations, further improving the clarification effectiveness. To evaluate our proposed methods, we first measure whether our methods can improve the ability to retrieve documents. We also evaluate the quality of generated candidate facets. Experimental results show that, compared with existing single-turn methods for Web search clarification, our proposed framework is more suitable for open-domain Web search systems in asking multi-turn clarification questions to clarify users' ambiguous or faceted intents.
