Knowledge engineering has been successfully applied in many domains to create knowledge-based "expert" systems. We have applied this technology to the area of large-scale simulation and have implemented ROSS, a Rule-Oriented Simulation System, that simulates military air battles. Alternative decision-making behaviors have been extracted from experts and encoded as object-oriented rules. Browsing of the knowledge and explanation of events occur at various levels of abstraction.
