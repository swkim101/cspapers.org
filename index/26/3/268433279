The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) Sparks curriculum is an innovative computer science curriculum designed to introduce middle school and early high school students to the world of computer science through functional programming. Developed by the creators of BJC CS Principles (CSP), BJC Sparks presents a simplified yet engaging approach to programming, emphasizing the flow of information through functions. By focusing on functions rather than commands and iteration, BJC Sparks nurtures problem-solving skills and reduces bugs in future programming experiences. At SIGCSE 2023, the BJC Sparks team shared their insights into the curriculum's development and implementation, featuring real-world accounts from pioneering teachers. The use of microworlds and multimedia elements captured middle school students' interest, particularly in physical computing micro:bit activities. This approach showcased the potential of multimedia and data science projects in teaching functional programming through exciting, personalized activities. Building on the success of previous summer PD workshops with 76 educators across the U.S., we propose a condensed version of our comprehensive workshop for SIGCSE. Participants will gain a deep understanding of BJC Sparks' design principles, hands-on experience with the Snap! programming language, collaborative lab activities, alignment with CSTA standards, access to teacher materials and resources, and effective pedagogical strategies. Attendees will receive a three-hour professional development certificate and will be equipped to empower the next generation of young minds in the world of functional programming and beyond.
