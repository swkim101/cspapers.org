Diffusion-based image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E 2, are able to learn from given images and generate high-quality samples following the guidance from prompts. For instance, they can be used to create artistic images that mimic the style of an artist based on his/her original artworks or to maliciously edit the original images for fake content. However, such ability also brings serious ethical issues without proper authorization from the owner of the original images. In response, several attempts have been made to protect the original images from such unauthorized data usage by adding imperceptible perturbations, which are designed to mislead the diffusion model and make it unable to properly generate new samples. In this work, we introduce a perturbation purification platform, named IMPRESS, to evaluate the effectiveness of imperceptible perturbations as a protective measure. IMPRESS is based on the key observation that imperceptible perturbations could lead to a perceptible inconsistency between the original image and the diffusion-reconstructed image, which can be used to devise a new optimization strategy for purifying the image, which may weaken the protection of the original image from unauthorized data usage (e.g., style mimicking, malicious editing). The proposed IMPRESS platform offers a comprehensive evaluation of several contemporary protection methods, and can be used as an evaluation platform for future protection methods.
