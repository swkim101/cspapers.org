The advent of telehealth revolutionizes healthcare by enabling remote consultations, yet poses complex security and privacy challenges. These are often acutely felt by lower-resourced, allied-healthcare practices. To address this, our study focuses on audiologists and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in private practice settings, often characterized by limited information technology resources. Over the course of six months, we conducted semi-structured interviews with ten audiologists and ten SLPs to understand their telehealth experiences and concerns. Key findings reveal a diversity of opinions on technology trustworthiness, data security concerns, implemented security protocols, and patient behaviors. Given the nature of the medical practitionersâ€™ primary work, participants expressed varied concerns about data breaches and platform vulnerabilities, yet trusted third-party services like Zoom due to inadequate expertise and time to evaluate security protocols. This work underscores the imperative of bridging the technology-healthcare gap to foster secure, patient/provider-centered telehealth as the prevailing practice. It also emphasizes the need to synergize security, privacy, and usability to securely deliver care through telehealth.
