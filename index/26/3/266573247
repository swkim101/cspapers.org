Product bundling has evolved into a crucial marketing strategy in e-commerce. However, current studies are limited to generating (1) fixed-size or single bundles, and most importantly, (2) bundles that do not reflect consistent user intents, thus being less intelligible or useful to users. This paper explores two interrelated tasks, i.e., personalized bundle generation and the underlying intent inference based on users' interactions in a session, leveraging the logical reasoning capability of large language models. We introduce a dynamic in-context learning paradigm, which enables ChatGPT to seek tailored and dynamic lessons from closely related sessions as demonstrations while performing tasks in the target session. Specifically, it first harnesses retrieval augmented generation to identify nearest neighbor sessions for each target session. Then, proper prompts are designed to guide ChatGPT to perform the two tasks on neighbor sessions. To enhance reliability and mitigate the hallucination issue, we develop (1) a self-correction strategy to foster mutual improvement in both tasks without supervision signals; and (2) an auto-feedback mechanism to recurrently offer dynamic supervision based on the distinct mistakes made by ChatGPT on various neighbor sessions. Thus, the target session can receive customized and dynamic lessons for improved performance by observing the demonstrations of its neighbor sessions. Finally, experimental results on three real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our methods on both tasks. Additionally, the inferred intents can prove beneficial for other intriguing downstream tasks, such as crafting appealing bundle names.
