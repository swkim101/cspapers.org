Many virtual reality applications require massive 3D content, which impels the need for low-cost and efficient modeling tools in terms of quality and quantity. In this paper, we present a Diffusion-augmented Generative model to generate high-fidelity 3D textured meshes that can be directly used in modern graphics engines. Challenges in directly generating textured mesh arise from the instability and texture incompleteness of a hybrid framework which contains conversion between 2D features and 3D space. To alleviate these difficulties, DG3D incorporates a diffusion-based augmentation module into the min-max game between the 3D tetrahedral mesh generator and 2D renderings discriminators, which stabilizes network optimization and prevents mode collapse in vanilla GANs. We also suggest using multi-modal renderings in discrimination to further increase the aesthetics and completeness of generated textures. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark and real scans show that our proposed DG3D outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, i.e., 5% ∼ 40% in FID-3D score and 5%∼10% in geometry-related metrics.
