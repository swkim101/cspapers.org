Semantic segmentation is one of the tasks concerned in the field of computer vision. However, the cost of capturing large numbers of pixel-level annotations is expensive. Semi-supervised learning can utilize labeled and unlabeled data, providing new ideas for solving the problem of insufficient labeled data. In this work, we propose a data-reliability weighted multi-phase learning method for semi-supervised segmentation (RWMS). Under the framework of self-training, we train two different teacher models to evaluate the reliability of pseudo labels. By selecting reliable data at the image level and reweighting pseudo labels at the pixel level, multi-phase training is guided to focus on more reliable knowledge. Besides, we also inject strong data augmentations on unlabeled images while training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs remarkably well compared to baseline methods and substantially outperforms them, more than 3% on VOC and Cityscapes.
