In this paper, we investigate the performance of a mobile edge computing (MEC) system in which a user intends to offload their tasks to MEC servers located at different access points by applying the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes. Due to the blocking of direct transmission channels between the user and access points, it needs the help of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) for offloading. STAR-RIS is a meta-surface with many low-cost passive elements which can be adjusted the phase shift by the controller to maximize the power gains of the channels. In order to evaluate the performance of this considered system, the expression of successful computation probability is derived by using statistical characteristics of the signal-to-noise ratio. Monte-Carlo simulations verify the analytical results.
