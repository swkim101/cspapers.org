3D scene segmentation based on neural implicit representation has emerged recently with the advantage of training only on 2D supervision. However, existing approaches still requires expensive per-scene optimization that prohibits generalization to novel scenes during inference. To circumvent this problem, we introduce a generalizable 3D segmentation framework based on implicit representation. Specifically, our framework takes in multi-view image features and semantic maps as the inputs instead of only spatial information to avoid overfitting to scene-specific geometric and semantic information. We propose a novel soft voting mechanism to aggregate the 2D semantic information from different views for each 3D point. In addition to the image features, view difference information is also encoded in our framework to predict the voting scores. Intuitively, this allows the semantic information from nearby views to contribute more compared to distant ones. Furthermore, a visibility module is also designed to detect and filter out detrimental information from occluded views. Due to the generalizability of our proposed method, we can synthesize semantic maps or conduct 3D semantic segmentation for novel scenes with solely 2D semantic supervision. Experimental results show that our approach achieves comparable performance with scene-specific approaches. More importantly, our approach can even outperform existing strong supervision-based approaches with only 2D annotations. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/HLinChen/GNeSF.
