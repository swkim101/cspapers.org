The rapid advancement of quantum computing has generated considerable anticipation for its transformative potential. However, harnessing its full potential relies on identifying"killer applications". In this regard, QuGeo emerges as a groundbreaking quantum learning framework, poised to become a key application in geoscience, particularly for Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI). This framework integrates variational quantum circuits with geoscience, representing a novel fusion of quantum computing and geophysical analysis. This synergy unlocks quantum computing's potential within geoscience. It addresses the critical need for physics-guided data scaling, ensuring high-performance geoscientific analyses aligned with core physical principles. Furthermore, QuGeo's introduction of a quantum circuit custom-designed for FWI highlights the critical importance of application-specific circuit design for quantum computing. In the OpenFWI's FlatVelA dataset experiments, the variational quantum circuit from QuGeo, with only 576 parameters, achieved significant improvement in performance. It reached a Structural Similarity Image Metric (SSIM) score of 0.905 between the ground truth and the output velocity map. This is a notable enhancement from the baseline design's SSIM score of 0.800, which was achieved without the incorporation of physics knowledge.
