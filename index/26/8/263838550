This paper presents a development methodology that helps designers to map efficiently applications onto a heterogeneous CPU/FPGA system. An industrial case study is presented and aims at meeting performance and real-time requirements with the help of our architecture capabilities and avionic model parallelization. Different avionic model implementations will be presented in order to explain how to find the best trade-off between performance and design-time.
