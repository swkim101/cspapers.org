A prediction market is a financial market designed to elicit a forecast for an uncertain event. To achieve this, the market offers a security whose payoff is tied to the outcome of the event and attracts traders to speculate on the outcome. With sufficient liquidity, traders will converge to a consensus price reflecting their collective information about the value of the security, which corresponds to a probabilistic forecast of the event. Empirically, prediction markets often outperform experts, groups, and polls across a variety of settings. This tutorial introduces the main concepts and issues in prediction markets. It covers related economic theory and analysis, including classical results regarding Arrow-Debreu security markets and rational expectations equilibrium, laboratory investigations of experimental markets, field tests, and recent empirical studies of real world prediction markets. Then, it moves to computational aspects of prediction markets, introducing distributed computation in markets and computational issues of order matching and making markets. The tutorial surveys recent research on prediction market mechanism design, including compound markets, permutation betting markets, market scoring rules, dynamic pari-mutuel markets, and automated market makers. It also touches on the legality of prediction markets. The tutorial is largely self-contained. Attendees may benefit from a rudimentary knowledge of probability.
