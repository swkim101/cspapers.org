Smart water systems, in which optimization algorithms autonomously control water infrastructure, are widely touted as a promising solution to urban water management and sanitation problems. Presently, however, adoption remains low. Even as automation and ubiquitous computing expand into consumer and civic applications, the operation of water infrastructure around the world remains stubbornly manual. We examine the barriers to adoption of smart water systems through a user study of control room operators managing a large urban sewer in Detroit, Michigan, USA. We find that limited operator trust, system complexity, high uncertainty in critical data sources, and structural barriers to regional cooperation are impeding smart technology adoption. In response, we introduce SewerTycoon, an interactive, model-based simulation tool, which we use as a scenario-based prototype. Discussion with operators on how the use of smart technologies can be expanded in the sewer system reveals opportunities for low risk testing of new technologies.
