Besides developers’ code, current Android apps usually integrate code from third-party libraries, all of which may include code for TLS validation. We analyze well-known improper TLS certificate validation issues in popular Android apps, and attribute the validation issues to the offending code/- party in a fine-grained manner, unlike existing work labeling an entire app for validation failures. Surprisingly, we discovered a widely used practice of overriding the global default validation functions with improper validation logic, or simply performing no validation at all, affecting the entire app’s TLS connections, which we call validation hijacking . We design and implement an automated dynamic analysis tool called Marvin to identify TLS validation failures, including validation hijacking, and the responsible parties behind such insecure practices. Among 7826 apps from a Chinese app store and Google Play analyzed by Marvin, we found many
