In the digital age, understanding the dynamics of information spread and opinion formation within networks is paramount. This research introduces an innovative framework that combines the principles of opinion dynamics with the strategic capabilities of Automated Planning. We have developed, to the best of our knowledge, the first-ever numeric PDDL tailored for opinion dynamics. Our tool empowers users to visualize intricate networks, simulate the evolution of opinions, and strategically influence that evolution to achieve specific outcomes. By harnessing Automated Planning techniques, our framework offers a nuanced approach to devise sequences of actions tailored to transition a network from its current opinion landscape to a desired state. This holistic approach provides insights into the intricate interplay of individual nodes within a network and paves the way for targeted interventions. Furthermore, the tool facilitates human-AI collaboration, enabling users to not only understand information spread but also devise practical strategies to mitigate potential harmful outcomes arising from it.
