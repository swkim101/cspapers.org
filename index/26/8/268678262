Our life is populated with articulated objects. Current category-level articulation estimation works largely focus on predicting part-level 6D poses on static point cloud observations. In this paper, we tackle the problem of category-level online robust and real-time 6D pose tracking of articulated objects, where we propose KPA-Tracker, a novel 3D KeyPoint based Articulated object pose Tracker. Given an RGB-D image or a partial point cloud at the current frame as well as the estimated per-part 6D poses from the last frame, our KPA-Tracker can effectively update the poses with learned 3D keypoints between the adjacent frames. Specifically, we first canonicalize the input point cloud and formulate the pose tracking as an inter-frame pose increment estimation task. To learn consistent and separate 3D keypoints for every rigid part, we build KPA-Gen that outputs the high-quality ordered 3D keypoints in an unsupervised manner. During pose tracking on the whole video, we further propose a keypoint-based articulation tracking algorithm that mines keyframes as reference for accurate pose updating. We provide extensive experiments on validating our KPA-Tracker on various datasets ranging from synthetic point cloud observation to real-world scenarios, which demonstrates the superior performance and robustness of the KPA-Tracker. We believe that our work has the potential to be applied in many fields including robotics, embodied intelligence and augmented reality.
