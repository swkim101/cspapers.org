The core of pointly-supervised panoptic segmentation is estimating accurate dense pseudo labels from sparse point labels to train the panoptic head. Previous works generate pseudo labels mainly based on hand-crafted rules, such as connecting multiple points into polygon masks, or assigning the label information of labeled pixels to unlabeled pixels based on the artificially defined traversing distance. The accuracy of pseudo labels is limited by the quality of the hand-crafted rules (polygon masks are rough at object contour regions, and the traversing distance error will result in wrong pseudo labels). To overcome the limitation of hand-crafted rules, we estimate pseudo labels with a fully data-driven pseudo label branch, which is optimized by point labels end-to-end and predicts more accurate pseudo labels than previous methods. We also train an auxiliary semantic branch with point labels, it assists the training of the pseudo label branch by transferring semantic segmentation knowledge through shared parameters. Experiments on Pascal VOC and MS COCO demonstrate that our approach is effective and shows state-of-the-art performance compared with related works.
