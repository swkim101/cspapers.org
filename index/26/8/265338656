This paper presents Bussgang-based belief propagation (BP) detection for a large-scale multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) communication system with one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). A closed-form presentation of the proposed receiver is derived using the Bussgang decomposition to model the non-linear effect of the one-bit ADC. The computer simulation results show that the Bussgang-based belief propagation detector outperforms the previous one, which was based on the additive noise model (AQNM).
