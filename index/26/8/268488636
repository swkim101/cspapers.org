The development of the CS content standards underscores the importance of curricula aligned with the standards, ensuring equitable coverage of CS concepts for all students. Because standards are broad, we emphasize the need for CS curricula to specify not only the standards they align with but also which aspects of the standards they align with and how. We map one common middle school CS curriculum to a few standards to demonstrate this need.
