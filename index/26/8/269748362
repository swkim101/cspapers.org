Mental health issues affect approximately 13% of people aged 10-24 years old worldwide. In Western countries (e.g. USA, UK, Australia), mental health issues are particularly prominent in Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) individuals, yet they are disproportionately affected in relation to service provision. Despite demand, there is a significant lack of literature explicitly exploring the design of digital mental health tools for CALD populations. Our study engaged five professionals working in CALD mental health, to gain insights into challenges for service access and provision, and then engaged 41 CALD young people to explore their experiences. We contribute a set of unique insights into the barriers that CALD young people face when seeking help, and their needs for future digital mental health tools. We also provide design recommendations for future researchers on how they might better support the inclusion of CALD communities in the design of digital health tools.
