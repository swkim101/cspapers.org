In-hand manipulation (IHM) is an important ability for robotic hands. This ability refers to changing the position and orientation of a grasped object without dropping it from the hand workspace. One major challenge of IHM is to achieve a large range of manipulation (especially rotation), regardless of the shape, size, and the orientation during manipulation of the grasped object. There are two main challenges - the manipulation range (due to the range of motion of the hand) and keeping the object grasped under all shapes and orientations. Specifically, even when the contact points between the hand and the object switch and the positions of these points change due to its shape and changing orientation, constant grasp of the object is required. This paper presents an IHM method for a robotic hand with belts, based on the prediction of the contact-point changes via image information. The focus is on a robotic hand that has a two-fingered parallel gripper with conveyor belts which can continuously manipulate an object through a large range. A stereo camera is attached to the hand. First, the contour of the grasped object is acquired from the camera. From the contour, the switching of the contact points between the surfaces of the belts and the object is predicted. Then, the positions of the contact points in the next frame are estimated by rotating the contour. The velocities of the belts are calculated based on the prediction of the switching. The fingers are controlled to follow the estimated positions of the contact points, via a feed-forward control. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through in-hand manipulation experiments for 22 objects of various shapes and sizes.
