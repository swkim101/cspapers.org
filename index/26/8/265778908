What constitutes a good example in the context of teaching design patterns? How can instructors judge whether one example is better than another one for teaching a design pattern to students? How might an example be presented to best connect with students, equipping them with the necessary know-how? In this paper, I address these questions by offering a means to judge the quality of examples for teaching design patterns: a list of desirable characteristics. The proposed list can be used to gauge the quality of examples and/or it can be used to guide the development of examples.
