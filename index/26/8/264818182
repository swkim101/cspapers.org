We present new information-theoretic generalization guarantees through the a novel construction of the"neighboring-hypothesis"matrix and a new family of stability notions termed sample-conditioned hypothesis (SCH) stability. Our approach yields sharper bounds that improve upon previous information-theoretic bounds in various learning scenarios. Notably, these bounds address the limitations of existing information-theoretic bounds in the context of stochastic convex optimization (SCO) problems, as explored in the recent work by Haghifam et al. (2023).
