Let S denote a set of n points in d-dimensional space, Rd, and let dist(p, g) denote the distance between two points in any Minkowski metric. For any real E > 0 and q E Rd, a point p E S is a (1 + c)-approximate nearest neighbor of q if, for all p’ E S, we have dist(p, q)/dist(p’,q) 5 (1 + E). We show how to preprocess a set of n points in Rd in O(nlog n) time and O(n) space, so that given a query point p E Rd, and e > 0, a (1 + c)-approximate nearest neighbor of q can be computed in O(log n) time. Constant factors depend on d and C. We show that given an integer k 1 1, (1 + c)-approximations to the L-nearest neighbors of q can be computed in O(k log n) time.
