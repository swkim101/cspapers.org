On behalf of the entire organizing committee, it is our pleasure to welcome you to the 2017 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UBICOMP) and International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC). This is the fifth installment of the conference after the merger of the previous "Pervasive" and "Ubiquitous Computing" conferences, and is the 29th conference to bear either of those names. UBICOMP 2017 once again is co-located with ISWC 2017---the premier forum to present cutting-edge research results in the fields of wearable computing and on-body mobile technologies.
