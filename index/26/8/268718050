Nowadays, detecting multimodal fake news has emerged as a foremost concern since the widespread dissemination of fake news may incur adverse societal impact. Conventional methods generally focus on capturing the linguistic and visual semantics within the multimodal content, which fall short in effectively distinguishing the heightened level of meticulous fabrications. Recently, external knowledge is introduced to provide valuable background facts as complementary to facilitate news detection. Nevertheless, existing knowledge-enhanced endeavors directly incorporate all knowledge contexts through static entity embeddings, resulting in the potential noisy and content-irrelevant knowledge. Moreover, the integration of knowledge entities makes it intractable to model the sophisticated correlations between multimodal semantics and knowledge entities. In light of these limitations, we propose a novel Adaptive Knowledge-Aware Fake News Detection model, dubbed AKA-Fake. For each news, AKA-Fake learns a compact knowledge subgraph under a reinforcement learning paradigm, which consists of a subset of entities and contextual neighbors in the knowledge graph, restoring the most informative knowledge facts. A novel heterogeneous graph learning module is further proposed to capture the reliable cross-modality correlations via topology refinement and modality-attentive pooling. Our proposal is extensively evaluated over three popular datasets, and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of AKA-Fake.
