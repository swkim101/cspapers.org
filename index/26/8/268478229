Affordable, secure, and scalable assessment delivery is an essential component of large university courses, whether online or in-person. The switch to Computer-Based Testing (CBT) can have a surprising, and almost transformational effect on pedagogy. Modern CBT systems provide almost unlimited flexibility in the types of questions they can support, for both manual grading and autograding, and CBT has now been adopted at several universities and is under serious consideration at others. In this BoF, faculty interested in learning about CBT and how to implement it at their institution are invited to ask their questions. Faculty experienced with CBT are invited to share how CBT has changed their approach, pedagogy, and behavior and how to advocate for its adoption.
