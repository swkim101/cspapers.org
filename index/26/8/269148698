Bit-level sparsity in neural network models harbors immense untapped potential. Eliminating redundant calculations of randomly distributed zero-bits significantly boosts computational efficiency. Yet, traditional digital SRAM-PIM architecture, limited by rigid crossbar architecture, struggles to effectively exploit this unstructured sparsity. To address this challenge, we propose Dyadic Block PIM (DB-PIM), a groundbreaking algorithm-architecture co-design framework. First, we propose an algorithm coupled with a distinctive sparsity pattern, termed a dyadic block (DB), that preserves the random distribution of non-zero bits to maintain accuracy while restricting the number of these bits in each weight to improve regularity. Architecturally, we develop a custom PIM macro that includes dyadic block multiplication units (DBMUs) and Canonical Signed Digit (CSD)-based adder trees, specifically tailored for Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. An input pre-processing unit (IPU) further refines performance and efficiency by capitalizing on block-wise input sparsity. Results show that our proposed co-design framework achieves a remarkable speedup of up to 7.69x and energy savings of 83.43%.
