In computing courses, instructor involvement and social comfort are vital for resilience and belonging. We examine engagement with instructor emails aimed at strengthening the connection with students. We sent weekly emails from instructors to first- and upper-year computing students. These emails included reminders for the assignments due each week. Half of the students received reminders embedded in an informal message that contained approachable wording and relevant current course events, while the rest received a list of precise deadlines. This text had no emotional engagement from the instructor. We collected and analyzed email access and link click rates, along with student survey responses about email preferences and engagement. We found that first-year students had lower email access and link click rates than upper-year students. While we did not find differences in first-year engagement based on the type of email, upper-year students appeared to be more engaged when receiving the intentionally informal version of the email. Understanding the message preferences of computing students can enhance instructor messaging and improve engagement. Strategies should be explored to boost first-year student engagement, while the higher engagement among upper-year students underscores the importance of instructor support in advanced courses.
