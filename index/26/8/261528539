It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the The Ninth ACM International Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental Evaluation, and Characterization -- WiNTECH'14. This year's workshop continues the tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of experimental wireless networking. The mission of the symposium is to bring together researchers working in the broad area of experimental wireless networking. This workshop will serve as a forum to share new ideas/experiences in all experimental aspects of wireless networks and systems, and facilitate discussions of key unresolved challenges in this area. 
 
The call for papers attracted numerous submissions from Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The program committee accepted 10 papers covering a variety of diverse topics focused on experimental wireless networking, including interference management, whitespace and spectrum management, and wireless medium access control. In addition, the program includes a exciting demo session, and a keynote speech by Prof. Suman Banerjee, University of Wisconsin- Madison.
