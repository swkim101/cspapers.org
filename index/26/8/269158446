Soil monitoring plays an essential role in agricultural systems. Rather than deploying sensors' antennas above the ground, burying them in the soil is an attractive way to retain a non-intrusive aboveground space. Low Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) has shown its long-distance and low-power features for aboveground Internet-of-Things (IoT) communication, presenting a potential of extending to underground cross-soil communication over a wide area, which however has not been investigated before. The variation of soil conditions brings significant signal polarization misalignment, degrading communication reliability. In this paper, we propose Demeter, a low-cost low-power programmable antenna design to keep reliable cross-soil communication automatically. First, we propose a hardware architecture to enable polarization adjustment on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) single-RF-chain LoRa radio. Moreover, we develop a low-power programmable circuit to obtain polarization adjustment. We further design an energy-efficient heuristic calibration algorithm and an adaptive calibration scheduling method to keep signal polarization alignment automatically. We implement Demeter with a customized PCB circuit and COTS devices. Then, we evaluate its performance in various soil types and environmental conditions. The results show that Demeter can achieve up to 11.6 dB SNR gain indoors and 9.94 dB outdoors, 4Ã— horizontal communication distance, at least 20 cm deeper underground deployment, and up to 82% energy consumption reduction per day compared with the standard LoRa.
