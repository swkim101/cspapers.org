Existing Building Damage Detection (BDD) methods always require labour-intensive pixel-level annotations of buildings and their conditions, hence largely limiting their applications. In this paper, we investigate a challenging yet practical scenario of BDD, Unsupervised Building Damage Detection (U-BDD), where only unlabelled pre- and post-disaster satellite image pairs are provided. As a pilot study, we have first proposed an advanced U-BDD baseline that leverages pre-trained vision-language foundation models to address the U-BDD task. However, the apparent domain gap between satellite and generic images causes low confidence in the foundation models used to identify buildings and their damages. In response, we further present a novel self-supervised framework, U-BDD++, which improves upon the U-BDD baseline by addressing domain-specific issues associated with satellite imagery. Extensive experiments on the widely used building damage assessment benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for unsupervised building damage detection. The presented annotation-free and foundation model-based paradigm ensures an efficient learning phase. This study opens a new direction for real-world BDD and sets a strong baseline for future research.
