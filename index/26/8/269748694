Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood psychiatric disorder. Schools can play a vital role in the early detection and treatment of mental health issues. However, stigma and fear regarding mental health often prevent schools from engaging in active interventions. ADHD is characterized by deficits in executive function, a critical contributor to children's self-directed behavior. We developed a conversational agent to assist children in planning and accomplishing daily tasks, with the aim of enhancing their executive function. We also designed supportive systems for both parents and teachers, proposing a collaborative school mental health system that incorporates various stakeholders. Through practical implementation with first-graders, this study confirmed the system's potential to improve structured living and symptoms among children with ADHD. Surveys involving parents and teachers confirmed that the application improved executive function and reduced inattention. Therefore, we suggest an enhanced mental health support system.
