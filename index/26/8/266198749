The tradeoff between the field-of-view and resolution of conventional onboard vision systems primarily results from their fixed optical components. We propose a novel active vision system, Falcon, as an optimal solution. This system comprises an electric zoom lens connected to a high-speed camera with a pair of galvanometer mirrors, enabling high-resolution imaging of a moving object across a wide range, from near to far. To ensure accurate calibration of the Falcon system, we introduce a novel mapping-based calibration method using external cameras. We also present a robust and lightweight visual feedback method that utilizes this mapping-based calibration for effective object tracking. The effectiveness of the Falcon system is verified by constructing a prototype and conducting tracking experiments in an indoor setting, which demonstrated the superior performance of our method. Additionally, we successfully achieved continuous and high-resolution imaging of a curved mirror on public roads while the vehicle was moving.
