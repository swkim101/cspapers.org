This paper gives several assignments that are interesting and challenging to students. These individual selections were obtained by requesting nifty assignments from authors of papers that will be presented at the Rocky Mountain section of the Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges (RM-CCSC). At the last few conferences of the RM-CCSC there has been a session of nifty assignments. It was thought by making this into a paper that it would be available to other CCSC members that did not attend the conference.
