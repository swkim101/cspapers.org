It is our great pleasure to welcome you all to the Eleventh ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access (MobiDE'12), held in conjunction with SIGMOD 2012. MobiDE continues its tradition of bringing together researchers and practitioners in databases, mobile computing, and networking, and providing a full day of exciting presentations and discussions. As in previous years, the workshop serves as a forum to present latest research and engineering results and contributions, and set future directions in wireless and mobile data management. 
 
MobiDE'12 is the eleventh of a successful series of workshops that aims to act as a bridge between the data management, wireless networking, and mobile computing communities. The 1st MobiDE workshop took place in Seattle, USA (August 1999), in conjunction with MobiCom 1999. The 2nd MobiDE workshop was held in Santa Barbara, USA (May 2001), together with SIGMOD 2001. The 3rd MobiDE workshop was organized in San Diego, USA (September 2003), co-located with MobiCom 2003. The 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th MobiDE workshops took place in Baltimore, USA (June 2005), Chicago, USA (June 2006), Beijing, China (June 2007), Vancouver, Canada (June 2008), Providence, USA (June 2009), Indianapolis, USA (June 2010), and Athens, Greece (June 2011) respectively, co-located with SIGMOD. 
 
The program of MobiDE'12 covers a range of topics such as big mobile data, mobile services and middleware, query processing, energy-aware mobile data management etc. It features 8 high-quality papers, with authors from 8 countries. In addition, the program includes two invited keynote speeches: one by Prof. Shashi Shekhar from University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA, with title "Spatial Big-Data Challenges Intersecting Mobility and Cloud Computing", another by Dr. Kyriakos Mouratidis from Singapore Management University, Singapore, with title "Spatial Queries in Wireless Broadcast Environments". These proceedings will serve as a valuable reference point for the latest results on mobile and wireless data engineering.
