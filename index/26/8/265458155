Autonomous Marine Vehicles (AMVs) have gained interest for scientific and commercial applications, including pipeline and algae bloom monitoring, contaminant tracking, and ocean debris removal. The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) is relevant in this context as Multi-Robot Systems (MRSs) allow for better coverage of the area of interest, simultaneous data collection at different locations, and an increase in the overall robustness and efficiency of the mission. However, route planning for AMVs in dynamic ocean environments is challenging due to the coupling of environmental and vehicle dynamics. We propose a multi-objective formulation that accounts for the trade-offs between visiting multiple task locations and energy consumption by the vehicles subject to a time budget. This work focuses on vehicles that can maintain a constant net speed but can be adapted to vehicles with constant thrust. Different from existing approaches, our method is able to leverage time-varying ocean currents to improve the energy efficiency of resulting routes. We validate our approach experimentally by superimposing ocean flow models with benchmark instances of the TOP.
