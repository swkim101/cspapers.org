Nowadays, closed-set perception methods for autonomous driving perform well on datasets containing normal scenes. However, they still struggle to handle anomalies in the real world, such as unknown objects that have never been seen while training. The lack of public datasets to evaluate the model performance on anomaly and corner cases has hindered the development of reliable autonomous driving systems. Therefore, we propose a multimodal Synthetic Dataset for Anomaly and Corner case detection, called SDAC, which encompasses anomalies captured from multi-view cameras and the LiDAR sensor, providing a rich set of annotations for multiple mainstream perception tasks. SDAC is the first public dataset for autonomous driving that categorizes anomalies into object, scene, and scenario levels, allowing the evaluation under different anomalous conditions. Experiments show that closed-set models suffer significant performance drops on anomaly subsets in SDAC. Existing anomaly detection methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance, suggesting that anomaly detection remains a challenging problem. We anticipate that our SDAC dataset could foster the development of safe and reliable systems for autonomous driving.
