Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of machine-learning-based intelligent recruitment services. Along this line, a large number of emerging models have been proposed, achieving remarkable performance in various tasks, such as person-job fit, job classification and salary prediction. However, existing studies are usually domain/task specific, which significantly hinders the adaptation of models for different industries/tasks with limited training data. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel skill-aware prompt-based pretraining framework, namely RecruitPro, which is capable of learning unified representations on the recruitment data and adapting for various downstream tasks of intelligent recruitment services. To be specific, we first present a contextualized embedding model that is pretrained on a large-scale recruitment dataset. Then, we construct 13 downstream benchmark tasks that are representative in the recruitment process. Along this line, we propose a skill-aware prompt learning module to enhance the adaptability of the pretrained model on downstream tasks. This module includes a skill-related prompt, which is designed to explore key semantic information (i.e., skills) from recruitment text, and a task-related prompt, which is designed to bridge the gap between the pretrained model and different downstream tasks. Moreover, we propose a strategy for extracting potential skills to further improve the performance of our skill-aware prompt learning module. Finally, extensive experiments have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of RecruitPro. In addition, a case study has been presented to discuss the privacy preserving issue of our RecruitPro.
