 Prosthetic devices remain unaffordable to many patients in resource-constrained environments. The design process of personalized prosthetic devices is sophisticated and requires specialized equipment and trained professionals who may have limited availability. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the resources are frequently situated away from underserved communities, compounding the issue of accessibility. Lowering the barriers to accessing required equipment and minimizing the involvement of trained professionals in designing and manufacturing prosthetic devices can potentially minimize the required visits to the prosthetists and lower the associated costs. Traditional prosthetic and orthotic device creation methods can take up to several months. There are attempts to leverage advanced technologies to enhance the design process, but they require special equipment such as 3D scanners and MRI equipment in addition to the active involvement of specialists.
 This work proposes a computer vision method for creating a virtual model of the affected human limb. We also propose an automated approach for generating the socket from the virtual model and scaling other parts of the prosthetic device. The prosthetic device designed through the proposed process is realized via a 3D printer. We present a case study demonstrating the feasibility of our approach, using a mobile phone and open-source software to reconstruct a virtual representation of an upper limb and customize a prosthetic hand with minimal input from a specialist.
