Graphs have emerged as one of the most important and powerful data structures to perform content analysis in many fields. In this line of work, node classification is a classic task, which is generally performed using graph neural networks (GNNs). Unfortunately, regular GNNs cannot be well generalized into the real-world application scenario when the labeled nodes are few. To address this challenge, we propose a novel few-shot node classification model that leverages pseudo-labeling with graph active learning. We first provide a theoretical analysis to argue that extra unlabeled data benefit few-shot classification. Inspired by this, our model proceeds by performing multi-level data augmentation with consistency and contrastive regularizations for better semi-supervised pseudo-labeling, and further devising graph active learning to facilitate pseudo-label selection and improve model effectiveness. Extensive experiments on four public citation networks have demonstrated that our model can effectively improve node classification accuracy with considerably few labeled data, which significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines by large margins.
