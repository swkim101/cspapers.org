Super-resolution (SR) networks have been gradually applied to embedded devices with good-quality image reconstruction. However, the hardware performance and power efficiency are limited by a large number of algorithm parameters, computation complexity, and hardware resources, obstructing the development of a high-quality SR accelerator. This paper proposes an end-to-end platform with a lightweight super-resolution network (LSR) and an efficient, high-quality super-resolution architecture HDSuper, to perform algorithm-hardware co-design for the SR accelerator. For algorithm design, we employ depth-wise separable convolution and pixelshuffle to reduce network size and computation complexity by considering the hardware constraints. For hardware design, we provide a unified computing core (UCC) combined with an efficient flattening-and-allocation (F-A) mapping strategy to support various operators with high computational utilization. We adopt the patch training method to reduce the external memory access of the hardware architecture. Based on the evaluation, the proposed algorithm achieves high-quality image reconstruction with 37.44dB PSNR. Finally, we implement the image reconstruction in FPGA demonstration, achieving high-quality image reconstruction with 2.08W power consumption under the lowest hardware resources compared to the state-of-the-art works.
