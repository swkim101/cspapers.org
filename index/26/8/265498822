From image-text pairs, large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) learn to implicitly associate image regions with words, which prove effective for tasks like visual question answering. However, leveraging the learned association for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open- Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss. To balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation, we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to, we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. PnP-OVSS does not require any neural net-work training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over comparable baselines (+29.4% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +13.2% mIoU on Pascal Context, +14.0% mIoU on MS COCO, +2.4% mIoU on COCO Stuff) and even outper-forms most baselines that conduct additional network training on top of pretrained VLMs. Our codebase is at https://github.com/letitiabanana/PnP-OVSS.
