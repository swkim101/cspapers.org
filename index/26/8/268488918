This BOF is for Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) chapter leaders and participants from Oregon, Washington, California, and Nevada (the CSTA Western region) to come together, explore ideas for connecting and strengthening our chapters, and discuss possible opportunities for regional cooperation across chapters, such as a western regional conference. Our goals for this BOF are to build and strengthen relationships with other chapter leaders and members, share best practices from our chapters, and scope possible areas of cooperation. We'll document our shared learnings and write up a report to be sent to all regional chapters and the CSTA leadership, with the possibility of presenting our findings at the 2024 CSTA Chapter Leadership Summit to support other regions in developing similar models of regional cooperation. After a brief introduction, we'll engage in a jigsaw/networking activity, designed to get participants to know others from different CSTA chapters and to share expertise and experiences across these communities. We'll then have a structured, group discussion regarding the value and feasibility of a regional conference within the context of the goals and activities of local chapters and the national organization. We intend to include on line attendees in order to support K-12 teachers who are unable to attend conferences during a school year in person. CSTA is an organization run by teachers, for teachers. Our goal is to continue to grow the CS community to ensure every educator has a home. Learn more at https://csteachers.org/.
