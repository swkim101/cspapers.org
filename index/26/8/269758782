Do longitudinal studies reveal a skewed gender distribution among newborn babies depicted in Bollywood movies? Who dominates the speaking time in political conversations on 24x7 news networks in the United States-men or women? How does Twitter discourse on gender equality evolve when a woman dies in police custody in Iran after being arrested (reportedly) due to improper headscarf-wearing? What is the representation of women in divorce court proceedings in India? This broad talk, where cutting-edge AI intersects with social science research questions, encompasses a diverse array of studies that unveil gender bias in various forms. In this presentation, I will describe the substantive findings, social impact, methodological challenges, scope for multimodal investigations, and the novelties entailed in this research. I will conclude the talk with our findings on worrisome gender bias in several large language models.
