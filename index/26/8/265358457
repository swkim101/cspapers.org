 As populations increase and freshwater supplies decrease, adopting water- and energy-efficient irrigation practices is crucial, particularly in resource-constrained regions. Here, farmers are often unable to purchase the equipment used in precision irrigation, a practice that implements the automatic scheduling of irrigation events to achieve high efficiency. Currently, no irrigation methods exist that combine the automatic scheduling of irrigation events with the manual operation of valves, a common practice on low-income farms. This work introduces a design concept for an automatic scheduling and manual operation (AS-MO) tool that addresses the efficiency needs of resource-constrained farms and integrates into current manual practices. However, it is unknown how farmers would value such a tool. Through interviews and focus groups facilitated by a series of storyboards and a physical prototype, the proposed concept was evaluated by farmers and key market stakeholders in Kenya, Jordan, and Morocco. Results showed that farmers in Kenya and Jordan in particular valued the proposed AS-MO concept because they want increased efficiency on their farms but did not want to install automatic valves for cost and complexity concerns. A possible market was also found in Morocco, but a majority of interviewed farms preferred automatic valve operation due to large farm sizes. Interviewees provided feedback on how to improve the toolâ€™s design in future iterations. If adopted at scale, this AS-MO tool could increase efficiency on farms that otherwise cannot afford current precision irrigation technology, improving sustainable agriculture worldwide.
