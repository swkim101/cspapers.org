In the event of a disaster, many people post a lot of information on SNS that promotes or inhibits action we designate this information "behavioral facilitation information". Such information is likely to have various effects on user behavior. A wide variety of people browse SNSs, and different readers perceive the same information in different ways. Therefore, in this study, we focus on users' attributes which are personality traits, age, and gender, and analyze how different users perceive information that promotes behavior. Specifically, we extract behavioral facilitation information from SNSs at the time of a disaster using deep learning, and classify the information into four user's personality traits: "suggestion," "inhibition," "encouragement," and "wish." Then, we conduct an experiment in which subjects classified by user's attributes which are personality traits, age, and gender read and judge how they feel about behavioral facilitation information. We then analyze the results, to determine the relationship between the behavioral facilitation information and the reader's attributes.
