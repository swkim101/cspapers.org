Vision and language foundation models (VLMs) have showcased impressive capabilities in 2D scene understanding. However, their latent potential in elevating the understanding of 3D autonomous driving scenes remains untapped. In this paper, we propose VLM2Scene, which exploits the potential of VLMs to enhance 3D self-supervised representation learning through our proposed image-text-LiDAR contrastive learning strategy. Specifically, in the realm of autonomous driving scenes, the inherent sparsity of LiDAR point clouds poses a notable challenge for point-level contrastive learning methods. This method often grapples with limitations tied to a restricted receptive field and the presence of noisy points. To tackle this challenge, our approach emphasizes region-level learning, leveraging regional masks without semantics derived from the vision foundation model. This approach capitalizes on valuable contextual information to enhance the learning of point cloud representations. First, we introduce Region Caption Prompts to generate fine-grained language descriptions for the corresponding regions, utilizing the language foundation model. These region prompts then facilitate the establishment of positive and negative text-point pairs within the contrastive loss framework. Second, we propose a Region Semantic Concordance Regularization, which involves a semantic-filtered region learning and a region semantic assignment strategy. The former aims to filter the false negative samples based on the semantic distance, and the latter mitigates potential inaccuracies in pixel semantics, thereby enhancing overall semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on representative autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our self-supervised method significantly outperforms other counterparts.
