Relying only on behaviors that emerge from simple responsive controllers; swarms of robots have been shown capable of autonomously aggregate themselves or objects into clusters without any form of communication. We push these controllers to the limit, requiring robots to sort themselves or objects into different clusters. Based on a responsive controller that maps the current reading of a line-of-sight sensor to a pair of speeds for the robots' differential wheels, we demonstrate how multiple tasks instances can be accomplished by a robotic swarm. Using the dividing rectangles approach and physics simulation, a training step optimizes the parameters of the controller guided by a fitness function. We conducted a series of systematic trials in physics-based simulation and evaluate the performance in terms of dispersion and the ratio of clustered robots/objects. Across 20 trials where 30 robots cluster themselves into 3 groups, an average of 99.83% of them were correctly clustered into their group after 300 s. Across 50 trials where 15 robots cluster 30 objects into 3 groups, an average of 61.20%, 82.87%, and 97.73% of objects were correctly clustered into their group after 600 s, 900 s, and 1800 s, respectively. The object cluster behavior scales well while the aggregation does not, the latter due to the requirement of control tuning based on the number of robots.
