Previsualization, previs, is essential for film production, allowing cinematographic experiments and effective collaboration. However, traditional previs methods like 2D storyboarding and 3D animation require substantial time, cost, and technical expertise, posing challenges for indie filmmakers. We introduce CollageVis, a rapid previsualization tool using video collages. CollageVis enables filmmakers to create previs through two main user interfaces. First, it automatically segments actors from videos and assigns roles using name tags, color filters, and face swaps. Second, it positions video layers on a virtual stage and allows users to record shots using mobile as a proxy for a virtual camera. These features were developed based on formative interviews by reflecting indie filmmakers’ needs and working methods. We demonstrate the system’s capability by replicating seven film scenes and evaluate the system’s usability with six indie filmmakers. The findings indicate that CollageVis allows more flexible yet expressive previs creation for idea development and collaboration.
