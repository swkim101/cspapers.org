Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success; however, their increasing model size poses a challenge due to the widening gap between model size and hardware capacity. To address this, model compression techniques have been proposed, but existing compression methods struggle to effectively handle the significant parameter variations (activations and weights) within the model. Moreover, current variance-aware encoding solutions for compression introduce complex logic, leading to limited compression benefits and hardware efficiency. In this context, we present SPARK, a novel algorithm/architecture co-designed solution that utilizes variable-length data representation for local parameter value processing, offering low hardware overhead and high-performance gains. Our key insight is that the high-order part in quantized values are often sparse, allowing us to employ an identity bit to assign the appropriate encoding length, thereby eliminating redundant bit-length footprints. This reduction in data representation based on data characteristics enables a serialized structured data encoding scheme that seamlessly integrates with existing hardware accelerators, such as systolic arrays. We evaluate SPARK-based accelerators against some existing encoding-based accelerator, and our results demonstrate significant improvements. The SPARK-based accelerator achieves up to 4.65 Ã— speedup and 74.7% energy reduction, while maintaining superior model accuracy.
