Contemporary natural language processing (NLP) systems are based on corpora of annotated documents for training and evaluation. To extend NLP to documents from Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) we need annotation systems that can deal with structured elements like mathematical formulae, tables, and possibly even diagrams. Current linguistic annotation systems treat documents as word sequences and disregard the structure of complex document elements, and are therefore unsuited for STEM annotation as this very structure carries important syntactic and semantic information. We present the KAT system, a browser-based annotation tool for linguistic/semantic annotations in structured (XHTML5, i.e. HTML + MathML + SVG in XML serialization) documents. As KAT is parametric in the annotation ontology and represents annotations as RDF, it can easily be integrated into RDF-based corpus management systems; we present an integration into the CorTeX system.
