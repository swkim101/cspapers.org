Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to leverage the rich information from the source domain to enhance recommendation performance in the target domain. However, the data imbalance problem inherent across different domains compromises the effectiveness of CDR approaches, posing a significant challenge to CDR. Most current CDR methodologies focus on creating better user embeddings for the target domain, yet usually neglect the inconsistency in user activities due to data imbalance. As a result, the process of creating user embeddings tends to prioritize users with more frequent interactions and leave less active users underserved, leading these CDR methods to struggle in making accurate recommendations for those with fewer interactions. Such bias in creating embeddings reveals the fact that ''not all embeddings are created equal'' in CDR, which serves as the primary motivation of this study. Inspired by the recent development of contrastive learning, this paper proposes User-aware Contrastive Learning for Robust cross-domain recommendation (UCLR), enhancing the robustness of cross-domain recommendation. Specifically, our proposed method consists of two sub-modules: (i) pretrained global embedding, where the global user embeddings are pretrained across all the domains; (ii) contrastive dual-stream collaborative autoencoder, where more equal user embeddings are generated by optimizing contrastive loss with individualized temperatures. To further improve the performance of our method in each domain, we finetune the whole framework of UCLR based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Theoretically, our method is equipped with a provable convergence guarantee during the contrastive learning stage. Furthermore, we also conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
