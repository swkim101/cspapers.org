Chinese traditional opera (Xiqu) performers often experience skin problems due to the long-term use of heavy-metal-laden face paints. To explore the current skincare challenges encountered by Xiqu performers, we conducted an online survey (N=136) and semi-structured interviews (N=15) as a formative study. We found that incomplete makeup removal is the leading cause of human-induced skin problems, especially the difficulty in removing eye makeup. Therefore, we proposed EyeVis, a prototype that can visualize the residual eye makeup and record the time make-up was worn by Xiqu performers. We conducted a 7-day deployment study (N=12) to evaluate EyeVis. Results indicate that EyeVis helps to increase Xiqu performersâ€™ awareness about removing makeup, as well as boosting their confidence and security in skincare. Overall, this work also provides implications for studying the work of people who wear makeup on a daily basis, and helps to promote and preserve the intangible cultural heritage of practitioners.
