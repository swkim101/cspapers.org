Image matting is a fundamental technique in visual understanding and has become one of the most significant capabilities in mobile phones. Despite the development of mobile storage and computing power, achieving diverse mobile Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) applications remains a great challenge. To address this issue, we present an innovative demonstration of an automatic system called "Matting Moments" that enables automatic image editing based on matting models in different scenarios. Coupled with accurate and refined matting subjects, our system provides visual element editing abilities and backend services for distribution and recommendation that respond to emotional expressions. Our system comprises three components: 1) photo content structuring, 2) data-driven matting engine, and 3) AIGC functions for generation, which automatically achieve diverse photo beautification in the gallery. This system offers a unified framework that guides consumers to obtain intelligent recommendations with beautifully generated contents, helping them enjoy the moments and memories of their present life.
