We propose a nearly optimal algorithm that uses 2n 2 random parameters, O(n) memory space and O((nlog2n)loglogn) operations in a fixed arbitrary field in order to compute the rank and a basis for the null space of a structured n x n matrix X represented with O(n) parameters of its short generator, as well as to solve a linear system Xy = b or to determine its inconsistency. If rank X = n, the algorithm also computes det X and a short generator of X -I. The cost bounds cover correctness verification for the output but not the cost of the generation of random parameters. The algorithm gives a unified t reatment of various classes of structured matrices including ones of Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde and Cauchy types. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n 1.1 C o m p u t a t i o n s w i t h s t r u c t u r e d m a t r i c e s Computations with structured matrices is a classical subject with long history and is a major subject of computer algebra and applied linear algebra (cf. [4], [11], [17]-[19]). Such matrices are omnipresent in signal and image processing, sciences and engineering. The next table displays some best known structured matrices.
