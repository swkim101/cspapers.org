The integration of learning and reasoning is one of the key challenges in artificial intelligence and machine learning today. The area of Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) tackles this challenge by integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks. In our recent work, we provided an introduction to NeSy by drawing several parallels to another field that has a rich tradition in integrating learning and reasoning, namely Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI).
