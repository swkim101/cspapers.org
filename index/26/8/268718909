Cross-sensory interaction is a key aspect for multisensory recognition. Without cross-sensory interaction, artificial neural networks show inferior performance in multisensory recognition. On the contrary, the human brain has an inherently remarkable ability in multisensory recognition, which stems from the diverse neurons that exhibit distinct responses to sensory inputs, especially the multisensory neurons with multisensory responses hence enabling cross-sensory interaction. Based on this neuronal diversity, we propose a Neuronal Diversity inspired Multisensory Recognition Model (ND-MRM), which, similar to the brain, comprises unisensory neurons and multisensory neurons. To reflect the different responses characteristics of diverse neurons in the brain, special connection constraints are innovatively designed to regulate the features transmission in the ND-MRM. Leveraging this novel concept of neuronal diversity, our model is biologically plausible, enabling more effective recognition of multisensory information. To validate the performance of the proposed ND-MRM, we employ a multisensory emotion recognition task as a case study. The results demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art brain-inspired baselines on two datasets, proving the potential of brain-inspired methods for advancing multisensory interaction and recognition.
