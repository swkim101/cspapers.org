Causal inference in relational data should account for the non-IID nature of the data and the interference phenomenon, which occurs when a unit's outcome is influenced by the treatments or outcomes of others. Existing solutions to causal inference under interference consider either homogeneous influence from peers or specific heterogeneous influence contexts (e.g., local neighborhood structure). This thesis investigates causal reasoning in relational data and the automated discovery of heterogeneous causal effects under arbitrary heterogeneous peer influence contexts and effect modification.
