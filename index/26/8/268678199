Automated Chinese ancient character restoration (ACACR) remains a challenging task due to its historical significance and aesthetic complexity. Existing methods are constrained by non-professional masks and even overfitting when training on small-scale datasets, which hinder their interdisciplinary application to traditional fields. In this paper, we are proud to introduce the Chinese Ancient Rubbing and Manuscript Character Dataset (ARMCD), which consists of 15,553 real-world ancient single-character images with 42 rubbings and manuscripts, covering the works of over 200 calligraphy artists spanning from 200 to 1,800 AD. We are also dedicated to providing professional synthetic masks by extracting localized erosion from real eroded images. Moreover, we propose DiffACR (Diffusion model for automated Chinese Ancient Character Restoration), a diffusion-based method for the ACACR task. Specifically, we regard the synthesis of eroded images as a special form of cold diffusion on uneroded ones and extract the prior mask directly from the eroded images. Our experiments demonstrate that our method comprehensively outperforms most existing methods on the proposed ARMCD. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/lhl322001/DiffACR.
