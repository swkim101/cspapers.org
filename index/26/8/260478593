This 90-minute panel session will discuss recent and future developments in incorporating Computational Science and Engineering into the undergraduate curriculum. There is a companion session devoted to tools and techniques and so the focus here is on programs and courses.The panelists will demonstrate a clear uniformity of purpose but a wide variety of approaches to increasing the CSE experience of undergraduates in different types of schools.The schools represented vary from large state universities to small private liberal arts colleges and a medium-sized school with a strong engineering bias.The approaches adopted also differ. There are complete programs built largely from existing courses, specific courses that are added to established programs to allow a student to follow an emphasis in CSE. The introduction of CSE into existing programs through faculty advice and education has also been successful.Yet other approaches represented among the panelists are the introduction of multi-disciplinary team-taught project-based courses as a springboard for growing an undergraduate CSE program including undergraduate research projects. The incremental use of small add-on courses to supplement conventional mathematics offerings with some CSE content has also been used successfully.Another approach represented on the panel is the use of a particular vehicle --- in this case graphics and visualization --- to introduce key ideas of CSE into regular parts of the curriculum.The unifying theme of the panel --- the desire to improve undergraduate CSE education will be evident throughout. By presenting a wide variety of approaches to achieve this end, it is hoped that any audience participants who wish to create a CSE thread in their own programs will find some ideas to help them. Some of the practical and political issues will also be discussed in the various contexts.The program for the panel would allow each panelist a maximum of 10 minutes to outline their programs and approaches. The remaining 30 (or more) minutes would then be reserved for general discussion and questions and contributions from the audience.
