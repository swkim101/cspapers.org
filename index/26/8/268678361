Multi-Domain Face Anti-Spoofing (MD-FAS) is a practical setting that aims to update models on new domains using only novel data while ensuring that the knowledge acquired from previous domains is not forgotten.
Prior methods utilize the responses from models to represent the previous domain knowledge or map the different domains into separated feature spaces to prevent forgetting.
However, due to domain gaps, the responses of new data are not as accurate as those of previous data. 
Also, without the supervision of previous data, separated feature spaces might be destroyed by new domains while updating, leading to catastrophic forgetting.
Inspired by the challenges posed by the lack of previous data, we solve this issue from a new standpoint that generates hallucinated previous data for updating FAS model.
To this end, we propose a novel Domain-Hallucinated Updating (DHU) framework to facilitate the hallucination of data.
Specifically, Domain Information Explorer learns representative domain information of the previous domains. 
Then, Domain Information Hallucination module transfers the new domain data to pseudo-previous domain ones.
Moreover, Hallucinated Features Joint Learning module is proposed to asymmetrically align the new and pseudo-previous data for real samples via dual levels to learn more generalized features, promoting the results on all domains.
Our experimental results and visualizations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in terms of effectiveness.
