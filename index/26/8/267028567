Batteryless energy harvesting systems enable a wide array of new sensing, computation, and communication platforms untethered by power delivery or battery maintenance demands. Energy harvesters charge a buffer capacitor from an unreliable environmental source until enough energy is stored to guarantee a burst of operation despite changes in power input. Current platforms use a fixed-size buffer chosen at design time to meet constraints on charge time or application longevity, but static energy buffers are a poor fit for the highly volatile power sources found in real-world deployments: fixed buffers waste energy both as heat when they reach capacity during a power surplus and as leakage when they fail to charge the system during a power deficit. To maximize batteryless system performance in the face of highly dynamic input power, we propose REACT: a responsive buffering circuit which varies total capacitance according to net input power. REACT uses a variable capacitor bank to expand capacitance to capture incoming energy during a power surplus and reconfigures internal capacitors to reclaim additional energy from each capacitor as power input falls. Compared to fixed-capacity systems, REACT captures more energy, maximizes usable energy, and efficiently decouples system voltage from stored charge---enabling low-power and high-performance designs previously limited by ambient power. Our evaluation on real-world platforms shows that REACT eliminates the tradeoff between responsiveness, efficiency, and longevity, increasing the energy available for useful work by an average 25.6% over static buffers optimized for reactivity and capacity, improving event responsiveness by an average 7.7x without sacrificing capacity, and enabling programmer directed longevity guarantees.
