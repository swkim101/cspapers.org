In the past year, large language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm, demonstrating their potential as a transformative force in many domains including computing education. Computing education researchers have found that LLMs can solve most assessments in introductory programming courses, including both traditional code writing tasks and other popular tasks such as Parsons problems. As more and more students start to make use of LLMs, the question instructors might ask themselves is "what can I do?". We propose that one promising way forward is to integrate LLMs into teaching practice, providing all students with an equal opportunity to learn how to interact productively with LLMs as well as encounter and understand their limitations. In this workshop, we first present state-of-the-art research results on how to utilize LLMs in computing education practice, after which participants will take part in hands-on activities using LLMs. We end the workshop by brainstorming ideas with participants around adapting their classrooms to most effectively integrate LLMs while avoiding some common pitfalls.
