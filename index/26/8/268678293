Recent research has shown significant interest in image-based glass surface detection (GSD). However, detecting glass surfaces in dynamic scenes remains largely unexplored due to the lack of a high-quality dataset and an effective video glass surface detection (VGSD) method. In this paper, we propose the first VGSD approach. Our key observation is that reflections frequently appear on glass surfaces, but they change dynamically as the camera moves. Based on this observation, we propose to offset the excessive dependence on a single uncertainty reflection via joint modeling of temporal and spatial reflection cues. To this end, we propose the VGSD-Net with two novel modules: a Location-aware Reflection Extraction (LRE) module and a Context-enhanced Reflection Integration (CRI) module, for the position-aware reflection feature extraction and the spatial-temporal reflection cues integration, respectively. We have also created the first large-scale video glass surface dataset (VGSD-D), consisting of 19,166 image frames with accurately-annotated glass masks extracted from 297 videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VGSD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches adapted from related fields. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/fawnliu/VGSD.
