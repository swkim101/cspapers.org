This research focuses on the issue of single-image reflection removal (SIRR) in real-world conditions, examining it from two angles: the collection pipeline of real reflection pairs and the perception of real reflection locations. We devise an advanced reflection collection pipeline that is highly adaptable to a wide range of real-world reflection scenarios and incurs reduced costs in collecting large-scale aligned reflection pairs. In the process, we develop a large-scale, high-quality reflection dataset named Reflection Removal in the Wild (RRW). RRW contains over 14,950 high-resolution real-world reflection pairs, a dataset forty-five times larger than its predecessors. Regarding perception of reflection locations, we identify that numerous virtual reflection objects visible in reflection images are not present in the corresponding ground-truth images. This observation, drawn from the aligned pairs, leads us to conceive the Maximum Reflection Filter (MaxRF). The MaxRF could accurately and explicitly characterize reflection locations from pairs of images. Building upon this, we design a reflection location-aware cascaded framework, specifically tailored for SIRR. Powered by these innovative techniques, our solution achieves superior performance than current leading methods across multiple real-world benchmarks. Codes and datasets are available at here.
