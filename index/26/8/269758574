Cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly important for the modern economy. Prior literature focuses on aligning actor incentives to ensure the secure and efficient operation of cryptocurrencies against adversarial threats that are unobserved in the wild. In this work, we address the gap between the theory and practice of cryptocurrencies by advancing realistic approaches to analyze the economics and security of key cryptocurrency components: consensus mechanisms, transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs), and the application layer. We present novel models of these components that we evaluate both theoretically and using cryptocurrency clients. We augment our evaluation with the first evidence of an in-the-wild attack on a major cryptocurrency, highlighting our approach's practicality. Results contained in our work were adopted by cryptocurrency platforms that hold user assets worth over 300 billion.
