Significant investment of time and effort for language learning has prompted a growing interest in microlearning. While microlearning requires frequent participation in 3-to-10-minute learning sessions, the recent widespread of smart speakers in homes presents an opportunity to expand learning opportunities by proactively providing microlearning in daily life. However, such proactive provision can distract users. Despite the extensive research on proactive smart speakers and their opportune moments for proactive interactions, our understanding of opportune moments for more-than-one-minute interactions remains limited. This study aims to understand user perceptions and opportune moments for more-than-one-minute microlearning using proactive smart speakers at home. We first developed a proactive microlearning service through six pilot studies (n=29), and then conducted a three-week field study (n=28). We identified the key contextual factors relevant to opportune moments for microlearning of various durations, and discussed the design implications for proactive conversational microlearning services at home.
