Personality detection is a fundamental task for user psychology research. One of the biggest challenges in personality detection lies in the quantitative limitation of labeled data collected by completing the personality questionnaire, which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Most of the existing works are mainly devoted to learning the rich representations of posts based on labeled data. However, they still suffer from the inherent weakness of the amount limitation of labels, which potentially restricts the capability of the model to deal with unseen data. In this paper, we construct a heterogeneous personality graph for each labeled and unlabeled user and develop a novel psycholinguistic augmented graph neural network to detect personality in a semi-supervised manner, namely Semi-PerGCN. Specifically, our model first explores a supervised Personality Graph Neural Network (PGNN) to refine labeled user representation on the heterogeneous graph. For the remaining massive unlabeled users, we utilize the empirical psychological knowledge of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) lexicon for multi-view graph augmentation and perform unsupervised graph consistent constraints on the parameters shared PGNN. During the learning process of finite labeled users, noise-invariant learning on a large scale of unlabeled users is combined to enhance the generalization ability. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, Youtube, PAN2015, and MyPersonality demonstrate the effectiveness of our Semi-PerGCN in personality detection, especially in scenarios with limited labeled users.
