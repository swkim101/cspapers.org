This poster explores the potential of ChatGPT to replace the traditional approach of pair programming in introductory computer science courses. Traditionally, two students collaborate as a driver and a navigator, periodically switching roles. Now, a student can pair up with ChatGPT, which offers an innovative approach to pair programming. This exploratory activity, which emphasizes collaboration and communication, provides step-by-step instructions for effectively interacting with ChatGPT during pair programming. This poster reflects on the advantages and limitations of using ChatGPT in pair programming. The main advantages of using ChatGPT include rapid responses, syntax error-free code generation, and flexibility in handling incomplete pseudocode. The primary limitations include the coding generation style, redundancy in responses, and challenges in understanding the code. Despite the advantages, it may still be valuable to have students work with human partners in certain situations, particularly for learning purposes. This poster proposes that ChatGPT is an invaluable tool for enhancing productivity and emphasizes the importance of becoming proficient in its use during students' college years. It also provides insights into the effective utilization of ChatGPT in pair programming and its preparation for future careers in programming and related fields.
