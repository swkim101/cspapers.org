This paper presents clay-dough, a 3D printable ceramic material that is made from a mixture of stoneware clay and a biomaterial dough. While all clays shrink when they are fired at high temperatures, clay-dough enables more dramatic shrinkage due to the dough burning away. We developed three clay-dough recipes made from different ratios of clay-to-dough and characterized the properties of each recipe; ultimately correlating shrinkage, density, strength, and porosity to the amount of dough in the recipe. We then leveraged clay-doughâ€™s shrinkage in our material-oriented approach to create ceramic forms, where form is dictated by the pattern we load the clay-dough materials in for 3D printing. To exemplify this approach, we built a design space around basic cylindrical forms that change shape during the firing process into more complex forms and explored a range of non-cylindrical applications. Lastly, we reflect on the limitations and opportunities for clay-dough and material-centered research.
