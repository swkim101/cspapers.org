Social media has become a crucial conduit for the swift dissemination of information during global crises. However, this also paves the way for the manipulation of narratives by malicious actors. This research delves into the interaction dynamics between coordinated (malicious) entities and organic (regular) users on Twitter amidst the Gaza conflict. Through the analysis of approximately 3.5 million tweets from over 1.3 million users, our study uncovers that coordinated users significantly impact the information landscape, successfully disseminating their content across the network: a substantial fraction of their messages is adopted and shared by organic users. Furthermore, the study documents a progressive increase in organic users' engagement with coordinated content, which is paralleled by a discernible shift towards more emotionally polarized expressions in their subsequent communications. These results highlight the critical need for vigilance and a nuanced understanding of information manipulation on social media platforms.
