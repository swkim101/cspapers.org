An apparatus for cleaning a photosensitive member comprising a cleaning roller formed of foamed resin which contacts the member and a pressure plate held in compressing abutment against the roller so as to extend in the direction of its forward rotation at the point of contact therebetween. Any residual powder on the photosensitive member is removed by the roller and retained in the pores formed in the roller surface. The powder retained in the pores is expelled by the resilience of the compressed surface of the roller as it is restored upon release from the pressure plate. The cleaning apparatus also comprises a system for recovering powder that is expelled from the roller surface, and a rotating helical coil disposed in a conveyance path for preventing solidification of the powder and for facilitating its conveyance.
