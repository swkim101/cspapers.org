Domain generalized medical image segmentation requires models to learn from multiple source domains and generalize well to arbitrary unseen target domain. Such a task is both technically challenging and clinically practical, due to the domain shift problem (i.e., images are collected from different hospitals and scanners). Existing methods focused on either learning shape-invariant representation or reaching consensus among the source domains. An ideal generalized representation is supposed to show similar pattern responses within the same channel for cross-domain images.
However, to deal with the significant distribution discrepancy, the network tends to capture similar patterns by multiple channels, while different cross-domain patterns are also allowed to rest in the same channel. 
To address this issue, we propose to leverage channel-wise decoupled deep features as queries. With the aid of cross-attention mechanism, the long-range dependency between deep and shallow features can be fully mined via self-attention and then guides the learning of generalized representation. Besides, a relaxed deep whitening transformation is proposed to learn channel-wise decoupled features in a feasible way. The proposed decoupled fea-
ture query (DFQ) scheme can be seamlessly integrate into the Transformer segmentation model in an end-to-end manner. 
Extensive experiments show its state-of-the-art performance, notably outperforming the runner-up by 1.31% and 1.98% with DSC metric on generalized fundus and prostate benchmarks, respectively. Source code is available at https://github.com/BiQiWHU/DFQ.
