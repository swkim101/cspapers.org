Welcome to the 2014 ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA). The research papers in this year's conference reflect the breadth of today's software landscape. Anything and everything related to programming is fair game for OOPSLA: we have contributions related to object-oriented, functional, concurrent and distributed, web, mobile, and domain-specific programming systems. Further, the research results range from core theoretical foundations to practical languages, libraries, and tools to experimental studies. 
 
This year OOPSLA continued the two-phase selection process that was initiated for last year's conference, with the goal of improving the quality of accepted papers. In the first reviewing phase a set of papers was conditionally accepted, and all other papers were rejected. Authors of conditionally accepted papers were provided with the usual committee reviews along with a set of mandatory revisions. After two months, the authors provided a second submission. The second reviewing phase assessed how well the mandatory revisions were performed by the authors in order to determine the final accept/reject status of each paper. 
 
There were 186 submissions, 53 of which were conditionally accepted in the first phase. The intent and expectation was that the mandatory revisions could be adequately addressed within two months and hence that conditionally accepted papers would be accepted in the second phase. In the end, 52 papers were accepted for publication, resulting in a 28% acceptance rate. 
 
Of the 186 submissions, 16 included members of the Program Committee as co-authors. These papers were reviewed by a separate External Review Committee, using the same two-phase selection process described above. In the end, six of these submissions were accepted for publication.
