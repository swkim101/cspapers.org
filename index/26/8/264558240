The majority of existing work on sign language recognition encodes signed videos without explicitly acknowledging the phonological attributes of signs. Given that handshape is a vital parameter in sign languages, we explore the potential of handshape-aware sign language recognition. We augment the PHOENIX14T dataset with gloss-level handshape labels, resulting in the new PHOENIX14T-HS dataset. Two unique methods are proposed for handshape-inclusive sign language recognition: a single-encoder network and a dual-encoder network, complemented by a training strategy that simultaneously optimizes both the CTC loss and frame-level cross-entropy loss. The proposed methodology consistently outperforms the baseline performance. The dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/Este1le/slr_handshape.git.
