Ethical concerns regarding Artificial Intelligence technology have fueled discussions around the ethics training received by its designers. Training designers for ethical behaviour, understood as habitual application of ethical principles in any situation, can make a significant difference in the practice of research, development, and application of AI systems. Building on interdisciplinary knowledge and practical experience from computer science, moral psychology, and pedagogy, we propose a functional way to provide this training.
