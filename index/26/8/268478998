To inspire student engagement in middle school math, we explore the possibility of using generative AI to enhance the creativity of math learning. We present the Math IDE, a math education environment in which students learn about math concepts by building artifacts. We aimed to create a platform in which students can engage with mathematical concepts, create an artifact that embodies the math that they are learning about, and practice their high-level specification skills. In the current iteration of the Math IDE, students can create custom web pages by describing and demonstrating understanding of the math that is involved in the web page. In this short overview, we describe our process and discuss several open questions regarding the design and application of this novel method of math education.
