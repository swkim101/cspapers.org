Bio-inspired neural networks have the potential to advance our understanding of neural computation and improve the state-of-the-art of AI systems. Bio-electrical synapses directly transmit neural signals, by enabling fast current flow between neurons. In contrast, bio-chemical synapses transmit neural signals indirectly, through neurotransmitters. Prior work showed that interpretable dynamics for complex robotic control, can be achieved by using chemical synapses, within a sparse, bio-inspired architecture, called Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs). However, a comparison of these two synaptic models, within the same architecture, remains an unexplored area. In this work we aim to determine the impact of using chemical synapses compared to electrical synapses, in both sparse and all-to-all connected networks. We conduct experiments with autonomous lane-keeping through a photorealistic autonomous driving simulator to evaluate their performance under diverse conditions and in the presence of noise. The experiments highlight the substantial influence of the architectural and synaptic-model choices, respectively. Our results show that employing chemical synapses yields noticeable improvements compared to electrical synapses, and that NCPs lead to better results in both synaptic models.
