The detection of traversable regions on staircases and the physical modeling constitutes pivotal aspects of the mobility of legged robots. This paper presents an onboard framework tailored to the detection of traversable regions and the modeling of physical attributes of staircases by point cloud data. To mitigate the influence of illumination variations and the overfitting due to the dataset diversity, a series of data augmentations are introduced to enhance the training of the fundamental network. A curvature suppression cross-entropy(CSCE) loss is proposed to reduce the ambiguity of prediction on the boundary between traversable and non-traversable regions. Moreover, a measurement correction based on the pose estimation of stairs is introduced to calibrate the output of raw modeling that is influenced by tilted perspectives. Lastly, we collect a dataset pertaining to staircases and introduce new evaluation criteria. Through a series of rigorous experiments conducted on this dataset, we substantiate the superior accuracy and generalization capabilities of our proposed method.
