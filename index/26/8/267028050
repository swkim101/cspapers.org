Adversaries have been targeting unique identifiers to launch typo-squatting, mobile app squatting and even voice squatting attacks. Anecdotal evidence suggest that online social networks (OSNs) are also plagued with accounts that use similar usernames. This can be confusing to users but can also be exploited by adversaries. However, to date no study characterizes this problem on OSNs. In this work, we define the username squatting problem and design the first multi-faceted measurement study to characterize it on X. We develop a username generation tool (UsernameCrazy) to help us analyze hundreds of thousands of username variants derived from celebrity accounts. Our study reveals that thousands of squatted usernames have been suspended by X, while tens of thousands that still exist on the network are likely bots. Out of these, a large number share similar profile pictures and profile names to the original account signalling impersonation attempts. We found that squatted accounts are being mentioned by mistake in tweets hundreds of thousands of times and are even being prioritized in searches by the network's search recommendation algorithm exacerbating the negative impact squatted accounts can have in OSNs. We use our insights and take the first step to address this issue by designing a framework (SQUAD) that combines UsernameCrazy with a new classifier to efficiently detect suspicious squatted accounts. Our evaluation of SQUAD's prototype implementation shows that it can achieve 94% F1-score when trained on a small dataset.
