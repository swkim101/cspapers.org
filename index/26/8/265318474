Adaptive Channel Selection (ACS) scheme is an efficient method to improve the electronic counter countermeasures (ECCM) capability of radio devices against interferences from jammers in wireless communications. Thanks to adaptive operation, radio device could detect intelligently jammed channels in its operating spectrum and only select jamming-free channels for its communications. In this paper, we propose a novel ACS scheme for VHF/UHF tactical radio communications, called VU-ACS, consisting of a link quality evaluation method based on Wideband Spectrum Sensing (WBSS) and Bit-Error-Rate (BER) calculation for determining jamming-free channels, an algorithm to construct an Adaptive Channel Map (ACM) and select channels adaptively, an ACM sharing protocol and a synchronization protocol between radio devices. Simulation and testbed results show that our proposed scheme outperforms traditional channel selection model (T-CS). While VU-ACS retains the communication smoothly in scenarios with the effect of barrage jamming up to 70% of the whole communication frequency band, T-CS loses completely communications under those harsh interference conditions.
