Software development processes are usually modeled by manifestations of the software artifact at given stages in its evolution and the nature of the transformations being applied to it during these stages. Thus, the software process is purported to begin with a stage called something like requirements development, or in some cases with the even the earlier step of a feasibility study. Such models vary the ordering of process stages (eg., prototyping vs. a traditional waterfall vs. incremental building and releasing). Yet, in all such models the software process is bounded by those activities that initiate and terminate the development of a specific software product.
