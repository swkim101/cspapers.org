Program Wars is a web-based card game for teaching fundamental concepts of programming and cybersecurity. We propose Program Wars v.3.0, an extension to Program Wars v.2.0, to explore the effectiveness of teaching fundamental software engineering concepts using GBL. In Program Wars v.3.0, a player constructs card decks to complete three 'sprints' based on the specific requirements for the sprint. After playing a fixed number of turns, in which the player builds a pseudo-program, the player's program is tested for requirement completion and either a new sprint begins with additional requirements or the game ends. Program Warsv.3.0 differs from prior work by allowing the user to learn and practice software engineering principles in an engaging manner and within a shorter time frame than traditional methods.
