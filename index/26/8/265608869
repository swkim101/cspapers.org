Estimating the 3D structure of the human body from nat-ural scenes is afundamental aspect of visual perception. 3D human pose estimation is a vital step in advancing fields like AIGC and human-robot interaction, serving as a crucial tech-nique for understanding and interacting with human actions in real-world settings. However, the current datasets, often collected under single laboratory conditions using complex motion capture equipment and unvarying backgrounds, are insufficient. The absence of datasets on variable conditions is stalling the progress of this crucial task. To facilitate the development of 3D pose estimation, we present FreeMan, the first large-scale, multi-view dataset collected under the real-world conditions. FreeMan was captured by synchronizing 8 smartphones across diverse scenarios. It comprises 11M frames from 8000 sequences, viewed from different perspec-tives. These sequences cover 40 subjects across 10 different scenarios, each with varying lighting conditions. We have also established an semi-automated pipeline containing er-ror detection to reduce the workload of manual check and ensure precise annotation. We provide comprehensive eval-uation baselines for a range of tasks, underlining the sig-nificant challenges posed by FreeMan. Further evaluations of standard indoor/outdoor human sensing datasets reveal that FreeMan offers robust representation transferability in real and complex scenes.
