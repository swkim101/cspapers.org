The ability to plan and control robotic in-hand manipulation is challenged by several issues, including the required amount of prior knowledge of the system and the sophisticated physics that varies across different robot hands or even grasp instances. One of the most direct models of in-hand manipulation is the inverse Jacobian, which can directly map from the desired in-hand object motions to the required hand actuator controls. However, acquiring such inverse Jacobians without complex hand-object system models is typically infeasible. We present a method for controlling in-hand manipulation using inverse Jacobians that are self-identified by a particle filter-based estimation scheme that leverages the ability of underactuated hands to maintain a passively stable grasp during self-identification movements. This method requires no a priori knowledge of the specific hand-object system and learns the systemâ€™s inverse Jacobian through small exploratory motions. Our system approximates the underlying inverse Jacobian closely, which can be used to perform manipulation tasks across a range of objects successfully. With extensive experiments on a Yale Model O hand, we show that the proposed system can provide accurate in-hand manipulation of sub-millimeter precision and that the inverse Jacobian-based controller can support real-time manipulation control of up to 900Hz.
