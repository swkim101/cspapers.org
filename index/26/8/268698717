Technical support services get several thousand voice calls
every year. These calls vary across a range of technical issues
or maintenance requests for a suite of hardware and software
products. On receiving the call, a support agent creates a ser-
vice request artifact that contains her interpretation of the
customerâ€™s problem. This service request goes through the life
cycle of the problem remediation process with the resolution
also being recorded as part of the service request. It has been
empirically observed that the actual complaint voiced by the
customer is often different from the recorded interpretation
in the service request. The service request created by sup-
port agents runs the risk of missing key information elements
present in the customer voice records. In this paper, we build
a framework that taps into voice calls and uses unsupervised
and supervised learning methods to enrich the service requests
with additional information. The enriched data is then used
for automated problem resolution.
