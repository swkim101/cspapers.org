I worry over topics for the syllabus, fretting over demos and presentations. And yet, I always come back to the fact that most of what my students learn and remember from my course comes from the assignments. Great assignments are hard to dream up and time-consuming to develop. With that in mind, the Nifty Assignments session is all about promoting and sharing the ideas and concrete materials of successful assignments.
