The article proposes a new approach to reasoning about knowledge and strategies in multiagent systems. It emphasizes data, not agents, as the source of strategic knowledge. The approach brings together Armstrong's functional dependency expression from database theory, a data-informed knowledge modality based on a recent work by Baltag and van Benthem, and a newly proposed data-informed strategy modality. The main technical result is a sound and complete logical system that describes the interplay between these three logical operators.
