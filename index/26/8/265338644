In this paper, a miniature communicating terminal with Embedded artificial Intelligence capabilities for Internet of Things experiment is presented. This platform can communicate to terrestrial and satellite gateways using LoRaWan protocol. The terminal integrates multiple sensors and Machine Learning algorithms that can be executed on the low-power Microcontroller to detect patterns and provide meta-data to the network. A model of this terminal based on OMNET++ is presented to simulate a large scale deployment.
