This paper presents a general discussion of the use of fingerprints, especially fingerprinted data, Fingerprinting is classified in four orthogonal ways, and some illustrative examples are given. The basis for a statistical analysis of altered fingerprints is presented, along with an example simulation. The possibility of more subtle fingerprints is discussed.
