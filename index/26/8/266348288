Federated learning (FL) has attracted growing attention since it allows for privacy-preserving collaborative training on decentralized clients without explicitly uploading sensitive data to the central server. However, recent works have revealed that it still has the risk of exposing private data to adversaries. In this paper, we conduct reconstruction attacks and enhance inference attacks on various datasets to better understand that sharing trained classification model parameters to a central server is the main problem of privacy leakage in FL. To tackle this problem, a privacy-preserving image distribution sharing scheme with GAN (PPIDSG) is proposed, which consists of a block scrambling-based encryption algorithm, an image distribution sharing method, and local classification training. Specifically, our method can capture the distribution of a target image domain which is transformed by the block encryption algorithm, and upload generator parameters to avoid classifier sharing with negligible influence on model performance. Furthermore, we apply a feature extractor to motivate model utility and train it separately from the classifier. The extensive experimental results and security analyses demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme compared to other state-of-the-art defense methods.
