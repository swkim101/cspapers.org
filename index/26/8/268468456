Lack of diversity is a major challenge in CS education. One way to broaden participation and increase student success is the adoption of equitable pedagogical and grading practices. Lack of evaluation of such practices within the context of undergraduate CS education results in less adoption. This study is the first step in a broader project examining such practices and their impact on undergraduate CS students. Factors such as confidence and sense-of-belonging have been linked to increase students' success. In this study, we report on the evaluation of four practices commonly adopted in pursuit of equity, in terms of students' perceptions and how they impact students' sense-of-belonging, confidence, and performance in a computer science course. We report on students' feedback from a CS2 course in the Spring 2023 semester. Our results show that students valued these practices and perceived them as having a positive impact on their course experience in relation to these constructs. Students also reported that these practices gave them better control of their learning, allowed them to learn from their mistakes, and have a better understanding of the course content.
