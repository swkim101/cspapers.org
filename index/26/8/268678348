Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various fields, and two powerful techniques, feature normalization and attention mechanisms, have been widely used to enhance model performance. However, they are usually considered as two separate approaches or combined in a simplistic manner.
In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic relationship between feature normalization and attention mechanisms and propose an Efficient Attention module guided by Normalization, dubbed EAN. Instead of using costly fully-connected layers for attention learning, EAN leverages the strengths of feature normalization and incorporates an Attention Generation (AG) unit to re-calibrate features. The proposed AG unit exploits the normalization component as a measure of the importance of distinct features and generates an attention mask using GroupNorm, L2 Norm, and Adaptation operations. By employing a grouping, AG unit and aggregation strategy, EAN is established, offering a unified module that harnesses the advantages of both normalization and attention, while maintaining minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, EAN serves as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with classic backbone architectures. Extensive quantitative evaluations on various visual tasks demonstrate that EAN achieves highly competitive performance compared to the current state-of-the-art attention methods while sustaining lower model complexity.
