A connector as disclosed for connecting fluid passages through a flexible sheet material. The connector is appropriate for use in connecting the coolant lines of a personal cooling garment through a waterproof immersion suit or a chemical proof outer garment. The connector includes inside and outside connector blocks with matching faces that sandwich the sheet material between them. Fluid passages through the two blocks meet at respective ports in the matching faces and are joined by coupling sleeves extending through holes in the sheet material. O-rings around the ports seal the holes through the sheet material. A cap screw or the like secures the two blocks to one another. The connector is equipped with valve male fittings and male lock components of a standard connector system that is now used for personal cooling garments. This allows the use of the connector in conjunction with an existing and satisfactory "zero leak" connect and disconnect system.
