Computing ethics courses are generally considered essential in undergraduate programs, but there is limited research on the importance of their inclusion at the master's level. In this study, we extend research conducted by Dexter et al. in 2013 about the importance of ethics in master's programs. We surveyed Associate Chairs and Associate Deans of Graduate Studies representing 81 different computing programs in the United States. 72% of respondents shared that ethics should be required in master's computing programs. In contrast, only 46% of the 81 programs surveyed require any type of ethics course at the master's level. Our findings also uncover barriers to the inclusion of ethics at the master's level and propose strategies for alleviating these challenges.
