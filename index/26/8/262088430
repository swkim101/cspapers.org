A non-interference formulation ofMLS applicable to the Secure Ada Target (SAT) Abstract Model is developed. An analogous formulation is developed to handle the SAT type enforcement policy. Unwinding theorems are presented for both MLS and Multi-Domain Security (MDS) and the SAT Abstract Model is shown to satisfy both MLS and MDS. Generalizations and extensions are also considered.
