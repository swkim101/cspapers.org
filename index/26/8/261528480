It is our pleasure to present to you the Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB), taking place in Vienna, Austria. The annual VLDB Conference is the premier international venue for the dissemination and exchange of ideas in the broad area of data management, both in core database technology and the application of this technology to develop infrastructure for information systems. 
 
For the first time this year, the conference takes place on three days instead of three and a half. Each day starts out with a keynote, on Tuesday, September 25 by Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon.com, on Wednesday, September 26 by Eric Brewer, Professor at the University of California-Berkeley and Director of Intel Research Berkeley, and on Thursday, September 27 with the VLDB 10-year best paper award presentation. 
 
The program committee that selected the papers consisted of 74 members for the Core Database Technology track, 65 members for the Infrastructure for Information Systems track, 21 members for the Industrial, Applications, and Experience track, and 15 members for the Demonstrations track. We accepted all papers that the program committee recommended as being of VLDB quality without setting any a priori quotas. 
 
The conference received 668 submissions overall, including 594 to the three paper tracks. The Core Database technology track received 263 submissions out of which 46 (17.5%) were accepted; the Infrastructure for Information Systems track received 275 submissions out of which 45 (16.4%) were accepted; the Industrial, Applications, and Experience track received 56 submissions out of which 17 (30.4%) were accepted; and the Demonstrations track received 74 submissions out of which 29 (39.2%) were accepted. Compared to last year this shows that the community's rapid growth seems to be slowing: Submissions to the Core Database Technology track were down 21.3%, to the Infrastructure for Information Systems track 5.8%, to the Industrial, Applications, and Experience track 5.1%, and to the Demonstrations track 11.9%. 
 
VLDB 2007 participated in the rollover process from SIGMOD 2007, and we received 28 submissions through this process (the rollover numbers are included in the totals above). Rollover papers were due two weeks after the regular submission deadline to give the authors additional time to address the comments of the SIGMOD reviewers. The rollover papers were re-reviewed by their three original reviewers from SIGMOD 2007 with one additional reviewer from VLDB 2007, resulting in 26 additional rollover reviewers for the Core Database Technology track and 21 additional reviewers for the Infrastructure for Information Systems track. 17 papers out of the rollover submissions were accepted (60.7%). We thank the SIGMOD 2007 PC Chair, Beng Chin Ooi, for his support and advice during the rollover process, and we thank the 47 selected reviewers from SIGMOD 2007 for participating in this additional round of reviews. We offered 36 papers that were rejected from VLDB 2007 the option to participate in the rollover process to SIGMOD 2008.
