Graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems have become one of the mainstream trends due to the powerful learning ability from user behavior data. Understanding the user intents from behavior data is the key to recommender systems, which poses two basic requirements for GNN-based recommender systems. One is how to learn complex and diverse intents especially when the user behavior is usually inadequate in reality. The other is different behaviors have different intent distributions, so how to establish their relations for a more explainable recommender system. In this paper, we present the Intent-aware Recommendation via Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (IDCL), which simultaneously learns interpretable intents and behavior distributions over those intents. Specifically, we first model the user behavior data as a user-item-concept graph, and design a GNN based behavior disentangling module to learn the different intents. Then we propose the intent-wise contrastive learning to enhance the intent disentangling and meanwhile infer the behavior distributions. Finally, the coding rate reduction regularization is introduced to make the behaviors of different intents orthogonal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IDCL in terms of substantial improvement and the interpretability.
