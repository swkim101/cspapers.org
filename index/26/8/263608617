Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results for novel view synthesis. However, they depend on the repetitive use of a single-input single-output multilayer perceptron (SISO MLP) that maps 3D coordinates and view direction to the color and volume density in a sample-wise manner, which slows the rendering. We propose a multi-input multi-output NeRF (MIMO-NeRF) that reduces the number of MLPs running by replacing the SISO MLP with a MIMO MLP and conducting mappings in a group-wise manner. One notable challenge with this approach is that the color and volume density of each point can differ according to a choice of input coordinates in a group, which can lead to some notable ambiguity. We also propose a self-supervised learning method that regularizes the MIMO MLP with multiple fast reformulated MLPs to alleviate this ambiguity without using pretrained models. The results of a comprehensive experimental evaluation including comparative and ablation studies are presented to show that MIMO-NeRF obtains a good trade-off between speed and quality with a reasonable training time. We then demonstrate that MIMO-NeRF is compatible with and complementary to previous advancements in NeRFs by applying it to two representative fast NeRFs, i.e., a NeRF with a sampling network (DONeRF) and a NeRF with alternative representations (TensoRF). 1
