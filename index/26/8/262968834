We describe the design of a censorship-resistant system that employs a unique document storage mechanism. Newly published documents are dependent on the blocks of previously published documents. We call this dependency an entanglement. Entanglement makes replication of previously published content an intrinsic part of the publication process. Groups of files, called collections, can be published together and named in a host-independent manner. Individual documents within a collection can be securely updated in such a way that future readers of the collection see and tamper-check the updates. The system employs a self-policing network of servers designed to eject non-compliant servers and prevent them from doing more harm than good.
