Application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIP) has been widely used to speedup specific applications based on general-purpose processor (CPU) ISA-extension and scalar/vector units customization. However, as deep neural processing unit (NPU) becomes a dominant IP in nowadays system-on-chip (SoC) designs, the rich computational and memory resource of the NPUs integrated into advanced CPUs should also be utilized to achieve an even better application performance boost than vector/scalar compute-unit customization only. In this paper, we propose APPEND, a novel framework that tries to enrich the ASIP design methodology by taking the co-designing of both NPU and RISC-V CPU into consideration. To fully utilize and customize the resources of CPU and NPU, APPEND automatically (1) identifies the NPU-compatible kernels from the target application and partition the applications in between the NPU and RISC-V CPU core, (2) based on the application performance specification, applies the necessary hardware parameterization and customization based on the RISC-V CPU and NPU templates, and also (3) generates the extended NPU instructions to accelerate the critical and compatible kernels of the target application.
