We integrate the cascade-of-rejectors approach with the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HoG) features to achieve a fast and accurate human detection system. The features used in our system are HoGs of variable-size blocks that capture salient features of humans automatically. Using AdaBoost for feature selection, we identify the appropriate set of blocks, from a large set of possible blocks. In our system, we use the integral image representation and a rejection cascade which significantly speed up the computation. For a 320 Ã— 280 image, the system can process 5 to 30 frames per second depending on the density in which we scan the image, while maintaining an accuracy level similar to existing methods.
