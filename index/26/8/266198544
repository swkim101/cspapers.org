The axes of robots and robot-like systems (RLS) usually include e-motor-gearbox-arrangements for optimal connection of the elements. The characteristics of the drive system and thus also of the robot depend strongly on the gears. Different gearbox designs are available which differ in stiffness, efficiency and further properties. For an application-optimal design of RLS a uniform documentation and a comparability of gearbox concepts is a decisive factor. The application-optimal design is supported by an interdisciplinary approach between mechanical engineering and software design, guided by adequate product development methodology. The quite heterogeneous characterization of gearboxes for RLS which is currently the state of the art is a relevant obstacle in the flexible and optimal design of RLS. The paper shows the analysis of the gear structure with unified symbols for specific machine elements and contact types. The introduced method gives insight into the mechanical structure of the gearboxes. Similarities between gear types can thus be revealed. This also enables the classification of new developments in the state of the art. Moreover, the developed method for analyzing the gear structure can be used to determine the characteristics of gears. Examples for these characteristics are backlash, efficiency or stiffness. Specifically, the stiffness of gears can be synthesized by the force action of individual contacts and the individual phenomena that occur with them. The representation by individual phenomena also makes it possible to extend the calculation to include influencing parameters such as temperature that have not been sufficiently taken into account so far.
