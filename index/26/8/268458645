Equitable grading practices and flexible deadline policies have previously demonstrated positive student learning and well-being outcomes. In this poster, we contribute a framework for flexible extension policies that emphasize equitable grading. We then analyze extension requests and grades obtained by students in a Data Science course with a flexible extension policy. We present two research questions based on this data. RQ1: How does the length of an extension relate to student performance on the corresponding assignment? RQ2: How does student extension usage across the semester relate to students' learning of the content?
