Despite widespread recognition of its value and importance, accessibility tends to be interpreted as a niche topic by students in many User Interfaces and User Experience (UI/UX) courses. In response, we advocate for explicitly positioning accessibility as a fundamental building block in UI/UX education. We present one implementation of this via early inclusion of accessibility and inclusivity principles, supplemented by strategic reinforcement across course modules. Early student reception of this intervention has been positive.
