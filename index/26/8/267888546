This paper presents a collection of string algorithms that are at the core of several biological problems such as creating diagnostic probes, universal primers, or discovering potential drug targets. All these problems reduce to the task of finding a pattern that, with some error, occurs in one set of strings (the Closest String Problem) and does not occur in another set (Farthest String Problem). In this paper, we break down the problem into several subproblems and .prove the following results. 1. Both the Closest String Problem and the Farthest String Problem are NP-hard. 2. There is a PTAS for the Farthest String Problem based on a linear programming relaxation technique. 3. There is a polynomial-time ($ + l )-approximation algorithm for the problem of finding a string that is close to each string (rather than its substring) in a set for any small constant E > 0. Using this algorithm, we also provide an &cient heuristic algorithm for the Closest String Problem. 4. The problem of finding a string that is at least Hamming distance d from as many strings in a set as possible, cannot be approximated within nc in polynomial time for some fixed constant E unless NP = P. 5. There is a polynomial-time P-approximation for finding a string that is both the Closest String to one set, and the Farthest String from another set.
