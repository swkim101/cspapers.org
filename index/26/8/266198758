This paper presents a new approach to determine single and multiple simultaneous contact forces on a tendon-driven continuum robot (CR). The estimation is based solely on the proprioceptive tendon force and length sensors that are already present. Unlike for rigid-body robots, only indirect measurements of the external forces' deflection is available. The required full kinetostatic model, which is prone to local minima due to the unknown contacts, is solved with a particle filter. The method is validated by simulative studies and experimental investigations on a new robot setup for visual inspection of aircraft engines. The algorithm allows the estimation of single contacts with an error up to 4.43 mm or 2.9 % of the robot's length. Multiple contacts can only be correctly determined at the two distal of the three segments.
