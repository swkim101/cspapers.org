Simultaneous Coalition Structure Generation and Assignment (SCSGA) is an important research problem in multi-agent systems. Given n agents and m tasks, the aim of SCSGA is to form m disjoint coalitions of n agents such that between the coalitions and tasks there is a one-to-one mapping, which ensures each coalition is capable of accomplishing the assigned task. SCSGA with Multi-dimensional Features (SCSGA-MF) extends the problem by introducing a d-dimensional vector for each agent and task. We propose a heuristic algorithm called Multiple Distance Metric (MDM) approach to solve SCSGA-MF. Experimental results confirm that MDM produces near optimal solutions, while being feasible for large-scale inputs within a reasonable time frame.
