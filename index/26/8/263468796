We propose a method for synthesizing decentralized feedback controllers for a team of multiple heterogeneous agents navigating a known environment with obstacles. The controllers are designed to drive agents with limited team state information to goal sets while avoiding collisions and maintaining specified proximity constraints. The method, its successful application to nonholonomic agents in dynamic simulation, and its limitations are presented in this paper.
