Data Warehousing and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) are technologies for providing executives and managers with timely, integrated access to critical information from multiple, distributed, heterogeneous databases and other information sources for analysis and decision making activities.The ACM International Workshop on Data Warehousing and Online Analytical Processing (DOLAP) is an annual event that provides an international forum where both researchers and practitioners can share their findings in theoretical foundations, current methodologies, practical experiences, and new research directions in the areas of data warehousing and online analytical processing. The fifth DOLAP workshop was held this year in McLean, VA, USA.These proceedings contain the papers selected for presentation at the workshop. We received 22 submissions form 16 different countries. The submitted papers covered various aspects of Data Warehousing and OLAP including multidimensional modeling, materialized view selection, extract-transform-merge processes, view maintenance, temporal and object-oriented aspects of data warehouses, query languages for OLAP, query processing and optimization, indexing, and XML data warehouses. After careful review the program committee selected 11 papers for presentation at the workshop. The accepted papers were presented in three sessions: data warehouse conceptual modeling, data warehouse logical design, and data warehouse operation and query optimization.
