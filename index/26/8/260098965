Learning surface by neural implicit rendering has been a promising way for multi-view reconstruction in recent years. Existing neural surface reconstruction methods, such as NeuS [24] and VolSDF [32], can produce reliable meshes from multi-view posed images. Although they build a bridge between volume rendering and Signed Distance Function (SDF), the accuracy is still limited. In this paper, we argue that this limited accuracy is due to the bias of their volume rendering strategies, especially when the viewing direction is close to be tangent to the surface. We revise and provide an additional condition for the unbiased volume rendering. Following this analysis, we propose a new rendering method by scaling the SDF field with the angle between the viewing direction and the surface normal vector. Experiments on simulated data indicate that our rendering method reduces the bias of SDF-based volume rendering. Moreover, there still exists non-negligible bias when the learnable standard deviation of SDF is large at early stage, which means that it is hard to supervise the rendered depth with depth priors. Alternatively we supervise zero-level set with surface points obtained from a pre-trained Multi-View Stereo network. We evaluate our method on the DTU dataset and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-arts neural implicit surface methods without mask supervision.
