Multilingual Intent Detection and explore its different characteristics are major field of study for last few years. But, detection of intention dynamics from text or voice, especially in the Indian multilingual contexts, is a challenging task. So, my first research question is on intent detection and then I work on the application in Indian Multilingual Healthcare scenario. Speech dialogue systems are designed by a pre-defined set of intents to perform user specified tasks. Newer intentions may surface

over time that call for retraining. However, the newer intents may not be explicitly announced and need to be inferred dynamically.

Hence, here are two crucial jobs: (a) recognizing newly emergent intents; and (b) annotating the data of the new intents in order

to effectively retrain the underlying classifier. The tasks become specially challenging when a large number of new intents emerge

simultaneously and there is a limited budget of manual annotation. We develop MNID (Multiple Novel Intent Detection), a cluster

based framework that can identify multiple novel intents while optimized human annotation cost. Empirical findings on numerous

benchmark datasets (of varying sizes) show that MNID surpasses the baseline approaches in terms of accuracy and F1-score by wisely allocating the budget for annotation. We apply intent detection approach on different domains in Indian multilingual scenarios -

healthcare, finance etc. The creation of advanced NLU healthcare systems is threatened by the lack of data and technology constraints for resource-poor languages in developing nations like India. We evaluate the current state of several cutting-edge language models used in the healthcare with the goal of detecting query intents and corresponding entities. We conduct comprehensive trials on a

number of models different realistic contexts, and we investigate the practical relevance depending on budget and the availability of

data on English.
