To enable safe motion planning in a dynamic environment, it is vital to anticipate and predict object movements. In practice, however, an accurate object identification among multiple moving objects is extremely challenging, making it infeasible to accurately track and predict individual objects. Furthermore, even for a single object, its appearance can vary significantly due to external effects, such as occlusions, varying perspectives, or illumination changes. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent network architecture called a recurrent flow network that can infer the velocity of each cell and the probability of future occupancy from a sequence of occupancy grids which we refer to as an occupancy flow. The parameters of the recurrent flow network are optimized using Bayesian optimization. The proposed method outperforms three baseline optical flow methods, Lucas-Kanade, Lucas-Kanade with Tikhonov regularization, and HornSchunck methods, and a Bayesian occupancy grid filter in terms of both prediction accuracy and robustness to noise.
