We are delighted to welcome you to the 24th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2015), held in Melbourne from October 19--23, 2015. CIKM is now well-established as a leading venue for bringing together researchers from across the Database, Information Retrieval, and Knowledge Management communities. 
 
Continuing the pattern of previous years, we received a large number of high-quality submissions in all three tracks, in both full- and short-paper categories. As a result, we are confident that CIKM 2015 has succeeded in creating an outstanding technical program including research paper presentations; short-paper presentations during the poster session; plenary talks; and an engaging Industry Track arranged by the Industry Track Chairs. In total, we received 646 fullpaper (10-page) submissions and 276 short-paper (4-page) submissions, which were reviewed and discussed by 88 area chairs, 471 program committee members, and a further 145 expert external reviewers. 
 
We accepted 165 full papers (26%) and 69 short papers (25%). The acceptance statistics per track were as follows: Databases, 35/129 full papers and 6/37 short papers; Information Retrieval, 43/171 full papers and 27/101 short papers; and Knowledge Management, 87/346 papers and 36/138 short papers. Two of the Knowledge Management short papers were withdrawn by their authors prior to the proceedings being finalized. Our work was greatly eased by the support provided by the Microsoft CMT service, and we thank the CMT team for their assistance.
