The de-occlusion problem, involving extracting clear background images by removing foreground occlusions, holds significant practical importance but poses considerable challenges. Most current research predominantly focuses on generating discrete images from calibrated camera arrays, but this approach often struggles with dense occlusions and fast motions due to limited perspectives and motion blur. To overcome these limitations, an effective solution requires the integration of multi-view visual information. The spike camera, as an innovative neuromorphic sensor, shows promise with its ultra-high temporal resolution and dynamic range. In this study, we propose a novel approach that utilizes a single spike camera for continuous multi-view imaging to address occlusion removal. By rapidly moving the spike camera, we capture a dense stream of spikes from occluded scenes. Our model, SpkOccNet, processes these spikes by integrating multi-view spatial-temporal information via long-short-window feature extractor (LSW) and employs a novel cross-view mutual attention-based module (CVA) for effective fusion and refinement. Additionally, to facilitate research in occlusion removal, we introduce the S-OCC dataset, which consists of real-world spike-based data. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and generalization capabilities of our model in effectively removing dense occlusions across diverse scenes.
