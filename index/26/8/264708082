The alternative wire technique attempts to replace a target wire by another wire without charging the logic functionality. In this paper, we propose two new transformations of replacing wires. One transformation simultaneously replaces multiple input wires of a gate by a new set of input wires and the other performs gate decompostion during the alternative wire process. To accomplish such complex transformations, we discuss some theoretical foundations for replacing multiple wires. Understanding how wires/gates can be replaced by other wires/gates allows us to speedup the process tremendously.
