Graph neural networks (GNNs) play a crucial role in various graph applications, such as social science, biology, and molecular chemistry. Despite their popularity, GNNs are still vulnerable to intellectual property threats. Previous studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of GNN models to model extraction attacks, where attackers steal the functionality of GNNs by sending queries and obtaining model responses. However, existing model extraction attacks often assume that the attacker has access to specific information about the victim modelâ€™s training data, including node attributes, connections, and the shadow dataset. This assumption is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose S TEAL - GNN, the first data-free model extraction attack framework against GNNs. S TEAL GNN advances prior GNN extraction attacks in three key aspects: 1) It is completely data-free , as it does not require actual node features or graph structures to extract GNN models. 2) It constitutes a full-rank attack that can be applied to node classification and link prediction tasks, posing significant intellectual property threats across a wide range of graph applications. 3) It can handle the most challenging hard-label attack setting, where the attacker possesses no knowledge about the target GNN model and can only obtain predicted labels through querying the victim model. Our experimental results on four benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of S TEAL GNN in attacking representative GNN models.
