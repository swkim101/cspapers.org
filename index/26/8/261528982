It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2014 ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems -- ASPLOS-XIX in Salt Lake City, UT on March 1-5, 2014. 
 
This year's ASPLOS finds a home in beautiful Salt Lake City, a thriving technology hub that is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and a handful of geologically diverse national parks. In fact, the large number of technology start-ups in the Salt Lake valley has inspired the moniker "Silicon Slopes". Visitors can choose among a wide array of activities while in town -- skiing or snowboarding in one of eight nearby world-class ski resorts, hiking on numerous local trails, visiting Historic Temple Square in downtown, or taking the five-hour drive to national parks in Utah and surrounding states. As the site of the 2002 Winter Olympic games, there are numerous Olympic class facilities nearby. The conference banquet will be held at the Olympic Oval, site of both the long and short track speed skating events. Apollo Anton Ohno appeared on the world stage as the gold medalist in the 1500 meter short-track event in the 2002 Olympics. We hope the banquet will not only provide the usual social opportunity to mingle with colleagues but also give you all the chance to feel some of the spirit that lies behind the Winter Olympic Games.
