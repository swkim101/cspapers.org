It is widely recognized that combining multiple classification or regression models typically provides superior results compared to using a single, well-tuned model. However, there are no well known approaches to combining multiple non-hierarchical clusterings. The idea of combining cluster labelings without accessing the original features leads us to a general knowledge reuse framework that we call <i>cluster ensembles</i>. Our contribution in this paper is to formally define the cluster ensemble problem as an optimization problem and to propose three effective and efficient combiners for solving it based on a hypergraph model. Results on synthetic as well as real data sets are given to show that cluster ensembles can (i) improve quality and robustness, and (ii) enable distributed clustering.
