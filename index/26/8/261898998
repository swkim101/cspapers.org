Analytical placement is proven to be effective in global placement. The differentiability of wirelength models is very critical to gradient-based numerical optimization. Most previous works approximate the non-smooth half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) model with various differentiable functions. In this paper, we propose a new differentiable wirelength model using the Moreau envelope to approximate HPWL. By combining the state-of-the-art electrostatic-based placement algorithm, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve up to 5.4% HPWL improvement and more than 1% on average compared to the most widely-used nonlinear wirelength model.
