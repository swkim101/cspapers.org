Enhancing low-light videos in a supervised style presents a set of challenges, including limited data diversity, misalignment, and the domain gap introduced through the dataset construction pipeline. Our paper tackles these challenges by constructing a self-learned enhancement approach that gets rid of the reliance on any external training data. The challenge of self-supervised learning lies in fitting high-quality signal representations solely from input signals. Our work designs a bottleneck neural representation mechanism that extracts those signals. More in detail, we encode the frame-wise representation with a compact deep embedding and utilize a neural network to parameterize the video-level manifold consistently. Then, an entropy constraint is applied to the enhanced results based on the adjacent spatial-temporal context to filter out the degraded visual signals, e.g. noise and frame inconsistency. Last, a novel Chromatic Retinex decomposition is proposed to effectively align the reflectance distribution temporally. It benefits the entropy control on different components of each frame and facilitates noise-to-noise training, successfully suppressing the temporal flicker. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and superior effectiveness of our proposed method. Our project is publicly available at: https://huangerbai.github.io/SLBNR/.
