We propose a novel stereo-confidence that can be measured externally to various stereo-matching networks, offering an alternative input modality choice of the cost volume for learning-based approaches, especially in safety-critical systems.
Grounded in the foundational concepts of disparity definition and the disparity plane sweep, the proposed stereo-confidence method is built upon the idea that any shift in a stereo-image pair should be updated in a corresponding amount shift in the disparity map. 
Based on this idea, the proposed stereo-confidence method can be summarized in three folds.
1) Using the disparity plane sweep, multiple disparity maps can be obtained and treated as a 3-D volume (predicted disparity volume), like the cost volume is constructed. 
2) One of these disparity maps serves as an anchor, allowing us to define a desirable (or ideal) disparity profile at every spatial point.
3) By comparing the desirable and predicted disparity profiles, we can quantify the level of matching ambiguity between left and right images for confidence measurement. 
Extensive experimental results using various stereo-matching networks and datasets demonstrate that the proposed stereo-confidence method not only shows competitive performance on its own but also consistent performance improvements when it is used as an input modality for learning-based stereo-confidence methods.
