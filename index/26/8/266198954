Rescue robots require versatility and the capability to operate in various environments to carry out a diverse set of tasks effectively. The eccentric paddle (ePaddle) mechanism stands out for its high efficiency and adaptability. Generally, it is designed as a quadruped robot with a combined structure for fully-actuated control, this approach is often both inefficient and inflexible due to the requirement for repeated front-to-back paths. Unlike the fully-actuated controller that assume torso is fixed, this study proposes an under-actuated controller, consisting of a single ePaddle mechanism and a free torso for more efficient and flexible movement. Inspired by human gait, precision walking, and non-precision walking are introduced to discuss the stability of zero dynamics. Additionally, the stability condition is presented and demonstrated by numerical simulation. Since this control is based on robot dynamics, it has a high fault-tolerance and benefited from its dynamics attractor. The concept of under-actuated controller we proposed in this study is not only applicable to the ePaddle mechanism, but also to other under-actuated legged locomotion models.
