Estimating 3D full-body pose from sparse sensor data is a pivotal technique employed for the reconstruction of realistic human motions in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. However, translating sparse sensor signals into comprehensive human motion remains a challenge since the sparsely distributed sensors in common VR systems fail to capture the motion of full human body. In this paper, we use well-designed Body Pose Graph (BPG) to represent the human body and translate the challenge into a prediction problem of graph missing nodes. Then, we propose a novel full-body motion reconstruction framework based on BPG. To establish BPG, nodes are initially endowed with features extracted from sparse sensor signals. Features from identifiable joint nodes across diverse sensors are amalgamated and processed from both temporal and spatial perspectives. Temporal dynamics are captured using the Temporal Pyramid Structure, while spatial relations in joint movements inform the spatial attributes. The resultant features serve as the foundational elements of the BPG nodes. To further refine the BPG, node features are updated through a graph neural network that incorporates edge reflecting varying joint relations. Our method's effectiveness is evidenced by the attained state-of-the-art performance, particularly in lower body motion, outperforming other baseline methods. Additionally, an ablation study validates the efficacy of each module in our proposed framework.
