Considering that the plasmonic properties of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) are strongly influenced by their dielectric environment, comprehension and manipulation of this interplay are crucial for the design and optimization of functional plasmonic systems. In this study, the plasmonic behavior of silver nanoparticles encapsulated in diverse copolymer dielectric environments was investigated, focusing on the analysis of the emerging localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) through both experimental and theoretical approaches. Specifically, two series of nanostructured silver ultrathin films were deposited via magnetron sputtering on heated Corning Glass substrates at 330 °C and 420 °C, respectively, resulting in the formation of self-assembled NPs of various sizes and distributions. Subsequently, three different polymeric layers were spin-coated on top of the silver NPs. Optical and structural characterization were carried out by means of UV–Vis spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, respectively. Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) was employed to study the LSPRs theoretically. The polymeric environment consistently induced a red shift as well as various alterations in the LSPR amplitude, suggesting the potential tunability of the system.
