Node-level graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalous nodes from graph-structured data in various domains such as medicine, social networks, and e-commerce. However, challenges have arisen due to the diversity of anomalies and the dearth of labeled data. Existing methodologies - reconstruction-based and contrastive learning - while effective, often suffer from efficiency issues, stemming from their complex objectives and elaborate modules. To improve the efficiency of GAD, we introduce a simple method termed PREprocessing and Matching (PREM for short). Our approach streamlines GAD, reducing time and memory consumption while maintaining powerful anomaly detection capabilities. Comprising two modules - a pre-processing module and an ego-neighbor matching module - PREM eliminates the necessity for message-passing propagation during training, and employs a simple contrastive loss, leading to considerable reductions in training time and memory usage. Moreover, our method demonstrated robustness and effectiveness in five datasets. Notably, when validated on the ACM dataset, PREM achieved a 5% improvement in AUC, a 9-fold increase in training speed, and sharply reduce memory usage compared to the most efficient baseline.
