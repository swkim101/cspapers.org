EdBoard is an educational breadboard designed to facilitate early learning of physical computing in children. We designed EdBoard's curriculum based on constructionist pedagogy, and our goal is to create an engaging and interactive learning environment for children. The EdBoard curriculum comprises three components: story booklets, circuit cards, and paper builders. These elements together foster an engaging and interactive learning experience for children. These booklets provide children with a narrative context that encourages pretend play. Circuit cards can be inserted into the EdBoard, helping children understand the positions of different components within the circuit. Paper builders empower children to create functional and interactive artifacts without the EdBoard. These hands-on activities reinforce children's understanding of physical computing concepts. During the demo, we will guide the audience through the EdBoard's curriculum design, providing insights into how these elements come together to facilitate learning. Attendees will have the opportunity to experience EdBoard as an educational tool. Furthermore, we invite open discussions on the potential of the EdBoard platform to enhance K-12 computer science education. We believe that EdBoard could play an important role in making computer science education more accessible and engaging for children.
