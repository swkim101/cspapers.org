Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) are widely considered state-of-the-art for collaborative filtering. Although several GCN-based methods have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they can be computationally expensive and time-consuming to train if too many layers are created. However, since the linear GCN model can be interpreted as a differential equation, it is possible to transfer it to an ODE problem. This inspired us to address the computational limitations of GCN-based models by designing a simple and efficient NODE-based model that can skip some GCN layers to reach the final state, thus avoiding the need to create many layers. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation-based method for Collaborative Filtering (GODE-CF). This method estimates the final embedding by utilizing the information captured by one or two GCN layers. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive baselines, including GCN-based models and other state-of-the-art CF methods. Notably, our proposed GODE-CF model has several advantages over traditional GCN-based models. It is simple, efficient, and has a fast training time, making it a practical choice for real-world situations.
