It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 25th International World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2016. For more than two decades, WWW has been the premier venue for researchers, academics, businesses, and standard bodies to come together and discuss latest updates on the state and evolutionary path of the Web. The conference program of WWW 2016 consists of 11 tracks for refereed research papers, as well as a poster track, a demonstration track, a developers track, an industry track, a Ph.D. symposium track, panels, tutorials, workshops, and a W3C track. Several co-located and special events will also be part of the general program. As in previous years, updates and changes were made to ensure that track topics correctly reflect the key research areas of interest in the WWW community. 
 
The research tracks are: 
Behavioral Analysis and Personalization 
Content Analysis 
Crowdsourcing Systems and Social Media 
Economics and Markets 
Mobility 
Security and Privacy 
Semantics and Big Data 
Social Networks and Graph Analysis 
Web Mining 
Web Science 
Web Search Systems and Applications 
 
 
 
The research tracks attracted submissions from all over the world. Submissions were rigorously reviewed, with each paper receiving at least three reviews. During a discussion phase, reviewers and track chairs discussed reviews in detail. For consistency across tracks, final decisions on papers were made at a face-toface PC meeting of all track chairs and the PC chairs. Of the 727 papers submitted to the research tracks, 115 were accepted for an acceptance rate of less than 16%.
