Conventional commonsense knowledge graph completion (CKGC) methods provide inadequate sequence when fine-tuning or generating stages and incorporate full fine-tuning, which fail to align with the autoregressive model's pre-training patterns and have insufficient parameter efficiency. Moreover, decoding through beam or greedy search produces low diversity and high similarity in generated tail entities. Hence, we resort to prefix-tuning and propose a lightweight, effective pipeline to enhance the quality and diversity of extracted commonsense knowledge. Precisely, we measure head entity similarity to yield and then concatenate top-k tuples before each target tuple for prefix-tuning the source LM, thereby improving the efficiency and speed for pretrained models; then, we design a penalty-tailored diverse beam search (p-DBS) for decoding tail entities, producing a greater quantity and diversity of generated commonsense tuples; besides, a filter strategy is utilized to filter out invalid commonsense knowledge. Through extensive automatic evaluations, including ChatGPT scoring, our method can extract diverse, novel, and accurate commonsense knowledge (CK).
