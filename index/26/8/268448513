Colab is a frictionless, hosted Jupyter notebook that combines text, code, and outputs into a single document. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code using the latest ML accelerators (GPU/TPUs) through the browser, no setup required. It is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education, and serves over 10 million active users. Colab is used extensively for teaching computer science and machine learning, giving equitable access to expensive resources and AI/ML instruction to students around the world, regardless of background. As one professor stated: ''There's an equity aspect. Not everyone has a high-end laptop. Being able to say everyone has the same computing experience and they all have access to the same resources and they can start using them right away, it allows us to find more talent randomly distributed around our student population. Colab has been the best solution so far.'' Additionally, Google Colab partners with Google DeepMind to launch innovative AI coding features and models to the public, giving users the ability to author code with natural language, a much simpler experience for writing code. We are the team who builds Colab, and would love to demo our latest features, including Google Classroom integration and AI coding using Gemini, Google's latest foundation AI model. We hope to make attendees aware of these features and have them give us feedback on their usefulness and impact on the process of teaching computer science and machine learning.
