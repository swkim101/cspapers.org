Average age of the population tends to increase and the number of people requiring care intensive medical monitoring is not small. This increases overall cost of medical care. Therefore, partially replacing the assistance of nursing staff by small health surveillance and communication equipments like sensors, networks, monitoring software could be cost effective and would also increase life standard. The objective is to develop and implement innovative solutions based on information technologies and wireless communication for the benefit of those needing medical permanence. Recent advances in technology have led to the development of small, intelligent, wearable sensors capable of remotely performing critical health monitoring tasks and then transmitting patient's data back to health care centers over wireless medium. Such wireless health monitoring platforms aim to continuously monitor mobile patients needing permanent surveillance.
