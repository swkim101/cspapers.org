Due to its effect on the success rate of a quantum circuit, quantum layout synthesis is a crucial step for circuit compilation. As such, having a layout synthesis tool that provides high solution quality is important to maximize circuit performance and fidelity for NISQ application. Previous heuristic approaches have been shown to be far from optimal when evaluated on known-optimal benchmarks. Alternatively, exact layout synthesis tools can generate optimal results with the aid of constraint solvers but generally suffer from scalability issues because of inefficient encodings and slow optimization methods. In this paper, we propose a scalable optimal layout synthesis tool that improves upon previous works, through a more succinct problem formulation as well as better encoding techniques. Additionally, we implement a depth and SWAP count optimization feature that performs iterative refinement under a fixed time budget. Experimental results show that for depth optimization, our tool can achieve a 692× speedup over the state-of-the-art optimal layout synthesis, and for SWAP optimization, we can obtain a 6,957× speedup on average. Compared to a leading heuristic-based synthesizer, for depth optimization, we can solve circuits consisting of 54 program qubits and 1726 gates within 11 hours with an 18× depth reduction and by 12× SWAP count reduction on average.
