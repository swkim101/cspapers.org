In this paper, we show that utilizing multiple protocols offers a unique opportunity to improve IP alias resolution and dual-stack inference substantially. Our key observation is that prevalent protocols, e.g., SSH and BGP, reply to unsolicited requests with a set of values that can be combined to form a unique device identifier. More importantly, this is possible by just completing the TCP hand-shake. Our empirical study shows that utilizing readily available scans and our active measurements can double the discovered IPv4 alias sets and more than 30Ã— the dual-stack sets compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. We provide insights into our method's accuracy and performance compared to popular techniques.
