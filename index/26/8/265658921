In this paper, we make a bold attempt toward an ambitious task: given a pre-trained classifier, we aim to reconstruct an image generator, without relying on any data samples. From a black-box perspective, this challenge seems intractable, since it inevitably involves identifying the inverse function for a classifier, which is, by nature, an information extraction process. As such, we resort to leveraging the knowledge encapsulated within the parameters of the neural network. Grounded on the theory of Maximum-Margin Bias of gradient descent, we propose a novel learning paradigm, in which the generator is trained to ensure that the convergence conditions of the network parameters are satisfied over the generated distribution of the samples. Empirical validation from various image generation tasks substantiates the efficacy of our strategy.
