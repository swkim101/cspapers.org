Fraud detection on multi-relation graphs aims to identify fraudsters in graphs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models leverage graph structures to pass messages from neighbors to the target nodes, thereby enriching the representations of those target nodes. However, feature and structural inconsistency in the graph, owing to fraudsters' camouflage behaviors, diminish the suspiciousness of fraud nodes which hinders the effectiveness of GNN-based models. In this work, we propose DiG-In-GNN, Discriminative Feature Guided GNN against Inconsistency, to dig into graphs for fraudsters. Specifically, we use multi-scale contrastive learning from the perspective of the neighborhood subgraph where the target node is located to generate guidance nodes to cope with the feature inconsistency. Then, guided by the guidance nodes, we conduct fine-grained neighbor selection through reinforcement learning for each neighbor node to precisely filter nodes that can enhance the message passing and therefore alleviate structural inconsistency. Finally, the two modules are integrated together to obtain discriminable representations of the nodes. Experiments on three fraud detection datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method DiG-In-GNN, which obtains up to 20.73% improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.
