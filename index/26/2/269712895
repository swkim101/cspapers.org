Entity disambiguation is one of the most important natural language tasks to identify entities behind ambiguous surface mentions within a knowledge base. Although many recent studies apply deep learning to achieve decent results, they need exhausting pre-training and mediocre recall in the retrieval stage. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, eXtreme Multi-label Ranking for Entity Disambiguation (XMRED), to address this challenge. An efficient zero-shot entity retriever with auxiliary data is first pre-trained to recall relevant entities based on linear models. Specifically, the retrieval process can be considered as an extreme multi-label ranking (XMR) task. Entities are first clustered at different scales to form a label tree, thereby learning multi-scale entity retrievers over the label tree with high recall. Moreover, XMRED applies deep cross-encoder as a re-ranker to achieve high precision based on high-quality candidates. Extensive experimental results based on the AIDA-CoNLL benchmark and five zero-shot testing datasets demonstrate that XMRED obtains 98% and over 95% recall scores for in-domain and zero-shot datasets with top-10 retrieved entities. With a deep cross-encoder as the re-ranker, XMRED further outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 1.74% in In-KB micro-F1 scores on average with a significant improvement on the training efficiency from days to 3.48 hours. In addition, XMRED also beats the state-of-the-art for page-level document retrieval by 2.38% in accuracy and 1.90% in recall@5.
