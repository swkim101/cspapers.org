We present an extensive study of surrogate losses for structured prediction supported by H -consistency bounds . These are recently introduced guarantees that are more relevant to learning than Bayes-consistency, since they are not asymptotic and since they take into account the hypothesis set H used. We ﬁrst show that no non-trivial H -consistency bound can be derived for widely used surrogate structured prediction losses. We then deﬁne several new families of surrogate losses, including structured comp-sum losses and structured constrained losses , for which we prove H -consistency bounds and thus Bayes-consistency. These loss functions readily lead to new structured prediction algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, based on their minimization. We describe efﬁcient algorithms for minimizing several of these surrogate losses, including a new structured logistic loss .
