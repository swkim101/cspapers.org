We analyze the emerging trends from research on multi-agent interaction protocols, on workflows and on business processes. We propose a definition of commitment-based interaction protocols, characterized by the decoupling of the constitutive and the regulative specifications, where the latter is explicitly represented based on constraints among commitments. The 2CL language, for writing regulative specifications, is also presented.
