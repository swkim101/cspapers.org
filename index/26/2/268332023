We present results of an in-depth survey of nearly 100 introductory programming (CS1) instructors in 18 countries spanning six continents. Although CS1 is well studied, relatively few broadly-scoped studies have been conducted, and none prior have exceeded regional scale. In addition, CS1 is a notoriously fickle and often changing course, and many might find it beneficial to know what other instructors are doing across the globe; perhaps more so as we continue to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on computing education and as the effects of Generative AI take hold. Expanding upon several surveys conducted in Australasia, the UK, and Ireland, this survey facilitates a direct comparison of global trends in CS1. The survey goes beyond environmental factors such as languages used, and examines why CS1 instructors teach what they do, in the ways they do. In total the survey spans 84 institutions and 91 courses in which a total of over 40,000 students are enrolled.
