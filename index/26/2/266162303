Neural style transfer (NST) has evolved significantly in recent years. Yet, despite its rapid progress and advancement, existing NST methods either struggle to transfer aesthetic information from a style effectively or suffer from high computational costs and inefficiencies in feature disentanglement due to using pre-trained models. This work proposes a lightweight but effective model, AesFA---Aesthetic Feature-Aware NST. The primary idea is to decompose the image via its frequencies to better disentangle aesthetic styles from the reference image while training the entire model in an end-to-end manner to exclude pre-trained models at inference completely. To improve the network's ability to extract more distinct representations and further enhance the stylization quality, this work introduces a new aesthetic feature: contrastive loss. Extensive experiments and ablations show the approach not only outperforms recent NST methods in terms of stylization quality, but it also achieves faster inference.
