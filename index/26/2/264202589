Many entertainment and healing robots have been developed. These robots have synthetic emotions so that they select behavior based on their current emotional state. On the contrary conventional robots which have designed to perform repetitive factor or office jobs do not have such emotions. Usually human operators assign tasks in explicit manner using keyboard or voice commands. In this paper we propose a coordination mechanism between robot mood (an activated emotion) and its task. On one hand, referring to the emotion-task history of the mechanism, the robot selects a task depending on its current mood if there is no explicit task command from the user. On the other hand, when it performs a task, a particular emotion gets boosted based on the same emotion-task history so that this emotion is more likely to be activated by external stimuli.
