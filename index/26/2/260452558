Existing approaches either introduce prior knowledge dependent label cost or tune parameters based on traditional classifiers, which are of limitation in methodology since they do not directly incorporate the false-positive rate tolerance. In this paper, we propose a novel scoring-thresholding approach, tau-False Positive Learning (tau-FPL) to address this problem. We show that the scoring problem which takes the false-positive rate tolerance into accounts can be efficiently solved in linear time, also an out-of-bootstrap thresholding method can transform the learned ranking function into a low false-positive classifier. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show superior performance of the proposed tau-FPL over the existing approaches.
