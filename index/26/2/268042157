Deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in most modeling tasks involving images, text and audio, however, they typically underperform tree-based methods on tabular data. In this paper, we hypothesize that a significant contributor to this performance gap is the interaction between irregular target functions resulting from the heterogeneous nature of tabular feature spaces, and the well-known tendency of neural networks to learn smooth functions. Utilizing tools from spectral analysis, we show that functions described by tabular datasets often have high irregularity, and that they can be smoothed by transformations such as scaling and ranking in order to improve performance. However, because these transformations tend to lose information or negatively impact the loss landscape during optimization, they need to be rigorously fine-tuned for each feature to achieve performance gains. To address these problems, we propose introducing frequency reduction as an inductive bias. We realize this bias as a neural network layer that promotes learning low-frequency representations of the input features, allowing the network to operate in a space where the target function is more regular. Our proposed method introduces less computational complexity than a fully connected layer, while significantly improving neural network performance, and speeding up its convergence on 14 tabular datasets.
