Controllable video editing has demonstrated remarkable potential across diverse applications, particularly in scenarios where capturing or re-capturing real-world videos is either impractical or costly. This paper introduces a novel and efficient system named Place-Anything, which facilitates the insertion of any object into any video solely based on a picture or text description of the target object or element. The system comprises three modules: 3D generation, video reconstruction, and 3D target insertion. This integrated approach offers an efficient and effective solution for producing and editing high-quality videos by naturally inserting realistic objects. Through experiment, we demonstrate that our system can effortlessly place any object into any video using just a photograph of the object. Our demo video can be found at https://youtu.be/afXqgLLRnTE.
