The Implicit Hitting Set (HS) approach has shown very effective for MaxSAT solving. However, only preliminary promising results have been obtained for the very similar Weighted CSP framework. In this paper we contribute towards both a better theoretical understanding of the HS approach and a more effective HS-based solvers for WCSP. First, we bound the minimum number of iterations of HS thanks to what we call distinguished cores. Then, we show a source of inefficiency by
introducing two simple problems where HS is unfeasible. Next, we propose two reformulation methods that merge cost-functions to overcome the problem. We provide a theoretical analysis that quantifies the magnitude of the improvement of each method with respect to the number of iterations of the algorithm. In particular, we show that the reformulations can bring an exponential number of iterations down to a constant number in our working examples. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis with two sets of experiments. First, we show that our results are aligned with real executions. Second, and most importantly, we conduct experiments on typical benchmark problems and show that cost-function merging may be heuristically applied and it may accelerate HS algorithms by several orders of magnitude. In some cases, it even outperforms state-of-the-art solvers.
