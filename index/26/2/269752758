Interior design aims to create aesthetically pleasing and functional environments within an architectural space. For a simple room, the preliminary design exploration currently takes multiple meetings and days of work for interior designers to incorporate homeownersâ€™ personal preferences through layout, furnishings, form, colors, and materials. We present RoomDreaming, a generative AI-based approach designed to facilitate preliminary interior design exploration. It empowers owners and designers to rapidly and efficiently iterate through a broad range of AI-generated, photo-realistic design alternatives, each uniquely tailored to fit actual space layouts and individual design preferences. We conducted a series of formative and summative studies with a total of 18 homeowners and 20 interior designers to help design, improve, and evaluate RoomDreaming. Owners reported that RoomDreaming effectively increased the breadth and depth of design exploration with higher efficiency and satisfaction. Designers reported that one hour of collaborative designing with RoomDreaming yielded results comparable to several days of traditional owner-designer meetings, plus days to weeks worth of designer work to develop and refine designs.
