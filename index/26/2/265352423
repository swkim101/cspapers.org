Clouds and massive-scale computing infrastructures are starting to dominate computing and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Major cloud operators are now comprising millions of cores hosting substantial fractions of corporate and government IT infrastructure. CCSW is the world's premier forum bringing together researchers and practitioners in all security aspects of cloud-centric and outsourced computing, including: Side channel attacks Cryptographic protocols for cloud security Secure cloud resource virtualization mechanisms Secure data management outsourcing (e.g., database as a service) Privacy and integrity mechanisms for outsourcing Foundations of cloud-centric threat models Secure computation outsourcing Remote attestation mechanisms in clouds Sandboxing and VM-based enforcements Trust and policy management in clouds Secure identity management mechanisms Cloud-aware web service security paradigms and mechanisms Cloud-centric regulatory compliance issues and mechanisms Business and security risk models and clouds Cost and usability models and their interaction with security in clouds Scalability of security in global-size clouds Binary analysis of software for remote attestation and cloud protection Network security (DOS, IDS etc.) mechanisms for cloud contexts Security for emerging cloud programming models Energy/cost/efficiency of security in clouds mOpen hardware for cloud Machine learning for cloud protection CCSW especially encourages novel paradigms and controversial ideas that are not on the above list. The workshop has historically acted as a fertile ground for creative debate and interaction in security-sensitive areas of computing impacted by clouds. This year marked the 14th anniversary of CCSW. In the past decade, CCSW has had a significant impact in our research community.
