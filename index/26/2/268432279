As states move to adopt computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) standards to prepare students for an increasingly technological world, school districts are integrating curriculum with CT skills and practices, building the capacity of their teachers and administrators through professional development, and increasing the knowledge infrastructure to support CT opportunities for students. One challenge that districts face when scaling new initiatives occurs when the work becomes siloed to one ''champion'' teacher or a singular motivated department. This poster presents Broward County Public Schools' use of an interactive infographic to build awareness of their CT initiative, including considerations for utilizing an infographic tool and the design decisions made to engage various stakeholders. The poster provides examples of methods to build knowledge of an emerging initiative and adds to the growing body of work in supporting districts as they scale their CS/CT initiatives.
