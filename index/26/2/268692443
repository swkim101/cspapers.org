Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged due to advancements in hardware and computer graphics. During the pandemic, conferences and exhibitions leveraging VR have gained attention. However, large-scale VR conferences, face a significant problem not yet studied in the literature -- displaying too many irrelevant users on the screen which may negatively impact the user experience. To address this issue, we formulate a new research problem, Social-Aware VR Conference Group Display Configuration (SVGD). Accordingly, we design the Social Utility-Aware VR Conference Group Formation (SVC) algorithm, which is a 2-approximation algorithm to SVGD. SVC iteratively selects either the P-Configuration or S-Configuration based on their effective ratios. This ensures that in each iteration, SVC identifies and chooses the solution with the highest current effectiveness. Experiments on real metaverse datasets show that the proposed SVC outperforms 11 baselines by 75% in terms of solution quality.
