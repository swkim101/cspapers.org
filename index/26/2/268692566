Hyperspectral image super-resolution (HISR) is a technique that can break through the limitation of imaging mechanism to obtain the hyperspectral image (HSI) with high spatial resolution. Although some progress has been achieved by existing methods, most of them directly learn the spatial-spectral joint mapping between the observed images and the target high-resolution HSI (HrHSI), failing to fully reserve the spectral distribution of low-resolution HSI (LrHSI) and the spatial distribution of high-resolution multispectral imagery (HrMSI). To this end, we propose a spatial-spectral-bilateral cycle-diffusion framework (S2CycleDiff) for HISR, which can step-wise generate the HrHSI with high spatial-spectral fidelity by learning the conditional distribution of spatial and spectral super-resolution processes bilaterally. Specifically, a customized conditional cycle-diffusion framework is designed as the backbone to achieve the spatial-spectral-bilateral super-resolution by repeated refinement, wherein the spatial/spectral guided pyramid denoising (SGPD) module seperately takes HrMSI and LrHSI as the guiding factors to achieve the spatial details injection and spectral correction. The outputs of the conditional cycle-diffusion framework are fed into a complementary fusion block to integrate the spatial and spectral details to generate the desired HrHSI. Experiments have been conducted on three widely used datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art HISR methods.
