Nanotechnology has played a pioneering role in advancing medical applications, aiming to enhance healthcare through innovation and collaboration. Nanomedicine can be seen expanding into many fields from cancer therapies, cosmetics, tissue regeneration, biosensing, and infectious diseases, and now, it is seen venturing into the realm of research geared toward autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by restrictive, monotonous activities or fixed interests as well as difficulties with social communication. As of now, there are no validated quantitative metrics for diagnosing autism, nor is there a drug that is specifically designed to treat the condition. As identifiers of ASD have improved, the diagnosis of individuals who meet established criteria have dramatically increased over the years. Although there is still no recognized nanomedicine treatment specifically intended for ASD, research is looking into how nanotechnology might be used in a number of ASD-related areas. This comprehensive review examines prior research efforts aimed at preventing, treating, and diagnosing individuals with ASD. It particularly focuses on the significance of prenatal care and investigates advancements in drug delivery methods through the bloodâ€“brain barrier concerning ASD treatment and management.
