Link prediction is a fundamental task in network analysis, with the objective of predicting missing or potential links. While existing studies have mainly concentrated on single networks, it is worth noting that numerous real-world networks exhibit interconnectedness. For example, individuals often register on various social media platforms to access diverse services, such as chatting, tweeting, blogging, and rating movies. These platforms share a subset of users and are termed multilayer networks. The interlayer links in such networks hold valuable information that provides more comprehensive insights into the network structure. To effectively exploit this complementary information and enhance link prediction in the target network, we propose a novel cross-network embedding method. This method aims to represent different networks in a shared latent space, preserving proximity within single networks as well as consistency across multilayer networks. Specifically, nodes can aggregate messages from aligned nodes in other layers. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method for link prediction in multilayer networks.
