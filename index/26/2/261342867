OSDI '02 continues the conference's tradition of presenting the best innovative work in the systems software area, taking a broad view of what the area encompasses. We believe that this year's conference contains some of the most original, intriguing, and important work in the field today. OSDI '02 drew a highly competitive selection from a large collection of diverse, original work submitted by authors internationally to form a program of creative, well-developed papers opening up new and innovative areas--not merely incremental results building on prior work.The program presents important results in a wide range of areas, including distributed storage systems, robust software construction, OS kernel innovations, sensor networks, virtual machine monitors, large-scale network simulation, resource management architectures for Internet services, peer-to-peer systems, network analysis, and migration of execution environments.OSDI '02 received 150 submissions; all submissions were reviewed by several members of the program committee and selected external reviewers, comprising roughly 700 reviews. Program committee members did not participate in the review or discussion of any papers co-authored by themselves, members of their home institutions, former students, advisors, or recent collaborators. The program committee met at the Intel Berkeley research lab on July 30, 2002, to make the final program selection during an eleven-hour meeting.
