Inspired by the success of graph contrastive learning, researchers have begun exploring the benefits of contrastive learning over hypergraphs. However, these works have the following limitations in modeling the high-order relationships over unlabeled data: (i) They primarily focus on maximizing the agreements among individual node embeddings while neglecting the capture of group-wise collective behaviors within hypergraphs; (ii) Most of them disregard the importance of the temperature index in discriminating contrastive pairs during contrast optimization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-level Hy perG raph C ontrastive L earning framework with Ad aptive T emperature (HyGCL-AdT ) to boost contrastive learning over hypergraphs. Specifically, unlike most works that merely maximize the agreement of node embeddings in hypergraphs, we propose a dual-level contrast mechanism that not only captures the individual node behaviors in a local context but also models the group-wise collective behaviors of nodes within hyperedges from a community perspective. Besides, we design an adaptive temperature-enhanced contrastive optimization to improve the discrimination ability between contrastive pairs. Empirical experiments conducted on seven benchmark hypergraphs demonstrate that HyGCL-AdT exhibits excellent effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.
