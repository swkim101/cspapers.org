Traditional curricula have concentrated on teaching students the content of a subject; however, it has recently become apparent that effective education needs to include explicit instruction in many of the auxiliary skills and attitudes needed for the content to be useful. This applies just as much at advanced levels as at introductory ones, though the impact on teaching practice is not yet widespread. This paper describes an innovative module taught to students who are about to commence research, in which these students are given explicit guidance on how to judge the work of others (or their own work). The module is provided to undergraduates intending to perform an "Honours" research project in their final year; however, the material would also be relevant to students in a graduate program or senior seminar.
