We present D O PA M ETER , a tool suite for the metrical investigation of written language, that provides diagnostic means for its division into discourse categories, such as registers, genres, and style. The quantitative basis of our sys-tem are 120 metrics covering a wide range of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features relevant for language profiling. The scores can be summarized, compared, and aggregated using visualization tools that can be tailored according to the usersâ€™ needs. We also showcase an application scenario for D O PA M ETER .
