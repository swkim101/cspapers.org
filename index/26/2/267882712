Security is the prime concern of organizations and individuals these days. It could be a house or an office which needs to be modernized with latest security systems that are more secure and robust systematically. Conventional Lock with key methods are more vulnerable to replication of keys and physically getting broken, in order to overcome this, modern techniques like RFID and Mobile applications are used. Though the prior mentioned security systems are often implemented with only the alarms and cameras which may intimate the user about the breach and collect the evidences respectively, there arenâ€™t any counter-measures proposed to expel the thief out of the place. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to deploy counter-measures to expel the thieves out of the place even after successful breach through the door/window along with the inherent functions of the already existing systems. This paper also proposes an effective handling way of a worst-case scenario, which prevents the deployment of countermeasures when a genuine user breaks through the door in emergency situations.
