Visual art facilitates expression, communication, and connection, yet it remains inaccessible to those who are visually-impaired and those who lack the resources to understand the techniques and history of art. In this work, I propose the development of a generative AI model that generates a description and interpretation of a given artwork. Such research can make art more accessible, support art education, and improve the ability of AI to understand and translate between creative media. Development will begin with a formative study to assess the needs and preferences of blind and low vision people and art experts. Following the formative study, the basic approach is to train the model on a database of artworks and their accompanying descriptions, predict sentiments from extracted visual data, and generate a paragraph closely resembling training textual data and incorporating sentiment analysis. The model will then be evaluated quantitatively through metrics like METEOR and qualitatively through Turing tests in an iterative process.
