Ink is a powerful medium for note-taking and creativity tasks. Multi-touch devices and stylus input have enabled digital ink to be editable and searchable. To extend the capabilities of digital ink, we introduce Inkeraction, an interaction modality powered by ink recognition and synthesis. Inkeraction segments and classifies digital ink objects (e.g., handwriting and sketches), identifies relationships between them, and generates strokes in different writing styles. Inkeraction reshapes the design space for digital ink by enabling features that include: (1) assisting users to manipulate ink objects, (2) providing word-processor features such as spell checking, (3) automating repetitive writing tasks such as transcribing, and (4) bridging with generative modelsâ€™ features such as brainstorming. Feedback from two user studies with a total of 22 participants demonstrated that Inkeraction supported writing activities by enabling participants to write faster with fewer steps and achieve better writing quality.
