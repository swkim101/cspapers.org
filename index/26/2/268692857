The filter bubble is a notorious issue in Recommender Systems (RSs), which describes the phenomenon whereby users are exposed to a limited and narrow range of information or content that reinforces their existing dominant preferences and beliefs. This results in a lack of exposure to diverse and varied content. Many existing works have predominantly examined filter bubbles in static or relatively-static recommendation settings. However, filter bubbles will be continuously intensified over time due to the feedback loop between the user and the system in the real-world online recommendation. To address these issues, we propose a novel paradigm, Multi-Facet Preference Learning for Pricking Filter Bubbles in Conversational Recommender System (FacetCRS), which aims to burst filter bubbles in the conversational recommender system (CRS) through timely user-item interactions via natural language conversations. By considering diverse user preferences and intentions, FacetCRS automatically model user preference into multi-facets, including entity-, word-, context-, and review-facet, to capture diverse and dynamic user preferences to prick filter bubbles in the CRS. It is an end-to-end CRS framework to adaptively learn representations of various levels of preference facet and diverse types of external knowledge. Extensive experiments on two publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating filter bubbles and enhancing recommendation quality in CRS.
