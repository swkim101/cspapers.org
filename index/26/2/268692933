This work studies the behaviors of two large-population teams competing in a discrete environment. The team-level interactions are modeled as a zero-sum game while the agent dynamics within each team is formulated as a collaborative mean-field team problem. Drawing inspiration from the mean-field literature, we first approximate the large-population team game with its infinite-population limit. Subsequently, we construct a fictitious centralized system and transform the infinite-population game to an equivalent zero-sum game between two coordinators. Via a novel reachability analysis, we study the optimality of coordination strategies, which induce decentralized strategies under the original information structure. The optimality of the resulting strategies is established in the original finite-population game, and the theoretical guarantees are verified by numerical examples.
