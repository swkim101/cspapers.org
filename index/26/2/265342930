Ultra-wide band (UWB) radar has made many significant improvements in the field of counting people. This paper proposes a lightweight micro-CNN model for accurate human counting, addressing the limitations of existing methods. The model achieves a high accuracy of 98.45% while counting up to 10 people, with consistent performance across different classes. Additionally, the model is lightweight that allows for seamless integration with resource-constrained microcontrollers, facilitating intelligent tasks. The benchmarking results demonstrate the modelâ€™s efficiency, achieving inference times of less than 500ms on various STM32 microcontrollers and three times faster than the previous model. It is a promising solution for real-world human presence detection and counting applications.
