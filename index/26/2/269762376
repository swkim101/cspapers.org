The first international workshop on multimedia content analysis for social good (MM4SG) was held in conjunction with the Web Conference 2024. The workshop aimed to address the challenge of effectively analyzing and moderating multimodal content across digital platforms. In an era where multimodal data including memes, text-embedded images, and fabricated content swiftly capture the public's attention and influence societal discourse, the need for advanced content moderation strategies is more pressing than ever. This workshop serves as a platform for research and collaboration between experts in natural language processing, machine learning, computational social science, and ethics. In this paper, we describe the inaugural edition of the MM4SG workshop. We also include the future directions for our workshop's upcoming editions.
