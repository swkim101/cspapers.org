Adversarial patch attacks present a significant threat to real-world object detectors due to their practical feasibil-ity. Existing defense methods, which rely on attack data or prior knowledge, struggle to effectively address a wide range of adversarial patches. In this paper, we show two inherent characteristics of adversarial patches, semantic in-dependence and spatial heterogeneity, independent of their appearance, shape, size, quantity, and location. Seman-tic independence indicates that adversarial patches oper-ate autonomously within their semantic context, while spatial heterogeneity manifests as distinct image quality of the patch area that differs from original clean image due to the independent generation process. Based on these observations, we propose PAD, a novel adversarial patch localization and removal method that does not require prior knowledge or additional training. PAD offers patch-agnostic de-fense against various adversarial patches, compatible with any pretrained object detectors. Our comprehensive digital and physical experiments involving diverse patch types, such as localized noise, printable, and naturalistic patches, ex-hibit notable improvements over state-of-the-art works.
