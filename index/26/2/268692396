Existing deep pan-sharpening methods lack the learning of complementary information between PAN and MS modalities in the intermediate layers, and exhibit low interpretability due to their black-box designs. To this end, an interpretable deep unfolded network with intrinsic supervision for pan-sharpening is proposed. Building upon the observation degradation process, it formulates the pan-sharpening task as a variational model minimization with spatial consistency prior and spectral projection prior. The former prior requires a joint component decomposition of PAN and MS images to extract intrinsic features. By being supervised in the intermediate layers, it can selectively provide high-frequency information for spatial enhancement. The latter prior constrains the intensity correlation between MS and PAN images derived from physical observations, so as to improve spectral fidelity. To further enhance the transparency of network design, we develop an iterative solution algorithm following the half-quadratic splitting to unfold the deep model. It rigorously adheres to the variational model, significantly enhancing the interpretability behind network design and efficiently alternating the optimization of the network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method compared to state-of-the-arts, showcasing its remarkable generalization capability to real-world scenes.
