It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 7th ACM International Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental evaluation & Characterization (WiNTECH 2012) hosted in the historical city of Istanbul in Turkey. Similar to previous editions, WiNTECH workshop is serving as a major venue for bringing together researchers and practitioners working in the area of experimental wireless research. 
 
The call for papers this year attracted submissions from all over the world. The program committee did an excellent job in reviewing the papers, and we finally accepted 10 papers that cover a variety of topics, including novel platforms and tools, experimentation on different testbeds (e.g., cellular deployments, cognitive networks, WiFi Mesh, and sensor networks), and characterization of wireless systems such as mobile RFID readers and vehicular networks. The program also includes a keynote speech on the recent advances in white space networking by Ranveer Chandra from Microsoft Research who is a well-known researcher in the field of Mobility and Wireless systems. We conclude the workshop with the demo and poster session, which has been an integral part of WiNTECH workshop over the years.
