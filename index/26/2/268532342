In this paper, we propose a novel method for plane clustering specialized in cluttered scenes using an RGB-D camera and validate its effectiveness through robot grasping experiments. Unlike existing methods, which focus on large- scale indoor structures, our approachâ€”Multi-Object RANSAC emphasizes cluttered environments that contain a wide range of objects with different scales. It enhances plane segmentation by generating subplanes in Deep Plane Clustering (DPC) module, which are then merged with the final planes by postprocessing. DPC rearranges the point cloud by voting layers to make subplane clusters, trained in a self-supervised manner using pseudo-labels generated from RANSAC. Multi-Object RANSAC demonstrates superior plane instance segmentation performances over other recent RANSAC applications. We conducted an experiment on robot suction-based grasping, comparing our method with vision-based grasping network and RANSAC applications. The results from this real-world scenario showed its remarkable performance surpassing the baseline methods, highlighting its potential for advanced scene understanding and manipulation.
