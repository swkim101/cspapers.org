Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) is a prevalent respiratory disease that significantly impacts the quality of life of affected individuals. This paper presents COPD-FlowNet, a novel deep-learning framework that leverages a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) velocity flow field images specific to the trachea of COPD patients. These synthetic images serve as a valuable resource for data augmentation and model training. Additionally, COPD-FlowNet incorporates a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to predict the location of the obstruction site.
