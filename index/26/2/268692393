Although Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing the raw data of clients, it encounters low-performance problems caused by various heterogeneous scenarios. Due to the limitation of dispatching the same global model to clients for local training, traditional Federated Average (FedAvg)-based FL models face the problem of easily getting stuck into a sharp solution, which results in training a low-performance global model. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel FL approach named FedMut, which mutates the global model according to the gradient change to generate several intermediate models for the next round of training. Each intermediate model will be dispatched to a client for local training. Eventually, the global model converges into a flat area within the range of mutated models and has a well-generalization compared with the global model trained by FedAvg. Experimental results on well-known datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our FedMut approach in various data heterogeneity scenarios.
