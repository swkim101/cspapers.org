Prior work has highlighted the gap between industry expectations for recent university graduates and the abilities those recent graduates possess. These works have even specifically recommended that students be given the opportunity to work on large, pre-existing code bases in their undergraduate career. This paper presents our experience teaching a newly-created course calledWorking with Large Code Bases. Guided by a Cognitive Apprenticeship approach to provide an authentic classroom experience that emphasizes the implicit processes and techniques involved in real-world software engineering, the course serves as a practical introduction to the skills and workflow involved in navigating and understanding a large code base. The goal of this experience report is to provide the motivation for key course design decisions, an overview of the course content, and a detailed description of key course components. We present student feedback indicating improved confidence in navigating a large code base and course outcomes related to specific tools and techniques students used in the course. Finally, we provide the full set of course materials we used and actionable recommendations for instructors to administer this course at their own institution, even with limited TA support.
