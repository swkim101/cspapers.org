This Birds of a Feather (BoF) session brings together attendees interested in computing education at the associate degree (two-year) level to discuss issues of specific interest to this group of educators. Faculty members from small community colleges who may be the only instructor in computing will be able to exchange ideas with faculty members of other institutions. Members of larger departments will find like-situated individuals with similar issues to help them solve problems and make progress. All attendees will find a community of educators who understand the issues that make teaching in an associate degree program, such as at a community or technical college, different from the job at a university teaching in a baccalaureate level computing program. The BoF facilitators will serve as discussion leaders, with prepared topics and discussion questions to keep the session flowing and productive. At the same time, the session will be open to relevant topics raised by participants. The focus on community, similar problems and solutions, resources, vision and mission that sets two-year computing programs apart will be apparent, and members will be able to return to their campuses refreshed and ready to move forward. Above all, students will be affected, and their opportunities improved because their instructors can directly apply what they discover to the current classroom.
