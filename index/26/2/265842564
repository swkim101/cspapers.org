B a c k g round: Leakage power is emerging as a key challenge in IC design. Traditionally, leakage has been considered as an important design variable in handheld devices and in standby circuit operation. However, this significant increase of leakage now warrants that it be considered as the key design variable in all IC designs. This tutorial presents a comprehensive review of leakage power issues in IC design. The tutorial is organized in four major parts. The first part provides an overview of technology and scaling trends which are causing the significant increase in leakage current. The device physics that leads to sub-threshold and gate leakage will be described, along with their dependence on circuit design variables. The second part of the tutorial will focus on circuit level leakage estimation and avoidance. Comprehensive description of multiple-Vt techniques for leakage avoidance will be presented along with associated leakage estimation techniques. The third part of the tutorial focuses on chip level effects on leakage. Leakage estimation techniques which consider both inter and intra-die process variations will be covered as will leakage minimization techniques such as Adaptive Body Bias (ABB) and power supply control. The final part of the tutorial covers system and circuit architectures for leakage avoidance. In standby mode, the leakage of the circuit can be lowered by putting it a low-leakage state. This section of the tutorial will cover topics including state assignment for leakage minimization, leakage-driven memory and cache circuits and architectures. The tutorial is intended for designers and CAD engineers interested in next generation design techniques and methodologies and emerging power challenges. Basic background of VLSI and CAD is useful though not needed.
