Face Verification Systems (FVSes) are more and more deployed by real-world mobile applications (apps) to verify a humanâ€™s claimed identity. One popular type of FVSes is called cross-side FVS (XFVS), which splits the FVS functionality into two sides: one at a mobile phone to take pictures or videos and the other at a trusted server for verification. Prior works have studied the security of XFVSes from the machine learning perspective, i.e., whether the learning models used by XFVSes are robust to adversarial attacks. However, the security of other parts of XFVSes, especially the design and implementation of the verification procedure used by XFVSes, is not well understood.In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study on the security of real-world XFVSes used by popular mobile apps from a system perspective. More specifically, we design and implement a semi-automated system, called XFVSChecker, to detect XFVSes in mobile apps and then inspect their compliance with four security properties. Our evaluation reveals that most of existing XFVS apps, including those with billions of downloads, are vulnerable to at least one of four types of attacks. These attacks require only easily available attack prerequisites, such as one photo of the victim, to pose significant security risks, including complete account takeover, identity fraud and financial loss. Our findings result in 14 Chinese National Vulnerability Database (CNVD) IDs and one of them, particularly CNVD-2021-86899, is awarded the most valuable vulnerability in 2021 among all the reported vulnerabilities to CNVD.
