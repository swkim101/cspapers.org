As the dominant container orchestration system, Kubernetes is widely used by many companies and cloud vendors. It runs third-party add-ons and applications (termed third-party apps) on its control plane to manage the whole cluster. The security of these third-party apps is critical to the whole cluster but has not been systematically studied so far. Therefore, this paper analyzes the security of third-party apps and reveals that third-party apps are granted excessive critical permissions, which can be exploited by an attacker to escape from the worker node and take over the whole Kubernetes cluster. Even worse, excessive permissions of different third-party apps can be chained together to turn non-critical issues into severe attack vectors. To systematically analyze the exploitability of excessive permissions, we design three strategies based on different attacking paths. These three strategies can steal the cluster admin permission with the DaemonSet of a third-party app directly, or via the same app's or another app's critical component indirectly. We investigate the security impact of excessive permission attacks in real production environments. We analyze all third-party apps in CNCF and show that 51 of 153 (33.3%) ones have potential security risks. We further scan Kubernetes services provided by the top four cloud vendors. The results show that all of them are vulnerable to excessive permission attacks. We report all our findings to the corresponding teams and get eight new CVEs from communities and a security bounty from Google.
