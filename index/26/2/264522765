Online publishers typically sell ad impressions through auctions held in ad exchanges in real-time, i.e., real-time bidding (RTB). A publisher will accept the winning bid if it is higher than a given reserve price for an ad impression. Setting an appropriate reserve price for an ad impression is critical for publishersâ€™ revenue generation, but also challenging. While this problem has been studied for second-price auctions, it lacks studies for first-price auctions, the de facto industry standard since 2019. This paper proposes a machine learning model that determines the optimal reserve prices for individual ad impressions in real-time. It uses a multi-task learning framework to predict the lower bounds of the highest bids with a coverage probability, using only the data available to publishers. The experiments using data from a large international publisher show that the proposed model outperforms the comparison systems on generating revenue.
