Documents describing information with expiration time often include time expressions specifying the expiration time. To train a classifier determining if a time expression represents an expiration time, we need a labeled dataset. We propose a method of automatically constructing such a dataset. Our method collects tweets including time expressions, and automatically determines whether the time expressions represent expiration times based on temporal changes in the frequency of retweets. Our experimental result shows that our method produces an effective dataset.
