Creativity is the ability to develop innovative functional ideas through unconventional associations. The consensus view on creativity in the literature involves divergence from stereotypical and habitual thought patterns [29, 39]. Creativity relies on search to explore diverse solutions. Search requires charting the mental terrain, leveraging past experiences and knowledge to manipulate and reconfigure components for new solutions [28]. The generally-accepted and overly-narrow view on creativity, however, neglects the fact that creativity is multidimensional [14]. This one-dimensional view of creativity triggers questions such as "Does one consider an unethical but novel creation to be creative?" and "Does one consider a new iPhone with mainstream functionalities but advanced camera features to be creative?" This research challenges the one-dimensional view of creativity, offering a more all-encompassing conceptualization of creativity [14]. The research examines the multidimensional nature of creativity by building a computational model of a designer's mutual search process across multiple mutually dependent search spaces. The research examines the trajectory of mutual search across multiple cognitive search spaces using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The field experiment employs 108 designers who develop their web designs through five iterations, utilizing computer graphics methods to extract the images. Through measuring the distance of search by considering changes in visual and source code in each iteration, the study argues that the search patterns differ in the degree of exploration in these search spaces over time. The research concludes that designers' search processes are non-linear and argues that there are more than one or two search spaces. The research also provides perceptual explanations of the multiple search processes in designs and argues for a more encompassing view of creativity.
