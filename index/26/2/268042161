Split Inference (SI) is an emerging deep learning paradigm that addresses computational constraints on edge devices and preserves data privacy through collaborative edge-cloud approaches. However, SI is vulnerable to Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA), which aim to reconstruct users’ private prediction instances. Existing attack methods suffer from various limitations. Optimization-based DRAs do not leverage public data effectively, while Learning-based DRAs depend heavily on auxiliary data quantity and distribution similarity. Consequently, these approaches yield unsatisfactory attack results and are sensitive to defense mechanisms. To overcome these challenges, we propose a G AN-based LA tent S pace S earch attack ( GLASS ) that harnesses abundant prior knowledge from public data using advanced StyleGAN technologies. Additionally, we introduce GLASS++ to enhance reconstruction stability. Our approach represents the ﬁrst GAN-based DRA against SI, and extensive evaluation across different split points and adversary setups demonstrates its state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we thoroughly examine seven defense mechanisms, highlighting our method’s capability to reveal private information even in the presence of these defenses.
