Emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) heavily rely on hardware security for data and privacy protection. However, constantly increasing integration complexity requires automatic synthesis to maintain the pace of innovation. We introduce the first High-Level Synthesis (HLS) flow that produces a security enhanced hardware design to directly prevent Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH) injection by a malicious foundry. Through analysis of entropy loss and criticality decay, the presented algorithms implement highly efficient resource-targeted information dispersion to counter HTH insertion. The flow is evaluated on existing HLS benchmarks and a new IoT-specific benchmark and shows significant resource savings.
