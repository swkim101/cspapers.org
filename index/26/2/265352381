The two main types of blockchains that are currently widely deployed are public blockchains and permissioned blockchains. The research that has been conducted for blockchain vulnerability detection is mainly oriented to public blockchains. Less consideration is given to the unique requirements of the permissioned blockchains, which cannot be directly migrated to the application scenarios of the permissioned blockchains. The permissioned blockchain is deployed between verified organizations, and its smart contracts may contain sensitive information such as the transaction flow of the contracts, transaction algorithms, etc. The sensitive information can be considered as the private information of the smart contracts themselves, which should be kept confidential to users outside the blockchain. In this paper, a privacy-preserving smart contract vulnerability detection framework is proposed. The framework leverages blockchain and confidential computing technologies to enable vulnerability detection in permissioned blockchain smart contracts while protecting the privacy of smart contracts. The framework is also able to protect the interests of vulnerability detection model owners. We experimentally validate the detection performance of our framework in a confidential computing environment.
