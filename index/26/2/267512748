Career mobility forecasting and recommendation are important topics in talent management research. While existing models have extensively covered short-term, single-period recommendations and long-term, unconstrained career path suggestions, the user preference-constrained career path optimization problem remains underexplored. This paper addresses the common scenario where individuals have approximate career plans and seek to optimize their career trajectories by incorporating specific user preferences. We develop an exploration space-aware stochastic searching algorithm that incorporates a deep learning-guided searching space determination module and a position transit prediction module. We mathematically demonstrate its strengths in exploring optimal path solutions with fixed components predefined by users. Finally, we empirically validate the superiority of our method using a comprehensive real-world dataset, comparing it against state-of-the-art approaches.
