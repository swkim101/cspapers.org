Foundation models such as GPT-4 for natural language processing (NLP), Flamingo for computer vision (CV), have set new benchmarks in AI by delivering state-of-the-art results across various tasks with minimal task-specific data. Despite their success, the application of these models to the graph domain is challenging due to the relational nature of graph-structured data. To address this gap, we propose the Graph Foundation Model (GFM) Workshop, the first workshop for GFMs, dedicated to exploring the adaptation and development of foundation models specifically designed for graph data. The GFM workshop focuses on two critical questions: (1) How can the underlying capabilities of existing foundation models be effectively applied to graph data? (2) What foundational principles should guide the creation of models tailored to the graph domain? Through a curated set of panel sections, keynote talks, and paper presentations, our workshop intends to catalyze innovative approaches and theoretical frameworks for Graph Foundation Models (GFMs). We target a broad audience, encompassing researchers, practitioners, and students, and aim to lay the groundwork for the next wave of breakthroughs in integrating graph data with foundation models.
