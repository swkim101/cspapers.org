Fair division, the study of how to fairly allocate resources among agents, has received substantial interest in the areas of artificial intelligence and multiagent systems. While there is an extensive theoretical literature on fair division by now, the developed algorithms are still mostly confined to research papers and inaccessible to the public. We attempt to bridge this gap by developing Fast & Fair, an open-source web application that hosts a number of fair allocation algorithms with user-friendly interfaces and explainable outcomes. In contrast to existing implementations, Fast & Fair is a collaborative platform that is open to community contributions and thereby facilitates the deployment of additional algorithms.
