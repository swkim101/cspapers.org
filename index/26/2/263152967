Mobile manipulation constitutes a fundamental task for robotic assistants and garners significant attention within the robotics community. A critical challenge inherent in mobile manipulation is the effective observation of the target while approaching it for grasping. In this work, we propose a graspability-aware mobile manipulation approach powered by an online grasping pose fusion framework that enables a temporally consistent grasping observation. Specifically, the predicted grasping poses are online organized to eliminate the redundant, outlier grasping poses, which can be encoded as a grasping pose observation state for reinforcement learning. Moreover, on-the-fly fusing the grasping poses enables a direct assessment of graspability, encompassing both the quantity and quality of grasping poses. This assessment can subsequently serve as an observe-to-grasp reward, motivating the agent to prioritize actions that yield detailed observations while approaching the target object for grasping. Through extensive experiments conducted on the Habitat and Isaac Gym simulators, we find that our method attains a good balance between observation and manipulation, yielding high performance under various grasping metrics. Furthermore, we discover that the incorporation of temporal information from grasping poses aids in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, leading to robust performance in challenging real-world experiments.
