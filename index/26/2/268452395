Gradeview is an innovative and ongoing project presenting a comprehensive dashboard designed to cater to the needs of both students and educators, offering a centralized platform for monitoring and managing course progress. This work in progress draws its data from a single Google Sheet ensuring that updates, such as new grades and categories, are seamlessly reflected across all student and administrator dashboards instantaneously. Gradeview leverages a plethora of other technologies that can drastically increase both student and educator productivity beyond the classroom setting. For instance, it introduces an interactive mastery learning Concept Map customized for each student. The organization structure of Gradeview promotes completion of work regardless of timeline so as to benefit student mental health and increase mastery of core concepts in the class. Our Director module enables the automated management of students' grades for those students working past the term deadline. In order to facilitate the implementation of these new dashboard modules, we developed the project to be an easy-to-use microservice architecture that can automatically track individual and overall student performance through course grading metrics.
