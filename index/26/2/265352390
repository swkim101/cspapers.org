In the study of software security many factors must be considered. Once venturing beyond the simplest of laboratory experiments, the researcher is obliged to contend with exponentially complex conditions. Software security has been shown to be affected by priming, tool usability, library documentation, organisational security culture, the content and format of internet resources, IT team and developer interaction, Internet search engine ordering, developer personality, security warning placement, mentoring, developer experience and more. In a systematic review of software security papers published since 2016, we have identified a number of unhelpful assumptions that are commonly made by software security researchers. In this paper we list these assumptions, describe why they sometimes do not reflect reality, and suggest implications for researchers.
