Welcome to AST 2013 --- The 8th International Workshop on Automation of Software Test which is to be held in conjunction with The 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2013) in San Francisco, USA, on May 18--19, 2013. 
 
The workshop is the 8th edition of the successful AST workshops held at ICSE 2006--2012. It provided researchers and practitioners with a forum for exchanging ideas, experiences, understanding of the problems, visions for the future, and promising solutions to the problems. The workshop has also provided a platform for researchers and developers of testing tools to work together to identify the problems in the theory and practice of software test automation and to set an agenda and lay the foundation for future development.
