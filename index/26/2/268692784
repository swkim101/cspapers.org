Due to the scarcity of training samples, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) poses a significant challenge to capture discriminative object features effectively. The combination of transfer learning and meta-learning has recently been explored by pre-training the backbone features using labeled base data and subsequently fine-tuning the model with target data. However, existing meta-learning methods, which use embedding networks, suffer from scaling limitations when dealing with a few labeled samples, resulting in suboptimal results. Inspired by the latest advances in FSL, we further advance the approach of fine-tuning a pre-trained architecture by a strengthened hierarchical feature representation. The technical contributions of this work include: 1) a hybrid design named Intra-Block Fusion (IBF) to strengthen the extracted features within each convolution block; and 2) a novel Cross-Scale Attention (CSA) module to mitigate the scaling inconsistencies arising from the limited training samples, especially for cross-domain tasks. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks, including three in-domain tasks (miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and FC100), as well as two cross-domain tasks (CDFSL and Meta-Dataset). The results have improved significantly over existing state-of-the-art approaches on all benchmark datasets. In particular, the FSL performance on the in-domain FC100 dataset is more than three points better than the latest PMF (Hu et al. 2022).
