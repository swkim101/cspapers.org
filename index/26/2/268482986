In the field of computer science, cultural assumptions are embedded in programming languages and problem prompts. However, for students studying computer science in a Western country not from a Western culture, these assumptions can create learning barriers. This paper investigates the impact of cultural assumptions on international students studying computer science in a Western country; with a focus on understanding the barriers students face, how they overcome these barriers, and how barriers can be avoided. By performing thematic analysis on semi-structured interviews with 12 international graduate students at North Carolina State University, the authors found six main themes: Barriers, Increased Work, Emotions, Educational Environment, Overcoming Barriers, and Solutions to Barriers. Analyzing these themes provided insight into what barriers international students face and how they can be alleviated. The most common suggestions participants gave for alleviating barriers were more discussions around problem statements. By shedding light on this topic, the authors hope to inform computer science educators and researchers on the importance of creating inclusive and culturally relevant learning environments that accommodate the needs of diverse student populations.
