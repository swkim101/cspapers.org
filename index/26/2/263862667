Expert nding is one of the most rapidly developing IR 
tasks and a popular research domain. The opportunity of 
search for knowledgeable people in the scope of an organi- 
zation or world-wide is a feature which makes modern En- 
terprise search systems commercially successful and socially 
demanded. A number of ecient expert nding approaches 
was proposed recently. Despite that most of them are based 
on theoretically sound measures of expertness, they still use 
rather unrealistic and oversimplied principles. In our re- 
search we try to avoid these limitations and come up with 
models that go beyond the assumptions used in state-of-the- 
art expert nding methods.
