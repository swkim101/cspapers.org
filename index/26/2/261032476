Proof: Donoho and Grimes [3] showed that as the number of examples goes to infinity, the H matrix converges to the (continuous) Hessian operator on the manifold whose d+1 eigenfunctions with zero eigenvalue are spanned by the latent factors. They also showed that if the support of p(z) is connected, then HLLE will recover the isometric embedding of the manifold up to a linear transformation. The assumption of non-Gaussianity means that running fastICA on the output of HLLE will provably recover the original independent factors. Similarly, Belkin and Niyogi [1] have shown that when the number of examples goes to infinity, the L matrix converges to the (continuous) manifold Laplacian, and Singer and Coifman [7] have shown that under local isometry, the d + 1 eigenfunctions with smallest eigenvalues are monotonic functions of the true latent functions. Since the eigenvalues are equal, LEM may recover a linear combination of the true factors and again the assumption of non-Gaussianity means that running fastICA on the output of LEM will provably recover the original independent factors.
