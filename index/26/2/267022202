Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to build moving trajectories for number-agnostic objects. Modern multi-object trackers commonly follow the tracking-by-detection strategy. Therefore, fooling detectors can be an effective solution but it usually requires attacks in multiple successive frames, resulting in low efficiency. Attacking association processes improves efficiency but may require model-specific design, leading to poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel False negative and False positive attack (F&F attack) mechanism: it perturbs the input image to erase original detections and to inject deceptive false alarms around original ones while integrating the association attack implicitly. The mechanism can produce effective identity switches against multi-object trackers by only fooling detectors in a few frames. To demonstrate the flexibility of the mechanism, we deploy it to three multi-object trackers (ByteTrack, SORT, and CenterTrack) which are enabled by two representative detectors (YOLOX and CenterNet). Comprehensive experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing attackers, revealing the vulnerability of the tracking-by-detection paradigm to detection attacks.
