This workshop will focus on many different issues related to software architecture representation, architectural modeling and model-based reasoning about architecture qualities. It will look at various ways to exploit existing practice and standards, such as the UML [1], and IEEE 1471:2000 Recommended practice for architectural representation [2], and how to make these standards and practices evolve, based on concrete user experience.
