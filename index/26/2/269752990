Electronic composites incorporate computing into physical materials, expanding the materiality of interactive systems for designers. In this research, we investigated acrylic as a substrate for electronics. Acrylic is valued for its visual and structural properties and is used widely in industrial design. We propose e-acrylic, an electronic composite that incorporates electronic circuits with acrylic sheets. Our approach to making this composite is centered on acrylic making practices that industrial designers are familiar with. We outline this approach systematically, including leveraging laser cutting to embed circuits into acrylic sheets, as well as different ways to shape e-acrylic into 3D objects. With this approach, we explored using e-acrylic to design interactive artifacts. We reflect on these applications to surface a design space of tangible interactive artifacts possible with this composite. We also discuss the implications of aligning electronics to an existing making practice, and working with the holistic materiality that e-acrylic embodies.
