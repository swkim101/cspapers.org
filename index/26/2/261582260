Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning is a challenge presented by binary classification problems where there is an abundance of unlabeled data along with a small number of positive data instances, which can be used to address chronic disease screening problem. State-of-the-art PU learning methods have resulted in the development of various risk estimators, yet they neglect the differences among distinct populations. To address this issue, we present a novel Positive-Unlabeled Learning Tree (PUtree) algorithm. PUtree is designed to take into account communities such as different age or income brackets, in tasks of chronic disease prediction. We propose a novel approach for binary decision-making, which hierarchically builds community-based PU models and then aggregates their deliverables. Our method can explicate each PU model on the tree for the optimized non-leaf PU node splitting. Furthermore, a mask-recovery data augmentation strategy enables sufficient training of the model in individual communities. Additionally, the proposed approach includes an adversarial PU risk estimator to capture hierarchical PU-relationships, and a model fusion network that integrates data from each tree path, resulting in robust binary classification results. We demonstrate the superior performance of PUtree as well as its variants on two benchmarks and a new diabetes-prediction dataset.
