Traditional blockchains execute transactions through the use of consensus mechanisms that guarantee reasonable expectations of integrity and finality. However, often these incur costs making the throughput of transactions orders of magnitude slower than their web2 counterparts. To address this drawback, so called L2 layers offload transactions from the main chain, called L1, execute these fast and anchor back the result of these transaction through succinct checkpoints. ZK-Rollups are emerging as compelling methods to establish the integrity of such checkpoints, by the use of compressed cryptographic proofs. However, the use of general purpose SNARKs still suffers from efficiency issues. We define a simple, but ubiquitous, account integrity constraint defined over a series of transactions and design a ZK-Rollup for transaction integrity using sumcheck arguments that exploits its simple structure and provides attractive efficiency benefits.
