Hardware image signal processing (ISP), aiming at converting RAW inputs to RGB images, consists of a series of processing blocks, each with multiple parameters. Traditionally, ISP parameters are manually tuned in isolation by imaging experts according to application-specific quality and performance metrics, which is time-consuming and biased towards human perception due to complex interaction with the output image. Since the relationship between any single parameterâ€™s variation and the output performance metric is a complex, non-linear function, optimizing such a large number of ISP parameters is challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Sequential ISP parameter optimization model, called the RL-SeqISP model, which utilizes deep reinforcement learning to jointly optimize all ISP parameters for a variety of imaging applications. Concretely, inspired by the sequential tuning process of human experts, the proposed model can progressively enhance image quality by seamlessly integrating information from both the image feature space and the parameter space. Furthermore, a dynamic parameter optimization module is introduced to avoid ISP parameters getting stuck into local optima, which is able to more effectively guarantee the optimal parameters resulting from the sequential learning strategy. These merits of the RL-SeqISP model as well as its high efficiency are substantiated by comprehensive experiments on a wide range of downstream tasks, including two visual analysis tasks (instance segmentation and object detection), and image quality assessment (IQA), as compared with representative methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. In particular, even using only 10% of the training data, our model outperforms other SOTA methods by an average of 7% mAP on two visual analysis tasks.
