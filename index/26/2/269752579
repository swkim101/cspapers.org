We present FoodSkin, a technique for adding interactive elements to foods by implementing edible circuits on the surface of the food. The circuit is easily fabricated using commercially available materials. Existing approaches to enhance the eating experience, such as presenting an electrical taste by making food part of an electronic circuit, are challenging to apply to foods with low water content due to their low conductivity. Our technique enables the integration of dry foods into an electronic circuit and provides displaying (e.g., smell or taste) and sensing (e.g., eating activity) functionalities. We describe our fabrication technique with a library of food materials that we can utilize, evaluate the conductivity and adhesion of the gold-leaf traces, introduce demonstrative applications, and conclude with a workshop we conducted to evaluate the accessibility of our technique. FoodSkin enriches the design space for the computer-augmented eating experience by enabling the digital fabrication of electronics on versatile materials, surfaces, and shapes of foods.
