Despite the widespread adoption of prompting, prompt tuning and prefix-tuning of transformer models, our theoretical understanding of these fine-tuning methods remains limited. A key question is whether one can arbitrarily modify the behavior of pretrained model by prompting or prefix-tuning it. Formally, whether prompting and prefix-tuning a pretrained model can universally approximate sequence-to-sequence functions. This paper answers in the affirmative and demonstrates that much smaller pretrained models than previously thought can be universal approximators when prefixed. In fact, the attention mechanism is uniquely suited for universal approximation with prefix-tuning a single attention head being sufficient to approximate any continuous function. Moreover, any sequence-to-sequence function can be approximated by prefixing a transformer with depth linear in the sequence length. Beyond these density-type results, we also offer Jackson-type bounds on the length of the prefix needed to approximate a function to a desired precision.
