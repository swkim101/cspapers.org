Usually, to apply game-theoretic methods, we must specify utilities
precisely, and we run the risk that the solutions we compute are not
robust to errors in this specification. Ordinal games provide an
attractive alternative: they require specifying only which outcomes
are preferred to which other ones. Unfortunately, they provide little
guidance for how to play unless there are pure Nash equilibria;
evaluating mixed strategies appears to fundamentally require cardinal
utilities.

In this paper, we observe that we can in fact make good use of mixed
strategies in ordinal games if we consider settings that allow for
folk theorems. These allow us to find equilibria that are robust, in
the sense that they remain equilibria no matter which cardinal
utilities are the correct ones -- as long as they are consistent with
the specified ordinal preferences. We analyze this concept and study
the computational complexity of finding such equilibria in a range of
settings.
