Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Transformers have been widely applied to skeleton-based human action recognition, with each offering unique advantages in capturing spatial relationships and long-range dependencies. However, for most GCN methods, the construction of topological structures relies solely on the spatial information of human joints, limiting their ability to directly capture richer spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, the self-attention modules of many Transformer methods lack topological structure information, restricting the robustness and generalization of the models. To address these issues, we propose a Joint Trajectory Graph (JTG) that integrates spatio-temporal information into a uniform graph structure. We also present a Joint Trajectory GraphFormer (JT-GraphFormer), which directly captures the spatio-temporal relationships among all joint trajectories for human action recognition. To better integrate topological information into spatio-temporal relationships, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Dijkstra Attention (STDA) mechanism to calculate relationship scores for all the joints in JTG. Furthermore, we incorporate the Koopman operator into the classification stage to enhance the model's representation ability and classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that JT-GraphFormer achieves outstanding performance in human action recognition tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and N-UCLA datasets.
