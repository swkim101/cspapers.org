Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS) is a pioneering solution in Crowd Computing, which integrates heterogeneous resources from cyber, physical, and social spaces, possessing collaborative capabilities in perception, computation, and control. However, existing CPSSs usually confine their functionality to rigid scenarios or tasks, and often oversimplify human resource modeling that fails to dynamically recognize human capabilities. In this work, we propose a Scenario-Driven CPSS to enable an adaptive resource choreography across scenarios. More concretely, we leverage temporal environments to identify events and disassemble these events into workflows, triggering the execution of corresponding capability units, where the capability units abstract the shared functionality of heterogeneous resource groups. Meanwhile, we improve the pre-assuming human capabilities to construct the relationship between human and their capabilities during the execution of workflows, sufficiently promoting human intelligence. Our real-world demo on fire rescue demonstrates the effectiveness of the solution.
