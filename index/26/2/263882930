By combining Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) as the feature set, we propose a novel human detection approach capable of handling partial occlusion. Two kinds of detectors, i.e., global detector for whole scanning windows and part detectors for local regions, are learned from the training data using linear SVM. For each ambiguous scanning window, we construct an occlusion likelihood map by using the response of each block of the HOG feature to the global detector. The occlusion likelihood map is then segmented by Mean-shift approach. The segmented portion of the window with a majority of negative response is inferred as an occluded region. If partial occlusion is indicated with high likelihood in a certain scanning window, part detectors are applied on the unoccluded regions to achieve the final classification on the current scanning window. With the help of the augmented HOG-LBP feature and the global-part occlusion handling method, we achieve a detection rate of 91.3% with FPPW= 10−6, 94.7% with FPPW= 10−5, and 97.9% with FPPW= 10−4 on the INRIA dataset, which, to our best knowledge, is the best human detection performance on the INRIA dataset. The global-part occlusion handling method is further validated using synthesized occlusion data constructed from the INRIA and Pascal dataset.
