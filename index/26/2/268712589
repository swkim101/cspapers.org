Deep Multi-view Graph Clustering (DMGC) aims to partition instances into different groups using the graph information extracted from multi-view data. The mainstream framework of DMGC methods applies graph neural networks to embed structure information into the view-specific representations and fuse them for the consensus representation. However, on one hand, we find that the graph learned in advance is not ideal for clustering as it is constructed by original multi-view data and localized connecting. On the other hand, most existing methods learn the consensus representation in a late fusion manner, which fails to propagate the structure relations across multiple views. Inspired by the observations, we propose a Structure-adaptive Unified gRaph nEural network for multi-view clusteRing (SURER), which can jointly learn a heterogeneous multi-view unified graph and robust graph neural networks for multi-view clustering. Specifically, we first design a graph structure learning module to refine the original view-specific attribute graphs, which removes false edges and discovers the potential connection. According to the view-specific refined attribute graphs, we integrate them into a unified heterogeneous graph by linking the representations of the same sample from different views. Furthermore, we use the unified heterogeneous graph as the input of the graph neural network to learn the consensus representation for each instance, effectively integrating complementary information from various views. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.
