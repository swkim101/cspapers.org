This is a report on JamCoders, a four-week long computer-science camp for high school students in Jamaica. The camp teaches college-level coding and algorithms, and targets academically excellent students in grades 9--11 (ages 14--17). Qualitative assessment shows that the camp was, in general terms, a success. We reflect on the background and academic structure of the camp and share key takeaways on designing and operating a successful camp. We analyze data collected before, during and after the camp and map the effects of demographic differences on student performance in camp. We conclude with a discussion on possible improvements on our approach.
