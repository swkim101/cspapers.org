Would you like to incorporate open source into your classes? Open source provides an unmatched opportunity for students to learn about large scale software, team processes, and tools that comprise professional software development. Using open source is helpful in motivating many software engineering concepts by providing scale, complexity, and on-going product evolution that is difficult to mimic in classroom-only materials. Finally, open source projects motivate students by providing an authentic, collaborative engagement environment for learning. Join us for a discussion with instructors on the myriad ways that open source software can be incorporated into classes or used to motivate students in clubs and extracurricular activities. Experienced instructors will provide examples that they've used in the classroom. Participants will be encouraged to provide examples and/or ask questions. Humanitarian open source software provides the added benefits of appealing to students who are interested in humanitarian application of computing, and providing an opportunity to introduce all students to computing for social good. The BoF organizers are focused on humanitarian open source, but encourage faculty with interest in using any type of open source in the classroom to join in this discussion.
