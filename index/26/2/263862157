The EC-funded R&D project, CROSSMARC, is developing technology for extracting information from domain-specific web pages, employing language technology methods as well as machine learning methods in order to facilitate technology porting to new domains. CROSSMARC also employs localisation methodologies and user modelling techniques in order to provide the results of extraction in accordance with the user's personal preferences and constraints. The system's implementation is based on a multi-agent architecture, which ensures a clear separation of responsibilities and provides the system with clear interfaces and robust and intelligent information processing capabilities.
