We introduce SEA-RAFT, a more simple, efficient, and accurate RAFT for optical flow. Compared with RAFT, SEA-RAFT is trained with a new loss (mixture of Laplace). It directly regresses an initial flow for faster convergence in iterative refinements and introduces rigid-motion pre-training to improve generalization. SEA-RAFT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the Spring benchmark with a 3.69 endpoint-error (EPE) and a 0.36 1-pixel outlier rate (1px), representing 22.9% and 17.8% error reduction from best published results. In addition, SEA-RAFT obtains the best cross-dataset generalization on KITTI and Spring. With its high efficiency, SEA-RAFT operates at least 2.3x faster than existing methods while maintaining competitive performance.
