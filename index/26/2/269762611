The field of SocialNLP stands at the confluence of two pivotal domains: natural language processing (NLP) and social computing, offering a multidisciplinary framework for exploring the intersections between these areas. This domain is characterized by its tri-directional focus. First, it endeavors to tackle prevalent challenges within the realm of social computing by leveraging advanced NLP methodologies. Second, it aims to address traditional NLP problems by harnessing the vast and dynamic data available from social networks and social media platforms. Third, SocialNLP is dedicated to identifying and solving emerging issues that lie at the nexus of social computing and NLP. The 12th iteration of the SocialNLP workshop, a hallmark event in this vibrant field, is scheduled to convene at TheWebConf (WWW) 2024. This edition has witnessed the acceptance of nine rigorously peer-reviewed papers, chosen from a competitive pool, reflecting an acceptance ratio of 53.8%. This achievement underscores the high caliber of research and the innovative approaches that the submitted works propose to advance the field of SocialNLP. The organizing committee extends its heartfelt gratitude to all contributing authors for their submissions, to the members of the program committee for their indispensable role in the rigorous review process, and to the workshop chairs for their visionary leadership and dedication. Their collective efforts have been instrumental in fostering an environment of academic excellence and collaboration that continues to drive forward the frontiers of knowledge in the interdisciplinary area of SocialNLP.
