Algorithms for the minimum-cost bipartite matching can be used to estimate Wasserstein distance between two distributions. Given two sets A and B of n points in a 2 -dimensional Euclidean space, one can use a fast implementation of the Hungarian method to compute a minimum-cost bipartite matching of A and B in ˜ O ( n 2 ) time. Let ∆ be the spread, i.e., the ratio of the distance of the farthest to the closest pair of points in A ∪ B . In this paper, we present a new algorithm to compute a minimum-cost bipartite matching of A and B with a similar worst-case execution time of ˜ O ( n 2 log ∆) . However, when A and B are drawn independently and identically from a fixed distribution that is not known to the algorithm, the execution time of our algorithm is, in expectation, ˜ O ( n 7 / 4 log ∆) . To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first one to achieve a sub-quadratic execution time even for stochastic point sets with real-valued coordinates. Our algorithm extends to any dimension d , where it runs in ˜ O ( n 2 − 12 d Φ( n )) time for stochastic point sets A and B ; here Φ( n ) is the query/update time of a dynamic weighted nearest neighbor data structure. Our algorithm can be seen as a careful adaptation of the Hungarian method in the geometric divide-and-conquer framework.
