Online advertising contributes a considerable part of the tech sector's revenue, and has been remarkably influencing the public agenda. With evolving developments, AI is playing an increasingly significant role in online advertising. We propose to create a forum for researchers, developers, users, ventures, policymakers, and other stakeholders to exchange ideas, research, innovations, etc. with emphasis on (1) AI driven mechanism design for distributing advertisements, (2) generative AI for creating content in advertisements, such as the promotion images/videos, and (3) ethics issues, especially in political advertisements, such as user privacy, fairness, hating speech, misinformation, etc. Relevant but not mentioned areas are also much encouraged. We plan to organize a half-day workshop.
