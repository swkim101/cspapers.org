Social computing platforms typically deal with data that are either related to humans or generated by humans. Consequently, effective design of these platforms needs to be cognizant ofsocial psychology theories. In this tutorial, we review and summarize the research thus far into the paradigm ofpsychology theory-informed design of social computing platforms where the design is guided by theories from social psychology in addition to theories from computer science. Specifically, we review techniques and frameworks that embrace this paradigm in the arena of social influence. In addition, we suggest open problems and new research directions.
