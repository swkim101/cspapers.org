This paper presents a case study regarding a comparative examination of the Louvain and Leiden community detection algorithms. The case study was conducted on a real-world communication network consisting of 3,222,623 nodes and 27,423,553 edges. In particular, the network in our case study models the communication between Twitter users during the initial four weeks of the 2022 war in Ukraine. In addition, we also applied dynamic topic modeling in order to examine differences in the detected communities.
