This study introduces a new method for detecting and localizing image forgery by focusing on manipulation traces within the noise domain. We posit that nearly invisible noise in RGB images carries tampering traces, useful for distinguishing and locating forgeries. However, the advancement of tampering technology complicates the direct application of noise for forgery detection, as the noise inconsistency between forged and authentic regions is not fully exploited. To tackle this, we develop a two-step discriminative noise-guided approach to explicitly enhance the representation and use of noise inconsistencies, thereby fully exploiting noise information to improve the accuracy and robustness of forgery detection. Specifically, we first enhance the noise discriminability of forged regions compared to authentic ones using a de-noising network and a statistics-based constraint. Then, we merge a model-driven guided filtering mechanism with a data-driven attention mechanism to create a learnable and differentiable noise-guided filter. This sophisticated filter allows us to maintain the edges of forged regions learned from the noise. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method can reliably detect and localize forgeries, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.
