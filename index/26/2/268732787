Domain adaptation aims to alleviate the problem of retraining a pre-trained model when applying it to a different domain, which requires large amount of additional training data of the target domain. Such an objective is usually achieved by establishing connections between the source domain labels and target domain data. However, this imbalanced source-to-target one way pass may not eliminate the domain gap, which limits the performance of the pre-trained model. In this paper, we propose an innovative Dual-Scheme Fusion Network (DSFN) for unsupervised domain adaptation. By building both source-to-target and target-to-source connections, this balanced joint information flow helps reduce the domain gap to further improve the network performance. The mechanism is further applied to the inference stage, where both the original input target image and the generated source images are segmented with the proposed joint network. The results are fused to obtain more robust segmentation. Extensive experiments of unsupervised cross-modality medical image segmentation are conducted on two tasks -- brain tumor segmentation and cardiac structures segmentation. The experimental results show that our method achieved significant performance improvement over other state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.
