Bidders often take a long time to read and understand tender documents because they require specialized knowledge, and tender documents are generally long. Bidders first overview the specific items, such as payment and warranty, in a tender document and then check the overall document. Therefore, the function that can extract specific items (i.e., item extractor) and the function that can highlight words or phrases related to specific items (i.e., word-phrase highlighter) are in great demand. To develop the above two types of functions, we need to solve two problems. The first problem is the problem related to the annotated data set. The second problem concerns the BERT NER-based prediction approach in a small training dataset setting. To solve the first problem, we created two types of sequence labeling datasets related to Item Extractor and Word-Phrase Highlighter. To solve the second problem, we propose the Information Extraction (IE) method, which combines (1) a supervised learning approach using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and (2) a large language model (LLM)-based improver. We then developed the web application system called Tender Document Analyzer (TDDA), which includes "Item Extractor" and "Word-Phrase Highlighter". Experimental evaluation shows that our approach is practical. Firstly, the evaluation for extraction ability shows that the performance of our proposed method is much higher than the baseline approach that uses GPT 3.5, as well as demonstrates that the proposed LLM-based improver can improve the IE ability. In addition, the usability evaluation shows that bidders can solve the task in less time using our system.
