Prolonged screen time while working on programming assignments can often lead to student fatigue, boredom, and stress. In response to these issues and to enhance the overall programming environment for students, we introduce ThemeRec, a Visual Studio Code extension. ThemeRec provides students with personalized recommendations for code themes, with a particular focus on semantic coloring combinations. It boasts an extensive collection of over 150 code themes, each offering unique combinations of background colors, font styles, and semantic color arrangements. Using an integrated collaborative filtering recommendation system, ThemeRec automatically suggests and installs various themes based on the preferences of similar users whenever they want to change a theme. To assess the effectiveness of ThemeRec, we conducted an evaluation within an introductory-level programming course. The feedback from students has been positive and encouraging. This underscores the potential value that ThemeRec brings to programming courses.
