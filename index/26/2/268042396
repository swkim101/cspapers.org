Single image super-resolution (SISR) has made a significant breakthrough benefiting from the prevalent rise of deep neural networks and large-scale training samples. The mainstream deep SR models primarily focus on network architecture design as well as optimization schemes, while few pay attention to the training data. In fact, most of the existing SR methods train the model on uniformly sampled patch pairs from the whole image. However, the uneven image content makes the training data present an unbalanced distribution, i.e., the easily reconstructed region (smooth) occupies the majority of the data, while the hard reconstructed region (edge or texture) has rarely few samples. Based on this phenomenon, we consider rethinking the current paradigm of merely using uniform data sampling way for training SR models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Bi-Sampling Parameter Attribution (BSPA) method for accurate image SR. Specifically, the bi-sampling consists of uniform sampling and inverse sampling, which is introduced to reconcile the unbalanced inherent data bias. The former aims to keep the intrinsic data distribution, and the latter is designed to enhance the feature extraction ability of the model on the hard samples. Moreover, integrated gradient is introduced to attribute the contribution of each parameter in the alternate models trained by both sampling data so as to filter the trivial parameters for further dynamic refinement. By progressively decoupling the allocation of parameters, the SR model can learn a more compact representation. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposal can effectively boost the performance of baseline methods from the data re-sampling view.
