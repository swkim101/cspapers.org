Analyzing gene expression data from microarray devices has many important application in medicine and biology, but presents significant challenges to data mining. Microarray data typically has many attributes (genes) and few examples (samples), making the process of correctly analyzing such data difficult to formulate and prone to common mistakes. For this reason it is unusually important to capture and record good practices for this form of data mining. This paper presents a process for analyzing microarray data, including pre-processing, gene selection, randomization testing, classification and clustering; this process is captured with "Clementine Application Templates". The paper describes the process in detail and includes three case studies, showing how the process is applied to 2-class classification, multi-class classification and clustering analyses for publicly available microarray datasets.
