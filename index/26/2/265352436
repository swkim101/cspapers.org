The paradigm of mobile computing has shifted with the rise of mobile super apps, encompassing diverse services within single applications. These apps, featuring "miniapps," have gained popularity for their native app-like features and comprehensive ecosystems. However, this popularity has led to significant concerns about user data security and privacy. The Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Superapps (SaTS 2023), co-hosted with ACM CCS 2023, addresses these challenges. As super apps become essential for communication, entertainment, and commerce, the workshop fosters collaboration among researchers and practitioners. By tackling these concerns, the event aims to provide insights and solutions benefiting the security community, industry, and society. SaTS 2023 aims to illuminate these issues while promoting knowledge exchange and innovative problem-solving.
