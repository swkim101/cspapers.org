In the private residential sales market, obtaining orders for exterior design requires a proposal considering the constraints of the location and customer. The design summary is a proposal document that describes concepts at the earliest stage of exterior design. It not only appeals to the customer, but also is referenced in the design drawing. However, the quality varies depending on the skill of the creator because the construction of a design summary requires the knowledge of human experts. This paper aims to generate the design summary using generative AI. Firstly, we analyze the characteristics of the design summary to identify the essential elements. Then, we propose a sequence of prompts to generate the design summary. Finally, we conducted a comparative evaluation between design summaries created by experts and those generated by generative AI.
