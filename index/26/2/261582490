Decisions made by machine learning models can have lasting impacts, making long-term fairness a critical consideration. It has been observed that ignoring the long-term effect and directly applying fairness criterion in static settings can actually worsen bias over time. To address biases in sequential decision-making, we introduce a long-term fairness concept named Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT). This concept is seamlessly integrated into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to consider the future effects of actions on long-term fairness, thus providing a unified framework for fair sequential decision-making problems. ELBERT effectively addresses the temporal discrimination issues found in previous long-term fairness notions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the policy gradient of Long-term Benefit Rate can be analytically simplified to standard policy gradients. This simplification makes conventional policy optimization methods viable for reducing bias, leading to our bias mitigation approach ELBERT-PO. Extensive experiments across various diverse sequential decision-making environments consistently reveal that ELBERT-PO significantly diminishes bias while maintaining high utility.
