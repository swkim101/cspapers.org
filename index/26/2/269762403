Count questions are an important type of information need, though often present in noisy, contradictory, or semantically not fully aligned form on the Web. In this work, we propose CardiO, a lightweight and modular framework for searching entity counts on the Web. CardiO extracts all counts from a set of relevant Web snippets, and infers the most central count based on semantic and numeric distances from other candidates. In the absence of supporting evidence, the system relies on peer sets of similar size, to provide an estimate. Experiments show that CardiO can produce accurate and traceable counts better than small LLM-only methods. Although larger models have higher precision, when used to enhance CardiO components, they do not contribute to the final precision or recall.
