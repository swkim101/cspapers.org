Our hypothesis is that certain clauses have foreground functions in text, 
while other clauses have background functions and that these functions are 
expressed or reflected in the syntactic structure of the clause. 
 
Presumably these clauses will have differing utility for automatic 
approaches to text understanding; a summarization system might want to 
utilize background clauses to capture commonalities between numbers of 
documents while an indexing system might use foreground clauses in order to 
capture specific characteristics of a certain document.
