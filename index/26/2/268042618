This paper presents Decorate3D, a versatile and user-friendly method for the creation and editing of 3D objects using images. Decorate3D models a real-world object of interest by neural radiance field (NeRF) and decomposes the NeRF representation into an explicit mesh representation, a view-dependent texture, and a diffuse UV texture. Subsequently, users can either manually edit the UV or provide a prompt for the automatic generation of a new 3D-consistent texture. To achieve high-quality 3D texture generation, we propose a structure-aware score distillation sampling method to optimize a neural UV texture based on user-defined text and empower an image diffusion model with 3D-consistent generation capability. Furthermore, we introduce a few-view resampling training method and utilize a super-resolution model to obtain refined high-resolution UV textures (2048 Ã— 2048) for 3D texturing. Extensive experiments collectively validate the superior performance of Decorate3D in retexturing real-world 3D objects. Project
