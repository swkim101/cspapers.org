We address the problem of (a) predicting the trajectory of an arm reaching motion, based on a few seconds of the motion’s onset, and (b) leveraging this predictor to facilitate shared-control manipulation tasks, by reducing the operator’s cognitive load through assistance in their anticipated direction of motion. Our novel intent estimator, dubbed the Robot Trajectron (RT), produces a probabilistic representation of the robot’s anticipated trajectory based on its recent position, velocity and acceleration history. By taking arm dynamics into account, RT can capture the operator’s intent better than other SOTA models that only use the arm’s position, making it particularly well-suited to assist in tasks where the operator’s intent is susceptible to change. We derive a novel shared-control solution that combines RT’s predictive capacity to a representation of the locations of potential reaching targets. Our experiments demonstrate RT’s effectiveness in both intent estimation and shared-control tasks. We will make the code and data supporting our experiments publicly available at https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/detry-lab/public/robot-trajectron
