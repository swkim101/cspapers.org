Capturing high frame rate and high dynamic range (HFR&HDR) color videos in high-speed scenes with conventional frame-based cameras is very challenging. The increasing frame rate is usually guaranteed by using shorter exposure time so that the captured video is severely interfered by noise. Alternating exposures can alleviate the noise issue but sacrifice frame rate due to involving long-exposure frames. The neuromorphic spiking camera records high-speed scenes of high dynamic range without colors using a completely different sensing mechanism and visual representation. We introduce a hybrid camera system composed of a spiking and an alternating-exposure RGB camera to capture HFR&HDR scenes with high fidelity. Our insight is to bring each camera's superiority into full play. The spike frames, with accurate fast motion information encoded, are firstly reconstructed for motion representation, from which the spike-based optical flows guide the recovery of missing temporal information for long-exposure RGB images while retaining their reliable color appearances. With the strong temporal constraint estimated from spike trains, both missing and distorted colors cross RGB frames are recovered to generate time-consistent and HFR color frames. We collect a new Spike-RGB dataset that contains 300 sequences of synthetic data and 20 groups of real-world data to demonstrate 1000 FPS HDR videos outperforming HDR video reconstruction methods and commercial high-speed cameras.
