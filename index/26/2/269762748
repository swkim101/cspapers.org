Intergroup dehumanisation represents a pressing concern for today's society. It hinders empathy, prosocial behaviour, and contributes to between-group aggression. Its consequences are particularly dangerous in the context of international military conflicts as dehumanisation contributes to support for war, war-related violence, and usually accompanies genocidal conflicts. This motivated the focus of this study on the blatant forms of dehumanisation towards an outgroup defined in political or national terms, with a specific focus on the relations between Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarusians around the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The study draws attention to previously under-researched aspect in outgroup dehumanisation, specifically the role of ingroup perception in it. Outgroup dehumanisation involves excluding the outgroup from the community one identifies with, thus reinforcing the boundary between ingroup and outgroup. This highlights the comparative nature of dehumanisation, suggesting its basis might lie more in comparative ingroup superiority bias rather than in outgroup inferiority bias. Existing research however generally concentrates solely on negative aspects of outgroup perception in dehumanising attitudes. While some studies have gauged dehumanisation through ingroup-outgroup perception differences, they lacked a ground truth measure for dehumanisation, leaving its comparative nature largely unexamined. Employing generative Large Language Model, we develop a dataset of Telegram channels posts, classified as dehumanising or neutral. Utilising NLP tools we analyse the role of ingroup-outgroup perception disparities in dehumanisation, specifically addressing its relation to affective polarisation.
