Situated visualization blends data into the real world to fulfill individuals’ contextual information needs. However, interacting with situated visualization in public environments faces challenges posed by users’ acceptance and contextual constraints. To explore appropriate interaction design, we first conduct a formative study to identify users’ needs for data and interaction. Informed by the findings, we summarize appropriate interaction modalities with eye-based, hand-based and spatially-aware object interaction for situated visualization in public environments. Then, through an iterative design process with six users, we explore and implement interactive techniques for activating and analyzing with situated visualization. To assess the effectiveness and acceptance of these interactions, we integrate them into an AR prototype and conduct a within-subjects study in public scenarios using conventional hand-only interactions as the baseline. The results show that participants preferred our prototype over the baseline, attributing their preference to the interactions being more acceptable, flexible, and practical in public.
