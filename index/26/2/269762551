Distributed Transparent Data Layer (DTDL) aims to overcome the significant storage inefficiencies in blockchain technology. The proposed scheme enhances scalability and enables broader adoption by allowing nodes to store only portions of the blockchain history, diverging from traditional methods like sharding. It consists of three main components: a transparent authentication scheme, a verifiable search tree, and a data availability sampling scheme, supporting diverse applications including zero-knowledge machine learning. This approach not only maintains transparency to the blockchain's upper layer but also offers seamless integration with existing systems without requiring forks. Additionally, the paper introduces an innovative transparent authentication method for Luby Transform (LT) codes using KZG commitments, enabling efficient and secure verification of encoded symbols without decoding. Addressing the challenges of data outsourcing in blockchain, our proposed model ensures data integrity and robust security in a potentially malicious publisher environment, marking a significant advancement in blockchain storage and data integrity solutions.
