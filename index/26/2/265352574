The problem of finding the kth Ranked Element (KRE) is of particular interest in collaborative studies for financial and medical agencies alike. Many of the applications of KRE deal with sensitive information that needs to be protected. The protocol by Chandran et al. (SECRYPT'22) considers a model where multiple parties hold datasets with many elements and wish to compute the kth element of their joint dataset. In their model, all participating parties interact with a central party in a star network topology. However, they leak some intermediate information to the central party. In this work we use differential privacy techniques to hide this leakage. We use the Laplace mechanism for introducing differentially private noise and use sigmoid scaling to improve the accuracy of the protocol. We show that our modifications have only a small impact on the accuracy. We also give experimental performance results and compare our work to the previous works on KRE.
