Wikipedia is a highly essential platform because of its informative, dynamic, and easily accessible nature. To identify topics/titles warranting their own Wikipedia article, editors of Wikipedia defined "Notability" guidelines. So far notability is enforced by humans, which makes scalability an issue. There has been no significant work on Notability determination for titles with complex category dependencies. We design a mechanism to identify such titles. We construct a dataset with 9k such titles and propose a category-agnostic approach utilizing Graph neural networks, for their notability determination. Our system outperforms machine learning-based, transformer-based classifiers and entity salience methods. It provides a scalable alternative for notability detection.
