It is commonly perceived that fake news and real news exhibit distinct writing styles, such as the use of sensationalist versus objective language. However, we emphasize that style-related features can also be exploited for style-based attacks. Notably, the advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) has empowered malicious actors to mimic the style of trustworthy news sources, doing so swiftly, cost-effectively, and at scale. Our analysis reveals that LLM-camouflaged fake news content significantly undermines the effectiveness of state-of-the-art text-based detectors (up to 38% decrease in F1 Score), implying a severe vulnerability to stylistic variations. To address this, we introduce SheepDog, a style-robust fake news detector that prioritizes content over style in determining news veracity. SheepDog achieves this resilience through (1) LLM-empowered news reframings that inject style diversity into the training process by customizing articles to match different styles; (2) a style-agnostic training scheme that ensures consistent veracity predictions across style-diverse reframings; and (3) content-focused veracity attributions that distill content-centric guidelines from LLMs for debunking fake news, offering supplementary cues and potential intepretability that assist veracity prediction. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate SheepDog's style robustness and adaptability to various backbones.
