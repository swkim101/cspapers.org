In the last few years, a lot of the activity of the computational social choice community has focused on novel mechanisms for reaching decisions by large groups of people. While this research makes meaningful scientific contributions, many of these mechanisms are not quite useful in realistic decision-making settings. Moreover, their radicalism ignores the centuries-old experience we have with large-scale human decision-making, and what it teaches us about what works. We believe it is important the community engage with mechanisms which are widely-used in the real world, as they may hold a key to a deeper understanding of how people reach decisions and the way that helps them do that productively. Moreover, letting the community bring its analysis and understanding to these will allow for algorithmic suggestions that have some chance of being implemented (and, thus, can contribute to the public debate on these topics). In particular, we highlight the relatively less-investigated role of parties and grouping of voters and candidates, and the role of executive capacity in analyzing decision-making structures.
