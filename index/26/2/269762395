In the modern Web landscape, data privacy and control are increasingly unattainable for users. Solid 1, a decentralized Web ecosystem, restores individual privacy and control by separating data from applications, allowing integration across applications while enabling users to control access. The growth in Solid's decentralized pods, and the escalating amounts of data stored in them, necessitate a decentralized search mechanism to query data within personal datastores, while respecting varying access constraints. This demo paper presents our decentralized search system (ESPRESSO) for querying RDF and non-RDF data in Solid datastores, tackling challenges like query propagation, data indexing, privacy, and results aggregation.
