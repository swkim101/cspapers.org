Communication in collaboration, especially synchronous, remote communication, is crucial to the success of task-specific goals. Insufficient or excessive forms of communication may lead to detrimental effects on task performance while increasing mental fatigue. However, identifying which combinations of communication modalities provide the most efficient transfer of information in collaborative settings will greatly improve collaboration. To investigate this, we developed a remote, synchronous, asymmetric VR collaborative assembly task application, where users play the role of either mentor or mentee, and were exposed to different combinations of three communication modalities: voice, gestures, and gaze. Through task-based experiments with 25 pairs of participants (50 individuals), we evaluated quantitative and qualitative data and found that gaze did not differ significantly from multiple combinations of communication modalities. Our qualitative results indicate that mentees experienced more difficulty and frustration in completing tasks than mentors, with both types of users preferring all three modalities to be present.
