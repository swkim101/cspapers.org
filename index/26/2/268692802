Fair allocation of indivisible goods presents intriguing challenges from both a social choice perspective and an algorithmic standpoint. Due to the indivisibility of goods, it is common for one agent to envy the bundle of goods assigned to another agent and, indeed, envy-free solutions do not exist in general. In line with the classical game-theoretic concept of Nucleolus in coalitional games, we propose that a fair allocation should minimize the agents’ dissatisfaction profile in a lexicographic manner, where the dissatisfaction of an agent is defined as her maximum envy towards other agents. Therefore, we seek allocations that minimize the maximum envy. In cases where multiple solutions have an equal maximum value, we minimize the second-worst value, and so on. Additionally, as is customary in fair division problems, we also consider an efficiency requirement: among the allocations with the best agents’ dissatisfaction profile, we prioritize those that maximize the sum of agents’ utilities, known as maximum social welfare. Such allocations, referred to as maxileximin allocations, always exist.
In this study, we analyze the computational properties of maxileximin allocations in the context of fair allocation problems with constraints. Specifically, we focus on the Connected Fair Division problem, where goods correspond to the nodes of a graph, and a bundle of goods is allowed if the subgraph formed by those goods is connected. We demonstrate that the problem is F∆P2 -complete, even for instances with simple graphical structures such as path and star graphs.
However, we identify islands of tractability for instances with more intricate graphs, such as those having bounded treewidth, provided that the number of agents is bounded by a fixed number and utility functions use small values.
