With the recent growth in popularity of alternative evaluation methods, two methodologies have become particularly prevalent in CS education literature: Specifications grading and contract grading. Recent work has shown that these novel evaluation approaches can have positive impacts in the classroom and lead to more equitable outcomes for students. However, there is not yet a consensus on terminology, implementation details and best practices. In this work, we review the literature on the use of specifications and contract grading in CS education. We find that while there is a good deal of promising research, there is a great deal of variation in methodologies and a sparsity of evaluation of the efficacy of learning outcomes.
