Trip recommendation aims to plan userâ€™s travel based on their specified preferences. Traditional heuristic and statistical approaches often fail to capture the intricate nuances of user intentions, leading to subpar performance. Recent deep-learning methods show attractive accuracy but struggle to generate faithful trajectories that match user intentions. In this work, we propose a DDPM-based incremental knowledge injection module to ensure the faithfulness of the generated trajectories. Experiments on two datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.
