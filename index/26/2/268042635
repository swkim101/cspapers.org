We study robust adversarial training of two-layer neural networks as a bi-level optimization problem. In particular, for the inner loop that implements the adversarial attack during training using projected gradient descent (PGD), we propose maximizing a lower bound on the 0 / 1 -loss by reflecting a surrogate loss about the origin. This allows us to give a convergence guarantee for the inner-loop PGD attack. Furthermore, assuming the data is linearly separable, we provide precise iteration complexity results for end-to-end adversarial training, which holds for any width and initialization. We provide empirical evidence to support our theoretical results.
