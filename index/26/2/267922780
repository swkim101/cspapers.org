Graph alignment in two correlated random graphs refers to the task of identifying the correspondence between vertex sets of the graphs. Recent results have characterized the exact informationtheoretic threshold for graph alignment in correlated Erdős-Rényi graphs. However, very little is known about the existence of efficient algorithms to achieve graph alignment without seeds. In this work we identify a region in which a straightforward O(n11/5 logn)-time canonical labeling algorithm, initially introduced in the context of graph isomorphism, succeeds in aligning correlated Erdős-Rényi graphs. The algorithm has two steps. In the first step, all vertices are labeled by their degrees and a trivial minimum distance alignment (i.e., sorting vertices according to their degrees) matches a fixed number of highest degree vertices in the two graphs. Having identified this subset of vertices, the remaining vertices are matched using a alignment algorithm for bipartite graphs.
