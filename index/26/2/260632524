We present an application in topological map building and localization with a high resolution omnidirectional camera. A visual map uses sift features in combination with affinely invariant Harris corners as its feature points. We use an automatic scheme to find correspondences from a video sequence to create the map. Loop-back is also detected automatically while the map is built. For localization, we use a vote transfer technique that uses prior knowledge about correspondences within the map to localize a query image instead of a majority vote.
