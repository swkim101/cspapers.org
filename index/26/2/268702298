Information sharing through communication is essential for tackling complex multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. Many existing multi-agent communication protocols can be viewed as instances of message passing graph neural networks (GNNs). However, due to the significantly limited expressive ability of the standard GNN method, the agent feature representations remain similar and indistinguishable even though the agents have different neighborhood structures. This further results in the homogenization of agent behaviors and reduces the capability to solve tasks effectively. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent communication protocol via identity-aware learning (IDEAL), which explicitly enhances the distinguishability of agent feature representations to break the diversity bottleneck. Specifically, IDEAL extends existing multi-agent communication protocols by inductively considering the agents' identities during the message passing process. To obtain expressive feature representations for a given agent, IDEAL first extracts the ego network centered around that agent and then performs multiple rounds of heterogeneous message passing, where different parameter sets are applied to the central agent and the other surrounding agents within the ego network. IDEAL fosters expressive communication between agents and generates distinguishable feature representations, which promotes action diversity and individuality emergence. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate IDEAL can be flexibly integrated into various multi-agent communication methods and enhances the corresponding performance.
