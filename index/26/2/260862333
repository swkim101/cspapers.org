In multi-label classification, it is critical to capitalize on complicated data structures and semantic relationships. Metric learning serves as an effective strategy to provide a better measurement of distances between examples. Existing works on metric learning for multi-label classification mainly learn one single global metric that characterizes latent semantic similarity between multi-label instances. However, such single-semantics metric exploitation approaches can not capture the intrinsic properties of multi-label data possessed of rich semantics. In this paper, the first attempt towards multi-semantics metric learning for multi-label classification is investigated. Specifically, the proposed LIMIC approach simultaneously learns one global and multiple label-specific local metrics by exploiting label-specific side information. The global metric is learned to capture the commonality across all the labels and label-specific local metrics characterize the individuality of each semantic space. The combination of global metric and label-specific local metrics is utilized to construct latent semantic space for each label, in which similar intra-class instances are pushed closer and inter-class instances are pulled apart. Furthermore, metric-based label correlation regularization is constructed to maintain similarity between correlated label spaces. Extensive experiments on benchmark multi-label data sets validate the superiority of our proposed approach in learning effective distance metrics for multi-label classification.
