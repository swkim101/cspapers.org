Action segmentation serves as a pivotal component in comprehending videos, encompassing the learning of a sequence of semantically consistent action units known as actoms. Conventional methodologies tend to require a significant consumption of time for both training and learning phases. This paper introduces an innovative unsupervised framework for action segmentation in video, characterized by its fast learning capability and absence of mandatory training. The core idea involves splitting the video into distinct actoms, which are then merging together based on shared actions. The key challenge here is to prevent the inadvertent creation of singular actoms that attempt to represent multiple actions during the splitting phase. Additionally, it is crucial to avoid situations where actoms associated with the same action are incorrectly grouped into multiple clusters during the merging phase. In this paper, we present a method for calculating the similarity between adjacent frames under a subspace assumption. Then, we employ a local minimum searching procedure, which effectively splits the video into coherent actoms aligned with their semantic meaning and provides us an action segmentation proposal. Subsequently, we calculate a spatio-temporal similarity between actoms, followed by developing a merging process to merge actoms representing identical actions within the action segmentation proposals. Our approach is evaluated on four benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Besides, our method also achieves the optimal balance between accuracy and learning time when compared to existing unsupervised techniques. Code is available at https://github.com/y66y/SaM.
