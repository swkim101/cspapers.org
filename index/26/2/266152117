Memory safety issues are a persistent source of security vulnerabilities, with conventional architectures and the C codebase chronically prone to exploitable errors. The CHERI research project has shown how one can provide radically improved security for that existing codebase with minimal modification, using unforgeable hardware capabilities in place of machine-word pointers in CHERI dialects of C, implemented as adaptions of Clang/LLVM and GCC. CHERI was first prototyped as extensions of MIPS and RISC-V; it is currently being evaluated by Arm and others with the Arm Morello experimental architecture, processor, and platform, to explore its potential for mass-market adoption, and by Microsoft in their CHERIoT design for embedded cores. There is thus considerable practical experience with CHERI C implementation and use, but exactly what CHERI C's semantics is (or should be) remains an open question. In this paper, we present the first attempt to rigorously and comprehensively define CHERI C semantics, discuss key semantics design questions relating to capabilities, provenance, and undefined behaviour, and clarify them with semantics in multiple complementary forms: in prose, as an executable semantics adapting the Cerberus C semantics, and mechanised in Coq. This establishes a solid foundation for CHERI C, for those porting code to it, for compiler implementers, and for future semantics and verification.
