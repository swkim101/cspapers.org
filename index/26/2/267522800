We introduce Edu-ConvoKit, an open-source library designed to handle pre-processing, annotation and analysis of conversation data in education. Resources for analyzing education conversation data are scarce, making the research challenging to perform and therefore hard to access. We address these challenges with Edu-ConvoKit. Edu-ConvoKit is open-source [1], pip-installable [2], with comprehensive documentation [3]. Our demo video is available at: https://youtu.be/zdcI839vAko?si=h9qlnl76ucSuXb8-. We include additional resources, such as Colab applications of Edu-ConvoKit to three diverse education datasets [4] and a repository of Edu-ConvoKit-related papers [5].[1] https://github.com/stanfordnlp/edu-convokit[2] https://pypi.org/project/edu-convokit/[3] https://edu-convokit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[4] https://github.com/stanfordnlp/edu-convokit?tab=readme-ov-file#datasets-with-edu-convokit[5] https://github.com/stanfordnlp/edu-convokit/blob/main/papers.md
