Modular Neural Networks (MNNs) demonstrate various advantages over monolithic models.Existing MNNs are generally \textit{explicit}: their modular architectures are pre-defined, with individual modules expected to implement distinct functions.Recent works reveal that there exists \textit{implicit} modularity in standard pre-trained transformers, namely \textit{Emergent Modularity}.They indicate that such modular structures spontaneously exhibit during the early pre-training phase.Despite the benefits of modularity, most Language Models (LMs) are still treated as monolithic models in the pre-train and fine-tune paradigm, with their emergent modularity locked and underutilized.In this work, focusing on unlocking the emergent modularity in LMs, we showcase that standard LMs could be fine-tuned as their Mixture-of-Expert (MoEs) counterparts without introducing any extra parameters. Such MoEs are derived from emergent modularity and are referred to as Emergent MoEs (EMoE).Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning EMoE effectively improves downstream in-domain and out-of-domain generalization compared with vanilla fine-tuning.Our analysis and ablation studies further illustrate that it is robust to various configurations and can scale up to Large Language Models (i.e., Llama2-7B and Llama-30B).
