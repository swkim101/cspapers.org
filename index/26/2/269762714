Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOs) feature intricate virtual economies that permeate various in-game activities. However, the balancing act between profitability and equality in MMO economic design proves to be a persistent conundrum, especially in nascent business models like Pay-to-Win (P2W). Conventional efforts are curtailed by two primary constraints: the inability to verify and the provision of suboptimal solutions. In light of these predicaments, this paper delves into MMO economies and explores the promising potential of integrating emerging AI methodologies into economic design. Specifically, we introduce a novel hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) solution for achieving Pareto optimality between profitability and equality in P2W economies. Leveraging our substantial industrial acumen and expertise, we establish an economic simulation environment that facilitates authentic and realistic assessments of MMO economic evolution. Building upon this foundation, we reconceptualize the P2W economic design process within the paradigm of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and tackle it as a standard RL problem. Comprehensive evaluations corroborate that our solution demonstrates consistent personality specialization in economic simulations akin to real-world MMOs and significantly outperforms other baselines in economic design. Further discussions highlight its superiority in both frontier research and practical applications within the game industry.
