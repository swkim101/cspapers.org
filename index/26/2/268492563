This demo presents a hands-on opportunity for users to explore a new, immersive, node-based platform for creative coding in virtual reality (VR). The Embodied Coding Environment (ECE) is a merged digital/physical workspace where coding tools, spatial representations of code, the scenes that are the output of the code, and user editing histories are co-located in a 3D space. Visual programming languages (VPL) have been used as an alternative to text-based programming since Sketchpad in 1963. However, the ECE transforms visual programming into an immersive experience, allowing users to enter the world where they are actively coding. Beyond immersion, embodied coding allows users to leverage 3D space to organize, annotate, and interact with their code in ways that would not be possible through 2D representation. Our research goals center on understanding how embodied coding can make learning to code more intuitive and elicit heightened engagement through the learning process. Demo visitors will experience embodied coding first hand through simple programming tasks (e.g., spawning objects, using arrays, creating conditional statements, and more) presented in the ECE via a Meta Quest 2 system. Presenters will guide users through the coding activities and discuss future directions. Handouts with brief descriptions of the ECE platform with links to embodiedcode.net will be available. Access to the website will allow users to login and save their projects.
