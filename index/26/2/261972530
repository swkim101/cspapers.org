The purpose of this panel is to explore ways to encourage and support undergraduate research in computer science and information technology. Specifically we will discuss ways that faculty members can fund and develop their own undergraduate research programs, as well as ways they can encourage their students to apply to existing programs. Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) are programs established to promote and support undergraduate research and encourage students to continue their education and research after graduation. Perhaps the best known REU programs are those funded by the National Science Foundation. However we use the more general term REU to refer to any research experience for undergraduates regardless of funding source. It is anticipated that the panel focus will be on summer NSF REUs, but panelists will also discuss undergraduate research programs that may be sponsored by other agencies and/or on-going during the school year. The panel will seek input from the audience on their experiences with all forms of REUs.
