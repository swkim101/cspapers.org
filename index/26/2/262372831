This paper discusses the software architecture of Impromptu, a mobile IP-based audio computing platform, with an associated set of network-based applications and services. Impromptu merges the communication properties and universal mobility of the telephone with the multi-tasking and open protocol world of the handheld PC. Its supporting architecture handles multiple streaming audio applications, provides speech services for consistent audio user interfaces across applications, and enables user management of these varied applications running simultaneously.
