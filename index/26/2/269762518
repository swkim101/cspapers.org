Since the inception of the Internet and WWW, providing the time among multiple nodes on the Internet has been one of the most critical challenges. David Mills is the pioneer to provide time on the Internet, inventing the Network Time Protocol (NTP), and synchronizing the clocks in computer systems. Now, the NTP is predominantly used on the Internet and WWW. In this paper, we revisit the NTP, and present the overview of the NTP. In particular, we highlight the advanced research effort, the SpaceNTP, to synchronize the clocks among assets and entities in space. The SpaceNTP designed for space environments will be the fundamental medium and enabling block to provide the future web services in space.
