Most current long-tailed classification approaches assume the cost-agnostic scenario, where the training distribution of classes is long-tailed while the testing distribution of classes is balanced. Meanwhile, the misclassification costs of all instances are the same. On the other hand, in many real-world applications, it is more proper to assume that the training and testing distributions of classes are the same, while the misclassification cost of tail-class instances is varied. In this work, we model such a scenario as cost-aware long-tailed classification, in which the identification of high-cost tail instances and focusing learning on them thereafter is essential. In consequence, we propose the learning strategy of augmenting new instances based on adaptive region partition in the feature space. We conduct theoretical analysis to show that under the assumption
that the feature-space distance and the misclassification cost are correlated, the identification of high-cost tail instances can be realized by building region partitions with a low variance of risk within each region. The resulting AugARP approach could significantly outperform baseline approaches on both benchmark datasets and real-world product sales datasets.
