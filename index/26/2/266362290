Despite weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) being a promising step toward evading strong instance-level annotations, its capability is confined to closed-set categories within a single training dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised open-vocabulary object detection framework, namely WSOVOD, to extend traditional WSOD to detect novel concepts and utilize diverse datasets with only image-level annotations. To achieve this, we explore three vital strategies, including dataset-level feature adaptation, image-level salient object localization, and region-level vision-language alignment. First, we perform data-aware feature extraction to produce an input-conditional coefficient, which is leveraged into dataset attribute prototypes to identify dataset bias and help achieve cross-dataset generalization. Second, a customized location-oriented weakly supervised region proposal network is proposed to utilize high-level semantic layouts from the category-agnostic segment anything model to distinguish object boundaries. Lastly, we introduce a proposal-concept synchronized multiple-instance network, i.e., object mining and refinement with visual-semantic alignment, to discover objects matched to the text embeddings of concepts. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and MS COCO demonstrate that the proposed WSOVOD achieves new state-of-the-art compared with previous WSOD methods in both close-set object localization and detection tasks. Meanwhile, WSOVOD enables cross-dataset and open-vocabulary learning to achieve on-par or even better performance than well-established fully-supervised open-vocabulary object detection (FSOVOD).
