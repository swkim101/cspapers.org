By encrypting the data of infected hosts, cryptographic ransomware has caused billions of dollars in financial losses to a wide range of victims. Many detection techniques have been proposed to counter ransomware threats over the past decade. Their common approach is to monitor I/O behaviors from user space and apply custom heuristics to discriminate ransomware. These techniques implicitly assume that ransomware behaves very differently from benign programs in terms of heuristics. However, when we investigated the behavior of benign and ransomware programs, we found that the boundary between their behaviors was blurred. A ransomware program can still achieve its goal even though it follows the behavior patterns of benign programs. In this paper, we aim to explore the limits of ransomware detection techniques that based on I/O behaviors. To this end, we present Animagus, an imitation-based ransomware attack that imitates behaviors of benign programs to disguise its encryption tasks. It first learns behavior patterns from a benign program, and then spawns and orchestrates child processes to perform encryption tasks behaving the same as the benign program. We evaluate its effectiveness against six state-of-the-art detection techniques, and the results show that it can successfully evade these defenses. We investigate in detail why they are ineffective and how Animagus is different from existing ransomware samples. In the end, we discuss potential countermeasures and the benefits that detection tools can gain from our work.
