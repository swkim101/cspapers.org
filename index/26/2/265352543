Phishing is one of the most popular cyberspace attacks. Phishing detection has been integrated into mainstream browsers to provide online protection. The phishing detector of Google Chrome reports millions of phishing attacks per week. However, it has been proven to be vulnerable to evasion attacks. Currently, Google has upgraded Chrome/Chromium's phishing detector, introducing a CNN-based image classifier. The robustness of the new-generation detector is unclear. If it can be bypassed, its billions of users will be exposed to sophisticated attackers. This paper presents a critical evaluation of Google's phishing detector by targeted evasion testing, and investigates corresponding defensive techniques. First, we propose a three-stage evasion method against the phishing image classifier. The experiments show that it can be completely bypassed with adversarial phishing pages generated using the proposed method. Meanwhile, the phishing pages still preserve their visual utility. Second, we introduce two defense techniques to enhance the phishing detection model. The results show that even using lightweight defense methods can significantly improve the model robustness. Our research reveals that Google's new-generation phishing classifier is very vulnerable to targeted evasion attacks. A sophisticated phishers can know how to fool the classifier. Billions of Chrome users are being exposed to potential phishing attacks. To improve its robustness, necessary security enhancements should be introduced.
