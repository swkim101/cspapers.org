Finding the best short- or long-term accommodation is troublesome in unknown areas. Current tools provided by the real-estate market offer valuable information regarding the property, such as price, photos, and descriptions of the space; however, this market has little explored other relevant information regarding the surrounding area, such as what is nearby and users' subjective perception of the property's area. To address this gap, we propose REAL-UP, an interactive tool designed to enrich real-estate marketplaces. In addition to information commonly provided by such applications, e.g., rent price, REAL-UP also provides subjective neighborhood information based on Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) messages. This novel tool helps to represent complex users' subjective perceptions of urban areas, which could ease the process of finding the best accommodation.
