Aligned text-image encoders such as CLIP have become the de-facto model for vision-language tasks. Further-more, modality-specific encoders achieve impressive per-formances in their respective domains. This raises a cen-tral question: does an alignment exist between uni-modal vision and language encoders since they fundamentally rep-resent the same physical world? Analyzing the latent spaces structure of vision and language models on image-caption benchmarks using the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), we find that the representation spaces of unaligned and aligned encoders are semantically similar. In the absence of statistical similarity in aligned encoders like CLIP, we show that a possible matching of unaligned encoders exists with-out any training. We frame this as a seeded graph-matching problem exploiting the semantic similarity between graphs and propose two methods - a Fast Quadratic Assignment Problem optimization, and a novel localized CKA metric-based matching/retrieval. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this on several downstream tasks including cross-lingual, cross-domain caption matching and image classification.
