Financial supervision plays a pivotal role in society as it provides early warnings of financial activities and aids the government in detecting financial crimes. Detecting anomalous activities from normal financial activities is extremely challenging due to their disguise and complexity. However, existing anomaly detection methods in real-world financial scenarios typically suffer from some limitations: (a) Their formulations are overly simplistic to effectively identify complex anomalies; (b) Machine learning-based anomaly-detection methods lack enough training label, interpretability, and confidence, making it difficult to obtain approval from governments or financial institutions; (c) Many of them only focus on the financial transaction itself, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of transaction and social relationships. To circumvent the challenges mentioned above, this paper proposes a novel anomaly-detection framework to detect the anomalies from disguised normal financial activities and infer clue chains for them. In particular, we are the first to formalize ten anomalies by reference to actual bank statements, and then three types of anomaly-detecting algorithms are proposed to discover these anomalies from financial activities. Next, we utilize an intelligent search algorithm to trace the most suspicious activities (clue chains) for institutions, improving the interpretability compared with learning-based methods. More importantly, we developed an anomaly-detection system, Themis, to detect these complex financial anomalies, which has been deployed in some real scenarios. The performance of Themis is demonstrated through some comprehensive extensive experiments and case studies on synthetic datasets and real bank statements.
