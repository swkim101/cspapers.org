Researchers have extensively explored how password creation policies influence the security and usability of user-chosen passwords, producing evidence-based policy guidelines. However, for web authentication to improve in practice, websites must actually implement these recommendations. To date, there has been limited investigation into what password creation policies are actually deployed by sites. Existing works are mostly dated and all studies relied on manual evaluations, assessing a small set of sites (at most 150, skewed towards top sites). Thus, we lack a broad understanding of the password policies used today. In this paper, we develop an automated technique for inferring a website's password creation policy, and apply it at scale to measure the policies of over 20K sites, over two orders of magnitude (~135x) more sites than prior work. Our findings identify the common policies deployed, potential causes of weak policies, and directions for improving authentication in practice. Ultimately, our study provides the first large-scale understanding of password creation policies on the web.
