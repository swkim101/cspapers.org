We give an algorithm to morph between two planar orthogonal drawings of a graph, preserving planarity and orthogonality. The morph uses a polynomial number of discrete steps. Each step is either a linear morph that moves a set of vertices horizontally or vertically; or a "twist" that introduces new bends in the edges incident with one vertex. Our morph can be implemented so that inter-vertex distances are well-behaved. This is the first algorithm to provide planarity-preserving morphs with well-behaved complexity for a significant class of graph drawings.
