Multimedia provides an opportunity to introduce innovative approaches to learning and, for this purpose, the technology has been used both in and out of the classroom to study concepts associated with myriad disciplines. However, obstacles exist that have prevented widespread use of this technology. For instance, although institutions encourage the incorporation of multimedia into curricula, some faculty and/or administrators are not totally convinced that benefits derived from the implementation of multimedia are worth the effort. For those who have embarked upon multimedia projects, there are functional, technical, and legal issues that create implementation problems. Thus , this remarkable " opportunity " is plagued with problems that continue to prevent educational impacts from reaching their full potential. The participants in the proposed panel have all been involved in the use of multimedia to meet education and training needs. Each has developed different implementation models for their respective environment and circumstances and their use of the technology spans a variety of applications, including case simulations, lecture support, student presentations, and laboratory learning. Although the panelists have approached the integration of multimedia somewhat differently, similar obstacles have been encountered. The reasons are many and include such issues as budget considerations, adaptation to change, time constraints, appropriateness, and faculty development. Samples of the educational materials will be presented by the panel and the underlying deterrents to the successful growth of multimedia in the academic environment will be debated as well as possible solutions to the issues involved.
