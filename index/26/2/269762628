Relevant recommendation is a distinctive recommendation scenario in e-commerce platforms, which provides an extended set of items that are relevant to the trigger item (the item that triggers the relevant recommendation). Different from the general recommendations whose item feeds are diversified, relevant recommendation regards the trigger item as a key component. From one perspective, the trigger item reveals users' current interests and determines the range of the recommendation results. From the other perspective, users may have the mindset to look for items that have directional attribute differences from the trigger item. In this paper, we present an attribute-aware personalized item comparison framework. Under this framework, an item subtraction module is first applied over the trigger item and the candidate item, which calculates their directional difference with consideration of their intrinsic similarity. Then two modules are used to estimate users' preference for this current item pair: one learns the collective preference of all users, and the other learns the current user's personal evolutional preference. Experiments on a CTR prediction task over both a public dataset and an industrial dataset from our shopping app show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and also achieves better generalization ability.
