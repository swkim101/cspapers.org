Keeping open-source software (OSS) up to date is one potential solution to prevent known vulnerabilities. However, it requires frequent and costly testing and may introduce compatibility issues. Consequently, developers often choose to backport security patches to the vulnerable versions instead. Manual backporting is time-consuming, especially for large OSS such as the Linux kernel. Therefore, automating this process is urgently needed to save considerable time. Existing automated approaches for backporting patches involve either automatic patch generation or automatic patch migration. However, these methods are often ineffective and error-prone since they failed to locate the precise patch locations or generate the correct patch, operating only on the syntactic level. In this paper, we propose a patch type-sensitive approach to automatically backport OSS security patches, guided by the patch type and patch semantics. Specifically, our approach identifies patch locations with the aid of program dependency graph-based matching at the semantic level. It further applies fine-grained patch migration and fine-tuning based on patch types. We have implemented our approach in a tool named TSBPORT and evaluated it on a large-scale dataset consisting of 1,815 pairs of real-world security patches for the Linux kernel. The evaluation results show that TSBPORT successfully backported 1,589 (87.59%) patches, out of which 587 (32.34%) could not be backported by any state-of-the-art approaches, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, experiments also show that TSBPORT can be generalized to backport patches in other OSS projects with a success rate of 88.18%.
