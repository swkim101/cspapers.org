We are again confronted with one of the most vexing aspects of the advancement of technology: automation and AI technology cause the devaluation of human labor, resulting in unemployment. With this background, automatic person-job fit systems are promising solutions to promote the employment rate. The purpose of person-job fit is to calculate a matching score between the job seeker's resume and the job posting, determining whether the job seeker is suitable for the position. In this paper, we propose a new approach to person-job fit that characterizes the hidden preference derived from the job seeker's career path. We categorize and utilize three types of preferences in the career path: consistency, likeness, and continuity. We prove that understanding the career path enables us to provide more appropriate career suggestions to job seekers. To demonstrate the practical value of our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world data extracted from an online recruitment platform and then present detailed cases to show how the career path matter in person-job fit.
