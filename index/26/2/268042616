The performance of deep learning models heavily relies on the quality of the training data. Inadequacies in the training data, such as corrupt input or noisy labels, can lead to the failure of model generalization. Recent studies propose repairing the model by identifying the training samples that contribute to the failure and removing their influence from the model. However, it is important to note that the identified data may contain both beneficial and detrimental information. Simply erasing the information of the identified data from the model can have a negative impact on its performance, especially when accurate data is mistakenly identified as detrimental and removed. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages the knowledge obtained from a retained clean set. Concretely, Our method first identifies harmful data by utilizing the clean set, then separates the beneficial and detrimental information within the identified data. Finally, we utilize the extracted beneficial information to enhance the modelâ€™s performance. Through empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches in both identifying harmful data and rectifying model failures. Particularly in scenarios where identification is challenging and a significant amount of benign data is involved, our method improves performance while the baselines deteriorate due to the erroneous removal of beneficial information.
