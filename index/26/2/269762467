The global rollout of 5G mobile networks has prompted discussions on deployment strategies. Given the knowledge gap in the current deployment strategies of 5G base stations, understanding the deployment experience from regions with widespread 5G base stations is valuable for guiding future deployments elsewhere. In this study, based on a large data set collected from a metropolitan city in China, we discover the misalignment between 5G traffic demand and the number of base stations. Then we introduce a factor to quantify the misalignment. Our analysis indicates the following important observations. Firstly, unique traffic patterns of functional areas contribute to different misalignment factors, i.e., transport areas exhibit a positive factor, in contrast to the negative factor observed in urban comprehensive and residential areas. Secondly, regions with a high density of base stations still suffer from low energy and resource utilization efficiency due to their high energy consumption. Thirdly, our analysis reveals that 5G base stations are frequently located in areas with large 4G traffic, yet the incomplete migration of traffic to 5G results in misalignment. This understanding of the 5G deployment experience can help further studies on optimizing energy efficiency and network utilization rate of the mobile networks.
