Search results hold paramount importance for both users and advertisers. However, re-ranking results based on the timing of user clicks on listing advertisements poses a considerable challenge. In this study, we introduce a dynamic re-ranking method to re-rank search results triggered by the viewing of listing advertisements containing search terms after the initial presentation of search results. The proposed method leverages relevance feedback to enhance search results, providing valuable support to users in their searches. We conducted a comparative verification of accuracy rates between methods with and without the added weight. The results suggest that considering the timings of clicking on listing ads for re-ranking results can more effectively reflect user interest compared to approaches that don't take this timing into account. This study contributes to the advancement of search result presentation strategies by incorporating dynamic user behavior considerations.
