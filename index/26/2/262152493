Graph sampling prepares training samples for graph learning and can dominate the training time. Due to the increasing algorithm diversity and complexity, existing sampling frameworks are insufficient in the generality of expression and the efficiency of execution. To close this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study on 15 popular graph sampling algorithms to motivate the design of gSampler, a general and efficient GPU-based graph sampling framework. gSampler models graph sampling using a general 4-step Extract-Compute-Select-Finalize (ECSF) programming model, proposes a set of matrix-centric APIs that allow to easily express complex graph sampling algorithms, and incorporates a data-flow intermediate representation (IR) that translates high-level API codes for efficient GPU execution. We demonstrate that implementing graph sampling algorithms with gSampler is easy and intuitive. We also conduct extensive experiments with 7 algorithms, 4 graph datasets, and 2 hardware configurations. The results show that gSampler introduces sampling speedups of 1.14--32.7× and an average speedup of 6.54×, compared to state-of-the-art GPU-based graph sampling systems such as DGL, which translates into an overall time reduction of over 40% for graph learning. gSampler is open-source at https://tinyurl.com/29twthd4.
