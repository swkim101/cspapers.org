Hate speech (HS) is a growing concern in many parts of
the world, including India, where it has led to numerous instances of violence and discrimination. The development of
effective counter-narratives (CNs) is a critical step in combating hate speech, but there is a lack of research in this
area, especially in non-English languages. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset, IndicCONAN, of counter-narratives
against hate speech in Hindi and Indian English. We propose a scalable human-in-the-loop approach for generating counter-narratives by an auto-regressive language model
through machine generation - human correction cycle, where
the model uses augmented data from previous cycles to generate new training samples. These newly generated samples
are then reviewed and edited by annotators, leading to further
model refnement. The dataset consists of over 2,500 exam- Ëœ
ples of counter-narratives each in both English and Hindi corresponding to various hate speeches in the Indian context. We
also present a framework for generating CNs conditioned on
specifc CN type with a mean perplexity of 3.85 for English
and 3.70 for Hindi, a mean toxicity score of 0.04 for English
and 0.06 for Hindi, and a mean diversity of 0.08 for English
and 0.14 for Hindi. Our dataset and framework provide valuable resources for researchers and practitioners working to
combat hate speech in the Indian context.
