In our current visual-centric digital age, the capability to interpret, understand, and produce visual representations of data —termed visualization literacy— is paramount. However, not everyone is adept at navigating this visual terrain. This paper explores the barriers that individuals who misread a visualization encounter, aiming to understand their specific mental gaps. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, we administered the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) to a group of 120 participants drawn from diverse demographic backgrounds, which provided us with 1774 task completions. We augmented the standard VLAT test to capture quantitative and qualitative data on participants’ errors. We collected participant sketches and open-ended text about their analysis approach, providing insight into users’ mental models and rationale. Our findings reveal that individuals who incorrectly answer visualization literacy questions often misread visual channels, confound chart labels with data values, or struggle to translate data-driven questions into visual queries. Recognizing and bridging visualization literacy gaps not only ensures inclusivity but also enhances the overall effectiveness of visual communication in our society.
