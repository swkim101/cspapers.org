We study the problem on how to maximize the throughput for a periodic real-time system under the given peak temperature constraint. We assume that different tasks in our system may have different power and thermal characteristics. Two algorithms are presented in this paper. The first one is built upon processors that can be either in active or sleep mode. By judiciously selecting tasks with different thermal characteristics as well as alternating the processor active/sleep mode, our approach can improve the throughput upon the existing techniques by 21% in average. We further extend this approach for processors with dynamic voltage/ frequency scaling (DVFS) capability. Our experiments show that an improvement of 24% can be achieved when compared with the existing methods.
