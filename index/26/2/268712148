Due to its effectiveness and efficiency, anchor based multi-view clustering (MVC) has recently attracted much attention. Most existing approaches try to adaptively learn anchors to construct an anchor graph for clustering. However, they generally focus on improving the diversity among anchors by using orthogonal constraint and ignore the underlying semantic relations, which may make the anchors not representative and discriminative enough. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive Cluster-wise Anchor learning based MVC method, CAMVC for short. We first make an anchor cluster assumption that supposes the prior cluster structure of target anchors by pre-defining a consensus cluster indicator matrix. Based on the prior knowledge, an explicit cluster structure of latent anchors is enforced by learning diverse cluster centroids, which can explore both inter-cluster diversity and intra-cluster consistency of anchors, and improve the subspace representation discrimination. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method compared with some state-of-the-art MVC approaches.
