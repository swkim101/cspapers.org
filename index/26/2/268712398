Multi-camera depth estimation has recently garnered significant attention due to its substantial practical implications in the realm of autonomous driving. In this paper, we delve into the task of self-supervised multi-camera depth estimation and propose an innovative framework, STViT, featuring several noteworthy enhancements: 1) we propose a Spatial-Temporal Transformer to comprehensively exploit both local connectivity and the global context of image features, meanwhile learning enriched spatial-temporal cross-view correlations to recover 3D geometry. 2) to alleviate the severe effect of adverse conditions, e.g., rainy weather and nighttime driving, we introduce a GAN-based Adversarial Geometry Regularization Module (AGR) to further constrain the depth estimation with unpaired normal-condition depth maps and prevent the model from being incorrectly trained. Experiments on challenging autonomous driving datasets Nuscenes and DDAD show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
