More students are encountering computer science at multiple grade levels and so are learning more than one programming language. There is an ever-growing body of research describing how students transfer knowledge from one language to another. Current research shows that transfer helps students learn a second programming language in the interim and improves attitudes and retention of students in computer science [2, 12]. While novice programmers generally struggle with the same concepts [1, 12], the exact difficulties and benefits of the transition to a second programming language differ depending on the programming languages the student is learning. In order to best serve students of different backgrounds and maintain their interest in the subject, the details of transfer for different programming language combinations must be understood. This poster surveys and analyzes the current research on transfer and provides a summary of the variety of challenges and advantages students face in learning a second programming language. Additionally, interdisciplinary pedagogical approaches are discussed, integrating perspectives from applied linguistics as novel solutions to the specific issues faced in programming language transfer.
