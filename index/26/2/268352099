Given the persistent underrepresentation of women, Black, Latinx, and other marginalized groups in computing fields, scholars from a variety of disciplines have generated a breadth of empirical findings on factors that are salient in broadening participation in undergraduate computing (BPC). While such literature yields insights into the computing experiences and outcomes of underrepresented groups, there is limited understanding of how BPC-related research is conducted. Our paper focuses on the methods used in BPC-focused journal articles and conference proceedings published between 2005-2022, centering exclusively on 129 studies that use quantitative methodologies. The study follows Moher et al.'s (2009) Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for reporting methodological review processes and findings. Results of the paper highlight important directions for future BPC research; in particular, studies should (a) include more longitudinal and multi-institutional approaches; (b) incorporate more sophisticated and multivariate techniques; and (c) yield insights on smaller racial/ethnic groups, community college students, and students with disabilities, while also accounting for students' intersecting identities.
