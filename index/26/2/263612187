We study the problem of 3D-aware full-body human generation, aiming at creating animatable human avatars with high-quality textures and geometries. Generally, two challenges remain in this field: i) existing methods struggle to generate geometries with rich realistic details such as the wrinkles of garments; ii) they typically utilize volumetric radiance fields and neural renderers in the synthesis process, making high-resolution rendering non-trivial. To overcome these problems, we propose GETAvatar, a Generative model that directly generates Explicit Textured 3D meshes for animatable human Avatar, with photorealistic appearance and fine geometric details. Specifically, we first design an articulated 3D human representation with explicit surface modeling, and enrich the generated humans with realistic surface details by learning from the 2D normal maps of 3D scan data. Second, with the explicit mesh representation, we can use a rasterization-based renderer to perform surface rendering, allowing us to achieve high-resolution image generation efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETAvatar achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D-aware human generation both in appearance and geometry quality. Notably, GETAvatar can generate images at 5122 resolution with 17FPS and 10242 resolution with 14FPS, improving upon previous methods by 2Ã—.
