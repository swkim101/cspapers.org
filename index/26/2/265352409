The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has been the center of the most outstanding advancements in the last years. The ability to analyze considerable streams of data in real time makes these technologies the most promising tool in many domains, including cybersecurity. As an outstanding example, ML can be used for identifying malware because of its ability to detect patterns otherwise difficult to see for humans and hard-coded rules. As malware continues to evolve, ML will become increasingly important for keeping up with the latest threats. However, the use of AI and ML in security-relevant domains raised rightful concerns about their trustworthiness and robustness, especially in front of adaptive attackers. Additionally, privacy threats are now emerging as a crucial aspect and need proper testing and possibly mitigation to prevent data stealing and leakage of sensitive information. The AISec workshop provides a venue for presenting and discussing new developments in the intersection of security and privacy with AI and ML.
