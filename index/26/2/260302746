Azo dyes such as Tropaeolin O have diverse applications in the textile, food, and biomedical industries. However, their recalcitrant properties make them toxic substances in surface waters. Nanocatalysts are photoactive nanoparticles that generate reactive oxygen species to destroy organic compounds. Moreover, the presence of dopant agents in the nanoparticles’ crystalline structure efficiently enhances photocatalytic activity. Ag-doped ZnO nanoparticles were prepared in ethylene glycol at 197 °C and characterized by UV-Vis absorption, photoluminescence, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electron diffraction (ED). The particles were mainly spherical with a size of ~10 nm, a hexagonal structure, and an elemental composition of 56.2% Zn, 37.8% O, and 5.9% Ag. The particles evidenced a broad absorption peak in the UV region and two emission peaks. Absorption analysis indicates that 92% and 58% of Tropaeolin O were degraded using 100 and 50 ppm of Ag-doped ZnO nanoparticles, respectively, during the first 550 min. Ion chromatograms selected using quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (QTOF-LC-MS) indicate a complete Tropaeolin O degradation (295.04 m/z) during the first 330 min. Initially, the nanocatalyst attacks the electron-rich groups (-OH and -NH), generating the 277.03 m/z [M-OH]+ and 174.02 m/z (molecule rupture on the azo group). In addition, small oxidized fragments 167.03 m/z and 114.03 m/z confirm the nanoparticles’ photocatalytic capacity, and oxidized chains indicate the tropaeolin’s opening rings (including phtalic acids) and mineralization.
