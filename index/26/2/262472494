Bioinformatics is the science of managing, mining, and interpreting information from biological data. Various genome projects have contributed to an exponential growth in DNA and protein sequence databases. Rapid advances in high-throughput technologies, such as microarrays, mass spectrometry and new/next-generation sequencing, can monitor quantitatively the presence or activity of thousands of genes, RNAs, proteins, metabolites, and compounds in a given biological state. The ongoing influx of these data, the pressing need to address complex biomedical challenge, and the gap between the two have collectively created exciting opportunities for data mining researchers.
