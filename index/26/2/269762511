Document-level event extraction faces numerous challenges in accurately modeling real-world financial scenarios, particularly due to the inadequacies in existing datasets regarding data scale and fine-grained annotations. The development of datasets is a crucial factor in driving research progress; therefore, we present a high-quality Chinese document-level event extraction dataset, CFinDEE. This dataset, grounded in real-world financial news, defines 22 event types and 116 argument roles, annotating 26,483 events and 107,096 event arguments. CFinDEE aims to address these shortcomings by providing more comprehensive annotations and data augmentation, offering richer resources for document-level event extraction in the financial domain. CFinDEE extends data both horizontally and vertically, where horizontal expansion enriches the types of financial events, enhancing the diversity of the dataset; vertical expansion, by increasing the scale of the data, effectively boosts the practical value of the dataset. Experiments conducted on multiple advanced models have validated the high applicability and effectiveness of the CFinDEE dataset for document-level event extraction tasks in the financial field.
