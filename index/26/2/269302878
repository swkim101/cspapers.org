 Integration of various electricity-generating technologies (such as natural gas, wind, nuclear, etc.) with storage systems (such as thermal, battery electric, hydrogen, etc.) has the potential to improve the economic competitiveness of modern energy systems. Driven by the need to efficiently assess the economic feasibility of various energy system configurations in early system concept development, this work outlines a versatile computational framework for assessing the net present value of various integrated storage technologies. The subsystems’ fundamental dynamics are defined, with a particular emphasis on balancing critical physical and economic domains to enable optimal decision-making in the context of capacity and dispatch optimization. In its presented form, the framework formulates a linear, convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using a direct transcription approach in the open-source software DTQP. Three case studies demonstrate and validate the framework’s capabilities, highlighting its value and computational efficiency in facilitating the economic assessment of various energy system configurations. In particular, natural gas with thermal storage and carbon capture, wind energy with battery storage, and nuclear with hydrogen are demonstrated.
