This study evaluated the potential of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) for single-cell screening compared to polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA). GelMA photopolymerized at 1000–2000 mJ/cm2 produced consistent patterns and supported HeLa cell viability. GelMA (5%w/v) facilitated better cell collection within 2 days due to its shape retention. GelMA demonstrated biocompatibility with HeLa cells exhibiting exponential proliferation and biodegradation over 5 days. The average cell displacement over 2 days was 16 µm. Two targeted cell recovery strategies using trypsin were developed: one for adherent cells encapsulated at 800 mJ/cm2, and another for floating cells encapsulated at 800 mJ/cm2, enabling the selective removal of unwanted cells. These findings suggest GelMA as a promising biomaterial for single-cell screening applications, offering advantages over PEGDA in cell encapsulation and targeted recovery.
