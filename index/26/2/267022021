Geometric frameworks for analyzing curves are common in applications as they focus on invariant features and provide visually satisfying solutions to standard problems such as computing invariant distances, averaging curves, or registering curves. We show that for any smooth curve in ℝd, d > 1, the generalized curvatures associated with the Frenet-Serret equation can be used to define a Riemannian geometry that takes into account all the geometric features of the shape. This geometry is based on a Square Root Curvature Transform that extends the square root-velocity transform for Euclidean curves (in any dimensions) and provides likely geodesics that avoid artefacts encountered by representations using only first-order geometric information. Our analysis is supported by simulated data and is especially relevant for analyzing human motions. We consider trajectories acquired from sign language, and show the interest of considering curvature and also torsion in their analysis, both being physically meaningful.
