This is the 10th edition of the workshop series labeled "AW4City - Web Applications and Smart Cities", which started back in Florence in 2015 and kept on taking place every year in conjunction with the WWW conference series. Last year the workshop was held in Austin, Texas. The workshop series aims to investigate the Web and Web applications' role in establishing smart city (SC) promises. The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the new era of the Web and web intelligence in cities and communities. In the era of digital twinning and metaverse (so-called citiverse for cities), and under the UN 2030 Agenda for sustainable growth, cities are being transformed into virtual spaces that generate new types of value and new experiences to their citizens and enterprises that can enhance living and offer new opportunities for economic growth. Moreover, AI and web intelligence generate new types of automated transactions in these virtual spaces, while they can utilize data spaces and standardization for optimal data flow. This workshop aims to demonstrate how the Web transforms cities into new virtual environments.
