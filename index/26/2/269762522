Quantum computing (QC) has recently achieved significant technological advancements, attracting widespread attention. Current users mainly access QC resources through cloud services. However, cloud-based quantum services provide convenience while also introducing security risks. For example, attackers could steal private information or inject malicious programs into quantum devices, while quantum device fingerprinting may be the first step for these malicious intents. In this paper, we propose a novel Task-Driven Quantum Device Fingerprinting (TD-QDF) identification method based on quantum neural network (QNN) task outcomes. Unlike previous research, our method does not require any hardware details, resulting in high availability in practice. Extensive experiments involving 3 QNN circuits on 10 real IBM quantum computers show that our method can effectively identify quantum devices. This research contributes to advancing quantum fingerprinting technologies and holds promising implications for enhancing the security and accountability of quantum computing systems.
