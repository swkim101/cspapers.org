This paper integrates weak decomposable negation normal form (wDNNF) circuits, introduced by Akshay et al. in 2018, into the knowledge compilation map. This circuit type generalises decomposable negation normal form (DNNF) circuits in such a way that they allow a restricted form of sharing variables among the inputs of a conjunction node. We show that wDNNF circuits have the same properties as DNNF circuits regarding the queries and transformations presented in the knowledge compilation map, whilst being strictly more succinct than DNNF circuits (that is, they can represent Boolean functions compactly). We also present and evaluate a knowledge compiler, called Bella, for converting CNF formulae into wDNNF circuits. Our experiments demonstrate that wDNNF circuits are suitable for configuration instances.
