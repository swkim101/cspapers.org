Recommender systems significantly impact user experience across diverse domains, yet existing frameworks often prioritize offline evaluation metrics, neglecting the crucial integration of A/B testing for forward-looking assessments. In response, this paper introduces a new framework seamlessly incorporating A/B testing into the Cornac recommendation library. Leveraging a diverse collection of model implementations in Cornac, our framework enables effortless A/B testing experiment setup from offline trained models. We introduce a carefully designed dashboard and a robust backend for efficient logging and analysis of user feedback. This not only streamlines the A/B testing process but also enhances the evaluation of recommendation models in an online environment. Demonstrating the simplicity of on-demand online model evaluations, our work contributes to advancing recommender system evaluation methodologies, underscoring the significance of A/B testing and providing a practical framework for implementation.
