2024 will be the largest election year in history involving over 50 countries and approximately 4.2 billion people. Since 1996, the Web has been instrumental in political campaigns, enhancing public engagement and creating new communication avenues for elections. Nevertheless, the proliferation of generative AI technologies has made false information dissemination simpler and quicker, posing a substantial threat to election integrity and democratic processes. The 2024 global elections underscore the need to comprehend and tackle the impact of such technologies on democracy. In this paper, we undertake a detailed meta-analysis, scrutinizing 44 papers published in The Web Conference, detailing the influence of the Web on elections. Our research reveals key historical trends on how the Web has impacted elections: first, social media has revolutionized election strategies through direct voter-candidate interactions. Second, big data and algorithm-driven campaigns are commonplace. Third, AI advancements have exacerbated the spread of fake news, risking election fairness. Predominantly from studies published since 2018 among 44 papers, we underscore the necessity for advanced detection tools, policy formulation, and responsible AI use to maintain electoral integrity. This analysis offers an insight into the Web and AI's impact on elections, presenting pointers for addressing challenges and leveraging opportunities in the 2024 and future elections.
