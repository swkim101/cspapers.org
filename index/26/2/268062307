Accurate, reliable timestamping which is also convenient and inexpensive is needed in many important areas including real-time network applications and network measurement. Recently the TSC register, which counts CPU cycles in popular PC architectures, was proposed as the basis of a new software clock which in terms of rate performance performs as well as more expensive GPS alternatives. Smooth and precise clock rate is essential to measure time <i>differences</i> accurately. We show how to define a TSC based clock which is also accurate with respect to <i>absolute</i> time. The clock is calibrated by processing, in a novel way, timestamps contained in the usual flow of Network Time Protocol (NTP) packets between a NTP server and the existing software clock, and TSC timestamps made independently on the host side. Using real measurements over 4 months, validated with a GPS synchronized hardware timing solution, the algorithm measured absolute time with a median error of only 30 microseconds when using a nearby stratum-1 NTP server. Results for two other servers are given. We also provide new algorithms for the robust determination of clock rate. We exploit the reliability of the available hardware to design synchronization algorithms which are inherently robust to many factors including packet loss, server outages, route changes, temperature environment, and network congestion.
