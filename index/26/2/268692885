The completion of large occluded human body images poses a unique challenge for general image completion methods. The complex shape variations of human bodies make it difficult to establish a consistent understanding of their structures. Furthermore, as human vision is highly sensitive to human bodies, even slight artifacts can significantly compromise image fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose a large occluded human image completion (LOHC) model based on a novel image-prior cooperative completion strategy. Our model leverages human segmentation maps as a prior, and completes the image and prior simultaneously. Compared to the widely adopted prior-then-image completion strategy for object completion, this cooperative completion process fosters more effective interaction between the prior and image information. Our model consists of two stages. The first stage is a transformer-based auto-regressive network that predicts the overall structure of the missing area by generating a coarse completed image at a lower resolution. The second stage is a convolutional network that refines the coarse images. As the coarse result may not always be accurate, we propose a Dynamic Fusion Module (DFM) to selectively fuses the useful features from the coarse image with the original input at spatial and channel levels. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our methodâ€™s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
