Graph few-shot learning (GFSL) has achieved great success in node classification tasks with rare labels. However, graph few-shot classification (GFSC) models often encounter the problem of classifying test samples with unobserved (or unknown) classes due to the rareness of labels. We formulate this problem as out-of-distribution (OOD) sample detection in inductive graph few-shot learning. This paper presents SMUG, a novel GFSL framework that can detect unobserved classes. Since we have no ground-truth OOD samples in a practical training dataset, it is challenging for the GFSC model to retrieve knowledge about unknown classes from labeled samples. To address this difficulty, we propose a sand mixing scheme to introduce observed classes as artificial OOD samples into meta-tasks. We also develop two unsupervised OOD discriminators to identify OOD samples. Thus, we can assess the performance of OOD discriminators since we know the true classes of these artificial OOD samples. Subsequently, we design a novel training procedure to optimize the encoder based on the performance of the OOD discriminators and the GFSC model. It not only enables the GFSL model to distinguish OOD samples but also promotes the classification accuracy of normal samples. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of SMUG based on four benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SMUG achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches in OOD detection and node classification.
