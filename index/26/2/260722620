The World Wide Web is a massive corpus that constantly evolves. Classification experiments usually grab a snapshot (temporally and spatially) of the Web for a corpus. In this paper, we examine the effects of page evolution on genre classification of Web pages. Web genre refers to the type of the page characterized by features such as style, form or presentation layout, and meta-content; Web genre can be used to tune spider crawling re-visits and inform relevance judgments for search engines. We found that pages in some genres change rarely if at all and can be used in present-day research experiments without requiring an updated version. We show that an old corpus can be used for training when testing on new Web pages, with only a marginal drop in accuracy rates on genre classification. We also show that features found to be useful in one corpus do not transfer well to other corpora with different genres.
