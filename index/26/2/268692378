Building click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) prediction models for cross-border e-commerce search requires modeling the correlations among multi-domains. Existing multi-domain methods would suffer severely from poor scalability and low efficiency when number of domains increases. To this end, we propose a Domain-Aware Multi-view mOdel (DAMO), which is domain-number-invariant, to effectively leverage cross-domain relations from a multi-view perspective. Specifically, instead of working in the original feature space defined by different domains, DAMO maps everything to a new low-rank multi-view space. To achieve this, DAMO firstly extracts multi-domain features in an explicit feature-interactive manner. These features are parsed to a multi-view extractor to obtain view-invariant and view-specific features. Then a multi-view predictor inputs these two sets of features and outputs view-based predictions. To enforce view-awareness in the predictor, we further propose a lightweight view-attention estimator to dynamically learn the optimal view-specific weights w.r.t. a view-guided loss. Extensive experiments on public and industrial datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art models, our DAMO achieves better performance with lower storage and computational costs. In addition, deploying DAMO to a large-scale cross-border e-commence platform leads to 1.21%, 1.76%, and 1.66% improvements over the existing CGC-based model in the online AB-testing experiment in terms of CTR, CVR, and Gross Merchandises Value, respectively.
