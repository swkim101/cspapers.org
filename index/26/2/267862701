Testing concurrent software is notoriously difficult due to problems with non-determinism and synchronisation. While tools and techniques for the testing of sequential components are well-understood and widely used, similar tools and techniques for concurrent components are not commonly available. This tutorial will look at the problems associated with testing concurrent components and propose techniques for dealing with these problems. The ConAn (Concurrency Analyser) testing tool supports these techniques for the testing of concurrent Java components and will be discussed and demonstrated in the tutorial. The limitations of the techniques and ConAn, as well as additional V&V tools and techniques to address these limitations will be presented.
