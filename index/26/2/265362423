 This work proposes a combined deep learning based approach to improve thermal component heat sinks involving turbulent fluid flow. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained to learn and recreate the new ellipse based heat sinks. Simulation data for new designs is efficiently generated using OpenFOAM 7 (Open Source Computational Fluid Dynamics software) along with high throughput computing. To improve the speed of design evaluation, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to predict the entire temperature field for a given design. The trained CNN is able to predict the entire temperature field for the design with a mean average error of 1.140 degrees kelvin in 0.04 seconds (22,500 times faster than the simulation). A combined model is formed using the trained CNN and GAN networks to create and simulate new designs. The combined model optimizes the latent representation of 64 random designs on a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) in ten minutes. The optimized designs perform fourteen degrees kelvin better on average than the non-optimized designs. The highest preforming design outperforms any design in the training data by 1.83 degrees kelvin.
