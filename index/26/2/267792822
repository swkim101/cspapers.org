Much excitement has been generated by the recent success of stochastic local search procedures at finding satisfying assignments to large formulas. Many of the problems on which these methods have been effective are non-Boolean in that they are most naturally formulated in terms of variables with domain sizes greater than two. To tackle such a problem with a Boolean procedure the problem is first reformulated as an equivalent Boolean problem. This paper introduces and studies the alternative of extending a Boolean stochastic local search procedure to operate directly on non-Boolean problems. It then compares the non-Boolean representation to three Boolean representations and presents experimental evidence that the non-Boolean method is often superior for problems with large domain sizes.
