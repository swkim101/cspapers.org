This system is modeled on the distance perception methods of human eyes. It uses DSP to process the images obtained by two CCD cameras and calculate the distance by the principle of parallax. This paper describes the working principle and hardware platform design. It focuses on the image matching methods based on Canny edge detection and Harris corner detection. The results of the experiment show that the system is efficient and reliable.
