We explore the matrix sensing problem from near-isotropic linear measurements, distributed across a network of agents modeled as an undirected graph, with no server. We provide the ﬁrst study of statistical, computational/communication guarantees for a decentralized gradient algorithm that solves the (nonconvex) Burer-Monteiro type decomposition associated to the low-rank matrix estimation. With small random initialization, the algorithm displays an approximate two-phase convergence: (i) a spectral phase that aligns the iterates’ column space with the underlying low-rank matrix, mimicking centralized spectral initialization (not directly implementable over networks); and (ii) a local reﬁnement phase that diverts the iterates from certain degenerate saddle points, while ensuring swift convergence to the underlying low-rank matrix. Central to our analysis is a novel “in-network” Restricted Isometry Property which accommodates for the decentralized nature of the optimization, revealing an intriguing interplay between sample complexity, network connectivity & topology, and communication complexity.
