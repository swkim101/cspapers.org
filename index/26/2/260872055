For point cloud reconstruction-related tasks, the reconstruction losses to evaluate the shape differences between reconstructed results and the ground truths are typically used to train the task networks. Most existing works measure the training loss with point-to-point distance, which may introduce extra defects as predefined matching rules may deviate from the real shape differences. Although some learning-based works have been proposed to overcome the weaknesses of manually-defined rules, they still measure the shape differences in 3D Euclidean space, which may limit their ability to capture defects in reconstructed shapes. In this work, we propose a learning-based Contrastive Adver-sarial Loss (CALoss) to measure the point cloud reconstruction loss dynamically in a non-linear representation space by combining the contrastive constraint with the adversarial strategy. Specifically, we use the contrastive constraint to help CALoss learn a representation space with shape similarity, while we introduce the adversarial strategy to help CALoss mine differences between reconstructed results and ground truths. According to experiments on reconstruction-related tasks, CALoss can help task networks improve re-construction performances and learn more representative representations.
