Dense subgraph discovery (DSD) is a key primitive in graph mining that typically deals with extracting cliques and near-cliques. In this paper, we revisit the optimal quasi-clique (OQC) formulation for DSD and establish that it is NP--hard. In addition, we reveal the hitherto unknown property that OQC can be used to explore the entire spectrum of densest subgraphs of all distinct sizes by appropriately varying a single hyperparameter, thereby forging an intimate link with the classic densest-k-subgraph problem (DkS). We corroborate these findings on real-world graphs by applying the simple greedy algorithm for OQC with improved hyperparameter tuning, to quickly generate high-quality approximations of the size-density frontier. Our findings indicate that OQC not only extracts high quality (near)-cliques, but also large and loosely-connected subgraphs that exhibit well defined local community structure. The latter discovery is particularly intriguing, since OQC is not explicitly geared towards community detection.
