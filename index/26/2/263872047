This paper discusses the recent views on knowledge, representations, and memory as presented by different researchers under the flag of 'situated cognition'. The situated view implies a radical shift of paradigm. We argue that there are no strong reasons to leave the traditional paradigm of cognitive science and AI. Four main issues are addressed; the role of computational models in theories of cognition, theories on knowledge and memory, the frame of reference problem and implications for learning and instruction. The main conclusion of the paper is that 'situationism' is throwing out the baby with the bath water. Consolidated achievements of Cognitive Science and AI still stand, even if the architectures that are assumed to underly traditional models of cognition can be challenged.
