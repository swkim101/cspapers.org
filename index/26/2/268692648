Transformer has shown outstanding performance on image denoising, but the existing Transformer methods for image denoising are with large model sizes and high computational complexity, which is unfriendly to resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Image Denoising Transformer method (LIDFormer) based on Triple Multi-Dconv Head Transposed Attention (TMDTA) to boost computational efficiency. LIDFormer first implements Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which transforms the input image into a low-frequency space, greatly reducing the computational complexity of image denoising. However, the low-frequency image lacks fine-feature information, which degrades the denoising performance. To handle this problem, we introduce the Complementary Periodic Feature Reusing (CPFR) scheme for aggregating the shallow-layer features and the deep-layer features. Furthermore, TMDTA is proposed to integrate global context along three dimensions, thereby enhancing the ability of global feature representation. Note that our method can be applied as a pipeline for both convolutional neural networks and Transformers. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed LIDFormer achieves a better trade-off between high performance and low computational complexity on real-world image denoising tasks.
