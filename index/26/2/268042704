This paper considers the problem of inferring the behaviors of multiple interacting experts by estimating their reward functions and constraints where the distributed demonstrated trajectories are sequentially revealed to a group of learners. We formulate the problem as a distributed online bi-level optimization problem where the outer-level problem is to estimate the reward functions and the inner-level problem is to learn the constraints and corresponding policies. We propose a novel “multi-agent behavior inference from distributed and streaming demonstrations" (MA-BIRDS) algorithm that allows the learners to solve the outer-level and inner-level problems in a single loop through intermittent communications. We formally guarantee that the distributed learners achieve consensus on reward functions, constraints, and policies, the average local regret (over N online iterations) decreases at the rate of O (1 /N 1 − η 1 +1 /N 1 − η 2 +1 /N ) , and the cumulative constraint violation increases sub-linearly at the rate of O ( N η 2 + 1) where η 1 , η 2 ∈ (1 / 2 , 1) .
