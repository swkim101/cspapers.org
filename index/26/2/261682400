We present a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) maximization problem with subadditive valuations accessible via demand queries. More generally, we propose a framework for NSW optimization which assumes two subroutines which (1) solve a configuration-type LP under certain additional conditions, and (2) round the fractional solution with respect to utilitarian social welfare. In particular, a constant-factor approximation for submodular valuations with value queries can also be derived from our framework.
