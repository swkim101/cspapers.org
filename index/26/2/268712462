Spiking Graph Neural Networks are emerging tools for analyzing graph data along with low energy consumption and certain biological fidelity. Existing methods directly integrate same-reactive spiking neurons into graph neural networks for processing propagated graphs. However, such same-reactive neurons are not biological-functionality enough compared to the brain's dynamic-reactive ones, limiting the model's expression. Meanwhile, insufficient long-range neighbor information can be excavated with the few-step propagated graph, restricting discrimination of graph spiking embeddings. Inspired by the dynamic cognition in the brain, we propose a Dynamic Reactive Spiking Graph Neural Network that can enhance model's expressive ability in higher biological fidelity. Specifically, we design dynamic reactive spiking neurons to process spiking graph inputs, which have unique optimizable thresholds to spontaneously explore dynamic reactive states between neurons. Moreover, discriminative graph positional spikes are learned and integrated adaptively into spiking outputs through our neurons, thereby exploring long-range neighbors more thoroughly. Finally, with the dynamic reactive mechanism and learnable positional integration, we can obtain a powerful and highly bio-fidelity model with low energy consumption. Experiments on various domain-related datasets can demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our code is available at https://github.com/hzhao98/DRSGNN.
