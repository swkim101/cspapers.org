1. a novel machine-translation-based framework to quantify political polarization; 
2. an analysis of disparate media portrayal of US policing in major cable news outlets; and 
3. a novel perspective of vicarious offense that examines a timely and important question -- how well do Democratic-leaning users perceive what content would be deemed as offensive by their Republican-leaning counterparts or vice-versa?
