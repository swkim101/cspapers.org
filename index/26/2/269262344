Discrete-event simulation (DES) is a prevalent tool for evaluating network designs. Although DES offers full fidelity and generality, its slow performance limits its application. To speed up DES, many network simulators employ parallel discrete-event simulation (PDES). However, adapting existing network simulation models to PDES requires complex reconfigurations and often yields limited performance improvement. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a parallel-efficient and user-transparent network simulation kernel, Unison, that adopts fine-grained partition and load-adaptive scheduling optimized for network scenarios. We prototype Unison based on ns-3. Existing network simulation models of ns-3 can be seamlessly transitioned to Unison. Testbed experiments on commodity servers demonstrate that Unison can achieve a 40× speedup over DES using 24 CPU cores, and a 10× speedup compared with existing PDES algorithms under the same CPU cores.
