Reinforcement learning (RL) problems where the learner attempts to infer an unobserved reward from some feedback variables have been studied in several recent papers. The setting of Interaction-Grounded Learning (IGL) is an example of such feedback-based RL tasks where the learner optimizes the return by inferring latent binary rewards from the interaction with the environment. In the IGL setting, a relevant assumption used in the RL literature is that the feedback variable $Y$ is conditionally independent of the context-action $(X,A)$ given the latent reward $R$. In this work, we propose Variational Information-based IGL (VI-IGL) as an information-theoretic method to enforce the conditional independence assumption in the IGL-based RL problem. The VI-IGL framework learns a reward decoder using an information-based objective based on the conditional mutual information (MI) between $(X,A)$ and $Y$. To estimate and optimize the information-based terms for the continuous random variables in the RL problem, VI-IGL leverages the variational representation of mutual information to obtain a min-max optimization problem. Also, we extend the VI-IGL framework to general $f$-Information measures leading to the generalized $f$-VI-IGL framework for the IGL-based RL problems. We present numerical results on several reinforcement learning settings indicating an improved performance compared to the existing IGL-based RL algorithm.
