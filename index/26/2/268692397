Pan-sharpening aims to leverage the high-frequency signal of the panchromatic (PAN) image to enhance the resolution of its corresponding multi-spectral (MS) image. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to prioritize learning the low-frequency components during the training process, which limits the restoration of high-frequency edge details in MS images. To overcome this limitation, we treat pan-sharpening as a coarse-to-fine high-frequency restoration problem and propose a novel method for achieving high-quality restoration of edge information in MS images. Specifically, to effectively obtain fine-grained multi-scale contextual features, we design a Band-limited Multi-scale High-frequency Generator (BMHG) that generates high-frequency signals from the PAN image within different bandwidths. During training, higher-frequency signals are progressively injected into the MS image, and corresponding residual blocks are introduced into the network simultaneously. This design enables gradients to flow from later to earlier blocks smoothly, encouraging intermediate blocks to concentrate on missing details. Furthermore, to address the issue of pixel position misalignment arising from multi-scale features fusion, we propose a Spatial-spectral Implicit Image Function (SIIF) that employs implicit neural representation to effectively represent and fuse spatial and spectral features in the continuous domain. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of quantitative and visual measurements for high-frequency detail recovery.
