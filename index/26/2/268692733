Ensuring fairness in machine learning (ML) is crucial, particularly in applications that impact diverse populations. The majority of existing works heavily rely on the availability of protected features like race and gender. However, practical challenges such as privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions often prohibit the use of this data, limiting the scope of traditional fairness research. To address this, we introduce a Shared Latent Space-based Debiasing (SLSD) method that transforms data from both the target domain, which lacks protected features, and a separate source domain, which contains these features, into correlated latent representations. This allows for joint training of a cross-domain protected group estimator on the representations. We then debias the downstream ML model with an adversarial learning technique that leverages the group estimator. We also present a relaxed variant of SLSD, the R-SLSD, that occasionally accesses a small subset of protected features from the target domain during its training phase. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art models in standard group fairness metrics.
