Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to select informative features where the data are collected from multiple sources with multiple interdependent class labels. For fully exploiting multi-view information, most prior works mainly focus on the common part in the ideal circumstance. However, the inconsistent part hidden in each view, including noises and specific elements, may affect the quality of mapping between labels and feature representations. Meanwhile, ignoring the specific part might lead to a suboptimal result, as each label is supposed to possess specific characteristics of its own. To deal with the double problems in multi-view multi-label feature selection, we propose a unified loss function which is a totally splitting structure for observed labels as hybrid labels that is, common labels, view-to-all specific labels and noisy labels, and the view-to-all specific labels further splits into several specific labels of each view. The proposed method simultaneously considers the consistency and complementarity of different views. Through exploring the feature weights of hybrid labels, the mapping relationships between labels and features can be established sequentially based on their attributes. Additionally, the interrelatedness among hybrid labels is also investigated and injected into the function. Specific to the specific labels of each view, we construct the novel regularization paradigm incorporating logic operations. Finally, the convergence of the result is proved after applying the multiplicative update rules. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
