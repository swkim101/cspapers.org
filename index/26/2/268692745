Recent advancements in implicit neural representations have contributed to high-fidelity surface reconstruction and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However, with the expansion of the scene scale, such as block or city level, existing methods
will encounter challenges because traditional sampling cannot cope with the cubically growing sampling space. To alleviate the dependence on filling the sampling space, we explore using multi-modal priors to assist individual points to
obtain more global semantic information and propose a priorrich multi-modal implicit neural representation network, Pm-INR, for the outdoor unbounded large-scale scene. The core of our method is multi-modal prior extraction and crossmodal prior fusion modules. The former encodes codebooks from different modality inputs and extracts valuable priors, while the latter fuses priors to maintain view consistency and preserve unique features among multi-modal priors. Finally, feature-rich cross-modal priors are injected into the sampling
regions to allow each region to perceive global information without filling the sampling space. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our method for outdoor unbounded large-scale scene novel
view synthesis, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.
