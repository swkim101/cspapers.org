Family caregivers of people living with dementia need easy-to-access strategies to manage changing care needs. Music therapy is valuable for supporting dementia care, but not always accessible. Technologies could potentially facilitate accessible, home-based music therapy support, but need to be carefully evaluated. We conducted an 8-week field trial of a prototype mobile application, MATCH, with caregivers and people living with dementia. MATCH contains training videos and suggested playlists showing how to use music for specific care needs. MATCH, and music streaming broadly, enabled caregivers to add new strategies to their care repertoire, addressing a range of care needs and enhancing the care relationship. To make MATCH work, however, caregivers needed to fit it into complex care environments and existing technologies. We argue that digital therapeutic tools need to be adopted by caregivers to fit their individual contexts, and this can challenge assumptions about how therapeutic tools will work in practice.
