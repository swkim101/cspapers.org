Generative models have demonstrated considerable potential in software engineering, particularly in tasks such as code generation and debugging. However, their utilization in the domain of code documentation generation remains underexplored. To this end, we introduce RepoAgent, a large language model powered open-source framework aimed at proactively generating, maintaining, and updating code documentation. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach, showing that RepoAgent excels in generating high-quality repository-level documentation. The code and results are publicly accessible at https://github.com/OpenBMB/RepoAgent.
