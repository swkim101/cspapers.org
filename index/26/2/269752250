Educational games have emerged as potent tools for helping students understand complex concepts and are now ubiquitous in global classrooms, amassing vast data. However, there is a notable gap in research concerning the effective visualization of this data to serve two key functions: (a) guiding students in reflecting upon their game-based learning and (b) aiding them in analyzing peer strategies. In this paper, we engage educators, students, and researchers as essential stakeholders. Taking a Design-Based Research (DBR) approach, we incorporate UX design methods to develop an innovative visualization system that helps players learn through gaining insights from their own and peersâ€™ gameplay and strategies.
