3D human pose estimation (3HPE) in large-scale outdoor scenes using commercial LiDAR has attracted significant attention due to its potential for real-life applications. However, existing LiDAR-based methods for 3HPE primarily rely on recovering 3D human poses from individual point clouds, and the coherence cues present in the neighborhood are not sufficiently harnessed. In this work, we explore spatial and contexture coherence cues contained in the neighborhood that lead to great performance improvements in 3HPE. Specifically, firstly, we deeply investigate the 3D neighbor in the background (3BN) which serves as a spatial coherence cue for inferring reliable motion since it provides physical laws to limit motion targets. Secondly, we introduce a novel 3D scanning neighbor (3SN) generated during the data collection and 3SN implies structural edge coherence cues. We use 3SN to overcome the degradation of performance and data quality caused by the sparsity-varying properties of LiDAR point clouds. In order to effectively model the complementation between these distinct cues and build consistent temporal relationships across human motions, we propose a new transformer-based module called the CoherenceFuse module. Extensive experiments were conducted on publicly available datasets, namely LidarHuman26M, CIMI4D, SLOPER4D and Waymo Open Dataset v2.0, showcase the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method. In particular, when compared with LidarCap on the LidarHuman26M dataset, our method demonstrates a reduction of 7.08mm in the average MPJPE metric, along with a decrease of 16.55mm in the MPJPE metric for distances exceeding 25 meters.
