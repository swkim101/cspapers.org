Differential Privacy (DP) is a widely used technique for protecting individuals' privacy by limiting what can be inferred about them from aggregate data. Recently, there have been efforts to implement DP using Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to achieve high utility without the need for a trusted third party. One of the key components of implementing DP in MPC is noise sampling. Our work presents the first MPC solution for sampling discrete Gaussian, a common type of noise used for constructing DP mechanisms, which plays nicely with malicious secure MPC protocols. Our solution is both generic, supporting various MPC protocols and any number of parties, and efficient, relying primarily on bit operations and avoiding computation with transcendental functions or non-integer arithmetic. Our experiments show that our method can generate 215 discrete Gaussian samples with a standard deviation of 20 and a security parameter of 128 in 1.5 minutes.
