Variational autoencoder (VAE) is known as a classic and effective method in modeling users’ homogeneous behaviors in recommender systems. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved promising performance in learning users’ preferences by modeling complex relationships between users and items. However, most VAE- and GNN-based methods are for single-behavior recommendation, rather than the more prevalent counterpart in real-world applications, i.e., multi-behavior recommendation. This motivates us to leverage VAE and GNNs to address the more important and challenging problem of multi-behavior recommendation. Traditional multi-behavior recommendation models have not captured the complex transition relationships across different types of behaviors well. Moreover, they often ignore the varying semantic strength of different types of behaviors. To tackle the above two challenges, we propose a novel multi-behavior recommendation framework named VCGAE (short for Variational Collective Graph AutoEncoder), which inherits the advantages of VAE and GNNs to fully exploit the multi-behavior data. Specifically, we design a behavior transition network that considers different transition relationships across different types of behaviors in order to learn users’ personal preferences. In addition, we introduce a behavior contrastive regularization module that extracts different correlations between users’ auxiliary behaviors and target behavior. By doing so, we gain a deeper understanding of the semantic strength of different behaviors, thereby improving the overall recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our VCGAE compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
