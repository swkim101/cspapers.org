Processing SPARQL queries over large federations of SPARQL endpoints is essential for maintaining the Semantic Web decentralized. However, existing federation engines struggle to query more than a dozen of endpoints. We recently proposed FedUP, a new type of federation engine based on unions-over-joins query plans that outperforms state-of-the-art federation engines by orders of magnitude on large federations. This demonstration paper introduces Fediscount, a federated online shopping application based on the FedShop benchmark, illustrating the capabilities of FedUP. The application is based on standard Semantic Web technologies, enabling end-users to shop online in a virtual federated store comprising 20, 100, or even 200 SPARQL endpoints. This breakthrough opens up promising new avenues for developing and deploying federated applications.
