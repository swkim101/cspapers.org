We describe a new setting for learning a deep graph generative model (GGM) from aggregate graph statistics, rather than from the graph adjacency matrix. Matching the statistics of observed training graphs is the main approach for learning traditional GGMs (e.g, BTER, Chung-Lu, and Erdos-Renyi models). Privacy researchers have proposed learning from graph statistics as a way to protect privacy. We develop an architecture for training a deep GGM to match statistics while preserving local differential privacy guarantees. Empirical evaluation on 8 datasets indicates that our deep GGM generates more realistic graphs than the traditional non-neural GGMs when both are learned from graph statistics only. We also compare our deep GGM trained on statistics only, to state-of-the-art deep GGMs that are trained on the entire adjacency matrix. The results show that graph statistics are often sufÔ¨Åcient to build a competitive deep GGM that generates realistic graphs while protecting local privacy.
