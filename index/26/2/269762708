Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, have emerged in decentralized finance. However, the DEX project with multi-contract interaction is accompanied by complex state logic, which makes it challenging to solve state defects. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on state derailment defects of DEXs. These defects could lead to incorrect, incomplete, or unauthorized changes to the system state during contract execution, potentially causing security threats. We propose StateGuard, a deep learning-based framework to detect state derailment defects in DEX smart contracts. StateGuard constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the smart contract, extracting key features to generate a graph representation. Then, it leverages a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to discover defects. Evaluating StateGuard on 46 DEX projects with 5,671 smart contracts reveals its effectiveness, with a precision of 92.24%. To further verify its practicality, we used StateGuard to audit real-world smart contracts and successfully authenticated multiple novel CVEs.
