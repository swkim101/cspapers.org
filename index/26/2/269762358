Context based data receive an increasing attention for Smart City (SC) flow homogenization and standardization. SC hubness can be a solution that can simplify these flows and transform them to standardized message exchanges, which can be easily retrieved. Several use cases can justify the SC hubness' potential and will be summarized in this paper. However, the aim of this article is to analyze and explain their potential in the era of metaverse in cities, the so-called "citiverse". The role of data in citiverse gains an additional importance since it is a data-oriented ecosystem, but, it has to be seen around the new capabilities and values that citiverse may bring.
