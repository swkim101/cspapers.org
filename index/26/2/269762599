Smishing, which refers to social engineering attacks delivered through mobile devices such as smartphones, poses significant threats, yet limited data hinder the development of effective countermeasures. To tackle this, we propose a novel prompt engineering method for data augmentation in smishing detection. Distinguished by its utilization of insights from social science on smishing mechanisms, our approach offers a promising avenue for improving machine learning models in combating smishing attacks.
