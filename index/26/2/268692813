Existing super-resolution methods exhibit limitations when applied to nighttime scenes, primarily due to their lack of adaptation to low-pair dynamic range and noise-heavy dark-light images. In response, this research introduces an innovative customized framework to simultaneously Brighten and Zoom in low-resolution images captured in low-light conditions, dubbed BrZoNet. The core method begins by feeding low-light, low-resolution images, and their corresponding ground truths into the Retinex-induced siamese decoupling network. This process yields distinct reflectance maps and illuminance maps, guided by supervision from the ground truthâ€™s decomposition maps. Subsequently, these reflectance and illuminance maps transition into an intricate super-resolution sub-network. This sub-network employs a meticulously designed cross-layer content-aware interactor - Illumination-aware Interaction Unit(IaIU), elegantly endowed with a gating mechanism. The IaIU facilitates meaningful feature interaction between illuminance and reflectance features while effectively reducing unwanted noise. An intricate super-resolution cage is also constructed to comprehensively integrate information, ultimately resulting in the generation of high-resolution images featuring intricate details. Thorough and diverse experiments validate the superiority of the proposed BrZoNet, surpassing contemporary cutting-edge technologies by proficiently augmenting brightness and intricately recovering complex details, showcasing advancements of 7.1% in PSNR, 2.4% in SSIM, and an impressive 36.8% in LPIPS metrics.
