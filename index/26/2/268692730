Accurately computing optical flow in low-contrast and noisy dark images is challenging, especially when contour information is degraded or difficult to extract. This paper proposes CEDFlow, a latent space contour enhancement for estimating optical flow in dark environments. By leveraging spatial frequency feature decomposition, CEDFlow effectively encodes local and global motion features. Importantly, we introduce the 2nd-order Gaussian difference operation to select salient contour features in the latent space precisely. It is specifically designed for large-scale contour components essential in dark optical flow estimation. Experimental results on the FCDN and VBOF datasets demonstrate that CEDFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the EPE index and produces more accurate and robust flow estimation.
