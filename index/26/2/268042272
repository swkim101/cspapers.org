Complex-valued representation exists inherently in the time-sequential data that can be derived from the integration of harmonic waves. The non-stationary spectral kernel, realizing a complex-valued feature mapping, has shown its potential to analyze the time-varying statistical characteristics of the time-sequential data, as a result of the modeling frequency parameters. However, most existing spectral kernel-based methods eliminate the imaginary part, thereby limiting the representation power of the spectral kernel. To tackle this issue, we propose a generalized spectral kernel network, namely, Complex-valued spectral kernel Network (Cos-Net), which includes spectral kernel mapping generalization (SKMG) module and complex-valued spectral kernel embedding (CSKE) module. Concretely, the SKMG module is devised to generalize the spectral kernel mapping in the real number domain to the complex number domain, recovering the inherent complex-valued representation for the real-valued data. Then a following CSKE module is further developed to combine the complex-valued spectral kernels and neural networks to effectively capture long-range or periodic relations of the data. Along with the CosNet, we study the effect of the complex-valued spectral kernel mapping via theoretically analyzing the bound of covering number and generalization error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CosNet performs better than the mainstream kernel methods and complex-valued neural networks.
