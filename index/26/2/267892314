Welcome to the 2nd Workshop on Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation which is at the same time the 20th PADS workshop. You will remember that in 2005 the PADS acronym changed its meaning from "Parallel and Distributed Simulation" to “Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation” in order to better represent a broader scope of the workshop. This year's program shows that extending the scope (and adapting the title) of the workshop made sense as categories such as "parallel" or "distributed" only address part of the innovative character of many interesting contributions to this conference's program.
