State-intensive network and distributed applications rely heavily on online caching heuristics for high performance. However, there remains a fundamental performance gap between online caching heuristics and the optimal offline caching al-gorithm due to the lack of visibility into future state access requests in an online setting. Driven by the observation that state access requests in network and distributed applications are often carried in incoming network packets, we present Seer, an online caching solution for networked systems, that exploits the delays experienced by a packet inside a network – most prominently, transmission and queuing delays – to no-tify in advance of future packet arrivals to the target network nodes (switches/routers/middleboxes/end-hosts) implementing caching. Using this as a building block, Seer presents the design of an online cache manager that leverages visibility into (partial) set of future state access requests to make smarter prefetching and cache eviction decisions. Our evaluations show that Seer achieves up to 65% lower cache miss ratio and up to 78% lower flow completion time compared to LRU for key network applications over realistic workloads.
