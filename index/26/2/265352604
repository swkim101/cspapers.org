State actors around the world censor the HTTPS protocol to block access to certain websites. While many circumvention strategies utilize the TCP layer only little emphasis has been placed on the analysis of TLS-a complex protocol and integral building block of HTTPS. In contrast to the TCP layer, circumvention methods on the TLS layer do not require root privileges since TLS operates on the application layer. With this proposal, we want to motivate a deeper analysis of TLS in regard to censorship circumvention techniques. To prove the existence of such techniques, we present TLS record fragmentation as a novel circumvention technique and circumvent the Great Firewall of China (GFW) using this technique. We hope that our research fosters collaboration between censorship and TLS researchers.
