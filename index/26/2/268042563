Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms typically utilize learning and/or planning techniques to derive effective policies. Integrating both approaches has proven to be highly successful in addressing complex sequential decision-making challenges, as evidenced by algorithms such as AlphaZero and MuZero, which consolidate the planning process into a parametric search-policy. AIXI, the universal Bayes-optimal agent, leverages planning through comprehensive search as its primary means to find an optimal policy. Here we define an alternative universal Bayesian agent, which we call Self-AIXI, that on the contrary to AIXI, maximally exploits learning to obtain good policies. It does so by self-predicting its own stream of action data, which is generated, similarly to other TD(0) agents, by taking an action maximization step over the current on-policy (universal mixture-policy) Q-value estimates. We prove that Self-AIXI converges to AIXI, and inherits a series of properties like maximal Legg-Hutter intelligence and the self-optimizing property.
