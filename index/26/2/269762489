The existing pairing and authentication mechanisms adopt either fuzzy commitment or fuzzy password-authenticated key exchange for device fingerprint generation, detecting and correcting multiple symbol errors, leading to guessing attacks and increased pairing time. In this study, we propose a one-shot pairing and authentication approach that generates a device fingerprint from the selected contextual data using Median-of-medians (Moms), ensuring randomness and preventing guessing attacks. Moreover, we integrate the Moms secret into Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) to reduce the pairing time and improve security. The evaluation demonstrates that our proposed one-shot pairing and authentication approach ensures strong resistance against information gain, reduces the probability of guessing attacks, and significantly decreases the pairing time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
