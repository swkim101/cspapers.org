The papers in these proceedings were presented at the 12th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce --- EC'11, held June 5-9, 2011, in San Jose, California, USA. Since its inception in 1999, ACM EC has served as the leading scientific conference on advances in theory, systems, and applications for electronic commerce. The conference is interdisciplinary and addresses a number of facets of electronic commerce, including (1) theory and foundations; (2) architectures and languages; (3) automation, personalization, and targeting; (4) security, privacy, encryption, and digital rights; (5) applications, experimental and empirical studies; and (6) social factors. In addition to the main technical program, EC'11 featured five workshops and six tutorials. EC'11 was also co-located this year with fifteen other computer science conferences as part of the 2011 ACM Federated Computing Research Conference. 
 
The call for papers attracted 189 submissions from authors in academia and industry from all around the world. Each paper was reviewed by at least three program committee members and one senior program committee member on the basis of scientific novelty, technical quality, and importance to the field. After discussion and deliberation among the program committee, senior program committee and program chairs, 49 papers were selected for presentation at the conference. Thirty-eight of these are published in these proceedings. For the remaining eleven, at the authors' request, only abstracts are included along with pointers to full working papers. This option accommodates the practices of fields outside of computer science in which conference publishing can preclude journal publishing. It is expected that many of the papers in these proceedings will appear in a more polished and complete form in scientific journals in the future. 
 
After the review process, an Outstanding Papers committee of Shuchi Chawla, David Reiley and Rahul Sami was established. The committee singled out the following two papers as co-winners of the EC'11 Best Student Paper Award: 
 
• Polynomial-time Computation of Exact Correlated Equilibrium in Compact Games, by Albert Xin Jiang and Kevin Leyton-Brown, University of British Columbia; 
 
• A Truthful Randomized Mechanism for Combinatorial Public Projects via Convex Optimization, by Shaddin Dughmi, Stanford University.
