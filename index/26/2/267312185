Cross-domain sequential recommendation is an important development direction of recommender systems. It combines the characteristics of sequential recommender systems and cross-domain recommender systems, which can capture the dynamic preferences of users and alleviate the problem of cold-start users. However, in recent years, people pay more and more attention to their privacy. How to protect the usersâ€™ privacy has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving cross-domain sequential recommender system (PriCDSR), which can provide users with recommendation services while preserving their privacy at the same time. Specifically, we define a new differential privacy on the data, taking into account both the ID information and the order information. Then, we design a random mechanism that satisfies this differential privacy and provide its theoretical proof. Our PriCDSR is a non-invasive method that can adopt any cross-domain sequential recommender system as a base model without any modification to it. To the best of our knowledge, our PriCDSR is the first work to investigate privacy issues in cross-domain sequential recommender systems. We conduct experiments on three domains, and the results demonstrate that our PriCDSR, despite introducing noise, still outperforms recommender systems that only use data from a single domain.
