We describe a "QUESTION-ANSWER" information system implemented on computer BESM-6 in the time-shared system. The "QUESTION-ANSWER" system is capable of deducing facts that have not been explicitly given to it by using a large data base and interpreting some of data as rules of inference. The system employs a special procedure which allows not to use contradictory information even if it is contained in the data base.
