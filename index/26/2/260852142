This study explores the topics and trends of teaching AI ethics in higher education, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation as the analysis tool. The analyses included 166 courses from 105 universities around the world. Building on the uncovered patterns, we distil a model of current pedagogical practice, the BAG model (Build, Assess, and Govern), that combines cognitive levels, course content, and disciplines. The study critically assesses the implications of this teaching paradigm and challenges practitioners to reflect on their practices and move beyond stereotypes and biases.
