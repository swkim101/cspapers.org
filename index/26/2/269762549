In public blockchains, leaking secret keys can cause the permanent loss of crypto assets. It is imperative to understand the illicit activities on blockchains related to leaked keys. This paper presents the first measurement study that uncovers, quantifies, and characterizes the actual misuses of the leaked keys from top websites on the Internet to withdraw assets on Ethereum. By finding key-leaking web pages and joining them with transactions, the study reveals 7.29*10^6/0.59*10^6 USD worth of assets on Ethereum mainnet/Binance Smart Chain (BSC) are withdrawn from 1421/1514 leaked secret keys. Mitigations are proposed to avoid the financial loss caused by leaked keys.
