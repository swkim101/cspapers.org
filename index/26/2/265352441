The supply of IoT devices is increasing year by year. Even in industries that demand sophistication, such as unmanned driving, construction, and robotics industry, IoT devices are being utilized. However, the security of IoT devices is lagging behind this development due to their diverse types and challenging firmware execution environments. The existing methods, such as direct device connectivity or partial emulation, are used to solve this. However, full system emulation is better suited for the large-scale analysis, because it can test many firmwares without requiring devices. Therefore, recent studies have integrated emulation and software testing techniques such as fuzzing, but they are still unsuitable for testing various firmware and inefficient. In this poster, we propose FirmColic, which combines fuzzing with concolic execution to mitigate these limitations. FirmColic is a type of augmented process emulation, which improves the effectiveness of fuzzing using keyword extraction based on concolic execution. Also, we apply five arbitration techniques in an augmented process emulation environment for the high success rates of the emulation. We prove that FirmColic has faster detection, more crash detection, and a higher code coverage than the previous studies.
