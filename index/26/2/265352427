These proceedings contain the papers selected for inclusion in the technical program for the 22st ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (ACM WPES 2023), held in conjunction with the 30th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (ACM CCS 2023) at the Tivoli Congress Center in Copenhagen, Denmark, on November 26, 2023. In response to the workshop's call for papers, 31 valid submissions were received, including 21 full paper submissions and 10 short paper submissions. They were evaluated by a technical program committee consisting of 54 researchers whose backgrounds include a diverse set of topics related to privacy. Each paper was reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. Papers were evaluated based on their importance, novelty, and technical quality. After the rigorous review process, 9 submissions were accepted as full papers (acceptance rate: 29.0%) and an additional 8 submissions were accepted as short papers.
