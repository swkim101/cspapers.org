Current motion forecasting approaches typically train a deep end-to-end model from the source domain data, and then apply it directly to target subjects. Despite promising results, they remain non-optimal, due to privacy considerations, the test person and his/her natural properties (e.g., behavioral trait) are typically unseen in training. In this case, the source pre-trained model has a low ability to adapt to these out-of-source characteristics, resulting in an unreliable prediction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel helper-predictor test-time personalization approach (H/P-TTP), which allows for a generalizable representation of out-of-source subjects to gain more realistic predictions. Concretely, the helper is preceded by explicit and implicit augmenters, where the former yields noisy sequences to improve robustness, while the latter is to generate novel-domain data with an adversarial learning paradigm. Then, the domain-generalizable learning is achieved where the helper can extract cross-subject invariant-knowledge to update the predictor. At test time, given a new person, the predictor is able to be further optimized to empower personalized capabilities to the specific properties. Extensive experiments show that with H/P-TTP, the existing models are significantly improved for various unseen subjects. The project page is available at https://sites.google.com/view/hp-ttp.
