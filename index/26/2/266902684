Freight transportation marketplace rates are typically challenging to forecast accurately. In this work, we have developed a novel statistical technique based on signature transforms and have built a predictive and adaptive model to forecast these marketplace rates. Our technique is based on two key elements of the signature transform: one being its universal nonlinearity property, which linearizes the feature space and hence translates the forecasting problem into linear regression, and the other being the signature kernel, which allows for comparing computationally efficiently similarities between time series data. Combined, it allows for efficient feature generation and precise identification of seasonality and regime switching in the forecasting process. An algorithm based on our technique has been deployed by Amazon trucking operations, with far superior forecast accuracy and better interpretability versus commercially available industry models, even during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict. Furthermore, our technique is able to capture the influence of business cycles and the heterogeneity of the marketplace, improving prediction accuracy by more than fivefold, with an estimated annualized saving of \$50MM.
