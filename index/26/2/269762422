The way scholarly knowledge and in particular literature reviews are communicated today rather resembles static, unstructured, pseudo-digitized articles, which are hardly processable by machines and AI. This demo showcases a novel way to create and publish scholarly literature reviews, also called semantic reviews. The neuro-symbolic approach consists of extracting key insights from scientific papers leveraging neural models and organizing them using a symbolic scholarly knowledge graph. The food information engineering review case study will allow participants to see how this approach is implemented using the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). The real-time demo will allow participants to play with the ORKG and create their own living, semantic review.
