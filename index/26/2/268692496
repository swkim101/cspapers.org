Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is an efficient and scalable method for knowledge graph completion. However, most existing KGE methods suffer from the challenge of multiple relation semantics, which often degrades their performance. This is because most KGE methods learn fixed continuous vectors for entities (relations) and make deterministic entity predictions to complete the knowledge graph, which hardly captures multiple relation semantics. To tackle this issue, previous works try to learn complex probabilistic embeddings instead of fixed embeddings but suffer from heavy computational complexity. In contrast, this paper proposes a simple yet efficient framework namely the Knowledge Graph Diffusion Model (KGDM) to capture the multiple relation semantics in prediction. Its key idea is to cast the problem of entity prediction into conditional entity generation. Specifically, KGDM estimates the probabilistic distribution of target entities in prediction through Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). To bridge the gap between continuous diffusion models and discrete KGs, two learnable embedding functions are defined to map entities and relation to continuous vectors. To consider connectivity patterns of KGs, a Conditional Entity Denoiser model is introduced to generate target entities conditioned on given entities and relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KGDM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in three benchmark datasets.
