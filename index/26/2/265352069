Large Language Models prompting, such as using in-context demonstrations, is a mainstream technique for invoking LLMs to perform high-performance and solid complex reasoning (e.g., mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning), and has the potential for further human-machine collaborative scientific findings. However, current LLMs are delicate and elusive in prompt words and styles. And there is an unseen gap between LLM understanding and human-written prompts. This paper introduces Alignedcot, an LLM-acquainted prompting technique that includes proficient ``native-speaking'' in in-context learning for the LLMs. Specifically, it achieves consistent and correct step-wise prompts in zero-shot scenarios by progressively probing, refining, and formatting the LLM chain of thoughts so that free from handcrafted few-shot demonstrations while maintaining the prompt quality. We conduct experiments on mathematical reasoning and commonsense reasoning. We find that LLMs with Alignedcot perform significantly superior to them with human-crafted demonstrations. We further apply Alignedcot for rewriting the GSM8K training set, resulting in a GSM8K-Align dataset. We observe its benefits for retrieval augmented generation.
