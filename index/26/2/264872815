We present the results of a research project focus on improving the usability of web search tools for blind users who interact via screen reader and voice synthesizer. In the first stage of our study, we proposed eight specific guidelines for simplifying this interaction with search engines. Next, we evaluated these criteria by applying them to Google UIs, re-implementing the simple search and the result page. Finally, we prepared the environment for a remote test with 12 totally blind users. The results highlight how Google interfaces could be improved in order to simplify interaction for the blind.
