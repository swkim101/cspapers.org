Multi-view clustering aims to extract valuable information from different sources or perspectives. Over the years, the deep neural network has demonstrated its superior representation learning capability in multi-view clustering and achieved impressive performance. However, most existing deep clustering approaches are dedicated to merging and exploring the consistent latent representation across multiple views while overlooking the abundant complementary information in each view. Furthermore, finding correlations between multiple views in an unsupervised setting is a significant challenge. To tackle these issues, we present a novel Cross-view Topology based Consistent and Complementary information extraction framework, termed CTCC. In detail, deep embedding can be obtained from the bipartite graph learning module for each view individually. CTCC then constructs the cross-view topological graph based on the OT distance between the bipartite graph of each view. Utilizing the above graph, we maximize the mutual information across views to learn consistent information and enhance the complementarity of each view by selectively isolating distributions from each other. Extensive experiments on five challenging datasets verify that CTCC outperforms existing methods significantly.
