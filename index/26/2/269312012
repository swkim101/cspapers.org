Despite extensive efforts, existing approaches to design accelerators for optimization-based robotic applications have limitations. Some approaches focus on accelerating general matrix operations, but they fail to fully exploit the specific sparse structure commonly found in many robotic algorithms. On the other hand, certain methods require manual design of dedicated accelerators, resulting in inefficiencies and significant non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs. The Orianna framework represents a significant advancement as it overcomes the limitations of existing approaches and provides a solution to generate accelerators for robotic applications that integrate multiple optimization-based algorithms. The framework leverages a common abstraction factor graph to overcome these challenges. Application designers can easily define their objectives and constraints using the Orianna software framework. The Orianna compiler then translates the high-level code into basic matrix operations and executes them in an out-of-order manner on the generated accelerator. We demonstrate its effectiveness by implementing a real FPGA-based prototype. Orianna accelerators achieve a 6.5× performance improvement and a 15.1× energy reduction compared to an advanced Intel CPU. Furthermore, Orianna achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art dedicated accelerators while utilizing only 36.1% of hardware resources.
