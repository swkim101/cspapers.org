Controlling the contact force during interactions is an inherent requirement for locomotion and manipulation tasks. Current reinforcement learning approaches to locomotion and manipulation rely implicitly on forceful interaction to accomplish tasks but do not explicitly regulate it. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning task specification that focuses on matching desired contact force levels. Integrating force control with the coordination of a robotâ€™s body and arm, we present an end-to-end policy for legged manipulator control. Force control enables us to realize compliant gripper and whole-body pulling movements that have not been previously demonstrated using a learned policy. It also facilitates a characterization of the force-tracking performance of learned policies in simulation and the real world, indicating their performance potential for force-critical tasks.
