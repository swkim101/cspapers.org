In a world where diversity is increasingly recognised and celebrated, it is important for HCI to embrace the evolving methods and theories for technologies to reflect the diversity of its users and be ability-centric. Interdependence Theory, an example of this evolution, highlights the interpersonal relationships between humans and technologies and how technologies should be designed to meet shared goals and outcomes for people, regardless of their abilities. This necessitates a contemporary understanding of "ability-diverse collaboration," which motivated this review. In this review, we offer an analysis of 117 papers sourced from the ACM Digital Library spanning the last two decades. We contribute (1) a unified taxonomy and the Ability-Diverse Collaboration Framework, (2) a reflective discussion and mapping of the current design space, and (3) future research opportunities and challenges. Finally, we have released our data and analysis tool to encourage the HCI research community to contribute to this ongoing effort.
