Brainwave measuring devices have transitioned from specialized medical tools to user-friendly and economically accessible consumer products. This shift has opened new avenues for pervasive services, with applications spanning brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), disease detection, criminal trials, and, notably, authentication in computer security. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, being difficult to steal and revocable, present an attractive biometric option. However, the practical deployment of these signals is hindered by security threats, usability issues, and privacy concerns. To this end, we expect to improve the overall performance of authentication systems using consumer-grade devices, gain a better understanding of user attitudes toward this type of authentication, and protect the user's privacy against unauthorized use of samples collected during enrollment and verification.
