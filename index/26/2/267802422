The performance of multiple-instruction-issue processors can be severely limited by the compilerâ€™s ability to generate efficient code for concurrent hardware. In the IhfPACT project, we have developed IMPACT-I, a highly optimizing C compiler Lo exploit instruction level concurrency. The optimization capabiiities of the IMPACT-I C: compiler are summarized in this paper. Using the IMPACT-I C compiler, we ran experiments to analyze the performance of multiple-instruction-issue processors executing some important non-numerical programs. The multiple-instruction-issue procuurors achieve solid speedup over high-performance single-instruction-issue processors. We ran experiments to characterize the following archirectural design issues: code scheduling model, instruction issue rate. memory load latency, and function unit resource limitations. Based on the experimental results, we propo5e the IMPACT Architectural Framework, a set of architectural features that best support the IMPACT-I C compiler to generate efficiettt code for multiple-instructionissue processors. By supporting these architectural features, multiple-instruction-issue implementations of existing and new architectures receive immediat.e compilation support from the IMPACT-I C compiler.
