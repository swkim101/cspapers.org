Global localization is a challenging task for intelligent robots, as its accuracy directly contributes to the performance of downstream navigation and planning tasks. However, existing literature focus more on the place retrieval and the success rate of localization, with limited attention given to the metrics of position estimation. In this paper, a single-shot global LiDAR localization method is proposed with the ultimate goal of achieving high position accuracy, inspired by the positioning approach of multi-constellation localization systems. Initially, we perform coarse localization using global descriptors and select observation points along with their corresponding coordinates based on the obtained coarse localization results. Coordinates can be acquired from a pre-built map, GNSS, or other devices. Then, a lightweight LiDAR odometry method is designed to estimate the distance between the retrieved data and the observation points. Ultimately, the localization problem is transformed into an optimization problem of solving a system of multiple sphere equations. The experimental results on the KITTI dataset and the self-collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves an average localization error (including errors in the z-axis) of 0.89 meters. In addition, it achieves retrieval efficiency of 0.357 s per frame on the former dataset and 0.214 s per frame on the latter one.
