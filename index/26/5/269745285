This paper examines the tensions between neighborhood gentrification and community surveillance posts on Nextdoor, a hyperlocal social media platform for neighborhoods. We created a privacy-preserving pipeline to gather research data from public Nextdoor posts in Atlanta, Georgia and filtered these to a dataset of 1,537 community surveillance posts. We developed a qualitative codebook to label observed patterns of community surveillance, and deploy a large language model to tag these posts at scale. Ultimately, we present an extensible and empirically-tested typology of the modes of community surveillance that occur on hyperlocal platforms. We find a complex relationship between community surveillance posts and neighborhood gentrification, which indicates that publicly disclosing information about perceived outsiders, especially for petty crimes, is most prevalent in gentrifying neighborhoods. Our empirical evidence inform critical perspectives which posit that community surveillance on platforms like Nextdoor can exclude and marginalize minoritized populations, particularly in gentrifying neighborhoods. Our findings carry broader implications for hyperlocal social platforms and their potential to amplify and exacerbate social tensions and exclusion.
