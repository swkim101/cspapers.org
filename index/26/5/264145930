In this paper, we present a new paradigm for evaluating egocentric pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms. Based on various contextual information, we extract driving scenarios for a meaningful and systematic approach to identifying challenges for prediction models. In this regard, we also propose a new metric for more effective ranking within the scenario-based evaluation. We conduct extensive empirical studies of existing models on these scenarios to expose shortcomings and strengths of different approaches. The scenario-based analysis highlights the importance of using multimodal sources of information and challenges caused by inadequate modeling of ego-motion and scale of pedestrians. To this end, we propose a novel egocentric trajectory prediction model that benefits from multimodal sources of data fused in an effective and efficient step-wise hierarchical fashion and two auxiliary tasks designed to learn more robust representation of scene dynamics. We conduct empirical evaluation on common benchmark datasets and show that our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also significantly improves performance by up to 39% in challenging scenarios, such as high ego-speed, compared to the past arts1.
