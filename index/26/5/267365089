In this work, we describe a method that determines an exact map from a finite set of subgraph densities to the parameters of a stochastic block model (SBM) matching these densities. Given a number $K$ of blocks, the subgraph densities of a finite number of stars and bistars uniquely determines a single element of the class of all degree-separated stochastic block models with $K$ blocks. Our method makes it possible to translate estimates of these subgraph densities into model parameters, and hence to use subgraph densities directly for inference. The computational overhead is negligible; computing the translation map is polynomial in $K$, but independent of the graph size once the subgraph densities are given.
