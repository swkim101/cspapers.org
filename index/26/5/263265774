Entangled photon quantum imaging technology has broad application prospects in ocean imaging due to its high resolution, anti-turbulence and anti-interference characteristics. Turbulence and optical attenuation caused by seawater will seriously limit the traditional imaging system, and quantum imaging based on entangled light source can overcome the limitations of low imaging resolution, large impact on marine environment and low confidentiality in traditional underwater target imaging. Based on the propagation characteristics of weak turbulent environment, we propose a new photon capture probability algorithm for marine environment based on entangled photon pairs. Finally, the relevant experimental environment is constructed according to the designed imaging optical path. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed quantum imaging method.
