Monitored data collected from railway turnouts are vulnerable to cyberattacks: attackers may either conceal failures or trigger unnecessary maintenance actions. To address this issue, a cyberattack investigation method is proposed based on predictions made from the temporal evolution of the turnout behavior. These predictions are then compared to the field acquired data to detect any discrepancy. This method is illustrated on a collection of real-life data.
