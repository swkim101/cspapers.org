Mapping 3D airflow fields is important for many HVAC, industrial, medical, and home applications. However, current approaches are expensive and time-consuming. We present Anemoi, a sub-$100 drone-based system for autonomously mapping 3D airflow fields in indoor environments. Anemoi leverages the effects of airflow on motor control signals to estimate the magnitude and direction of wind at any given point in space. We introduce an exploration algorithm for selecting optimal waypoints that minimize overall airflow estimation uncertainty. We demonstrate through microbenchmarks and real deployments that Anemoi is able to estimate wind speed and direction with errors up to 0.41 m/s and 25.1Â° lower than the existing state of the art and map 3D airflow fields with an average RMS error of 0.73 m/s.
