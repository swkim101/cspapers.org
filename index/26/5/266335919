There has been significant attention devoted to the effectiveness of various domains, such as semi-supervised learning, contrastive learning, and meta-learning, in enhancing the performance of methods for noisy label learning (NLL) tasks. However, most existing methods still depend on prior assumptions regarding clean samples amidst different sources of noise (e.g., a pre-defined drop rate or a small subset of clean samples). In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful idea called NPN, which revolutionizes Noisy label learning by integrating Partial label learning (PLL) and Negative learning (NL). Toward this goal, we initially decompose the given label space adaptively into the candidate and complementary labels, thereby establishing the conditions for PLL and NL. We propose two adaptive data-driven paradigms of label disambiguation for PLL: hard disambiguation and soft disambiguation. Furthermore, we generate reliable complementary labels using all non-candidate labels for NL to enhance model robustness through indirect supervision. To maintain label reliability during the later stage of model training, we introduce a consistency regularization term that encourages agreement between the outputs of multiple augmentations. Experiments conducted on both synthetically corrupted and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the superiority of NPN compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
