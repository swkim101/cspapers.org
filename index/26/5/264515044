Swarm User Interfaces (Swarm UIs) enable manipulation of user environment through the dynamic arrangement of small robots. However, the operation range of Swarm UIs are limited to a single plane due to their locomotion constraints, which are typically two-wheel-propelled. Here, We present a proof-of-concept design for swarm robots, which enables them to cooperatively transition between horizontal and vertical surfaces. Notably, this design requires only passive mechanical structure and does not rely on any powered electrical components. We demonstrate several application examples to showcase the feasibility of the robots.
