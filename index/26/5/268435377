With the increased demand for Computer Science degrees in the work force, Computer Science is becoming more prominent in high schools. AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) is a course that serves as a bridge into Computer Science. Code.org provides a year-long curriculum for this AP course to be led by teachers in the classroom. Beyond an analysis of the pass rates of students, and with the recency of the AP CSP course, a reflection of the AP CSP curriculum from the student's perspective is in order. This study breaks down the strengths and weaknesses of AP CSP from a student's perspective. Results show there are many strengths compared to weaknesses in relation to the Code.org curriculum. However, the course can be a little challenging in motivating and engaging students if not executed properly by the teacher.
