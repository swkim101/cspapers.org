An integrated set of tools to support top—down, structured software design is described. The tools provide multiple views of the design process and share a common, iconic user interface among themselves and with an extensive set of office system utilities. The multiple design views are supported by a multiple window operating system running on a high performance microcomputer with a high resolution, bit—mapped display and a mouse. The system provides support for proven software engineering methodologies from data flow design through software maintenance. High quality documentation is automatically produced during each phase of the design. The tool set is language—independent and open—ended for ease of future expansion.
