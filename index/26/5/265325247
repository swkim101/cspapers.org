A dual-polarized composite patch-monopole antenna with enhanced bandwidth and beamwidths is proposed. It consists of a double differential-fed patch loaded with four monopoles, which broaden the beamwidth and enhance the operational bandwidth simultaneously. As a proof, an antenna prototype operating at the center frequency of 2.5 GHz has been fabricated and measured. The antenna prototype achieves a bandwidth of $12.5\%(2.39-2.71\text{GHz})$, a port-to-port isolation of $\geq 40\text{dB}$, and half-power beamwidth (HPBWs) of $\geq 160^{\circ}$ and $\geq 120^{\circ}$ in the E- and H-planes, respectively.
