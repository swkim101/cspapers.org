As teaching-focused positions proliferate and university teaching careers become more professionalized, there is growing attention being paid to how teaching faculty are created. However, how teaching faculty are hired also deserves scrutiny. Teaching faculty hiring varies widely between institutions, raising questions of whether hiring processes are effectively identifying, evaluating, and recruiting qualified applicants, and which approaches are most effective. Variation in application requirements and interview processes may also result in a higher workload for teaching faculty candidates when compared to peers applying for other types of faculty positions. This panel brings together faculty with significant teaching faculty hiring experience and new teaching faculty who were very recently on the job market. Together we'll discuss what is and is not working in teaching faculty hiring, and how we might improve the process for both institutions and candidates. We anticipate engaging with those involved with hiring teaching faculty, as well as current and future teaching faculty candidates.
