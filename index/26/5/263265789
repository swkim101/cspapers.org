Energy-efficient visual sensing is of paramount importance to enable battery-backed low power IoT and mobile applications. Unfortunately, modern image sensors still consume hundreds of milliwatts of power, mainly due to analog readout. This is because current systems always supply a fixed voltage to the sensor's analog circuitry, leading to higher power profiles. In this work, we propose to aggressively scale the analog voltage supplied to the camera as a means to significantly reduce sensor power consumption. To that end, we characterize the power and fidelity implications of analog voltage scaling on three off-the-shelf image sensors. Our characterization reveals that analog voltage scaling reduces sensor power but also degrades image quality. Furthermore, the degradation in image quality situationally affects the task accuracy of vision applications. We develop a visual streaming pipeline that flexibly allows application developers to dynamically adapt sensor voltage on a frame-by-frame basis. We develop a voltage controller that programmatically generates desired sensor voltage based on application request. We integrate our voltage controller into the existing RPi-based video streaming IoT pipeline. On top of this, we develop runtime support for flexible voltage specification from vision applications. Evaluating the system over a wide range of voltage scaling policies on popular vision tasks reveals that Squint imaging can deliver up to 73% sensor power savings, while maintaining reasonable task fidelity.
