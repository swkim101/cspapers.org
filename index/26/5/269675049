Meta-learning has been widely employed to tackle the cold-start problem in user modeling. Similar to a guidebook for a new traveler, meta-learning significantly affects decision-making for new users in crucial scenarios, such as career recommendations. Consequently, the issue of fairness in meta-learning has gained paramount importance. Several methods have been proposed to mitigate unfairness in meta-learning and have shown promising results. However, a fundamental question remains unexplored: What is the critical factor leading to unfairness in meta-learned user modeling? Through the theoretical analysis that integrates the meta-learning paradigm with group fairness metrics, we identify group proportion imbalance as a critical factor. Subsequently, in order to mitigate the impact of this factor, we introduce a novel Fairness-aware Adaptive Sampling framework for meTa-learning, abbreviated as FAST. Its core concept involves adaptively adjusting the sampling distribution for different user groups during the interleaved training process of meta-learning. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating the convergence of FAST. Finally, empirical experiments conducted on three datasets reveal that FAST effectively enhances fairness while maintaining high accuracy. The code for FAST is available at https://github.com/zhengz99/FAST.
