This paper presents a new information source for supporting robot localisation: material composition. The proposed method complements the existing visual, structural, and semantic cues utilized in the literature. However, it has a distinct advantage in its ability to differentiate structurally [23], visually [25] or categorically [1] similar objects such as different doors, by using Raman spectrometers. Such devices can identify the material of objects it probes through the bonds between the material's molecules. Unlike similar sensors, such as mass spectroscopy, it does so without damaging the material or environment. In addition to introducing the first material-based localisation algorithm, this paper supports the future growth of the field by presenting a gazebo plugin for Raman spectrometers, material sensing demonstrations, as well as the first-ever localisation data-set with benchmarks for material-based localisation. This benchmarking shows that the proposed technique results in a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art localisation techniques, achieving 16 % more accurate localisation than the leading baseline.
