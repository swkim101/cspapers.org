For multicomputer applications, the most important performance parameters of a network is the latency for short messages. In this paper we present an analysis of communication latency using measurement of the Nectar system. Nectar is a high-performance multicomputer built around a high-bandwidth crosspoint network. Nodes are connected to the Nectar network using network coprocessors that are primarily responsible the protocol processing, but that can also execute application code. This architecture allows us to analyze message latency both between workstations with an outboard protocol engine and between lightweight nodes with a minimal runtime system and a fast, simple network interface (the coprocessors). We study how much context switching, buffer management and protocol processing contribute to the communication latency and we discuss how the latency is influenced by the protocol implementation.
