The deluge of scholarly publication poses a challenge for scholars find relevant research and policy makers to seek in-depth information and understand research impact. Information retrieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP) and bibliometrics could enhance scholarly search, retrieval and user experience, but their use in digital libraries is not widespread. To address this gap, we propose the 4th Joint Workshop on BIRNDL and the 5th CL-SciSumm Shared Task. We seek to foster collaboration among researchers in NLP, IR and Digital Libraries (DL), and to stimulate the development of new methods in NLP, IR, recommendation systems and scientometrics toward improved scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale.
