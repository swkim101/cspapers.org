Sparkybot is a novel robotic platform designed to enrich children-robot interaction by leveraging embodied agent technology. The platform allows children to customize the interaction characters and behaviors of the robot, providing a more personalized and engaging experience. Two scenarios are demonstrated to showcase how children can customize and interact with the robot. Our goal is to provide a platform that enables children to interact with robots in a more creative and engaging way.
