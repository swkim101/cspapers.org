Air pollution poses serious health concerns in developing countries, such as India, necessitating large-scale measurement for correlation analysis, policy recommendations, and informed decision-making. However, fine-grained data collection is costly. Specifically, static sensors for pollution measurement cost several thousand dollars per unit, leading to inadequate deployment and coverage. To complement the existing sparse static sensor network, we propose a mobile sensor network utilizing lower-cost PM 2 . 5 sensors mounted on public buses in the Delhi-NCR region of India. Through this exercise, we introduce a novel dataset A IR D ELHI comprising PM 2 . 5 and PM 10 measurements. This dataset is made publicly available at https: // www. cse. iitd. ac. in/ pollutiondata , serving as a valuable resource for machine learning (ML) researchers and environmental-ists. We present three key contributions with the release of this dataset. Firstly, through in-depth statistical analysis, we demonstrate that the released dataset significantly differs from existing pollution datasets, highlighting its uniqueness and potential for new insights. Secondly, the dataset quality been validated against existing expensive sensors. Thirdly, we conduct a benchmarking exercise ( https: // github. com/ sachin-iitd/ DelhiPMDatasetBenchmark ), evaluating state-of-the-art methods for interpolation, feature imputation, and forecasting on this dataset, which is the largest publicly available PM dataset to date. The results of the benchmarking exercise underscore the substantial disparities in accuracy between the proposed
