Many work domains include numerous interruptions, which can contribute to errors. We investigated the potential of augmented reality (AR) cues to facilitate primary task resumption after interruptions of varying lengths. Experiment 1 (N = 83) involved a computer-based primary task with a red AR arrow at the to-be-resumed task step which was placed via a gesture by the participants or automatically. Compared to no cue, both cues significantly reduced the resumption lag (i.e., the time between the end of the interruption and the resumption of the primary task) following long but not short interruptions. Experiment 2 (N = 38) involved a tangible sorting task, utilizing only the automatic cue. The AR cue facilitated task resumption compared to not cue after both short and long interruptions. We demonstrated the potential of AR cues in mitigating the negative effects of interruptions and make suggestions for integrating AR technologies for task resumption.
