Our work exploits multiple antennas to ameliorate communication reliability and energy harvesting efficiency for energy harvesting overlay networks (EHONs). The performance of EHONs is elaborately evaluated through abundant practical contexts. Various simulation results demonstrate flexible system performance control with several parameters. Moreover, the system throughput reaches the peak with selecting optimally the time durations, the required data rate, the energy conversion efficiency, and the transmission power and the number of antennas of the power transmitter.
