Peer instruction (PI) has shown significant potential in facilitating student engagement and collaborative learning. However, the implementation of PI for large-scale programming lectures has proven challenging due to difficulties in monitoring student engagement, discussion topics, and code changes. This paper introduces VizPI, an interactive web tool that enables instructors to conduct, monitor, and assess PI for programming exercises in real-time. With features that visualize the progress of student discussions and code submissions, VizPI allows for more effective oversight of PI activities and the provision of personalized feedback at scale. Our work aims to transform the pedagogical approach to PI in programming education, making it more engaging and adaptable to student needs.
