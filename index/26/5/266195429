Robotic applications like automated order picking in warehouses or retail stores, or fetch and carry tasks in hospitals, care homes, or households rely on the capability of service robots to find and handle a specific type of object. These applications are challenging as the set of objects is very large and varies over time. Despite its significance, there is no suitable universal large-scale dataset available from the retail domain, which allows for a principled analysis of all relevant robotics research aspects in that field. Hence, this paper introduces a novel dataset of more than 1,000 retail objects, including color images, 3D scans, and high-resolution textured 3D models of individual objects, synthetic scenes and real settings, which covers the specifics of the retail domain. The dataset was designed to serve researchers in all relevant robotics tasks in retail like 3D reconstruction and object modeling, large-scale object classification and instance detection including incremental learning and fine-grained detection, text reading, logo detection, semantic grounding and affordance detection, grasp analysis and manipulation planning, as well as digital twinning and virtual environments. Based on synthetic RGB images of scenes created from the 3D models, two exemplary use cases are examined in this paper to demonstrate the benefits of the dataset: we evaluate the state-of-the-art incremental object detection method InstanceNet and a few-shot fine-grained object classification method. The results prove the suitability of InstanceNet for incremental object detection on large datasets and are promising for the few-shot object classification system.
