This paper focuses on the problem of detecting and reacting to changes in the distribution of a sensorimotor controllerâ€™s observables. The key idea is the design of policies that can take conformal quantiles as input, to detect distribution shifts with formal statistical guarantees, which we define as conformal policy learning. We show how to design such policies by using conformal quantiles to switch between base policies with different characteristics, e.g. safety or speed, or directly augmenting a policy observation with a quantile and training it with reinforcement learning. Theoretically, we show that such policies achieve the formal convergence guarantees in finite time. In addition, we thoroughly evaluate their advantages and limitations on two use cases: simulated autonomous driving and active perception with a physical quadruped. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms five baselines. It is also the simplest of the baseline strategies besides one ablation. Being easy to use, flexible, and with formal guarantees, our work demonstrates how conformal prediction can be an effective tool for sensorimotor learning under uncertainty.
