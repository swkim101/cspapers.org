Fast Internet-wide scanning is essential for network situational awareness and asset evaluation. However, the vast IPv6 address space makes brute-force scanning infeasible. Although state-of-the-art techniques have made effective attempts, these methods do not work in seedless regions, while the detection efficiency is low in regions with seeds. More-over, the constructed hitlists with low coverage cannot truly represent the active IPv6 address landscape of the Internet. This paper introduces AddrMiner , a systematic and comprehensive global active IPv6 address probing system. We divide the IPv6 address space regions into three kinds according to the number of seed addresses to discover active IPv6 addresses from scratch, from few to many. For the regions with no seeds, we present AddrMiner-N , leveraging an organization association strategy to mine active addresses. It fills the gap of address probing in seedless regions and finds active addresses covering 86.4K IPv6 prefixes announced by BGP, accounting for 81.6% of the probed announced prefixes. For the regions with few seeds, we propose AddrMiner-F , utilizing a similarity matching strategy to probe active addresses further. The hit rate of active address probing is improved by 70%-150% compared to existing algorithms. Moreover, for the regions with sufficient seeds, we present AddrMiner-S to generate target addresses based on reinforcement learning dynamically. It nearly doubles the hit rate compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we deploy AddrMiner and discover 2.1 billion active IPv6 addresses, including 1.7 billion de-aliased active addresses and 0.4
