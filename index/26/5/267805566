NetKuang is an extension to Baldwin's SU-Kuang. It runs on networks of computers using Unix and can nd vulnerabilities created by poor system conngu-ration. Vulnerabilities are discovered using a backwards goal-based search that is breadth-rst on individual hosts and parallel when multiple hosts are checked. An implementation in C++ found real vul-nerabilities on production systems. Tests show reasonably fast performance on an LAN.
