Scene Text Recognition (STR) is an important and challenging upstream task for building structured information databases, that involves recognizing text within images of natural scenes. Although current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for STR exhibit high performance, they typically suffer from low inference efficiency due to their reliance on hybrid architectures comprised of visual encoders and sequence decoders. In this work, we propose a VIsion Permutable extractor for fast and efficient Scene Text Recognition (SVIPTR), which achieves an impressive balance between high performance and rapid inference speeds in the domain of STR. Specifically, SVIPTR leverages a visual-semantic extractor with a pyramid structure, characterized by the Permutation and combination of local and global self-attention layers. This design results in a lightweight and efficient model and its inference is insensitive to input length. Extensive experimental results on various standard datasets for both Chinese and English scene text recognition validate the superiority of SVIPTR. Notably, the SVIPTR-T (Tiny) variant delivers highly competitive accuracy on par with other lightweight models and achieves SOTA inference speeds. Meanwhile, the SVIPTR-L (Large) attains SOTA accuracy in single-encoder-type models, while maintaining a low parameter count and favorable inference speed. Our proposed method provides a compelling solution for the STR challenge, which greatly benefits real-world applications requiring fast and efficient STR.
