In this paper, we propose Laseroma, a tiny, lightweight, and low-cost Olfactory Display (OD) that can release a maximum of eleven types of odors through pointed heating. Laseroma can be easily attached to Head-Mounted Devices (HMDs) for creating smell-enhanced and controllable Immersive Experiences. Laseroma mainly consists of (1) a laser diode for rapidly generating the pointed heat, (2) a modular and replaceable odor strip which carries eleven miniature odor reservoirs, and (3) a stepper motor for rotating the odor strip for switching the target aroma. We illustrated and articulated the system design, including the hardware, structural mechanism, materials, and fabrication process. We also conducted a preliminary study by testing the scent release performance through the perceived time and odor-release duration of a single scent container.
