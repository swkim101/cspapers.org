This paper uses a data-driven approach to model a highly redundantly driven tensegrity manipulator's forward and inverse kinematics. The tensegrity manipulator is based on a class-1 tensegrity with 20 struts and bends by 40 pneumatic actuators whose internal pressures are independently controlled. Based on the data obtained through random trials with the robot, a VAE-based kinematics model is trained. The forward model, inverse model, and null space of kinematics are simultaneously acquired as subnetworks of the VAE-based kinematics model. Experiments confirmed that the subnetworks representing forward and inverse kinematics could be used for the end position estimation and control, respectively. In addition, the subnetwork representing null space can generate different target pressures that achieve the same end position, which was confirmed to mean variable stiffness properties similar to musculoskeletal robots.
