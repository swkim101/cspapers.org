Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) enhances the capabilities of 5G by enabling the computation closer to the end-user for real-time and context-aware services. One of the main challenges of MEC is the migration of the MEC application in the presence of user mobility. MigraMEC is a hybrid testbed that simulates the network scenario and user mobility and emulates the MEC framework by using AdvantEDGE. Moreover, MigraMEC implements two physical MEC Hosts (MEHs) by using an extended version of Kubernetes (K8s). Finally, the MigraMEC controller interacts with both the emulative and experimental environments to ensure an efficient migration of the MEC application. Based on network information, the MigraMEC controller not only enforces the MEH where the MEC application is running but also the Point of Access (PoA) to which the user is connected. In our demonstration, the MEC application is a video streaming service, and the results highlight the need for multiple MEHs and efficient migration to maintain a high user experience.
