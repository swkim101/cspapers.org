While hyper-parameters (HPs) are important 001 for knowledge graph (KG) embedding, exist- 002 ing methods fail to search them efﬁciently. To 003 solve this problem, we ﬁrst analyze the proper- 004 ties of different HPs and quantize the transfer- 005 ability from small subgraph to the large graph. 006 Based on the analysis, we propose an efﬁcient 007 two-stage search algorithm, which efﬁciently 008 explores HP conﬁgurations on small subgraph 009 at the ﬁrst stage and transfers the top conﬁgura- 010 tions for ﬁne-tuning on the large whole graph 011 at the second stage. Experiments show that our 012 method can consistently ﬁnd better HPs than 013 the baseline algorithms with the same time 014 budget. We achieve 10.8% average relative im- 015 provement for four embedding models on the 016 large-scale KGs in open graph benchmark. 017
