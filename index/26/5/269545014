This study introduces a novel approach for analyzing thin film interference spectra by employing a micro-spectrometer equipped with a spectral chip. Focusing on zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films prepared via the sol–gel method, this research aims to explore the films’ physical properties through spectral analysis. After obtaining the interference spectrum of the ZnO thin films, the peak positions within the spectrum were cataloged. Mathematical simulation was used to adjust the refractive index and thickness of the films to match the simulated interference peak positions with the observed peak positions. The thickness of the prepared ZnO film was estimated to be 4.9 μm and its refractive index at 80 °C was estimated to be 1.96. In addition, the measurement system was used to detect environmental changes, including temperature changes and gas exposure. It was observed that the optical characteristics of ZnO films exhibit marked variations with temperature shifts, enabling the establishment of a temperature calibration curve based on spectral feature displacement. In addition, experiments using a variety of gases showed that NO2 and gaseous isopropanol significantly affect the interference spectrum of ZnO, with the peak of the interference spectrum shifted by 2.3 nm and 5.2 nm, respectively, after injection of the two gases. This indicates that interferometric spectroscopy can serve as an effective tool for ZnO monitoring, capable of selectively detecting specific gases.
