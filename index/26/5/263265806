Designing a reliable and highly accurate indoor localization system is challenging due to the non-uniformity of indoor spaces, multipath fading, and satellite signal blockage. To address these issues, we propose a Deep Neural Network-based localization system that combines passive Visible Light Positioning (p-VLP) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technologies to achieve stable, energy-efficient, and accurate indoor localization. Our solution leverages incremental learning to fuse data from visible light and BLE, overcoming their individual limitations and achieving centimeter-level localization accuracy. We build a prototype using low-cost S9706 hue sensors for p-VLP and low-power nrf52830 BLE boards to collect data simultaneously from both technologies in a 25m2 testbed. Our approach demonstrates a significant localization accuracy improvement of approximately 47% and 64% compared to individual p-VLP and BLE technologies, respectively, achieving a mean localization error of 20 cm.
