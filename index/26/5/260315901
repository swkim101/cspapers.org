The field of aerial manipulation has seen rapid advances, transitioning from push-and-slide tasks to interaction with articulated objects. The motion trajectory of these complex actions is usually hand-crafted or a result of online optimization methods like Model Predictive Control (MPC) or Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control. However, these methods rely on heuristics or model simplifications to efficiently run on onboard hardware, limiting their robustness, and making them sensitive to disturbances and differences between the real environment and its model. In this work, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to learn reactive motion behaviors for a manipulation task while producing policies that are robust to disturbances and modeling errors. Specifically, we train a policy to perform a door-opening task with an Omnidirectional Micro Aerial Vehicle (OMAV). The policy is trained in a physics simulator and shown in the real world, where it is able to generalize also to door closing tasks never seen in training. We also compare our method against a state-of-the-art MPPI solution in simulation, showing a considerable increase in robustness and speed.
