Neglecting proper oral hygiene has proven to potentially lead to severe oral disease, resulting in complications over time. Careful brushing can mitigate the problem, but it is common for individuals to dedicate insufficient time to the various areas of their teeth. We propose LiT to monitor the brushing situation of 16 Bass technique surfaces in real-time. LiT relies on commercial toothbrushes with blue LEDs as a transmitter and requires only 2 low-cost photosensors as receivers on the toothbrush head. However, the transmission channel of light in the oral cavity is unclear. Finding the optimal deployment positions and minimizing the number of photosensors is challenging. To tackle these obstacles, we design the positioning of the 2 photosensors and create a transmission model within the oral cavity to verify the feasibility theoretically. Additionally, obstacles in implementation include separating brushing action accurately, interference of light on the outer surfaces of front teeth, and individual variability. To overcome these challenges, we develop corresponding technologies and a comprehensive framework. Experiments with 16 users show that LiT achieves a highly accurate recognition rate of 95.3% with an error estimate for brushing duration of 6.1%. Furthermore, LiT also proves resilient under user motion and environmental interference.
