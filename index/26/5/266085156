GPUs, due to their massively-parallel computing architectures, provide high performance for data-parallel applications. However, existing GPU simulators are too slow to enable architects to quickly evaluate their hardware designs and software analysis studies. Sampled simulation methodologies are one common way to speed up CPU simulation. However, GPUs apply drastically different execution models that challenge the sampled simulation methods designed for CPU simulations. Recent GPU sampled simulation methodologies do not fully take advantage of the GPU’s special architecture features, such as limited types of basic blocks or warps. Moreover, these methods depend on up-front analysis via profiling tools or functional simulation, making them difficult to use.To address this, we extensively studied the execution patterns of a variety of GPU workloads and propose Photon, a sampled simulation methodology tailored to GPUs. Photon incorporates methodologies that automatically consider different levels of GPU execution, such as kernels, warps, and basic blocks. Photon does not require up-front profiling of GPU workloads and utilizes a lightweight online analysis method based on the identification of highly repetitive software behavior. We evaluate Photon using a variety of GPU workloads, including real-world applications like VGG and ResNet. The final result shows that Photon reduces the simulation time needed to perform one inference of ResNet-152 with batch size 1 from 7.05 days to just 1.7 hours with a low sampling error of 10.7%.CCS CONCEPTS• Computing methodologies → Modeling and simulation; Graphics processors; Cluster analysis.
