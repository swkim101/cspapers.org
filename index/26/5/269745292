Increasing encounters between people and autonomous service robots may lead to conflicts due to mismatches between human expectations and robot behaviour. This interactive online study (N = 335) investigated human-robot interactions at an elevator, focusing on the effect of communication and behavioural expectations on participants’ acceptance and compliance. Participants evaluated a humanoid delivery robot primed as either submissive or assertive. The robot either matched or violated these expectations by using a command or appeal to ask for priority and then entering either first or waiting for the next ride. The results highlight that robots are less accepted if they violate expectations by entering first or using a command. Interactions were more effective if participants expected an assertive robot which then asked politely for priority and entered first. The findings emphasize the importance of power expectations in human-robot conflicts for the robot’s evaluation and effectiveness in everyday situations.
