Source free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to transfer a trained source model to the unlabeled target domain without accessing the source data. However, the SFDA setting faces a performance bottleneck due to the absence of source data and target supervised information, as evidenced by the limited performance gains of the newest SFDA methods. Active source free domain adaptation (ASFDA) can break through the problem by exploring and exploiting a small set of informative samples via active learning. In this paper, we first find that those satisfying the proper-ties of neighbor-chaotic, individual-different, and source-dissimilar are the best points to select. We define them as the minimum happy (MH) points challenging to explore with existing methods. We propose minimum happy points learning (MHPL) to explore and exploit MH points actively. We design three unique strategies: neighbor environment uncertainty, neighbor diversity relaxation, and one-shot querying, to explore the MH points. Further, to fully exploit MH points in the learning process, we design a neighbor focal loss that assigns the weighted neighbor purity to the cross entropy loss of MH points to make the model focus more on them. Extensive experiments verify that MHPL remarkably exceeds the various types of baselines and achieves significant performance gains at a small cost of labeling.
