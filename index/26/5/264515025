Lenticular lenses are widely known as optical elements that change color depending on the viewing angle. By realizing this phenomenon in edible materials, it is possible to create a new gastronomic experience that significantly changes the appearance of food. In this study, we propose a system that supports the workflow from the design to the fabrication of edible lenticular lenses. The proposed system consists of lenticular lens design software and fabrication hardware. Users can design a visual effect of lenticular lenses by software simulation and fabricate the lenses by the knife cutting method using the hardware of the proposed system. In this study, the fabricated lenses were compared with the rendered ones. Furthermore, we confirm that the fabrication of the lenses is highly accurate and requires a short time.
