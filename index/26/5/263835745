Emerging partial-assistance exoskeletons can enhance able-bodied performance and aid people with patho-logical gait or age-related immobility. However, every person walks differently, which makes it difficult to directly compute assistance torques from joint kinematics. Gait-state estimation-based controllers use phase (normalized stride time) and task variables (e.g., stride length and ground inclination) to parameterize the joint torques. Using kinematic models that depend on the gait-state, prior work has used an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the gait-state online. However, this EKF suffered from kinematic errors since it used a subject-independent measurement model, and it is still unknown how personalization of this measurement model would reduce gait-state tracking error. This paper quantifies how much gait-state tracking improvement a personalized measurement model can have over a subject-independent measurement model when using an EKF-based gait-state estimator. Since the EKF performance depends on the measurement model covariance matrix, we tested on multiple different tuning parameters. Across reasonable values of tuning parameters that resulted in good performance, personalization improved estimation error on average by 8.5 ± 13.8% for phase (mean ± standard deviation), 27.2 $\pm \ 8.1{\%}$ for stride length, and 10.5 $\pm \ 13.5{\%}$ for ground inclination. These findings support the hypothesis that personalization of the measurement model significantly improves gait-state estimation performance in EKF based gait-state tracking $(P \ll 0.05)$, which could ultimately enable reliable responses to faster human gait changes.
