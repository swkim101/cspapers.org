In this demonstration, we showcase BrightMarker, a fabrication method that uses fluorescent filaments to embed easily trackable markers in 3D printed color objects. By employing an infrared-fluorescent filament that emits light at a wavelength higher than the incident light, our optical detection setup filters out all the noise to only have the markers present in the infrared camera image. The high contrast of the markers allows us to robustly track them when objects are in motion. We also demonstrate a software interface for automatically embedding these markers for the input object geometry, and a hardware module with a high-speed camera that can be attached to existing AR/VR headsets. We developed an image processing pipeline to robustly localize the markers real-time from the captured images. We illustrate applications for fabricating wearables for motion capture, tangible interfaces for AR/VR, and enabling rapid product tracking, as well as privacy-preserving night vision.
