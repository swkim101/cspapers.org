This paper investigates the use of through-skull sound conduction to authenticate smartglass users. We mount a surface transducer on the right mastoid process to play cue signals and capture skull-transformed audio responses through contact microphones on various skull locations. We use the resultant bio-acoustic information as classification features. In an initial single-session study (N=25), we achieved mean Equal Error Rates (EERs) of 5.68% and 7.95% with microphones on the brow and left mastoid process. Combining the two signals substantially improves performance (to 2.35% EER). A subsequent multi-session study (N=30) demonstrates EERs are maintained over three recalls and, additionally, shows robustness to donning variations and background noise (achieving 2.72% EER). In a follow-up usability study over one week, participants report high levels of usability (as expressed by SUS scores) and that only modest workload is required to authenticate. Finally, a security analysis demonstrates the systemâ€™s robustness to spoofing and imitation attacks.
