Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with hardware advances enabling rapid advancement in the capabilities of quantum machines. Recently, quantum image generation has been explored with many potential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques have suffered from poor quality and robustness. To address these problems, we introduce MosaiQ a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that can be executed on todayâ€™s Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers.
