Research on emergent communication has recently gained significant traction as a promising avenue for the linguistic community to unravel human language's origins and explore artificial intelligence's generalization capabilities. Current research has predominantly concentrated on recognizing qualitative patterns of object attributes(e.g., shape and color) and paid little attention to the quantitative relationship among object quantities which is known as the part of numerical concepts. The ability to generalize numerical concepts, i.e., counting and calculations with unseen quantities, is essential, as it mirrors humans' foundational abstract reasoning abilities. In this work, we introduce the NumGame, leveraging the referential game framework, forcing agents to communicate and generalize the numerical concepts effectively. Inspired by the human learning process of numbers, we present a two-stage training approach that sequentially fosters a rudimentary numerical sense followed by the ability of arithmetic calculation, ultimately aiding agents in generating semantically stable and unambiguous language for numerical concepts. The experimental results indicate the impressive generalization capabilities to unseen quantities and regularity of the language emergence from communication.
