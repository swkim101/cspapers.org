Climbing robots can investigate scientifically valuable sites that conventional rovers cannot access due to steep terrain features. Robots equipped with microspine grippers are particularly well-suited to ascending rocky cliff faces, but most existing designs are either large and slow or limited to relatively flat surfaces such as walls. We present a novel free-climbing robot to bridge this gap through innovations in gripper design and force control. Fully passive grippers and wrist joints allow secure grasping while reducing mass and complexity. Forces are distributed among the robotâ€™s grippers using an optimization-based control strategy to minimize the risk of unexpected detachment. The robot prototype has demonstrated vertical climbing on both flat cinder block walls and uneven rock surfaces in full Earth gravity.
