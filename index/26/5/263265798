In this paper, we concentrate on modeling and simulation aspects of the Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN). In detail, we present the solution in the form of an xApp considering the Quality-of-Service (QoS) Based Resource Optimization Use Case (QBRO-UC) within the O-RAN system. The xApp has been developed for the Î¼ONOS RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) contained in the SD-RAN software platform designed by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF). The paper focuses on the mechanisms of Radio Resource Management (RRM) controlled by O-RAN-compliant policies. The paper highlights the capabilities of the proposed Physical Resource Block (PRB) allocation and discusses the limitations of the whole modeling framework.
