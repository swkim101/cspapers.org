This work investigates efficient score-based black-box adversarial attacks with high Attack Success Rate (ASR) and good generalizability. We design a novel attack method based on a Disentangled Feature space, called DifAttack, which differs significantly from the existing ones operating over the entire feature space. Specifically, DifAttack firstly disentangles an image's latent feature into an adversarial feature and a visual feature, where the former dominates the adversarial capability of an image, while the latter largely determines its visual appearance. We train an autoencoder for the disentanglement by using pairs of clean images and their Adversarial Examples (AEs) generated from available surrogate models via white-box attack methods. Eventually, DifAttack iteratively optimizes the adversarial feature according to the query feedback from the victim model until a successful AE is generated, while keeping the visual feature unaltered. In addition, due to the avoidance of using surrogate models' gradient information when optimizing AEs for black-box models, our proposed DifAttack inherently possesses better attack capability in the open-set scenario, where the training dataset of the victim model is unknown. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in ASR and query efficiency simultaneously, especially in the targeted attack and open-set scenarios.
