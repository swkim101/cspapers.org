This paper proposes an adaptive modulation and coding for our previously proposed semi-blind interference suppression on an uplink multiuser massive MIMO system. In a multi-cell environment, inter-cell interference increases as the cell edge is approached. In a multiuser MIMO, orthogonal pilots provide efficient channel estimation. However, orthogonal pilots must be reused in each cell due to the upper bound on the number of orthogonal sequences. This causes a pilot contamination. To suppress inter-user and inter-cell interferences in this environment, we previously proposed a semi-blind interference suppression scheme. However, this approach has a problem of degraded interference suppression performance in certain user terminals when using higher order modulation schemes more than 16QAM. Therefore, we propose to introduce adaptive modulation and coding scheme according to partitioned cell region. In the proposed method, forward error correction is performed at the transmitter (user terminal), and the receiver performs decoding and re-encoding of the transmitted symbol. Additionally, the combination of modulation scheme and coding rate is optimized based on the transmission distance from the base station. This approach can increase interference suppression performance compared to the conventional method.
