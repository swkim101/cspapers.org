In this paper, we present an approach for coverage path planning for a team of an energy-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). Both the UAV and the UGV have predefined areas that they have to cover. The goal is to perform complete coverage by both robots while minimizing the coverage time. The UGV can also serve as a mobile recharging station. The UAV and UGV need to occasionally rendezvous for recharging. We propose a heuristic method to address this NP-Hard planning problem. Our approach involves initially determining coverage paths without factoring in energy constraints. Subsequently, we cluster segments of these paths and employ graph matching to assign UAV clusters to UGV clusters for efficient recharging management. We perform numerical analysis on real-world coverage applications and show that compared with a greedy approach our method reduces rendezvous overhead on average by 11.33%. We demonstrate proof-of-concept with a team of a VOXL m500 drone and a Clearpath Jackal ground vehicle, providing a complete system from the offline algorithm to the field execution.
