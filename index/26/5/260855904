Recently, techniques utilizing frequency-based methods have gained significant attention, as they exhibit exceptional restoration capabilities for detail and structure in video super-resolution tasks. However, most of these frequency-based methods mainly have three major limitations: 1) insufficient exploration of object motion information, 2) inadequate enhancement for high-fidelity regions, and 3) loss of spatial information during convolution. In this paper, we propose a novel network, Directional Frequency Video Super-Resolution (DFVSR), to address these limitations. Specifically, we reconsider object motion from a new perspective and propose Directional Frequency Representation (DFR), which not only borrows the property of frequency representation of detail and structure information but also contains the direction information of the object motion that is extremely significant in videos. Based on this representation, we propose a Directional Frequency-Enhanced Alignment (DFEA) to use double enhancements of task-related information for ensuring the retention of high-fidelity frequency regions to generate the high-quality alignment feature. Furthermore, we design a novel Asymmetrical U-shaped network architecture to progressively fuse these alignment features and output the final output. This architecture enables the intercommunication of the same level of resolution in the encoder and decoder to achieve the supplement of spatial information. Powered by the above designs, our method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art models on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
