The 2004 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, held in Paris in the week of June 13-18, is the first SIGMOD ever held outside of North America, and it has chosen a place that is rich in tradition but also rich in new departures, one of the focal points of the age of enlightenment and the place of the French revolution in 1789. We hope that this is a symbol of SIGMOD embracing new challenges in the broader area of business and scientific information management and the wider spectrum of network-enabled data-rich applications.The SIGMOD conference is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and its Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD). Two days of the conference overlap with the Symposium on Principles of Database System (PODS), and several workshops and other events are co-located with SIGMOD.
