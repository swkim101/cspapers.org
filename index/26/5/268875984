The expansion of urban centers necessitates enhanced efficiency and sustainability in their transportation infrastructure and mobility systems. The big data obtainable from various transportation modes potentially offers critical insights for urban planning. This study presents analysis of detailed historical public transit data, enriched with relevant temporal and geospatial metadata, as a precursor to injecting dynamism into digital twins of mobility systems via ML/DL-based predictive modeling. A data preprocessing framework was implemented to refine the raw data for effective historical analysis and predictive modeling. This paper examines public transit data for patterns and trendsâ€”incorporating factors such as time, geospatial elements, external influences, and operational aspects. From a technical standpoint, this research helps to assess the quality of the available transit data and identify important information for use in digital twins. Such digital twins foster educated decisions for efficient, sustainable urban mobility systems by anticipating infrastructure demand, identifying service gaps, and understanding mobility dynamics.
