Recent developments in AI have made it possible to design new proteins that are crucial to meeting humanityâ€™s needs. However, tools for exploring the 3D structures of proteins in the early stages of AI-based protein design are lacking, leading to many preventable trials and errors and much wasted time and efforts in the design process. To address this, we propose a novel VR interaction system that enables synthetic biologists to intuitively author the 3D structures of proteins with their bare hands.
