Fast parallel algorithms for various problems in algebraic computation are presented. Two of the algorithms convert the coefficient representation of a rational function into a base representation, and vice versa. Combining them yields an algorithm which converts the representation of a rational function in one base of polynomials into that in another base. The existence question for representations is then discussed. Applications of the general conversion algorithms fast parallel methods to Taylor expansion, partial fraction decomposition, Chinese remainder algorithm, elementary symmetric functions, Pade approximation and various interpolation problems are given. 5 references.
