The Service Function Chain (SFC) has become a popular paradigm to complete mobile services due to the advancements in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This new computing and networking paradigm allows Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to be placed in physical devices within MEC-NFV networks cost-effectively and flexibly. However, most existing VNF placement algorithms are complex, unscalable, and time-consuming. In this paper, we investigate the VNF placement problem in MEC-NFV networks and formulate an optimization model to optimize network resource utilization. We introduce a novel Deep Learning-based VNF Placement Approach (DLVPA) that intelligently selects nodes and places VNFs for SFC requests. Performance evaluations demonstrate that DLVPA can effectively improve network resource utilization.
