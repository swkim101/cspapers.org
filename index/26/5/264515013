In this paper, we propose a new robotic display equipped with a transparent display, whose position and posture can be controlled, and a design space that uses it. Robotic displays have been researched in which the display is mounted on a movable robotic arm to extend the expression through motion expression in addition to visual expression. In this paper, we propose combining a transparent display with a robotic display to extend the design space of the robotic display through the characteristics of transparent display. We implement a prototype and propose a design space for a single display and multiple cooperating displays.
