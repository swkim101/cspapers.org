In multiplayer gaming, skill disparity can lead to frustrating and excluding experiences. Balancing approaches exist to level the playing field (e.g., providing aim assistance to low-performing players), but it is unclear how different design choices affect individual player experience. We first introduce a design space for balancing mechanics encompassing six categories: Determination, Timing, Targeting, Effect, Feedback, and Information. We then present a mixed-methods study, focused on the effect of two subcategories: Targeting Direction and Effect Dependency on skill. In this study, eight pairs of participants played a game prototype and experienced seven balancing mechanics. We collected data from questionnaires and group interviews, revealing implications for future designs, including the importance of 1) merited victory that does not ignore individual achievements, 2) sense of agency when determining the balancing before and during gameplay, and 3) balancing as an intrinsic part of the game that does not disrupt the core gameplay.
