Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) offer long-range communication with low energy consumption, making them ideal for IoT applications powered by energy harvesting. However, unpredictable energy harvesting rates can lead to sub-optimal device operation. To tackle this, the intermittent computing paradigm has been proposed. In this paper, we explore the combination of intermittent computing and LPWANs by proposing four different communication solutions based on LoRa and designed to match common application scenarios and requirements. For the solutions, we also present experimental energy estimation models, which we evaluate against measurements.
