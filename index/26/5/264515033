Advances in artificial intelligence have transformed the paradigm of human-computer interaction, with the development of conversational AI systems playing a pivotal role. These systems employ technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning to simulate intelligent and human-like conversations. Driven by the personal experience of an individual with a neuromuscular disease who faces challenges with leaving home and contends with limited hand-motor control when operating digital systems, including conversational AI platforms, we propose a method aimed at enriching their interaction with conversational AI. Our prototype allows the creation of multiple agent personas based on hobbies and interests, to support topic-based conversations. In contrast with existing systems, such as Replika, that offer a 1:1 relation with a virtual agent, our design enables one-to-many relationships, easing the process of interaction for this individual by reducing the need for constant data input. We can imagine our prototype potentially helping others who are in a similar situation with reduced typing/input ability.
