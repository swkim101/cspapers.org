Nowadays, novice users often turn to digital tutorials for guidance in software. However, searching and utilizing the tutorial remains a challenge due to the request for proper problem articulation, extensive searches and mind-intensive follow-through. We introduce "Docent", a system designed to bridge this knowledge-seeking gap. Powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), Docent takes vague user input and recent digital operation contexts to reason, seek, and present the most relevant tutorials in-situ. We assume that Docent smooths the user experience and facilitates learning of the software.
