A joint task force of the ACM, IEEE-Computer Society, and AAAI has updated the computer science curricular guidelines last published in 2013. Included in the updated guidelines, referred to as CS2023, is a revised knowledge model and a new framework for building a customized competency model of the computer science curriculum. Acknowledging that one size does not fit all, the guidelines provide flexibility for computer science programs to structure their curriculum around the competency area(s) they wish to target. Given the pervasiveness of computing in everyday life, the guidelines emphasize the importance of society, ethics, and issues of the computing profession throughout the curriculum. The role of mathematics has been expanded in the guidelines, particularly in response to the latest developments in artificial intelligence. The curricular guidelines will be accompanied by articles written by experts on curricular issues such as ethics, computing for the social good, and accessibility. In the special session, the CS2023 curricular guidelines will be presented, and feedback solicited on facilitating their adoption and adaptation. The session is aimed at computer science educators, administrators, and professionals interested in computer science education.
