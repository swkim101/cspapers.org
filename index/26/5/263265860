Ultrasound computer tomography (USCT) represents a medical imaging modality designed to visualize alterations in the speed of ultrasonic waves. The primary objective of the study presented was to devise a lightweight, portable, and cost-effective tomographic device capable of non-invasively capturing internal images of the human brain in real-time. To achieve this aim, a prototype ultrasonic tomograph was developed, comprising a lightweight head hoop integrated with ultrasonic transducers and a tomograph unit. Ultrasonic measurements were transformed into images using a heterogeneous convolutional neural network (CNN). The USCT system was engineered to facilitate wireless communication between the sensors embedded within the wearable head cap and the tomographic apparatus.
