We present FlavourFrame, a canvas-based app that helps tasters capture and visualize their perceptions during mindful tasting experiences. Taste perceptions are difficult to document because they are subjective, multisensory, and ephemeral; and everyday people have limited dedicated vocabulary to describe such experiences. Our customizable tool is designed to help novice and experienced tasters structure and record tasting experiences. FlavourFrame superimposes visual and text layers to personalize visual and word-based expression of flavor experience. Through autoethnographic reflections, we generated sample data and identified strengths and limitations of the prototype.
