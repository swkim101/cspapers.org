Recent advancements in deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices have generated interest in input-adaptive dynamic neural networks (DyNNs). DyNNs offer more efficient inferences and enable the deployment of DNNs on devices with limited resources, such as mobile devices. However, we have discovered a new vulnerability in DyNNs that could potentially compromise their efficiency. Specifically, we investigate whether adversaries can manipulate DyNNs' computational costs to create a false sense of efficiency. To address this question, we propose EfficFrog, an adversarial attack that injects universal efficiency backdoors in DyNNs. To inject a backdoor trigger into DyNNs, EfficFrog poisons only a minimal percentage of the DyNNs' training data. During the inference phase, EfficFrog can slow down the backdoored DyNNs and abuse the computational resources of systems running DyNNs by adding the trigger to any input. To evaluate EfficFrog, we tested it on three DNN backbone architectures (based on VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet56) using two popular datasets (CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet). Our results demonstrate that EfficFrog reduces the efficiency of DyNNs on triggered input samples while keeping the efficiency of clean samples almost the same.
