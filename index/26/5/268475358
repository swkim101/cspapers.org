Because of the high pay and high flexibility, computer science careers can be highly viable for people with blindness or vision impairments (BVI). However, in our programming education, we observed that existing screen readers used by students with BVI usually cannot properly handle computer programs, which mix English letters, digits, and punctuation marks. When applied to computer programs, current screen readers either ignore the punctuation marks, or mix English words, digits, and punctuation marks, making the screen reading either incorrect or hard to understand. The resulting difficulty in understanding program statements significantly hinders students' ability to locate incorrect code and independent coding. To address these limitations in current screen reading, we are developing a new semantic-oriented screen reader, called JupterVox, which reads Python statements by their meanings to speedup code navigation, and thus improve independent coding skills. This new screen reader is based on compiler's lexical and syntax analyses to parse, understand, and read program statements. This poster presents the initial implementation and results of JupterVox.
