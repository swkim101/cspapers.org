 One of the ways that additive manufacturing technology continues to improve is the addition of a fourth or fifth degree-of-freedom. Adding rotational axes to the printer head or to the print bed can lead to improvement in the time, cost of printing as well as the quality of the print. We have witnessed similar improvements in subtractive CNC machining as well. The added axes require new computational methods to automatically define toolpaths. In additive, slicer software creates planar cross-sections through the part and automatically defines these toolpaths. With added rotational axes, toolpaths on nonplanar surfaces will be required to fully utilize the advantages of multi-axis printing. This paper reviews current work in nonplanar toolpaths and introduces three new concepts that advance the field. These three concepts are presented in three separate sections â€” each with their own related work and results. Firstly, we present methods for projecting or unwrapping a nonplanar surface to 2D polygons so that paths can be defined by conventional means. Then, the paths are projected or wrapped back onto the 3D surfaces. Next, two approaches are presented for creating perimeter paths and infill paths that do not transform the slices to 2D planes. These iterative methods simulate the toolpath as particles reacting to virtual forces that guide them to ideal positions. The third builds on an algorithm for creating biologically inspired undulating paths or membranes called differential line growth. These methods can be useful in defining paths for surfaces with high curvature since converting to 2D and back would likely produce too much distortion and paths would not maintain near-equal geodesic distances.
