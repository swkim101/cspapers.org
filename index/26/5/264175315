Content creation and consumption play vital roles in our lives. However, creating high-quality content can be challenging for beginners, while navigating through and consuming vast amounts of media content can be overwhelming and cumbersome. My Ph.D. research focuses on democratizing content creation and improving content consumption experiences for everyday users. I achieve this by designing and evaluating interactive AI systems that serve as copilots, assisting users with tedious tasks. I explore various media modalities, such as video, audio, text, and images, and investigate how their interplay can address problems in individual modalities. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of my research agenda, including recent contributions, on-going progress, and future directions.
