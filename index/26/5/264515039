With recent advances in Generative AI, it is becoming easier to automatically manipulate 3D models. However, current methods tend to apply edits to models globally, which risks compromising the intended functionality of the 3D model when fabricated in the physical world. For example, modifying functional segments in 3D models, such as the base of a vase, could break the original functionality of the model, thus causing the vase to fall over. We introduce Style2Fab, a system for automatically segmenting 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements, and selectively modifying the aesthetic segments, without affecting the functional segments. Style2Fab uses a semi-automatic classification method to decompose 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements, and differentiable rendering to selectively stylize the functional segments. We demonstrate the functionality of this tool with six application examples across domains of Home Interior Design, Medical Applications, and Personal Accessories.
