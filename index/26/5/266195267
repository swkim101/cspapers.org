Maintaining balance during gait in the mediolateral direction requires more active motor control than in the anteroposterior direction. Step width modulation is a key strategy used by healthy individuals to achieve mediolateral walking balance, but it can be disrupted in populations with poor sensorimotor integration and weak hip abductors, such as the elderly, stroke patients, and people with lower limb amputation. Wearable hip exoskeletons have the potential to serve as assistive or rehabilitation devices for these populations, but there has been limited research on their appropriate usage. In this study, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of controlling step width using a mediolaterally acting robotic hip exoskeleton. We were able to effectively adjust the user's step width by increasing or decreasing it to predefined targets through the regulation of admittance control parameters governing the device. The maximum average error to increase or decrease the step width was 1.2 cm. This research has the potential to facilitate the development of assistive and rehabilitation applications focused on enhancing the mediolateral gait balance of individuals with neurological impairments, elderly individuals, and amputees via the control of step width.
