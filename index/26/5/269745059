Mental health disorders are prevalent worldwide, yet they remain stigmatized, especially in the Middle East. While mHealth has the potential to circumvent traditional barriers, research on its application remains scarce in Arab countries. To address this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study of mental health apps availability, adoption, and perceptions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) where digital health transformation is rapidly progressing. We interviewed twelve psychiatrists and psychologists to elicit their views on local barriers and opportunities for digital mental health support. We further systematically reviewed the Saudi app market, analysing 110 Arabic mental health apps. Our findings indicate that whilst fear of stigma and cultural factors hindered help-seeking, the privacy and anonymity enabled by technology created new opportunities for accessing mental support in the KSA. We revealed tensions between expertsâ€™ professional and practical perspectives, explored technology-exacerbated challenges and provided considerations for improving Saudi digital mental healthcare experience.
