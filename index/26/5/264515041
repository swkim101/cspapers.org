As a stylized representation of traditional painting art, ink painting has been widely used in most of Asian countries. Art creations with ink painting strokes in 3D space have shown potential in animation and games. We propose a sketch-based authoring tool for drawing ink painting style strokes in 3D space. With automatic strip-based modeling and procedural texture generation, users can easily create ink painting style artworks by drawing sketches. Our system generates ink effects in real time and provides a simple non-linear workflow. User evaluations show that novice users can easily use the system and quickly create 3D ink paintings.
