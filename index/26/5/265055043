Highly configurable systems enable customers to flexibly configure the systems in diverse deployment environments. The flexibility of configurations also poses challenges for performance testing. On one hand, there exist a massive number of possible configurations; while on the other hand, the time and resources are limited for performance testing, which is already a costly process during software development. Modeling the performance of configurations is one of the solutions to reduce the cost of configuration performance testing. Although prior research proposes various modeling and sampling techniques to build configuration performance models, the sampling approaches used in the model typically do not consider the accuracy of the performance models, leading to potential sub-optimal performance modeling results in practice. In this paper, we present a modeling-driven sampling approach (CoMSA) to improve the performance modeling of highly configurable systems. The intuition of CoMSA is to select samples based on their uncertainties to the performance models. In other words, the configurations that have the more uncertain performance prediction results by the performance models are more likely to be selected as further training samples to improve the model. CoMSA is designed by considering both scenarios where 1) the software projects do not have historical performance testing results (cold start) and 2) there exist historical performance testing results (warm start). We evaluate the performance of our approach in four subjects, namely LRZIP, LLVM, x264, and SQLite. Through the evaluation result, we can conclude that our sampling approaches could highly enhance the accuracy of the prediction models and the efficiency of configuration performance testing compared to other baseline sampling approaches.
