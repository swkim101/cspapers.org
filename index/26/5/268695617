Automatic recognition of bird behavior from long-term, un controlled outdoor imagery can contribute to conservation efforts by enabling large-scale monitoring of bird populations. Current techniques in AI-based wildlife monitoring have focused on short-term tracking and monitoring birds individually rather than in species-rich flocks. We present Bird-Collect, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for monitoring dense bird flock attributes. It includes a unique collection of more than 6,000 high-resolution images of Demoiselle Cranes (Anthropoides virgo) feeding and nesting in the vicinity of Khichan region of Rajasthan. Particularly, each image contains an average of 190 individual birds, illustrating the complex dynamics of densely populated bird flocks on a scale that has not previously been studied. In addition, a total of 433 distinct pictures captured at Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur provide a comprehensive representation of 34 distinct bird species belonging to various taxonomic groups. These images offer details into the diversity and the behaviour of birds in vital natural ecosystem along the migratory flyways. Additionally, we provide a set of 2,500 point-annotated samples which serve as ground truth for benchmarking various computer vision tasks like crowd counting, density estimation, segmentation, and species classification. The benchmark performance for these tasks highlight the need for tailored approaches for specific wildlife applications, which include varied conditions including views, illumination, and resolutions. With around 46.2 GBs in size encompassing data collected from two distinct nesting ground sets, it is the largest birds dataset containing detailed annotations, showcasing a substantial leap in bird research possibilities. We intend to publicly release the dataset to the research community. The database is available at: https://iab-rubric.org/resources/wildlife-dataset/birdcollect
