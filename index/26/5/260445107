Collective Inference (CI) is a procedure designed to boost weak relational classiﬁers, specially for node classiﬁcation tasks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are strong classiﬁers that have been used with great success. Unfortunately, most existing practical GNNs are not most-expressive (universal). Thus, it is an open question whether one can improve strong relational node classiﬁers, such as GNNs, with CI. In this work, we investigate this question and propose collective learning for GNNs —a general collective classiﬁcation approach for node representation learning that increases their representation power. We show that previous attempts to incorporate CI into GNNs fail to boost their expressiveness because they do not adapt CI’s Monte Carlo sampling to representation learning. We evaluate our proposed framework with a variety of state-of-the-art GNNs. Our experiments show a consistent, signiﬁcant boost in node classiﬁcation accuracy —regardless of the choice of underlying GNN— for inductive node classiﬁcation in partially-labeled graphs, across ﬁve real-world network datasets.
