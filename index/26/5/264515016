Constraints are fundamental to human-centered design. Although by definition, constraints “limit” or “restrict” the capability of software, when designed correctly, they can have enabling characteristics as well. In my dissertation, I seek to understand how user interface constraints can influence user behaviour when reading and writing text. First, I discuss a document reader with auto-scrolling to facilitate time-bounded reading for increased focus. Second, I contribute the idea of limiting how much text can be highlighted in a document to encourage readers to think more about what is truly important in the document. Lastly, I discuss how constraining an AI writing assistant through prompts with varying levels of detail may improve a writer’s feelings of ownership. Through these three projects, my dissertation will contribute novel constraints-based interaction techniques that can be integrated into new or existing systems, which is of interest to the UIST community and the HCI community more broadly.
