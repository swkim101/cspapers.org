The introduction of neural radiance fields has greatly improved the effectiveness of view synthesis for monocular videos. However, existing algorithms face difficulties when dealing with uncontrolled or lengthy scenarios, and require extensive training time specific to each new scenario. To tackle these limitations, we propose DynPoint, an algorithm designed to facilitate the rapid synthesis of novel views for unconstrained monocular videos. Rather than encoding the entirety of the scenario information into a latent representation, DynPoint concentrates on predicting the explicit 3D correspondence between neighboring frames to realize information aggregation. Specifically, this correspondence prediction is achieved through the estimation of consistent depth and scene flow information across frames. Subsequently, the acquired correspondence is utilized to aggregate information from multiple reference frames to a target frame, by constructing hierarchical neural point clouds. The resulting framework enables swift and accurate view synthesis for desired views of target frames. The experimental results obtained demonstrate the considerable acceleration of training time achieved - typically an order of magnitude - by our proposed method while yielding comparable outcomes compared to prior approaches. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong robustness in handling long-duration videos without learning a canonical representation of video content.
