Visual interpretation is extremely important in human geography as the primary technique for geographers to use photograph data in identifying, classifying, and quantifying geographic and topological objects or regions. However, it is also time-consuming and requires overwhelming manual effort from professional geographers. This paper describes our interdisciplinary team's efforts in integrating computer vision models with geographers' visual image interpretation process to reduce their workload in interpreting images. Focusing on the dune segmentation task, we proposed an approach featuring a deep dune segmentation model to identify dunes and label their ranges in an automated way. By developing a tool to connect our model with ArcGIS, one of the most popular workbenches for visual interpretation, geographers can further refine the automatically-generated dune segmentation on images without learning any CV or deep learning techniques. Our approach thus realized a non-invasive change to geographers' visual interpretation routines, reducing their manual efforts while incurring minimal interruptions to their work routines and tools they are familiar with. Deployment with a leading Chinese geography research institution demonstrated the potential of our approach in supporting geographers in researching and solving drylands desertification.
