In this paper, we propose a novel swashplateless-elevon actuation (SEA) for dual-rotor tail-sitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In contrast to the conventional elevon actuation (CEA) which controls both pitch and yaw using elevons, the SEA adopts swash-plateless mechanisms to generate an extra moment through motor speed modulation to control pitch and uses elevons solely for controlling yaw, without requiring additional actuators. This decoupled control strategy mitigates the saturation of elevons' deflection needed for large pitch and yaw control actions, thus improving the UAV's control performance on trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection performance in the presence of large external disturbances. Furthermore, the SEA overcomes the actuation degradation issues experienced by the CEA when the UAV is in close proximity to the ground, leading to a smoother and more stable take-off process. We validate and compare the performances of the SEA and the CEA in various real-world flight conditions, including take-off, trajectory tracking, and hover flight and position steps under external disturbance. Experimental results demonstrate that the SEA has better performances than the CEA. Moreover, we verify the SEA's feasibility in the attitude transition process and fixed-wing-mode flight of the VTOL UAV. The results indicate that the SEA can accurately control pitch in the presence of high-speed incoming airflow and maintain a stable attitude during fixed-wing mode flight.
