In this paper, we present CaveSeg - the first visual learning pipeline for semantic segmentation and scene parsing for AUV navigation inside underwater caves. We address the problem of scarce annotated training data by preparing a comprehensive dataset for semantic segmentation of underwater cave scenes. It contains pixel annotations for important navigation markers (e.g. caveline, arrows), obstacles (e.g. ground plain and overhead layers), scuba divers, and open areas for servoing. Through comprehensive benchmark analyses on cave systems in USA, Mexico, and Spain locations, we demonstrate that robust deep visual models can be developed based on CaveSeg for fast semantic scene parsing of underwater cave environments. In particular, we formulate a novel transformer-based model that is computationally light and offers near real-time execution in addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we explore the design choices and implications of semantic segmentation for visual servoing by AUVs inside underwater caves. The proposed model and benchmark dataset open up promising opportunities for future research in autonomous underwater cave exploration and mapping.
