The lengthy monologue-style online lectures cause learners to lose engagement easily. Designing lectures in a “vicarious dialogue” format can foster learners’ cognitive activities more than monologue-style. However, designing online lectures in a dialogue style catered to the diverse needs of learners is laborious for instructors. We conducted a design workshop with eight educational experts and seven instructors to present key guidelines and the potential use of large language models (LLM) to transform a monologue lecture script into pedagogically meaningful dialogue. Applying these design guidelines, we created VIVID which allows instructors to collaborate with LLMs to design, evaluate, and modify pedagogical dialogues. In a within-subjects study with instructors (N=12), we show that VIVID helped instructors select and revise dialogues efficiently, thereby supporting the authoring of quality dialogues. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to assist instructors with creating high-quality educational dialogues across various learning stages.
