Private browsing is a common feature of web browsers on desktop platforms. This feature protects the privacy of users browsing the Internet and, therefore, is widely welcomed by users. In recent years, with the popularity of smartphones, the private browsing mode has been introduced into mobile browsers. However, its deployment on mobile platforms has not been well evaluated. To bridge the gap, in this work, we systemically studied the private browsing modes of Android browser apps. Specifically, we proposed six private rules for mobile browsers to follow by combining the mobile browsing features with the previous research on private browsing. Furthermore, we designed an automated analysis framework, BroDroid, to detect whether mobile browsers violate these rules. Also, with BroDroid, we evaluated 49 popular browser apps crawled from Google Play. Finally, BroDroid successfully identified 58 violations, some of which come from the promised capabilities of the browser. We reported our discovered issues to the corresponding developers, and four of them (Yandex Browser, Mint Browser, Web Explorer, and Net Fast Web Browser) have acknowledged our findings. Our observation may be the tip of the iceberg, and more efforts should be put into improving the privacy protections of mobile browsers.
