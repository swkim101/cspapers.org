The emergence and wide-spread use of social networks and microblogging sites has led to a dramatic increase on the availability of users’ activity data. Importantly, this data can be exploited to solve some of the problems that have captured the attention of economists and marketers for decades as, e.g., product adoption, product competition and product life cycle. In this paper, we leverage on users’ activity data from a popular microblogging site to model and predict the competing dynamics of products and social conventions adoptions. To this aim, we propose a data-driven model, based on continuous-time Hawkes processes, for the adoption and frequency of use of competing products and conventions. We then develop an inference method to efficiently fit the model parameters by solving a convex program. The problem decouples into a collection of smaller subproblems, thus scaling easily to networks with hundred of thousands of nodes. We validate our method over synthetic and real diffusion data gathered from Twitter, and show that the proposed model does not only present a good predictive power but also provides interpretable model parameters, which allow us to gain insights into the fundamental principles that drive product and convention adoptions.
