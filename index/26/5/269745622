Running and jogging are popular activities for many visually impaired individuals thanks to the relatively low entry barriers. Research in HCI and beyond has focused primarily on leveraging technology to enable visually impaired people to run independently. However, depending on their residual vision and personal preferences, many chose to run with a sighted guide. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the partnership between visually impaired runners and sighted guides. Using a combination of interaction and thematic analysis on video and interview data from 6 pairs of runners and guides, we unpack the complexity and directionality of three layers of vocal communication (directive, contextual, and recreational) and distinguish between intentional and unintentional corporeal communication. Building on the understanding of the importance of synchrony we also present some exploratory data looking at physiological synchrony between 2 pairs of runners with different level of experience and articulate recommendations for the HCI community.
