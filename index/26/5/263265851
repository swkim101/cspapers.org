The emergence of latency-critical use cases for cellular networks has necessitated the need for real-time (RT) network performance optimization. While solutions such as the O-RAN architecture provide primitives for non-RT and near-RT control, the notion of RT control is still missing. To that end, in this paper, we introduce TinyRIC, a first-of-its-kind RT control platform for O-RAN base stations. Key highlights include a comprehensive system architecture design, a systems-level implementation in support of flexible user scheduling, and a preliminary over-the-air experimental evaluation to demonstrate the system's performance and feasibility.
