Working out alone at the gym often lacks the quality and intensity of exercises compared to the training session with a personal trainer. To narrow this gap, we introduce TrainerTap, which simulates the personal trainer’s presence during solitary weightlifting workouts. TrainerTap replicates the trainer’s manual interventions of tapping the trainee’s body parts to capture their attention on target muscles and provides auditory guidance to support executing the movements at a consistent tempo.
