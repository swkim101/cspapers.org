In this work, we examine Asymmetric Shapley Values (ASV), a variant of the popular SHAP additive local explanation method. ASV proposes a way to improve model explanations incorporating known causal relations between variables, and is also considered as a way to test for unfair discrimination in model predictions. Unexplored in previous literature, relaxing symmetry in Shapley values can have counter-intuitive consequences for model explanation. To better understand the method, we first show how local contributions correspond to global contributions of variance reduction. Using variance, we demonstrate multiple cases where ASV yields counter-intuitive attributions, arguably producing incorrect results for root-cause analysis. Second, we identify generalized additive models (GAM) as a restricted class for which ASV exhibits desirable properties. We support our arguments by proving multiple theoretical results about the method. Finally, we demonstrate the use of asymmetric attributions on multiple real-world datasets, comparing the results with and without restricted model families using gradient boosting and deep learning models.
