 Transient topology optimization (TO) requires huge computational resources in terms of both computing time and storage. In this study, we have applied the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based on-the-fly dual reduction method on TO problems for time-dependent incompressible fluid channel optimization. The fluid motion was governed by time-dependent Navier-Stokes equation. Total energy dissipation over a given period was considered as the cost function, and total fluid volume was constrained during optimization process. POD based reduced order modeling (ROM) was applied to both the primal equations and the adjoint equations for reduction. We examined the reduction efficacy though examples including U-bend channel and nozzle. Tolerance and snapshot set size were studied as hyper-parameters to improve the reduction performance. The best cases can reach 99% of skip ratios, 50% reduction in computational time, and 96% saving of memory storage.
