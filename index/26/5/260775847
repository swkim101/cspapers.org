3D scene reconstruction is a long-standing vision task. Existing approaches can be categorized into geometry-based and learning-based methods. The former leverages multi-view geometry but may face catastrophic failures due to the reliance on accurate pixel correspondence across views, while the latter mitigates these issues by learning 2D or 3D representation directly. However, without a largescale video or 3D training data, it can hardly be generalized to diverse real-world scenarios due to the presence of tens of millions or even billions of optimization parameters in the deep network.Recently, robust monocular depth estimation models trained with large-scale datasets have been proven to possess weak 3D geometry prior, but they are insufficient for reconstruction due to the unknown camera parameters, the affine-invariant property, and inter-frame inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose a novel test-time optimization approach that can transfer the robustness of affine- invariant depth models such as LeReS to challenging diverse scenes while ensuring inter-frame consistency, with only dozens of parameters to optimize per video frame. Specifically, our approach involves freezing the pre-trained affine-invariant depth modelâ€™s depth predictions, rectifying them by optimizing the unknown scale-shift values with a geometric consistency alignment module, and employing the resulting scale-consistent depth maps to robustly obtain camera poses and achieve dense scene reconstruction, even in low-texture regions. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset reconstruction on five zero-shot testing datasets. Code is available at: https://aim-uofa.github.io/FrozenRecon/
