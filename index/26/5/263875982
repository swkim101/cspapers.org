This paper describes a customized database and a comprehensive set of queries that can be used for systematic benchmarking of relational database systems. Designing this database and a set of carefully tuned benchmarks represents a first attempt in developing a scientific methodology for performance evaluation of database management systems. We have used this database to perform a comparative evaluation of the database machine DIRECT, the "university" and "commercial" versions of the INGRES database system, the relational database system ORACLE, and the IDM 500 database machine. We present a subset of our measurements (for the single user case only), that constitute a preliminary performance evaluation of these systems.
