Root cause analysis for multi-dimensional time series from large scale micro-service scenarios aims at identifying the set of anomaly attributes by monitoring operational metrics. The online metrics provide a general indication to investigate these attributes' inter-dependencies and can guide the overall exploration process. However, the problem space for the root cause localization still remains largely challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible attribute combinations. This leads researchers and practitioners to (a) assume some prior distributions on the data set; (b) assume some data patterns on the attribute combinations; (c) perform pruning techniques to reduce the search space. Furthermore, state-of-the-art root cause analysis methods are often tied to one or more of these assumptions, which makes it difficult to be robust to general scenarios. In this paper, we conclude the heterogeneity in the data patterns by analyzing several open and industrial datasets. A uniform analytical framework, PatternRCA, is proposed such that it can be aware of the patterns in the metrics while avoiding explicit assumptions about them. We design an offline learning procedure that enables the framework to detect existing data patterns, which then can guide it to do fine-grain exploration in online metrics. Our extensive evaluation results show that PatternRCA outperforms state-of-the-art models with better benchmark results in public datasets. Meanwhile, it can scale to complex root cause analysis tasks on datasets with hybrid patterns in production environments.
