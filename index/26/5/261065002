Previous research has studied the task of segmenting cinematic videos into scenes and into narrative acts. However, these studies have overlooked the essential task of multimodal alignment and fusion for effectively and efficiently processing long-form videos (> 60min). In this paper, we introduce Multimodal alignmEnt aGgregation and distillAtion (MEGA) for cinematic long-video segmentation. MEGA tackles the challenge by leveraging multiple media modalities. The method coarsely aligns inputs of variable lengths and different modalities with alignment positional encoding. To maintain temporal synchronization while reducing computation, we further introduce an enhanced bottleneck fusion layer which uses temporal alignment. Additionally, MEGA employs a novel contrastive loss to synchronize and transfer labels across modalities, enabling act segmentation from labeled synopsis sentences on video shots. Our experimental results show that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MovieNet dataset for scene segmentation (with an Average Precision improvement of +1.19%) and on TRIPOD dataset for act segmentation (with a Total Agreement improvement of +5.51%).
