A miniaturized electrochemical sensor was developed for the remote detection of chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants. To facilitate drone-based remote sensing, this present study focuses on advancing the miniaturized and compact electrochemical sensor for monitoring two CWA simulants, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and O,S-diethylmethylphosphonothioate (O,S-DEMPT). The differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signal was processed, and the DPV signature features were extracted on the basis of the redox properties associated with the absence and the presence of DFP and O,S-DEMPT. Upon the addition of 0.10 equivalence of DFP or O,S-DEMPT, a shift in potential (E) of ~0.13 V was recorded. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 0.25 µM (0.046 ppm) and 0.10 µM (0.017 ppm) for DFP and O,S-DEMPT, respectively. These results were validated using a portable Palmsens Emstat HR potentiostat, which corroborated the results obtained using a lab benchtop potentiostat. Additionally, Boolean logic (“AND” operation) was implemented for future drone technology deployment. This advancement enables the fabrication of a networked device capable of autonomously executing tasks without constant oversight.
