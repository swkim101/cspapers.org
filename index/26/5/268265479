Cross-reality tasks, like creating or consuming virtual reality (VR) content, often involve inconvenient or distracting switches between desktop and VR. An initial formative study explores cross-reality switching habits, finding most switches are momentary “peeks” between interfaces, with specific habits determined by current context. The results inform a design space for context-aware “peeking” techniques that allow users to view or interact with desktop from VR, and vice versa, without fully switching. We implemented a set of peeking techniques and evaluated them in two levels of a cross-reality task: one requiring only viewing, and another requiring input and viewing. Peeking techniques made task completion faster, with increased input accuracy and reduced perceived workload.
