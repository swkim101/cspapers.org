HD map is a key enabling technology towards fully autonomous driving. We propose VI-Map, the first system that leverages roadside infrastructure to enhance real-time HD mapping for autonomous driving. The core concept of VI-Map is to exploit the unique cumulative observations made by roadside infrastructure to build and maintain an accurate and current HD map. This HD map is then fused with on-vehicle HD maps in real time, resulting in a more comprehensive and up-to-date HD map. By extracting concise bird-eye-view features from infrastructure observations and utilizing vectorized map representations, VI-Map incurs low compute and communication overhead. We conducted end-to-end evaluations of VI-Map on a real-world testbed and a simulator. Experiment results show that VI-Map can construct decentimeter-level (up to 0.3 m) HD maps and achieve real-time (up to a delay of 42 ms) map fusion between driving vehicles and roadside infrastructure. This represents a significant improvement of 2.8× and 3× in map accuracy and coverage compared to the state-of-the-art online HD mapping approaches.
