With the turn of new decade, wireless communications face a major challenge on connecting many more new users and devices, at the same time being energy efficient and minimizing its carbon footprint. However, the current approaches to address the growing number of users and spectrum demands, like Massive MIMO, demand exorbitant energy consumption. The reason is that traditionally Massive MIMO requires a digital beamforming architecture that needs a separate RF chain per antenna, so the power consumption scales with number of antennas. Instead, GreenMO creates a new Massive MIMO architecture with just a single physically laid RF chain, shared by all the antennas and introduces for the first time, the concept of virtualizing the RF chain hardware. That is, GreenMO creates an optimal number of virtual RF chains to serve a given number of spatial streams, depending on channel conditions and network load. Due to efficient, softwarized control over the number of virtual RF chains, GreenMO paves the way for green and flexible massive MIMO. We prototype GreenMO on a PCB with eight antennas and evaluate it with a WARPv3 SDR platform in an office environment. The results demonstrate that GreenMO is 3× more power-efficient than traditional Massive MIMO and 4× more spectrum-efficient than traditional OFDMA systems, while multiplexing 4 spatial streams, and can save upto 50% power in modern 5G NR base stations.
