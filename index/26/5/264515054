We propose a computational design system for packaging boxes, which enables reconstruction of cardboard into packaging structures that precisely fit the size of the objects to be shipped. Given a 3D model of the object and the structure of the cardboard to be reused, our system suggests the optimal net of a new box, which only requires minimum cuts and folds for fabrication by leveraging the edges of the input cardboard. To achieve this, we implemented a GUI visualizing the input models and the optimal net computed by our optimization algorithm. As a demonstration, we showed three design examples, with evaluation results of our method for reducing the length of cuts and folds.
