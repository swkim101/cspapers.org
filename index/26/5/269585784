The concept of the animal Internet has flourished, with many conceptualisations proceeding from the premise that connecting animals online may enrich their social life. Yet we remain unaware of how – or even whether – online interactions (either live or with pre-recorded material) might affect how animals engage with other animals. We implemented a system for parrots to trigger live video calls with other birds or playback from a pre-recorded video call. The goal was to identify differences in engagement and behaviours. Over a six-month study, parrots triggered significantly more live calls and engaged longer in that setting relative to the playback condition, while the animals’ caregivers found greater value in the latter but preferred the live alternative for the birds under their care. The results begin to question what animals make of online remote connections, putting forward considerations as to how the internet can affect animals’ experiences.
