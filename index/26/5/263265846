High quality video can provide viewers with better visual and immersive experience in video streaming systems. However, traditional such systems with adaptive bitrate algorithms can only provide low-resolution videos when the network conditions deteriorate. To break the strong dependency of video transmission on network, we design and demonstrate iSAW, a super-resolution-assisted intelligent adaptive WebRTC video streaming system, by using two mobile devices and a policy server. iSAW performs a lightweight and scalable super-resolution (SR) model on the mobile devices to enhance the quality of received videos, and leverages an learning-based adaptive algorithm on the policy server to jointly adjust the transmitted video resolution and SR reconstructed video resolution according to dynamic network conditions and client computing power. The enhanced real-time video is smooth and the performance is improved obviously.
