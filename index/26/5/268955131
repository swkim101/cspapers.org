The switch buffers in datacenters today are dynamically shared by traffic classes with different loss tolerance and reaction to congestion signals. In particular, while legacy applications use loss-tolerant transport, e.g., DCTCP, newer applications require lossless datacenter transport, e.g., RDMA over Converged Ethernet. Unfortunately, as we analytically show in this paper, the buffer-sharing practices of todayâ€™s datacenters pose a fundamental limitation to effectively isolate RDMA and TCP while also maximizing burst absorption . We identify two root causes: (i) the buffer-sharing for RDMA and TCP relies on two independent and often conflicting views of the buffer, namely ingress and egress; and (ii) the buffer-sharing scheme micromanages the buffer and overreacts to the changes in its occupancy during transient congestion. In this paper, we present R EVERIE , a buffer-sharing scheme, which, unlike prior works, is suitable for both lossless and loss-tolerant traffic, providing isolation and better burst absorption than state-of-the-art buffer-sharing schemes. At the core of R EVERIE lies a unified (consolidated ingress and egress) admission control that jointly optimizes the buffers for both RDMA and TCP. R EVERIE allocates buffer based on a low-pass filter that naturally absorbs bursty queue lengths during transient congestion within the buffer limits. Our evaluation shows that R EVERIE can improve the performance of RDMA as well as TCP in terms of flow completion times by up to 33%.
