The majority of Nigerian high schoolers have little to no exposure to the basics of algorithms and programming. We believe this trajectory should change as programming offers these students, especially those from indigent backgrounds, an opportunity to learn profitable skills and ignite their passions for problem-solving and critical thinking. NaijaCoder is an organization that is dedicated to organizing a free, intensive summer program in Nigeria to teach the basics of algorithms and computer programming to high schoolers. However, the adoption of computer science curriculum has been especially challenging in countries in the global south that face unique challenges---such as unstable power supply, internet service, and price volatility. We design a curriculum that is more conducive to the local environment while incorporating rigorous thinking and preparation. Using basic survey designs, we elicit feedback, from the students, designed to further improve and iterate on our curriculum.
