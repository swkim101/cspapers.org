The integration of advanced technologies in healthcare necessitates the development of systems accommodating the daily routines in medical practices. Neurosurgeons, in particular, require extensive practice in microsurgical suturing in the long term, even in the busy routine of a medical practice. This study collaboratively developed a Mixed Reality system with neurosurgeons to support self-training in microscopic suturing. Based on the neurosurgeonsâ€™ opinions, we implemented a level-appropriate microsurgical suture training system. For novices, the system offers shadow-matching training to support the practice of precise movements under the high-sensitivity environment of the microscope. For intermediates, it provides a real-time feedback system, which allows users to practice attention to details. Evaluation involved testing the novice system on students with no medical background and the intermediate system on neurosurgery residents. The effectiveness of the system was demonstrated through the experimental results and subsequent discussion.
