This study describes the synthesis and characterization of the lead-free organic ferroelectric perovskite N-methyl-N’-diazabicyclo [2.2.2]octonium)-ammonium trichloride (MDABCO-NH4Cl3). The electrospinning technique was employed to obtain nanofibers embedded with this perovskite in a PVC polymer for hybrid fiber production. The dielectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties of these fibers were carefully examined. Based on measurements of the dielectric permittivity temperature and frequency dependence, together with the pyroelectric results, a transition from a high temperature paraelectric to a ferroelectric phase that persisted at room temperature was found to occur at 438 K. The measured pyroelectric coefficient yielded values as high as 290 μC K−1 m−2, which is in between the values reported for MDABCO-NH4I3 and the semiorganic ferroelectric triglycine sulfate (TGS). The hybrid nanofibers exhibited good morphological characteristics and demonstrated very good piezoelectric properties. Specifically, a piezoelectric coefficient of 42 pC/N was obtained when applying a periodical force of 3 N and a piezoelectric voltage coefficient of geff = 0.65 V mN−1. The performance of these fibers is on par with that of materials discussed in the existing literature for the fabrication of nano energy-harvesting generators. Importantly, the perovskite nanocrystals within the fibers are protected from degradation by the surrounding polymer, making them a promising environmentally friendly platform for flexible mechanical energy harvesting.
