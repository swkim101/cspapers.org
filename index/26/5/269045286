Existing data visualization design guidelines focus primarily on constructing grammatically-correct visualizations that faithfully convey the values and relationships in the underlying data. However, a designer may create a grammatically-correct visualization that still leaves audiences susceptible to reasoning misleaders, e.g. by failing to normalize data or using unrepresentative samples. Reasoning misleaders are especially pernicious when presenting public policy data, where data-driven decisions can affect public health, safety, and economic development. Through textual analysis, a formative evaluation, and iterative design with 19 policy communicators, we construct an actionable visualization design framework, V-FRAMER, that effectively synthesizes ways of mitigating reasoning misleaders. We discuss important design considerations for frameworks like V-FRAMER, including using concrete examples to help designers understand reasoning misleaders, and using a hierarchical structure to support example-based accessing. We further describe V-FRAMERâ€™s congruence with current practice and how practitioners might integrate the framework into their existing workflows.
