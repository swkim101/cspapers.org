Heat stress, caused by a warming climate and the increasingly high milk-producing dairy cattle, is one of the major threats to the well-being of dairy cattle as well as the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of dairy farming around the world. Timely identification of cows under heat stress is crucial to improving animal welfare, preventing milk production losses, and preserving water and energy for cooling. This paper presents a smart ear tag, named eTag, and an associated system that can read a passive microchip temperature sensor subcutaneously injected into the animal with minimal discomfort. It features a lightweight design using a single coil shared for microchip scanning and wireless charging. eTag is autonomously recharged by a wireless charger over the head during daily milking sessions, enabling perpetual operation without battery replacement after deployment. The real-world performance of the proposed system was examined intensively in a three-week deployment on seven lactating Holstein cows. We demonstrate that eTag can reliably collect accurate body temperature in real time while maintaining a positive energy flow. The deployment of eTag will enable the timely detection of heat stress and facilitate precision control of barn cooling systems.
