Certain thermoplastic blends have substantially improved hot strength (i.e., cohesive strength and resistance to sagging or tearing during milling or other hot processing). The blends comprise (1) at least one ethylene-propylene (EP) or ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) polymer and (2) at least one highly crystalline polyallomer, and are useful for tubing, wire and cable insulation, molded items and the like.
