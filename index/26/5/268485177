Algorithm visualization is an educational tool that has been used for many years to show the progress of an algorithm by updating a visual representation of a data structure. Visualizations usually cover CS1 and CS2 algorithms. However, algorithm animations and high level data structure visualizations are not yet widely used in algorithm learning. The demo features Algovision (www.algovision.org), which seeks to overcome the problems of existing algorithm visualizations using the following design principles: Algovision is implemented in JavaScript to be immediately available on any device with a web browser; it does not offer simple visualizations, but full visual algorithm lectures; it is based on feedback from several hundreds of students and many teachers who have already used it in courses; it also includes some fairly advanced algorithms; it visualizes not only the action of the code, but also the underlying algorithmic idea; it offers a built-in guide with optional synthetic voice output. The most important and innovative features are "playgrounds": interactive scenes, where learners can prepare their own inputs (trees, graphs, . . .) and play with operations that are later used in algorithms (e.g., rotations of binary tree edges, color flipping in red-black trees, node joining and splitting in B-trees). Playgrounds make instruction significantly more efficient and highly motivate learners. The playgrounds are advantageously used at home or in cooperating student groups.
