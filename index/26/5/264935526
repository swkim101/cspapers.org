We provide novel information-theoretic generalization bounds for stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) under the assumptions of smoothness and dissipativity, which are widely used in sampling and non-convex optimization studies. Our bounds are time-independent and decay to zero as the sample size increases, regardless of the number of iterations and whether the step size is fixed. Unlike previous studies, we derive the generalization error bounds by focusing on the time evolution of the Kullback--Leibler divergence, which is related to the stability of datasets and is the upper bound of the mutual information between output parameters and an input dataset. Additionally, we establish the first information-theoretic generalization bound when the training and test loss are the same by showing that a loss function of SGLD is sub-exponential. This bound is also time-independent and removes the problematic step size dependence in existing work, leading to an improved excess risk bound by combining our analysis with the existing non-convex optimization error bounds.
