Food waste and food insecurity are two problems that co-exist worldwide. A major force to combat food waste and insecurity, food rescue platforms (FRP) match food donations to low-resource communities. Since they rely on external volunteers to deliver the food, communicating rescue task difficulty to volunteers is very important for volunteer engagement and retention. We develop a hybrid model with tabular and natural language data to predict the difficulty of a given rescue trip, which significantly outperforms baselines in identifying easy and hard rescues. Furthermore, using storyboards, we conducted interviews with different stakeholders to understand their perspectives on how to integrate such predictions into volunteers' workflow. Motivated by our findings, we developed three explanation methods to generate interpretable insights for volunteers to better understand the predictions. The results from this study are in the process of being adopted at Food Rescue Hero, a large FRP serving over 25 cities across the United States.
