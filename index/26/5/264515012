We design and build A11yBits, a tangible toolkit that empowers blind and low vision (BLV) people to easily create personalized do-it-yourself assistive technologies (DIY-ATs). A11yBits includes (1) a series of Sensing modules to detect both environmental information and user commands, (2) a set of Feedback modules to send multi-modal feedback, and (3) two Base modules (Sensing Base and Feedback Base) to power and connect the sensing and feedback modules. The toolkit enables accessible and easy assembly via a “plug-and-play” mechanism. BLV users can select and assemble their preferred modules to create personalized DIY-ATs.
