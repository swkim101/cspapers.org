This study proposes and evaluates a new Bayesian network classifier (BNC) having an I-map structure with the fewest class variable parameters among all structures for which the class variable has no parent. Moreover, a new learning algorithm to learn our proposed model is presented. The proposed method is guaranteed to obtain the true classification probability asymptotically. Moreover, the method has lower computational costs than those of exact learning BNC using marginal likelihood. Comparison experiments have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed method.
