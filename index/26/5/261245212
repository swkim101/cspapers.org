Numerous solutions are proposed for the Traffic Signal Control (TSC) tasks aiming to provide efficient transportation and alleviate traffic congestion. Recently, promising results have been attained by Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods through trial and error in simulators, bringing confidence in solving cities' congestion problems. However, performance gaps still exist when simulator-trained policies are deployed to the real world. This issue is mainly introduced by the system dynamic difference between the training simulators and the real-world environments. In this work, we leverage the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and profile the system dynamics by a prompt-based grounded action transformation to bridge the performance gap. Specifically, this paper exploits the pre-trained LLM's inference ability to understand how traffic dynamics change with weather conditions, traffic states, and road types. Being aware of the changes, the policies' action is taken and grounded based on realistic dynamics, thus helping the agent learn a more realistic policy. We conduct experiments on four different scenarios to show the effectiveness of the proposed PromptGAT's ability to mitigate the performance gap of reinforcement learning from simulation to reality (sim-to-real).
