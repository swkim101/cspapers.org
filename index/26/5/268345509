We implemented pedagogical strategies designed to give students greater control over the use of class time and grading methods in a major-required computer science theory (CST) course. Our methodology addresses the challenges inherent in transferring more power to students in a lecture-based class with a curriculum that requires the sequential mastery of formal mathematical concepts. We offered students increased control over four classroom variables: the degree of interactivity, the selection of in-class activities, increased emphasis on standards-based outcomes as opposed to averaging over all coursework, and the granularity of the grading schema used by TAs. In this experience report, we present our methodology, report on our classroom experience, and conclude that increasing student control over the undergraduate CST classroom via participatory governance can increase student motivation and encourage critical reflection in budding computer scientists.
