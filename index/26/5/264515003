Digital fabrication serves as a potent instrument for facilitating interaction between the real and digital realms. However, the process is becoming increasingly complex amidst its development. We present Sacriface, a simple and versatile support structure for 3D printing which allows us to obtain further efficiency and flexibility in 3D printing. We simplified the strategy of expanding support structures taking advantage of a stable, growing overhang that gradually recovers its original shape as printing thickness increases. Sacriface is effortlessly designed and printable using an unmodified 3D printer, which enhances user customization.
