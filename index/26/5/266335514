This paper addresses the time-intensive nature of systematic reviews (SRs) and proposes a solution leveraging advancements in Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) and external knowledge augmentation (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation). The proposed system, GEAR-Up, automates query development and translation in SRs, enhancing efficiency by enriching user queries with context from language models and knowledge graphs. Collaborating with librarians, qualitative evaluations demonstrate improved reproducibility and search strategy quality. Access the demo at https://youtu.be/zMdP56GJ9mU.
