In this paper we present aspect-oriented programming laws that are useful for deriving refactorings for AspectJ. The laws help developers to verify if the transformations they define preserve behavior. We illustrate that by deriving several AspectJ refactorings. We also show that our laws are useful for restructuring two Java applications with the aim of using aspects to modularize common crosscutting concerns.
