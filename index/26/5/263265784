Given the central role that the mobile core plays in supporting mobile network operations, the efficiency, cost-effective dynamic scalability and resilience of the core control plane are paramount. Achieving these goals, however, presents two main challenges: (i) decoupling core network state from processing; (ii) decoupling control plane processing in the core from its interface to the radio access network (RAN). To address these challenges, our proposed solution, CoreKube, is based on a novel message-focused and cloud-native design with truly stateless workers that interface with a common database (to hold the core network state) and with the RAN through a frontend in a standard compliant manner. The fully stateless and generic nature of the workers to process any control plane message enables efficient message handling. Orchestration of containerized CoreKube components using Kubernetes allows leveraging the latter's autoscaling and self-healing properties. This demo highlights three key features of CoreKube: dynamic scaling of core in the face of varying control plane traffic while maintaining low user-perceived latency, resilience to failures, and the ability to seamlessly interface with standard-compliant RAN and commodity hardware.
