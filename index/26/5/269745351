We present EcoThreads, a sustainable e-textile prototyping approach for fabricating biodegradable functional threads. We synthesized two thread-based fabrication methods, wet spinning and thread coating, to fabricate functional threads from biomaterials or modify natural fiber to achieve conductive or interactive functionality. We built a wet spinning tool from a modified DIY syringe pump to spin biodegradable conductive threads. The conductive and interactive threads can be further integrated into textiles through weaving, knitting, embroidery, and braiding. We conducted a workshop study inviting e-textile practitioners to use the materials to fabricate e-textile swatches for transient use cases. The EcoThreads approach presents a path for individual creators to incorporate biodegradable material choices toward sustainable e-textile practices.
