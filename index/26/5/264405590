Conversational Machine Reading (CMR) requires answering a user's initial question through multi-turn dialogue interactions based on a given document. Although there exist many effective methods, they largely neglected the alignment between the document and the user-provided information, which significantly affects the intermediate decision-making and subsequent follow-up question generation. To address this issue, we propose a pipeline framework that (1) aligns the aforementioned two sides in an explicit way, (2)makes decisions using a lightweight many-to-many entailment reasoning module, and (3) directly generates follow-up questions based on the document and previously asked questions. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art in micro-accuracy and ranks the first place on the public leaderboard of the CMR benchmark dataset ShARC.
