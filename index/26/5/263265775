This paper proposes Meta-Speaker, an innovative speaker capable of projecting audible sources into the air with a high level of manipulability. Unlike traditional speakers that emit sound waves in all directions, Meta-Speaker can manipulate the granularity of the audible region, down to a single point, and can manipulate the location of the source. Additionally, the source projected by Meta-Speaker is a physical presence in space, allowing both humans and machines to perceive it with spatial awareness. Meta-Speaker achieves this by leveraging the fact that air is a nonlinear medium, which enables the reproduction of audible sources from ultrasounds. Meta-Speaker comprises two distributed ultrasonic arrays, each transmitting a narrow ultrasonic beam. The audible source can be reproduced at the intersection of the beams. We present a comprehensive profiling of Meta-Speaker to validate the high manipulability it offers. We prototype Meta-Speaker and demonstrate its potential through three applications: anchor-free localization with a median error of 0.13 m, location-aware communication with a throughput of 1.28 Kbps, and acoustic augmented reality where users can perceive source direction with a mean error of 9.8 degrees.
