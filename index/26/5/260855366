To build a theory of intention revision for agents operating in stochastic environments, we need a logic in which we can explicitly reason about their decision-making policies and those policies' uncertain outcomes. Towards this end, we propose PLBP, a novel probabilistic temporal logic for Markov Decision Processes that allows us to reason about policies of bounded size. The logic is designed so that its expressive power is sufficient for the intended applications, whilst at the same time possessing strong computational properties. We prove that the satisfiability problem for our logic is decidable, and that its model checking problem is PSPACE-complete. This allows us to e.g. algorithmically verify whether an agent's intentions are coherent, or whether a specific policy satisfies safety and/or liveness properties.
