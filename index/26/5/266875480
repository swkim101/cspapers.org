The Automated Diagram Drafting (ADD) system is an off-line drafting system for generating schematic diagrams. The system has been operational at the Orlando Division of Martin Marietta for more than one year and has successfully demonstrated economical performance while producing documentation that meets military specification requirements. ADD has accomplished reduction in turn-around time from the development of a circuit to documentation in drawing form. The extremely important maintenance phase has been made 30 percent more economical over the manual means previously used. Additional cost and time reduction is expected with increased experience on the part of the user and with continued development of the ADD system. The system has proven to be most useful during the maintenance phase, particularly when changes would require repeating large parts of the drawing, if not the entire layout, under the manual procedure. In the ADD system, circuit revisions may be made by changing/rearranging only the input associated with that particular portion of the circuit. Thus, the updating process significantly reduces maintenance time and cost.
