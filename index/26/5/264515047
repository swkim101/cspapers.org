Prototyping novel social computing systems is a challenge in the field of Social Computing. Rapid experimentation with novel social network sites can offer valuable insights into their pro-social benefits before their public release to a large audience. In this demo, we present SocialSketch, a Figma Plugin to simulate a crowd in a social network. This demo introduces a plugin for Figma, a no-code interactive prototyping tool, enabling the creation of profile frames and prototype links for large crowds based on realistic network models. Privacy-protective profile content is generated using AI. The plugin aids UX designers, researchers, and students in prototyping social apps and exploring social system design.
