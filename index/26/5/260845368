The growing amount of available information poses challenges not only in the process of information retrieval. The usability of the rendered search process and results can be increased by appropriate visualization techniques or new interaction paradigms, or both. In this article we present the HoneyComb™ paradigm, an information visualization style that aims to render and manage large quantities of information items. We describe the design objectives and the prototype of HC™. Finally, we present a short evaluation of the HC™ paradigm in the context of search and browsing.
