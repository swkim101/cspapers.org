A stark disparity exists in the energy consumption for performing transmissions and the tasks of sensing and processing in wireless embedded systems. We present our early work to design a novel transmitter that enables transmissions at a similar energy consumption as other tasks in wireless embedded systems. In particular, the proposed transmitter does not require a carrier emitting device, which is essential to support backscatter transmitters, but has also limited their widespread deployment. The proposed transmitter exploits the capability of tunnel diode oscillators to function as a low-power, self-oscillating mixer. This property enables us to mix a weak baseband signal with a locally generated carrier signal at a peak power consumption below 100 microwatts. Nevertheless, the tunnel diode oscillator trades off the stability for low energy consumption leading to poor link reliability. In this study, we investigate error correction codes to increase link reliability. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of the transmitter to support short-range transmissions with a low energy consumption and enhanced link reliability.
