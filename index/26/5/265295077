Today's rapidly evolving educational landscape prioritizes active student engagement. Classrooms at scale face particular challenges in fostering meaningful interactions between students and course content. In this study, we introduce EIT (Earnest Insight Toolkit), a tool designed to assess students' engagement within interactive lecture participation exercises-particularly in the context of large-scale hybrid classrooms. We use EIT to conduct a comprehensive assessment of student responses to interactive lecture poll questions. Our objective with EIT is to equip educators with valuable means of identifying at-risk students for enhancing intervention and support strategies and measuring student engagement with course content.
