Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a novel implicit 3D reconstruction method that shows immense potential and has been gaining increasing attention. It enables the reconstruction of 3D scenes solely from a set of photographs. However, its real-time rendering capability, especially for interactive real-time rendering of large-scale scenes, still has significant limitations. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel neural rendering system called UE4-NeRF, specifically designed for real-time rendering of large-scale scenes. We partitioned each large scene into different sub-NeRFs. In order to represent the partitioned independent scene, we initialize polygonal meshes by constructing multiple regular octahedra within the scene and the vertices of the polygonal faces are continuously optimized during the training process. Drawing inspiration from Level of Detail (LOD) techniques, we trained meshes of varying levels of detail for different observation levels. Our approach combines with the rasterization pipeline in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), achieving real-time rendering of large-scale scenes at 4K resolution with a frame rate of up to 43 FPS. Rendering within UE4 also facilitates scene editing in subsequent stages. Furthermore, through experiments, we have demonstrated that our method achieves rendering quality comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page: https://jamchaos.github.io/UE4-NeRF/.
