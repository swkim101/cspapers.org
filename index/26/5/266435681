Few-shot intent classification and slot filling are important but challenging tasks due to the scarcity of finely labeled data. Therefore, current works first train a model on source domains with sufficiently labeled data, and then transfer the model to target domains where only rarely labeled data is available. However, experience transferring as a whole usually suffers from gaps that exist among source domains and target domains. For instance, transferring domain-specific-knowledge-related experience is difficult. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method that explicitly decouples the transferring of general-semantic-representation-related experience and the domain-specific-knowledge-related experience. Specifically, for domain-specific-knowledge-related experience, we design two modules to capture intent-slot relation and slot-slot relation respectively. Extensive experiments on Snips and FewJoint datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The method improves the joint accuracy metric from 27.72% to 42.20% in the 1-shot setting, and from 46.54% to 60.79% in the 5-shot setting.
