In this paper, we propose a synthesis of a process for designing a passive RFID tag. The synthesis is developed with the purpose of constructing a systematic approach for passive tag design. To clarify the method steps, a passive tag, which operates at a center frequency of 900 MHz on a plastic substrate, is designed. The tag is composed of a dipole antenna and a tag chip.
