The creation of new datasets often presents new challenges for video recognition and can inspire novel ideas while addressing these challenges. While existing datasets mainly comprise landscape mode videos, our paper seeks to introduce portrait mode videos to the research community and highlight the unique challenges associated with this video format. With the growing popularity of smartphones and social media applications, recognizing portrait mode videos is becoming increasingly important. To this end, we have developed the first dataset dedicated to portrait mode video recognition, namely PortraitMode-400. The taxon-omy of PortraitMode-400 was constructed in a data-driven manner, comprising 400 fine-grained categories, and rigorous quality assurance was implemented to ensure the accuracy of human annotations. In addition to the new dataset, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the impact of video format (portrait mode versus landscape mode) on recognition accuracy and spatial bias due to the different formats. Furthermore, we designed extensive experiments to explore key aspects of portrait mode video recognition, including the choice of data augmentation, evaluation procedure, the importance of temporal information, and the role of audio modality. Building on the insights from our experimental results and the introduction of PortraitMode-400, our paper aims to inspire further research efforts in this emerging research direction.
