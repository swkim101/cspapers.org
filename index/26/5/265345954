Accidents at water tourist sites are a serious problem. To solve this problem and ensure timely rescue, the IoT technology-applied life jacket solution was proposed. This solution includes the use of life jackets equipped with IoT technology. This life jacket is equipped with sensors and wireless network connection, allowing to track the position and condition of people in danger in the water. When a problem is detected, the life jacket automatically sends a rescue message to the rescue stations and lifeguards. The application of IoT technology in this solution also helps to improve the management and analysis of data on drowning accidents. These data can be used to analyze trends and provide preventive measures and improve water safety for visitors. This contributes to improving the quality and safety of the tourism sector.
