Previous research argues that liberal arts computer science programs are defining new directions for curricula based on distinctive features of their institutional and/or departmental identity. These innovations, and the approach to curricular design that inform them, can inspire curricular innovation at large universities, community colleges, and K-12 institutions. This panel illustrates an approach to curriculum design based on institutional and/or departmental identity with specific examples from four programs. It will guide audience members to consider distinctive features of their program context and how that can influence their curricula.
