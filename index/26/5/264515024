The design handoff process refers to the stage in the user interface (UI) design process where a designer gives their finished design to a developer for implementation. However, design decisions are lost when developers struggle to interpret and implement the designerâ€™s original intent. To address this problem, we built a system called Relay that utilizes concrete UI models to capture design intent. To our knowledge, Relay is the first system described in the academic literature to take artifacts from an existing design tool and generate a UI model.
