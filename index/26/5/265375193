 Optimization for different tasks like material characterization, synthesis, and functional properties for desired applications over multi-dimensional control parameter and function spaces need a rapid strategic search through active learning. However, in all cases prior to optimization, the target material properties are assumed known and fixed, which mostly deviates from real-world scenarios in material synthesis. This can be critical for running expensive experiments on new materials, when the experimental results are fuzzy for any scientific outcomes due to improper target setting, ultimately wasting time and cost. The failure rate and cost are even higher over exploring on multi-target space, where we want to learn the pareto among multiple properties, to jointly optimize during material synthesis for desired applications. To address the challenge, here we introduce the human-operator attempt flexibility in the active learning based automated experiment framework, with generating multiple human assessed targets through a voting-based recommender system during real-time microscope measurements over the large material image space, sequentially learn/update multiple desired targets through a weighting system, and adaptively search in multiple material properties functional space for non-dominated pareto discoveries to maximize the custom structural similarity based acquisition function. We term this a multi-objective Bayesian optimized human assessed multi-target generated spectral recommender systems (MOBO-HAM-SRS). The approach has been demonstrated to peizoresponse force spectroscopy of a ferroelectric thin film, exploring with different kernels and acquisition functions. This work shows an advancement towards human-AI collaborated automated experiments, steering optimization trajectories through human overpowering AI at the early stage when uncertainty is high and AI overpowering human at the later stage with rapid exploration towards optimal goal, following human-assessed multiple targets properties.
