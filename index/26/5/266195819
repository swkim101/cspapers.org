This paper proposes an external wrench estimation method for modular manipulators, where each link module is driven with external actuation (e.g., rotors, thrusters) and inter-module joints can be locked to increase end-effector stiffness or workforce of the manipulator. For such systems, the commonly-used momentum-based observer (MBO [1]) is not suitable due to the presence of unknown joint locking (JL) torque and also the degeneracy of Jacobian transpose relation with the system degree-of-freedom (DOF) becoming less than six with the joint locking. To overcome this, we propose two novel external wrench estimation algorithms: a distributed algorithm based on recursive Newton-Euler dynamics and a centralized algorithm based on D'Alembert's principle, both using an F/T (force/torque) sensor at the base. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
