Embedding-based neural topic models have turned out to be a superior option for low-resourced topic modeling. However, current approaches consider static word embeddings learnt from source tasks as general knowledge that can be transferred directly to the target task, discounting the dynamically changing nature of word meanings in different contexts, thus typically leading to sub-optimal results when adapting to new tasks with unfamiliar contexts. To settle this issue, we provide an effective method that centers on adaptively generating semantically tailored word embeddings for each task by fully exploiting contextual information. Specifically, we first condense the contextual syntactic dependencies of words into a semantic graph for each task, which is then modeled by a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder to produce task-specific word representations. On this basis, we further impose a learnable Gaussian mixture prior on the latent space of words to efficiently learn topic representations from a clustering perspective, which contributes to diverse topic discovery and fast adaptation to novel tasks. We have conducted a wealth of quantitative and qualitative experiments, and the results show that our approach comprehensively outperforms established topic models.
