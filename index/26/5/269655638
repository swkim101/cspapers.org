The increasing demand for remote work and virtual interactions has heightened the usage of business collaboration platforms~(BCPs), with Google Workspace as a prominent example. These platforms enhance team collaboration by integrating Google Docs, Slides, Calendar, and feature-rich third-party applications (add-ons). However, such integration of multiple users and entities has inadvertently introduced new and complex attack surfaces, elevating security and privacy risks in resource management to unprecedented levels. In this study, we conduct a systematic study on the effectiveness of the cross-entity resource management in Google Workspace, the most popular BCP. Our study unveils the access control enforcement in real-world BCPs for the first time. Based on this, we formulate the attack surfaces inherent in BCPs and conduct a comprehensive assessment, pinpointing three vulnerability types leading to distinct attacks. An analysis of 4,732 marketplace add-ons reveals that approximately 70% are potentially vulnerable to these attacks. We propose robust countermeasures to improve BCP security, urging immediate action and setting a foundation for future research.
