Robotic systems for manipulation in millimeter scale often use a camera with high magnification for visual feedback of the target region. However, the limited field-of-view (FoV) of the microscopic camera necessitates camera motion to capture a broader workspace environment. In this work, we propose an autonomous robotic control method to constrain a robot-held camera within a designated FoV. Furthermore, we model the camera extrinsics as part of the kinematic model and use camera measurements coupled with a U-Net based tool tracking to adapt the complete robotic model during task execution. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the proposed framework was evaluated in a bi-manual setup, where the microscopic camera was controlled to view a tool moving in a pre-defined trajectory. The proposed method allowed the camera to stay 94.1% of the time within the real FoV, compared to 54.4% without the proposed adaptive control.
