This talk will explore the possibilities of what emerging AI architectures could mean for interaction. My perspective and examples are based on personal opinions, informed by observations and experience gained from building advanced interactions over the last few decades. While I aim to provide insights, speculations, and suggest some essential conditions for creating such an ultimate interface, my insights may not be exhaustive. I invite open discussion and debate on this subject, recognizing that the conditions that I propose might be necessary but perhaps not sufficient in themselves.
