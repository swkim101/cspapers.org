In this paper, we explore a specific optimization problem that involves the combination of a differentiable nonconvex function and a nondifferentiable function. The differentiable component lacks a global Lipschitz continuous gradient, posing challenges for optimization. To address this issue and accelerate the convergence, we propose a Bregman proximal stochastic gradient method with extrapolation (BPSGE), which only requires smooth adaptivity of the differentiable part. Under variance reduction framework, we not only analyze the subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithm under certain conditions, but also analyze the sublinear convergence rate of the subsequence, and the complexity of the algorithm, revealing that the BPSGE algorithm requires at most O(epsilon\^\,(-2)) iterations in expectation to attain an epsilon-stationary point. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, we conduct numerical experiments on three real-world applications: graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), matrix factorization with weakly-convex regularization, and NMF with nonconvex sparsity constraints. These experiments demonstrate that BPSGE is faster than the baselines without extrapolation. The code is available at: https://github.com/nothing2wang/BPSGE-Algorithm.
