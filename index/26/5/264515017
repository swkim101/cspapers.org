Pervasive symptoms in autistic individuals, such as facing more frequent challenges in social situations, pose significant obstacles in their pursuit of an independent life in adulthood. Although much research has proposed computer-assisted programs (e.g., smartphone apps and VR-based systems), there is a significant lack of systems designed for autistic adults and their independence, and the preferences or characteristics of autistic individuals are not carefully reflected in the design process. Thus, in my dissertation, I focus on two requirements of autistic adults for supporting their independence: (1) an independent and healthy lifestyle and (2) positive social skill practice. These requirements were externalized in two gamified mobile apps (PuzzleWalk and RoutineAid) and two VR-based systems (VISTA and V-DAT). My research aims to design and develop mobile/VR systems and derive design guidelines to support the independence of autistic adults.
