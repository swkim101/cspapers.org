In this paper, we propose a new progression mechanism for a restricted form of incomplete knowledge formulated as a basic action theory in the situation calculus. Specifically, we focus on functional fluents and deal directly with the possible values these fluents may have and how these values are affected by both physical and sensing actions. The method we propose is logically complete and can be calculated efficiently using database techniques under certain reasonable assumptions.
