Mobile apps which support womenâ€™s health have developed rapidly alongside the increasing de-stigmatisation of female reproductive wellbeing. However, the ubiquity of these apps has advanced the practice of intimate surveillance and the commodification of sensitive user data. While the overturning of Roe v. Wade has prompted reflection on the privacy and safety implications of female mobile health (mHealth) apps, the privacy practices of these apps have yet to be thoroughly examined in a post-Roe world. We investigated the privacy practices of 20 popular female mHealth apps, combining a thematic analysis of Data safety sections and privacy policies with a privacy-focused usability inspection. Our findings revealed problematic practices, including inconsistencies across privacy policy content and privacy-related app features, flawed consent and data deletion mechanisms, and covert gathering of sensitive data. We present recommendations for improving privacy practices, and call for a dedicated focus not only on user privacy, but also safety.
