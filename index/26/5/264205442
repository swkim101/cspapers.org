MARKLINK Terminal (MLT) is a Distributed Data Processing system on the General Electric Information Services Company (GEISCO) network. The GEISCO network is a hierarchical network with the file systems at one end and the terminals at the other. The terminals are connected to the network via remote devices. The MLT X.25 interface connects the MLT to the remote device, Network Gateway, via the Public Data Network. To be cost effective, all the users of an MLT are multiplexed over a single virtual circuit. The interrupt and the clear processes are flow controlled using Network Control Data Packets. MLT initiates, communicates and terminates the communication sessions with the GEISCO network by exchanging the Network Control Data Packets and the User Data Packets. The Network Control Data Packets extend some of the network control functions to the MLT.
