We present a novel approach, Augmented Photogrammetry, for scanning and editing the appearance of physical objects in augmented reality (AR). Our work provides a user-friendly and efficient technique for enabling customizable appearance modifications in real time on arbitrary objects scanned from a userâ€™s physical environment. We accomplish this by integrating Structure from Motion (SfM), instance segmentation, and machine learning into a unified pipeline. Our streamlined process enables users to easily select a physical object and specify its desired appearance. We believe our mobile AR approach holds promise for applications in interior design, virtual prototyping, and content creation.
