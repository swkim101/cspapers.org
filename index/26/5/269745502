Inspired by physical possessions displayed in the home, we define “digital knick-knacks” as standalone audiovisual digital possessions or embellishments contained within non-game digital environments. “Neko”, a cat that chases the cursor, is a historical example. We propose a taxonomy to define and generate digital knick-knacks based on key publications on consumer behaviour and personal possessions, augmented by results of a brainstorming session with 9 HCI researchers. Using the taxonomy, we prototype three classes of digital knick-knack exemplars: an ambient noise machine, a virtual pet, and a virtual picture frame. In a 10-day diary study, 10 participants design their own variants of the prototypes, and report on their experience using them on a personal device. Our analysis shows how digital knick-knacks can bring value to users, and we suggest implications for designing playful digital embellishments.
