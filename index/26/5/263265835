Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications are crucial for unlocking the potential of future communication systems. Phased arrays play a vital role in generating directional beams, mitigating the high path-loss associated with these frequencies. Consequently, implementing beamforming within the radio is necessary to serve users in various directions. Applications such as AR/VR and vehicular communications demand rapid beam direction changes, typically within microseconds, to maintain stable connections when the user is mobile. In this demonstration, we showcase a mmWave setup capable of switching beams at microsecond intervals, along with a compact and portable user equipment setup for conducting experiments with high user mobility.
