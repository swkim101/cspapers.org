The challenge in sourcing attribution for forgery faces has gained widespread attention due to the rapid development of generative techniques. While many recent works have taken essential steps on GAN-generated faces, more threatening attacks related to identity swapping or expression transferring are still overlooked. And the forgery traces hidden in unknown attacks from the open-world unlabeled faces still remain under-explored. To push the related frontier research, we introduce a new benchmark called Open-World DeepFake Attribution (OW-DFA), which aims to evaluate attribution performance against various types of fake faces under open-world scenarios. Meanwhile, we propose a novel framework named Contrastive Pseudo Learning (CPL) for the OW-DFA task through 1) introducing a Global-Local Voting module to guide the feature alignment of forged faces with different manipulated regions, 2) designing a Confidence-based Soft Pseudo-label strategy to mitigate the pseudo-noise caused by similar methods in unlabeled set. In addition, we extend the CPL framework with a multi-stage paradigm that leverages pre-train technique and iterative learning to further enhance traceability performance. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of our proposed method on the OW-DFA and also demonstrate the interpretability of deepfake attribution task and its impact on improving the security of deepfake detection area.
