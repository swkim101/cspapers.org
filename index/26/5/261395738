Motion capture from a limited number of body-worn sensors, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and pressure insoles, has important applications in health, human performance, and entertainment. Recent work has focused on accurately reconstructing whole-body motion from a specific sensor configuration using six IMUs. While a common goal across applications is to use the minimal number of sensors to achieve required accuracy, the optimal arrangement of the sensors might differ from application to application. We propose a single diffusion model, Dif-fusionPoser, which reconstructs human motion in real-time from an arbitrary combination of sensors, including IMUs placed at specified locations, and, pressure insoles. Un-like existing methods, our model grants users the flexibility to determine the number and arrangement of sensors tai-lored to the specific activity of interest, without the need for retraining. A novel autoregressive inferencing scheme ensures real-time motion reconstruction that closely aligns with measured sensor signals. The generative nature of Dif-fusionl'oser ensures realistic behavior, even for degrees-of-freedom not directly measured.
