In the face of rising surface temperatures from climate change, impacting biodiversity, extreme weather events, and agricultural productivity, understanding the drivers behind temperature changes is imperative. Traditional global climate models (GCMs) are computationally expensive, limiting their applicability, while machine learning approaches, though promising, face interpretability challenges due to their "black box" nature, especially in a dynamic setting where the data is constantly evolving. We propose DUO, a framework to identify shifts in important features and feature combinations as the data distribution changes over time. Our model independently assesses the importance of features and their interactions while also evaluating their relevance when combined with additional features, contributing to the target class. As a case study, we apply DUO to assess the shifts in climate drivers for station-level temperatures in six locations across New Zealand from 1980 to 2020, we identify specific humidity, geopotential height, and air temperature at high atmospheric pressure levels as the most important features for describing temperature variability. By revealing how climate drivers change over time, DUO contributes to a deeper understanding of temperature change patterns, enabling practitioners to develop targeted and adaptive mitigation strategies.
