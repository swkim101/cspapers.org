Beyond visual and auditory displays, tactile displays and grounded force feedback devices have become more common. Other sensory modalities are also catered to by a broad range of display devices, including temperature, taste, and olfaction. However, one sensory modality remains challenging to represent: kinesthesia â€“ the sense of movement. Inspired by grain-based compliance illusions, we investigate how vibrotactile cues can evoke kinesthetic experiences, even when no movement is performed. We examine the effects of vibrotactile mappings and granularity on the magnitude of perceived motion; distance-based mappings provided the greatest sense of movement. Using an implementation that combines visual feedback and our prototype kinesthetic display, we demonstrate that action-coupled vibrotactile cues are significantly better at conveying an embodied sense of movement than the corresponding visual stimulus, and that combining vibrotactile and visual feedback is best. These results point towards a future where kinesthetic displays will be used in rehabilitation, sports, virtual-reality and beyond.
