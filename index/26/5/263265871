As the demand for precision medicine rapidly grows, companion diagnostics is proposed to monitor and evaluate therapeutic effects for adjusting medicine plans in time. Although a set of clinical companion diagnostics tools (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) have been investigated, they are expensive and only accessible in a lab environment, which hinders the promotion to broader patients. In light of this situation, we take the first steps towards developing a real-world companion diagnostic tool by leveraging mobile technology. In this paper, we present TherapyPal, a privacy-preserving medicine effectiveness computational framework by harnessing semantic hashing-based digital symptomatic phenotyping. Specifically, sensor data captured from daily-life activities is first transformed into spectrograms. Then, we develop a hashing learning network to extract privacy-masked symptomatic phenotypes on smartphones. Afterward, symptomatic hashes at different medicine states are fed to a contrastive learning network in the cloud for treatment effectiveness detection. To evaluate the performance, we conduct a clinical study among 65 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients under dopaminergic drug treatment. The results show that TherapyPal can achieve around 84.1% medicine effectiveness detection accuracy among patients and above 0.925 privacy-masked scores for protecting each private attribute, which validates the reliability and security of TherapyPal to be used as a real-world companion diagnostics tool.
