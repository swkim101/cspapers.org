Designing ultra-low power RFID sensor tags is a major challenge, especially when incorporating a micro-controller (MCU) to operate sensors. While simplifying MCU functionality can reduce power consumption, it has limited effect as the fundamental information transformation is necessary for communication between the RFID reader and the sensor. Unfortunately, information transformation requires baseband sampling and processing, which consumes significant power on passive RFID tags. This paper proposes a novel approach that enables the reader to communicate directly with the sensor, eliminating the need for information transformation of MCU. We address the unique challenges posed by the physical and link layers of the EPC Gen2 protocol and introduce GoodID, a cross-layer design for next-generation RFID sensor tags featuring ultra-low power consumption. We prototype the GoodID tag for proof-of-concept and demonstrate significant power benefits through experimental results.
