Edge computing has transformed cellular networks, offering fast response times by moving computing resources to the network's edge. This not only reduces the burden on the Wide Area Network (WAN) but also enables latency-sensitive applications. However, the widespread deployment of edge computing raises concerns regarding its sustainability. In this work, we present MintEDGE, a simulation framework that models a fully configurable edge-enabled cellular network. MintEDGE empowers researchers and practitioners to design and assess energy-saving strategies for edge computing. We discuss the details of the simulator and its customizable elements like user mobility, the possibility to use predictive workload algorithms, and diverse application scenarios at scale.
