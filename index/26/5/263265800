Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has shown its benefits in various configurations of coexisting wireless networks. In this work, we discuss the ways for effective DSA between the terrestrial and non-terrestrial (satellite) networks. It is shown that the usage of historical statistical data leads to efficient resource sharing between these two kinds of networks at a limited interference cost.
