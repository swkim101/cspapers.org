Fostering learnersâ€™ interest remains an important challenge in computer science (CS) education. In this paper, we explore how creative music-making, tangible interfaces, and embodiment can be used toward this end. The primary contribution of this paper is Xylocode, a novel exhibit that introduces middle school age learners to computing concepts and fosters interest in CS via a tangible playspace for making music using an embodied simulation. We additionally present an in-museum evaluation of Xylocode with 29 middle school age children. Our results indicate that the exhibit fosters situational interest in computer science and leads to recognition of certain computing concepts, including arrays and global variables. Future research is needed to assess whether the exhibit leads to longer-term learning and/or interest gains and to explore why other computing concepts were not recognized by as many learners. We identify several implications and directions for future work based on our findings.
