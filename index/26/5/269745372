Tactile technologies are important for novel user experiences. Among several tactile submodalities, cold sensation is essential for realistically portraying materials and environments. However, current cold presentations such as Peltier devices face challenges like low energy efficiency and the need for complicated equipment. To address these, we suggest leveraging alcohol’s endothermic property during evaporation. Our prototype, a wristwatch wearable with a fan, capitalizes on alcohol’s high volatility by absorbing ambient heat upon evaporation. The device further enhances the cooling effect by circulating air around the skin. This approach simplifies the setup required for cooling technologies and is more energy-efficient than Peltier-based systems. We also integrated perfume, which is a mixture of alcohol and scent substance, and presented a unique cooling and scent experience. The use of alcohol as a cooling method was not considered conventional, but social changes after COVID-19 made it easy to obtain a tiny amount of alcohol.
