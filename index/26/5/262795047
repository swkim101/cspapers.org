The environment generated media (EGM) are defined here as being generated from a massive amount of and/or incomprehensible environmental data by compressing them into averages or representative values and/or by converting them into such user-friendly media as text, figures, charts, and animations. As an application of EGM, an object-participation-type weblog is introduced, where anthropomorphic indoor objects with sensor nodes post weblog entries and comments about what happened to them in a sensor networked environment.
