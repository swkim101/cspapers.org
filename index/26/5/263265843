The use of frequencies above 100 GHz has received increasing attention due to the large amount of available bandwidth. Given the high chance of signal blockage, reflected paths play a key role in 100+ GHz networks. Interestingly, at these frequencies, the signal wavelength becomes comparable to the height perturbation in common natural surfaces. Hence, the reflection pattern deviates from mirror-like smooth reflection and exhibits rough scattering patterns that consist of non-specular components. This paper presents an in-depth analysis and experimental demonstration of "rough" surface scattering and its implications for wireless networking, namely in coverage, mobility resilience, and channel reciprocity. Furthermore, we present a novel framework for estimating the surface roughness level from the unique spectral and spatial signatures seen in the reflection spectra. We perform extensive modeling, simulation, and over-the-air experiments using a broadband sub-THz wireless system employing typical indoor/outdoor surfaces such as tile, brick, redstone, and granite.
