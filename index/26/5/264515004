We present iTutor, a generative tutorial system for promoting smartphone use proficiency among elders. iTutor is unique because it can dynamically generate tutorials based on current operation goals and UI context, which we achieved through leveraging prompt engineering to large language models (LLMs). Our evaluations showed potential for this approach, as we yielded 78.6% accuracy in the instruction generation process. We conclude by providing the roadmap for further development.
