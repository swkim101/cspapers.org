Despite the proliferation of research studies examining elementary computing education worldwide, knowledge regarding the implementation and outcomes of elementary computing education is limited. In this study, we systematically reviewed 45 empirical papers published between January 2015 and December 2021 to establish a holistic understanding of recent research trends, implementation practices, and student outcomes in elementary computing instruction. This review identified three areas of focus that the current literature has explored: 1) curriculum and lesson development; 2) computing tools and learning environment design; and 3) computing pedagogy. In terms of implementation, we identified 1) eight types of subject contexts where computing instruction is implemented; 2) seven types of technologies that are used to engage elementary students in computing; and 3) eight types of learning activities that are implemented. Regarding student outcomes, the current literature reported student outcomes in six dimensions. This review presents the current research landscape of elementary computing education in terms of research trend, implementation practices, and student accomplishment. It showcases the versatility of instructional practices, highlights the progress of current efforts, while also pinpoints potential issues and concerns for future improvement.
