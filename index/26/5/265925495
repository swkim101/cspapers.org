We replicate the paper, "When to Use and When Not to Use BBR: An Empirical Analysis and Evaluation Study" by Cao et al, published in IMC 2019 [2], with a focus on the relative goodput of TCP BBR and TCP CUBIC for a range of bottleneck buffer sizes, bandwidths, and delays. We replicate the experiments performed by the original authors on two large-scale open-access testbeds, to validate the conclusions of the paper. We further extend the experiments to BBRv2. We package the experiment artifacts and make them publicly available so that others can repeat and build on this work.
