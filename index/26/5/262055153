Medical image registration is a critical task that estimates the spatial correspondence between pairs of images. However, current traditional and deep-learning-based methods rely on similarity measures to generate a deforming field, which often results in disproportionate volume changes in dissimilar regions, especially in tumor regions. These changes can significantly alter the tumor size and underlying anatomy, which limits the practical use of image registration in clinical diagnosis. To address this issue, we have formulated image registration with tumors as a constraint problem that preserves tumor volumes while maximizing image similarity in other normal regions. Our proposed strategy involves a two-stage process. In the first stage, we use similarity-based registration to identify potential tumor regions by their volume change, generating a soft tumor mask accordingly. In the second stage, we propose a volume-preserving registration with a novel adaptive volume-preserving loss that penalizes the change in size adaptively based on the masks calculated from the previous stage. Our approach balances image similarity and volume preservation in different regions, i.e., normal and tumor regions, by using soft tumor masks to adjust the imposition of volume-preserving loss on each one. This ensures that the tumor volume is preserved during the registration process. We have evaluated our strategy on various datasets and network architectures, demonstrating that our method successfully preserves the tumor volume while achieving comparable registration results with state-of-the-art methods.
