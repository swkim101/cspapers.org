In this demo we showcase an interactive application to support the learning of “TikTok dance challenge” short dance choreographies. Our system utilizes dance challenge videos as the information source, performing music analysis and pose estimation to segment the dance into learnable chunks and generate a practice plan that implements motor learning techniques such as incremental part-learning and fading guidance. These plans are presented in a web app that implements video demonstration, augmented webcam mirroring, practice recording/review functionality, and both concurrent and terminal feedback. By operating on a ubiquitous information source, generating the lessons automatically, and requiring only a web browser and webcam in the user interface, our system is a step towards significantly expanding the reach of dance choreography learning and a platform for further research into dance HCI.
