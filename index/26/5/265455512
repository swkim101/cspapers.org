Many electoral control and manipulation problems—which we will refer to in general as “manipulative actions” problems—are NP-hard in the general case. Many of these problems fall into polynomial time if the electorate is singlepeaked, i.e., is polarized along some axis/issue. However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked—for example, there may be some maverick voters—and to take this into account, we study the complexity of manipulative-action algorithms for the case of nearly single-peaked electorates.
