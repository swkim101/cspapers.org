Fidgeting is a common behavior that one tends to engage in during periods of inattention or mind wandering. Although attempts were undertaken to enhance fidget devices with advanced technology, such as sensors and displays, no works exist that explored fidgeting with actuated devices. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of programmable actuated fidgeting and the design space for SwarmFidget. Programmable actuated fidgeting is a type of fidgeting that involves devices integrated with actuators, sensors, and computing to enable a dynamic and customizable interactive fidgeting experience. SwarmFidget is an instance of a platform where tabletop swarm robots are used to facilitate programmable actuated fidgeting. To engage with actuated fidgets, users can input commands through various modalities such as touch or gesture, and the actuators in the fidgeting device will respond in a programmable manner to provide haptic, visual, or audio feedback.
