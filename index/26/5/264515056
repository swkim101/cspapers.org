This workshop aims to unite experts and practitioners in XR and AI to envision the future of AI-enabled virtual, augmented, and mixed reality experiences. Our expansive discussion includes a variety of key topics: Generative XR, Large Language Models (LLMs) for XR, Adaptive and Context-Aware XR, Explainable AI for XR, and harnessing AI to enhance and prototype XR experiences. We aim to identify the opportunities and challenges of how recent advances of AI could bring new XR experiences, which cannot be done before, with a keen focus on the seamless blending of our digital and physical worlds.
