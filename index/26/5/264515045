To add haptic feedback and tactile cues of a physical interface to interaction with mobile touch displays, several passive systems have been proposed as Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs). The haptic feedback from such passive objects can be customized by changing their shape and structure but cannot be changed dynamically. Therefore, we propose a simple TUI that can provide dynamic haptic feedback on a touch device. We use an electromagnet embedded in the tangible object and a magnetic sheet fixed on the back of a touch device. An electric current flowing through the electromagnet and the customizable magnetic pattern printed on the magnetic sheet together produce magnetic interference. The magnetic interference caused by these magnetic objects is actively generated during interaction with the touch device to provide dynamic haptic feedback of both bumps and vibrations.
