We present a key-policy attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme for circuits based on the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption whose key size is independent of the circuit depth. Our result constitutes the first improvement for ABE for circuits from LWE in almost a decade, given by Gorbunov, Vaikuntanathan, and Wee (STOC 2013) and Boneh, et al. (EUROCRYPT 2014) â€“ we reduce the key size in the latter from poly(depth $,\lambda)$ to poly $(\lambda)$. The starting point of our construction is a recent ABE scheme of Li, Lin, and Luo (TCC 2022), which achieves poly $(\lambda)$ key size but requires pairings and generic bilinear groups in addition to LWE; we introduce new lattice techniques to eliminate the additional requirements.
