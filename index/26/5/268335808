This paper examines whether undergraduate students perform better and experience lower cognitive load when programming in Algot, a visual programming language that supports programming by demonstration, than in the textual programming language Python. We recruited 38 first-semester computer science university students who had received prior instruction in the programming language Python but were unfamiliar with Algot. Participants reviewed a 12-minute video tutorial about Algot and performed the same programming tasks in Python and Algot. We graded student submissions, estimated cognitive load through physiological measures and a validated post-test survey, and evaluated free-form feedback. Our results indicated that students experienced lower negative (extraneous and intrinsic) and higher positive (germane) cognitive load when programming in Algot. Additionally, students programming in Algot scored an average grade of 5.8 out of 10, compared to an average grade of 3.4 when using Python for the same tasks, and according to the free-form feedback, Algot is perceived as well-designed and easy to learn.
