We develop several quasi-polynomial-time deterministic algorithms for approximating the fraction of truth assignments that satisfy a disjunctive normal form formula. The most efficient algorithm computes for a given DNF formulaF onn variables withm clauses and e > 0 an estimateY such that ¦Pr[F] −Y¦≤e in time which is\((m\log (n))^{\exp (O(\sqrt {\log \log (m)} ))}\), for any constante. Although the algorithms themselves are deterministic, their analysis is probabilistic and uses the notion of limited independence between random variables.
