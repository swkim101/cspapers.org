With 30 billion RFID tags sold worldwide in 2021, a common basic functionality needed by RFID-enabled applications is cardinality estimation --- to quickly estimate the number of distinct tags in an RFID system. Although many advanced solutions have been proposed over the past decade, they suffer from one major limitation in practical use: they need to either modify the existing RFID standard or obtain MAC-layer information, both of which however cannot be supported by commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. In this paper, we revisit the counting problem and propose a novel counting scheme called average time duration based counter (ATD) that quickly estimates the number of distinct tags in a standards-compliant manner. Compared with existing work, the competitive advantage of ATD is that it can be directly deployed on a COTS RFID system, with no need for any hardware modifications. In ATD, we found a new and measurable indicator --- the time duration between two adjacent singleton slots, which depends on the number of tags. Following this observation, we derive the theoretical relationship between the time indicator and the number of tags and then give the proof of the estimation as well as its parameter settings. Additionally, we propose a flag-flipping solution to address the overlapping problem in the multi-reader case. We implement ATD in a COTS RFID system with 1000 tags. Experimental results show that ATD is 4.2Ã— faster than the baseline of tag inventory; the performance gain will be further increased in a larger RFID system.
