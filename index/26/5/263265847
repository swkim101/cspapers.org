LoRaWAN is a wireless technology that enables high-density deployments of IoT devices. Designed for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), LoRaWAN employs large cells to service a potentially extremely high number of devices. The technology enforces a centralized architecture, directing all data generated by the devices to a single network server for data processing. End-to-end encryption is used to guarantee the confidentiality and security of data. In this demo, we present Edge2LoRa, a system architecture designed to incorporate edge processing in LoRaWAN without compromising the security and confidentiality of data. Edge2LoRa maintains backward compatibility and addresses scalability issues arising from handling large amounts of data sourced from a diverse range of devices. The demo provides evidence of the advantages in terms of reduced latency, lower network bandwidth requirements, higher scalability, and improved security and privacy resulting from the application of the Edge processing paradigm to LoRaWAN.
