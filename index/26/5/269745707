Virtual reality (VR) objects react dynamically to users’ touch interactions in real-time. However, experiencing changes in weight through the haptic sense remains challenging with consumer VR controllers due to their limited vibrotactile feedback. While prior works successfully applied pseudo-haptics to perceive absolute weight by manipulating the control-display (C/D) ratio, we continuously adjusted the C/D ratio to mimic weight changes. Vibrotactile feedback additionally emphasises the modulation in the virtual object’s physicality. In a study (N=18), we compared our multimodal technique with pseudo-haptics alone and a baseline condition to assess participants’ experiences of weight changes. Our findings demonstrate that participants perceived varying degrees of weight change when the C/D ratio was adjusted, validating its effectiveness for simulating dynamic weight in VR. However, the additional vibrotactile feedback did not improve weight change perception. This work extends the understanding of designing haptic experiences for lightweight VR systems by leveraging perceptual mechanisms.
