An information systems major is presented as a second offering by a computer science department. The rationale for the degree program is based upon the demands of industry for graduates skilled in database and information systems. Courses in COBOL, business data processing, database management, and systems analysis are included in the information systems curriculum to prepare the student for employment in the business systems area. The contents of the courses in the information systems core curriculum at Kansas State University are presented as an example of an implemented degree program. In addition, the information systems curriculum is analyzed in terms of its differences with the Curriculum 78 computer science curriculum and of the resources required for its implementation.
