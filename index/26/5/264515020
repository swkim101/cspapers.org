Manual crafts typically involve action-oriented workflows, wherein the craftsperson performs a series of repeated actions to create beautiful intricate artifacts. Despite working with similar materials, digital fabrication workflows often implement methods that differ fundamentally from manual ones. In my dissertation work, I aim to develop action-oriented digital fabrication systems that implement abstractions derived from craft domain-expert knowledge. I theorize that action-oriented systems have the potential to (1) support the integration of computational tools with manual practices, (2) enable complex design tasks that would be challenging to achieve through other means, and (3) leverage the unique properties of materials through fine control over machine toolpath. To investigate this theory, I developed three digital fabrication systems, which I evaluated by producing various artifacts. Additionally, I propose analyzing my work and HCI system research in general through the lenses of three theoretical frameworks that reflect on materiality, i.e. new materialism, indigenous epistemologies, and post-colonial theory on skill mastery. I believe this analysis can offer alternative perspectives that promote a more inclusive understanding of the relationship between humans, materials, and technology in the context of digital fabrication.
