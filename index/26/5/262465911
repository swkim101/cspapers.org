Uncertain, unpredictable, real-time, and lifelong evolution causes operational failures in intelligent software systems, leading to significant damages, safety and security hazards, and tragedies. To fully unleash such systems' potential and facilitate their wider adoption, ensuring the trustworthiness of their decision-making under uncertainty is the prime challenge. To overcome this challenge, an intelligent software system and its operating environment should be continuously monitored, tested, and refined during its lifetime operation. Existing technologies, such as digital twins, can enable continuous synchronisation with such systems to reflect their most up-to-date states. Such representations are often in the form of prior-knowledge-based and machine-learning models, together called ‘model universe’. In this paper, we present our vision of combining techniques from software engineering, evolutionary computation, and machine learning to support the model universe evolution.
