This paper presents an experimental study of water-to-air optical camera communication (OCC) in the presence of wavy surface conditions. It evaluates the system performance in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), considering various camera exposure times and regions of interest (ROI) in captured images. The results reveal a noticeable reduction in the SNR due to the presence of surface waves. However, the system performance is improved by considering the average value of several illuminated pixels produced by the point spread function as the ROI. Furthermore, the statistical characteristics of the received optical signals in the presence of surface waves are assessed.
