Most of the recent works on post-hoc example-based eXplainable AI (XAI) methods revolves around employing counterfactual explanations to provide justification of the predictions made by AI systems. Counterfactuals show what changes to the input-features change the output decision. However, a lesser-known, special-case of the counterfacual is the semi-factual, which provide explanations about what changes to the input-features do not change the output decision. Semi-factuals are potentially as useful as counterfactuals but have received little attention in the XAI literature. My doctoral research aims to establish a comprehensive framework for the use of semi-factuals in XAI by developing novel methods for their computation, supported by user tests.
