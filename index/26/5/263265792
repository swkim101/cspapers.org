We present a systems approach for tracking of mobile systems in an avalanche scenario using an ultra-wideband (UWB)-based ranging and localization system. UWB-based positioning is particularly challenging in outdoor scenarios covering large distances in complex topography. In the long-term, we are interested in tracking the motion of snow avalanches; particularly their inner dynamics are still unknown since they remain hidden for most observation approaches. Our system model considers multiple anchors distributed with inter-node distances in the order of a few hundred meters. Mobile nodes, which move with the avalanche in the field, are tracked via UWB time-of-flight measurements and further supported by inertial measurement units. Our system further integrates LoRa and IEEE 802.11 mesh for configuration and management, with UWB for measurement and reporting. First measurement results in the field show good accuracy and confirm the design choice.
