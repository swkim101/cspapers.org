With the 5G commercial deployments rapidly proceeding, operating mobile networks efficiently has become a great challenge. Self-organizing networks have been proposed to focus on automatically monitoring, analyzing and optimizing networks. Regarding the growing scale and complexity, 5G self-organizing networks confront the challenge to handle the massive data. Therefore, AI models are urgently needed to enable end-to-end network automation. In this demonstration, benefiting from the open data interfaces of the standardized NWDAF within the 5GC network, we implement a containerized network data analytic framework embedding Docker-based AI model containers into 5G networks. Furthermore, we simulate a use case automatically monitoring and optimizing user-level QoE in real time and simulation results are presented.
