In this paper, we present a novel intelligent management system (IMS) for smart retail environments that integrates various components to optimize user experience, energy efficiency, and seamless connectivity. The proposed architecture incorporates an Intelligent Handover Controller, an Energy Harvesting Module, Adaptive Resource Management, Edge Tracking and Localization. Preliminary testbed results show promising performance in maintaining seamless handovers between VLC and WiFi links, as well as accurate tracking of user mobility based on CSI. This advanced architecture offers the potential for significant improvements in smart retail operations by providing uninterrupted connectivity, targeted marketing, optimized store layouts, and enhanced user experiences.
