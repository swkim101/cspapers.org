In this paper, we demonstrate PassiveLiFi, a battery-free system that works at the intersection of Light-Fidelity (LiFi) and Radio-Frequency (RF) backscatter technologies to enable long-range and ultra-low power wireless communications. We show how the PassiveLiFi tag can transmit real measured data through an interactive demo, and we display the received data in a customized graphical user interface. Our demo shows the suitability of PassiveLiFi for implementing real IoT applications, such as monitoring systems for smart agrifood facilities (i.e., greenhouses and vertical farms).
