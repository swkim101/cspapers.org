This paper describes our efforts to integrate software accessibility into the CS1 curriculum. Accessibility is an important aspect of modern software systems for both legal and ethical reasons. The acceptance of Java as language for CS1 gives us the opportunity to teach accessibility from the beginning, since Java Accessibility is simple and integrated into Swing components. We present simple guidelines on how to incorporate Accessibility into a Java based CS1, and describe programming projects that incorporate accessibility.
