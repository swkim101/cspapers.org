Chandelier is a mid-air tangible interface where a user is surrounded in the center by 120 pendants that levitate independently and orbit in 5 concentric circumferences, where each pendant is touch-enabled and color-changeable by default. We explore interactions with Chandelier such as change blindness and repurposing formations from immersive experiences to mitigate the limitation of the hardware systems. We discuss the extent of Surrounding Mid-Air interactions in tangible interfaces and the design factors that could be brought into experiences of future levitation interfaces.
