In-time disease assessment is essential to better customize the medication scheme and improve the quality of life for chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). Toward the inconvenience problem in current clinical assessment practice, mobile sensing solutions based on detecting Parkinson's vocal changes are proposed. However, current solutions either can only achieve binary disease detection task or require patients to perform specific speaking tasks, which is not effective and practical for disease stage assessment in daily scenario. Moreover, most of existing solutions do not take speech privacy into consideration. In this work, we present PDAssess, a free speech-based daily assessment system that can perform 4-stage Parkinson's disease assessment in a privacy-preserving manner. We observe that current solutions did not fully leverage the rich information embedded in free speech due to the linguistic content variations, and therefore leverage a pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to achieve a content variation-aware feature-extraction. In order to distinguish subtle stage-wise differences, we design a novel attention-based neural network architecture with a customized loss function for disease assessment task. Towards the potential privacy leakage problem, we design a Split Learning-based framework with pseudo-labeling and local domain adversarial training to better preserve speech content privacy. We collaborate with a medical center and evaluate the performance of PDAssess on real-world speech data collected from 50 PD subjects and 50 healthy subjects. The evaluation result shows that PDAssess can perform 4-stage PD assessment with an average person-wise F1 score of 89.1% and voice sample-wise F1 score of 75.1%.
