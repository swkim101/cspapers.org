Pedagogical question-answering (QA) systems have been utilized for providing individual support in online learning courses. However, existing systems often neglect the education practice of guiding and encouraging students to think of relevant questions for deeper and more comprehensive learning. To address this gap, we introduce Knowledge Compass, an interactive QA system. The system can recommend follow-up questions that provide potential further explorations of the topics students ask about. Additionally, the system applies a course outline visualization and a set of interactive features for students to track the relationship between their questions and the course content.
