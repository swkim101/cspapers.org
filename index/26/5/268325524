The overturn of Roe v. Wade has taken away the constitutional right to abortion. Prior work shows that period-tracking apps’ data practices can be used to detect pregnancy and abortion, hence putting women at risk of being prosecuted. It is unclear how much women know about the privacy practices of such apps and how concerned they are after the overturn. Such knowledge is critical to designing effective strategies for stakeholders to enhance women’s reproductive privacy. We conducted an online 183-participant vignette survey with US women from states with diverse policies on abortion. Participants were significantly concerned about the privacy practices of the period-tracking apps, such as data access by law enforcement and third parties. However, participants felt uninformed and powerless about risk mitigation practices. We provide several recommendations to enhance women’s privacy awareness toward their period-tracking practices.
