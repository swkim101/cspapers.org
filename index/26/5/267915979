If XML is to play the critical role of the lingua franca for Internet data interchange that many predict, it is necessary to start designing and adopting benchmarks allowing the comparative performance analysis of the tools being developed and proposed. The effectiveness of existing XML query languages has been studied by many, with a focus on the comparison of linguistic features, implicitly reflecting the fact that most XML tools exist only on paper. In this paper, with a focus on efficiency and concreteness, we propose a pragmatic first step toward the systematic benchmarking of XML query processing platforms with an initial focus on the data (versus document) point of view. We propose XOO7, an XML version of the OO7 benchmark. We discuss the applicability of XOO7, its strengths, limitations and the extensions we are considering. We illustrate its use by presenting and discussing the performance comparison against XOO7 of three different query processing platforms for XML.
