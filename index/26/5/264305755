In the financial domain, conducting entity-level sentiment analysis is crucial for accurately assessing the sentiment directed toward a specific financial entity. To our knowledge, no publicly available dataset currently exists for this purpose. In this work, we introduce an entity-level sentiment classification dataset, called \textbf{FinEntity}, that annotates financial entity spans and their sentiment (positive, neutral, and negative) in financial news. We document the dataset construction process in the paper. Additionally, we benchmark several pre-trained models (BERT, FinBERT, etc.) and ChatGPT on entity-level sentiment classification. In a case study, we demonstrate the practical utility of using FinEntity in monitoring cryptocurrency markets. The data and code of FinEntity is available at \url{https://github.com/yixuantt/FinEntity}
