Modularity plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of complex systems. While end-to-end text spotting efficiently mitigates the issues of error accumulation and sub-optimal performance seen in traditional two-step methodologies, the two-step methods continue to be favored in many competitions and practical settings due to their superior modularity. In this paper, we introduce Bridging Text Spotting, a novel approach that resolves the error accumulation and suboptimal performance issues in two-step methods while retaining modularity. To achieve this, we adopt a well-trained detector and recognizer that are developed and trained independently and then lock their parameters to preserve their already acquired capabilities. Subsequently, we introduce a Bridge that connects the locked detector and recognizer through a zero-initialized neural network. This zero-initialized neural network, initialized with weights set to zeros, ensures seamless integration of the large receptive field features in detection into the locked recognizer. Further-more, since the fixed detector and recognizer cannot naturally acquire end-to-end optimization features, we adopt the Adapter to facilitate their efficient learning of these features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments: Connecting the latest detector and recognizer through Bridging Text Spotting, we achieved an accuracy of 83.3% on Total-Text, 69.8% on CTW1500, and 89.5% on ICDAR 2015.
