In this paper, we present a novel Amplitude-Modulated Stochastic Perturbation and Vortex Convolutional Network, AMSP-UOD, designed for underwater object detection. AMSP-UOD specifically addresses the impact of non-ideal imaging factors on detection accuracy in complex underwater environments. To mitigate the influence of noise on object detection performance, we propose AMSP Vortex Convolution (AMSP-VConv) to disrupt the noise distribution, enhance feature extraction capabilities, effectively reduce parameters, and improve network robustness. We design the Feature Association Decoupling Cross Stage Partial (FAD-CSP) module, which strengthens the association of long and short range features, improving the network performance in complex underwater environments. Additionally, our sophisticated post-processing method, based on non-maximum suppression with aspect-ratio similarity thresholds, optimizes detection in dense scenes, such as waterweed and schools of fish, improving object detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the URPC and RUOD datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and noise immunity. AMSP-UOD proposes an innovative solution with the potential for real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoujingchun03/AMSP-UOD.
