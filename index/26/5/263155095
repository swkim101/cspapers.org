The recent development of a new kind of public transportation system relies on a particular double-steering kinematic structure enhancing maneuverability in cluttered environments such as downtown areas. We call bi-steerable car a vehicle showing this kind of kinematics. We present experimental results, from map-building to trajectory tracking, aiming at validating the theoretical considerations obtained recently for the general bi-steerable system. These results are a first step towards the motion autonomy of this kind of transportation system.
