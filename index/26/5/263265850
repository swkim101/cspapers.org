Toxic gases inhalation is the most common cause of death in fire scenes, which can make people unconscious and unable to save themselves. Hence, discovering the unconscious victims is crucial to improve their survival rate. In this paper, we propose RF-Search, a victim searching system with RF device mounted on the drone. The challenge mainly comes from the fact that drone motion would overwhelm the subtle vital signs utilized for victim identification. To resolve this problem, we have noted that the physical signature of drone motion has been encoded in stationary object reflections. Leveraging this unique physical signature, we propose to identify the unconscious victim through the spatio-temporal correlation between signals reflected from the victim and the surrounding stationary objects. To extract respiration information of the victim, we propose a motion segmentation module and a motion compensation module to suppress the signal variation caused by drone movement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our system could achieve an accuracy of 92.5% for victim identification.
