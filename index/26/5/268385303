Social media platforms have become one of the main channels where people disseminate and acquire information, of which the reliability is severely threatened by rumors widespread in the network. Existing approaches such as suspending users or broadcasting real information to combat rumors are either with high cost or disturbing users. In this paper, we introduce a novel rumor mitigation paradigm, where only a minimal set of links in the social network are intervened to decelerate the propagation of rumors, countering misinformation with low business cost and user awareness. A knowledge-informed agent embodying rumor propagation mechanisms is developed, which intervenes the social network with a graph neural network for capturing information flow in the social media platforms and a policy network for selecting links. Experiments on real social media platforms demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively alleviate the influence of rumors, substantially reducing the affected populations by over 25%.
