Live commerce is the act of selling products online through live streaming. The customer’s diverse demands for online products introduce more challenges to Livestreaming Product Recognition. Previous works have primarily focused on fashion clothing data or utilize single-modal input, which does not reflect the real-world scenario where multimodal data from various categories are present. In this paper, we present LPR4M, a large-scale multimodal dataset that covers 34 categories, comprises 3 modalities (image, video, and text), and is 50× larger than the largest publicly available dataset. LPR4M contains diverse videos and noise modality pairs while exhibiting a long-tailed distribution, resembling real-world problems. Moreover, a cRoss-vIew semantiC alignmEnt (RICE) model is proposed to learn discriminative instance features from the image and video views of the products. This is achieved through instance-level contrastive learning and cross-view patch-level feature propagation. A novel Patch Feature Reconstruction loss is proposed to penalize the semantic misalignment between cross-view patches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RICE and provide insights into the importance of dataset diversity and expressivity.
