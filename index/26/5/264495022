This paper presents a framework for a theory of granularity, which is seen as a means of constructing simple theories out of more complex ones. A transitive indistinguishability relation can be defined by means of a set of relevant predicates, allowing simplification of a theory of complex phenomena into computationally tractable local theories, or granularities. Nontransitive indistinguishability relations can be characterized in terms of relevant partial predicates, and idealization allows simplification into tractable local theories. Various local theories must be linked with each other by means of articulation axioms, to allow shifts of perspective. Such a treatment of granularity must be built into the very foundation of the reasoning processes of intelligent agents in a complex world.
