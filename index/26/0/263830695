We present a novel 3D odometry method that recovers the full motion of a vehicle only from a Doppler-capable range sensor. It leverages the radial velocities measured from the scene, estimating the sensor’s velocity from a single scan. The vehicle’s 3D motion, defined by its linear and angular velocities, is calculated taking into consideration its kinematic model which provides a constraint between the velocity measured at the sensor frame and the vehicle frame.Experiments carried out prove the viability of our single-sensor method compared to mounting an additional IMU. Our method provides a more reliable translation of the sensor, compared to the errors linked to IMUs due to noise and biases. Its short-term accuracy and fast operation (∼5ms) make it a proper candidate to supply the initialization to more complex localization algorithms or mapping pipelines. Not only does it reduce the error of the mapper, but it does so at a comparable level of accuracy as an IMU would. All without the need to mount and calibrate an extra sensor on the vehicle.
