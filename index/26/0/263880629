Online consumer data presents new opportunities for measuring the effects of advertising. We combine search query data with the television commercial schedule for the 2011 Super Bowl to measure the causal impact of TV advertising on consumer search behavior. Examining 46 Super Bowl commercials, we generally find large spikes in search behavior related to the advertiser or product within 15 seconds following the conclusion of the TV commercial. We present results for four categories of Super Bowl advertisers: movies, online services, cars, and other consumer goods. We also consider the economic and statistical feasibility of scaling this analysis to use search data to measure the impact of other TV commercials.
