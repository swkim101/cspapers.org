Amid corrosion degradation of metallic structures causing expenses nearing 3 trillion or 4% of the GDP annually along with major safety risks, the adoption of AI technologies for accelerating the materials science life-cycle for developing materials with better corrosive properties is paramount. While initial machine learning models for corrosion assessment are being proposed in the literature, their incorporation into end-to-end tools for field experimentation by corrosion scientists remains largely unexplored. To fill this void, our university data science team in collaboration with the materials science unit at the Army Research Lab have jointly developed MOSS, an innovative AI-based digital platform to support material science corrosion research. MOSS features user-friendly iPadOS app for in-field corrosion progression data collection, deep-learning corrosion assessor, robust data repository system for long-term experimental data modeling, and visual analytics web portal for material science research. In this demonstration, we showcase the key innovations of the MOSS platform via use cases supporting the corrosion exploration processes, with the promise of accelerating the discovery of new materials.
