Trust between humans and AI in the context of decision-making has acquired an important role in public policy, research and industry. In this context, Human-AI Trust has often been tackled from the lens of cognitive science and psychology, but lacks insights from the stakeholders involved. In this paper, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 7 AI practitioners and 7 decision subjects from various decision domains. We found that 1) interviewees identified the prerequisites for the existence of trust and distinguish trust from trustworthiness, reliance, and compliance; 2) trust in AI-integrated systems is strongly influenced by other human actors, more than the systemâ€™s features; 3) the role of Human-AI trust factors is stakeholder-dependent. These results provide clues for the design of Human-AI interactions in which trust plays a major role, as well as outline new research directions in Human-AI Trust.
