In recent years, quantum neural network (QNN) based on quantum computing has attracted attention due to its potential for computation-acceleration and parallelism. However, the intrinsic limitations of QNN, where the output (i.e., observables) can only be obtained through a measurement process, pose scalability challenges. Motivated by this, this paper aims to address the scalability challenges by incorporating Pauli-Z measurement and Basis measurement. In conventional frameworks, QNN typically relies on classical fully connected networks (FCNs) or increases the number of qubits to achieve large output dimensions. However, by leveraging our proposed framework, this paper successfully expands the output dimensions to an exponential scale, surpassing the limitations imposed by the limited number of qubits without relying on FCNs. Through extensive experiments, this paper demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms existing QNN frameworks in multi-class classification tasks that require numerous output dimensions.
