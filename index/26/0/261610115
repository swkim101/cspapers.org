This paper offers a simple and lossless compression method for compression of medical images. Method is based on wavelet decomposition of the medical images followed by the correlation analysis of coefficients. The correlation analyses are the basis of prediction equation for each sub band. Predictor variable selection is performed through coefficient graphic method to avoid multicollinearity problem and to achieve high prediction accuracy and compression rate. The method is applied on MRI and CT images. Results show that the proposed approach gives a high compression rate for MRI and CT images comparing with state of the art methods.
