The sequential recommendation system has been widely studied for its promising effectiveness in capturing dynamic preferences buried in users' sequential behaviors. Despite the considerable achievements, existing methods usually focus on intra-sequence modeling while overlooking exploiting global collaborative information by inter-sequence modeling, resulting in inferior recommendation performance. Therefore, previous works attempt to tackle this problem with a global collaborative item graph constructed by pre-defined rules. However, these methods neglect two crucial properties when capturing global collaborative information, i.e., adaptiveness and personalization, yielding sub-optimal user representations. To this end, we propose a graph-driven framework, named Adaptive and Personalized Graph Learning for Sequential Recommendation (APGL4SR), that incorporates adaptive and personalized global collaborative information into sequential recommendation systems. Specifically, we first learn an adaptive global graph among all items and capture global collaborative information with it in a self-supervised fashion, whose computational burden can be further alleviated by the proposed SVD-based accelerator. Furthermore, based on the graph, we propose to extract and utilize personalized item correlations in the form of relative positional encoding, which is a highly compatible manner of personalizing the utilization of global collaborative information. Finally, the entire framework is optimized in a multi-task learning paradigm, thus each part of APGL4SR can be mutually reinforced. As a generic framework, APGL4SR can not only outperform other baselines with significant margins, but also exhibit promising versatility, the ability to learn a meaningful global collaborative graph, and the ability to alleviate the dimensional collapse issue of item embeddings.
