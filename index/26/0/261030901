Algebraic techniques have had an important impact on graph algorithms so far. Porting them, e.g., the matrix inverse, into the dynamic regime improved best-known bounds for various dynamic graph problems. In this paper, we develop new algorithms for another cornerstone algebraic primitive, the Frobenius normal form (FNF). We apply our developments to dynamic and fault-tolerant exact distance oracle problems on directed graphs.For generic matrices A over a finite field accompanied by an FNF, we show (1) an efficient data structure for querying submatrices of the first $k \geq 1$ powers of A, and (2) a near-optimal algorithm updating the FNF explicitly under rank-1 updates.By representing an unweighted digraph using a generic matrix over a sufficiently large field (obtained by random sampling) and leveraging the developed FNF toolbox, we obtain:•a conditionally optimal distance sensitivity oracle (DSO) in the case of single-edge or single-vertex failures, providing a partial answer to the open question of Gu and Ren [ICALP 2021],•a multiple-failures DSO improving upon the state of the art (vd. Brand and Saranurak [FOCS 2019]) wrt. both preprocessing and query time,•improved dynamic distance oracles in the case of single-edge updates,•a dynamic distance oracle supporting vertex updates, i.e., changing all edges incident to a single vertex, in $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{2}\right)$ worst-case time and distance queries in $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time.
