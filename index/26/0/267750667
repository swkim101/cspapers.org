Invariance learning algorithms that conditionally filter out domain-specific random variables as distractors, do so based only on the data semantics, and not the target domain under evaluation. We show that a provably optimal and sample-efficient way of learning conditional invariances is by relaxing the invariance criterion to be non-commutatively directed towards the target domain. Under domain asymmetry, i.e., when the target domain contains semantically relevant information absent in the source, the risk of the encoder $\varphi^*$ that is optimal on average across domains is strictly lower-bounded by the risk of the target-specific optimal encoder $\Phi^*_\tau$. We prove that non-commutativity steers the optimization towards $\Phi^*_\tau$ instead of $\varphi^*$, bringing the $\mathcal{H}$-divergence between domains down to zero, leading to a stricter bound on the target risk. Both our theory and experiments demonstrate that non-commutative invariance (NCI) can leverage source domain samples to meet the sample complexity needs of learning $\Phi^*_\tau$, surpassing SOTA invariance learning algorithms for domain adaptation, at times by over $2\%$, approaching the performance of an oracle.
