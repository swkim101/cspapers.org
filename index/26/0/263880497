This paper introduces a Biologically Inspired Dead-beat (BID) controller for bipedal running in 3D. The controller runs in real-time, is extremely robust against perturbations and allows for versatile running patterns. It is based on the encoding of leg forces and CoM trajectories during stance as polynomial splines, allowing for intuitive and primarily analytical controller design. The performance of the control framework is tested in various simulations for a bipedal point-mass model.
