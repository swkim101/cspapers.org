The success of large-scale recommender systems hinges upon their ability to deliver accurate and timely recommendations to a diverse user base. At Glance, we deliver snackable personalized content to the lock screens of 200M smartphones. In this context, continuous monitoring is paramount as it safeguards data integrity, detects drifts, addresses evolving user preferences, optimizes system downtime, and ultimately augments the system's effectiveness and user satisfaction. In this talk, we delve into Vigil, a set of monitoring practices developed to provide comprehensive end-to-end monitoring of recommender systems at Glance. These practices revolve around three key pillars: mitigating developer fatigue, ensuring precise predictions, and establishing a centralized monitoring framework. By adopting these practices, we have observed a 30% reduction in compute cost, a 26% drop in downtime, and a surge in developer productivity demonstrated by a 45% decrease in turnaround time.
