The increasing accessibility of legal corpora and databases create opportunities to develop data-driven techniques and advanced tools that can facilitate a variety of tasks in the legal domain, such as legal search and research, legal document review and summary, legal contract drafting, and legal outcome prediction. Compared with other application domains, the legal domain is characterized by the huge scale of natural language text data, the high complexity of specialist knowledge, and the critical importance of ethical considerations. The MLLD workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share the latest research findings and innovative approaches in employing data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, and knowledge management techniques to transform the legal sector. Building upon the previous successes, the third edition of the MLLD workshop will emphasize the exploration of new research opportunities brought about by recent rapid advances in Large Language Models and Generative AI. We encourage submissions that intersect computer science and law, from both academia and industry, embodying the interdisciplinary spirit of CIKM.
