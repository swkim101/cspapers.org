We are witnessing significant breakthroughs in the tech-nology for generating 3D objects from text. Existing approaches either leverage large text-to-image models to optimize a 3D representation or train 3D generators on object-centric datasets. Generating entire scenes, however, remains very challenging as a scene contains multiple 3D objects, diverse and scattered. In this work, we introduce SceneWiz3D - a novel approach to synthesize high-fidelity 3D scenes from text. We marry the locality of objects with globality of scenes by introducing a hybrid 3D representation - explicit for objects and implicit for scenes. Remarkably, an object, being represented explicitly, can be either generated from text using conventional text-to-3D approaches, or provided by users. To configure the layout of the scene and automatically place objects, we apply the Particle Swarm Optimization technique during the optimization process. Furthermore, it is difficult for certain parts of the scene (e.g., corners, occlusion) to receive multi-view supervision, leading to inferior geometry. We incor-porate an RGBD panorama diffusion model to mitigate it, resulting in high-quality geometry. Extensive evaluation supports that our approach achieves superior quality over previous approaches, enabling the generation of detailed and view-consistent 3D scenes.
