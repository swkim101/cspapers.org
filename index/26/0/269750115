Healthcare providers’ implicit bias, based on patients’ physical characteristics and perceived identities, negatively impacts healthcare access, care quality, and outcomes. Feedback tools are needed to help providers identify and learn from their biases. To incorporate providers’ perspectives on the most effective ways to present such feedback, we conducted semi-structured design critique sessions with 24 primary care providers. We found that providers seek feedback designed with transparent metrics indicating the quality of their communication with a patient and trends in communication patterns across visits. Based on these metrics and trends, providers want this feedback presented in a dashboard paired with actionable, personalized tips about how to improve their communication behaviors. Our study provides new insights for interactive systems to help mitigate the impact of implicit biases in patient-provider communication. New systems that build upon these insights could support providers in making healthcare more equitable, particularly for patients from marginalized communities.
