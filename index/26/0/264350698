Recently, cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been widely studied in both research and industry since it can alleviate a long-standing challenge of traditional recommendation methods, i.e., data sparsity issue, by transferring the information from a relatively richer domain (termed source domain) to a sparser domain (termed target domain). To our best knowledge, most (if not all) existing CDR methods focus on transferring either the similar content information or the user preferences embedding from the source domain to the target domain. However, they fail to improve the recommendation performance in real-world recommendation scenarios where the items in the source domain are totally different from those in the target domain in terms of attributes. To solve the above issues, we analyzed the historical interactions of users from different domains in the WeChat platform, and found that if two users have similar interests (interactions) in one domain, they are very likely to have similar interests in another domain even though the items of these two domains are totally different in terms of attributes. Based on this observation, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Dual Interests-Aligned Graph Auto-Encoders (DIAGAE) by utilizing the inter-domain interest alignment of users. Besides, our proposed model DIAGAE also leverages graph decoding objectives to align intra-domain user interests, which makes the representation of two users who have similar interests in a single domain closer. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our model DIAGAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both public benchmark datasets and online A/B tests in WeChat live-stream recommendation scenario. Our model DIAGAE now serves the major online traffic in WeChat live-streaming recommendation scenario.
