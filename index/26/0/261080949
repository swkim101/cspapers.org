Neural scene representations have achieved great success in parameterizing and reconstructing images, but current state of the art models are not optimized with the preservation of physical quantities in mind. While current architectures can reconstruct color images correctly, they create artifacts when trying to fit maps of polar quantities. We propose polarimetric coordinate networks (pCON), a new model architecture for neural scene representations aimed at preserving polarimetric information while accurately parameterizing the scene. Our model removes artifacts created by current coordinate network architectures when reconstructing three polarimetric quantities of interest.
