Neural Processes (NPs) are a family of supervised density estimators devoted to probabilistic function approximation with meta-learning. Despite extensive research on the subject, the absence of a unified framework for NPs leads to varied architectural solutions across diverse studies. This non-consensus poses challenges to reproducing and benchmarking different NPs. Moreover, existing codebases mainly prioritize generative density estimation, yet rarely consider expanding the capability of NPs to self-supervised representation learning, which however has gained growing importance in data mining applications. To this end, we present NP-SSL, a modular and configurable framework with built-in support, requiring minimal effort to 1) implement classical NPs architectures; 2) customize specific components; 3) integrate hybrid training scheme (e.g., contrastive); and 4) extend NPs to act as a self-supervised learning toolkit, producing latent representations of data, and facilitating diverse downstream predictive tasks. To illustrate, we discuss a case study that applies NP-SSL to model time-series data. We interpret that NP-SSL can handle different predictive tasks such as imputation and forecasting, by a simple switch in data samplings, without significant change to the underlying structure. We hope this study can reduce the workload of future research on leveraging NPs to tackle more a broader range of real-world data mining applications.
