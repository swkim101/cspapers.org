This paper tackles precision marketing in financial technology, focusing on the accurate prediction of potential customers' interest in specific financial products amidst extreme class imbalance and a significant volume of unlabeled data. We propose the innovative Semi-supervised Curriculum Ensemble (SSCE) framework, which integrates curriculum pseudo-labeling and balanced bagging with tree-based models. This novel approach enables the effective utilization of high-confidence predicted instances from unlabeled data and mitigates the impact of extreme class imbalance. Experiments conducted on a large-scale real-world banking dataset, featuring five financial products, demonstrate that the SSCE consistently outperforms existing methods, thereby promising significant advances in the domain of financial precision marketing.
