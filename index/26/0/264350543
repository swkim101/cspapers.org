With the rapid development of web services, social media has been a prevalent and readily way for people to express themselves and share their daily lives. Consequently, numerous user-generated content is accumulated on social media platforms. These data usually contain rich information and knowledge for users, which is a viable source for user data mining. As one of the prevalent techniques in user data mining, mining personalized topics and discovering user preferences from social media data attract much interest in academic and industrial communities. The emerging Neural Topic Models(NTMs) have recently shown leading performance and scalability by employing neural networks. However, most existing NTMs usually model topics simply from observed document token information and do not explicitly take user preferences into the generative process, which inevitably fails to model personalized topics. To address this issue, we introduce Neural Personalized Topic Model(NPTM), a novel NTM that can discover personalized topics and user preferences. NPTM introduces a novel hybrid generative process for combining user preferences and contextualized document codes in modeling personalized topics. A transformer-based document encoder to obtain contextualized document codes. For user preference modeling, NPTM regards user-related information as trainable user embeddings, further determining user preferences over the topics. Following the proposed hybrid generative process, we present a module-wise asynchronous optimization strategy to get coherent topics and user preferences. Then, we apply our model to two challenging real-world social media post collections and compare them against several baseline methods to verify our contributions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
