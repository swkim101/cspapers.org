In this paper, we initiate the study of Euclidean clustering with Distance-based privacy. Distance-based privacy is motivated by the fact that it is often only needed to protect the privacy of exact, rather than approximate, locations. We provide constant-approximate algorithms for k -means and k -median clustering, with additive error depending only on the attacker’s precision bound ρ , rather than the radius Λ of the space. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm performs significantly better than previous differentially private clustering algorithms, as well as naive distance-based private clustering baselines
