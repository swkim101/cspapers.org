\beginabstract Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance in graph-based analysis tasks. Despite their remarkable success, the inherent homophilic message-passing mechanism (MP) makes GNNs challenging to generalize to heterophilic graphs. In addition, the MP explicitly exploits the connection relationships between local neighbor nodes making GNNs unable to maintain stable performance in the face of adversarial perturbation attacks. In this paper, we propose a new method to explore graph structure by removing explicit message-passing mechanisms and present a network embedding framework AMCNE with Adaptive Multi-hop Contrast loss (AMCLoss) to address these challenges. AMCNE only relies on a simple autoencoder to obtain node representations for classification and uses elaborate contrastive loss to drive nodes capturing complex structural information on heterophilic graphs. The comprehensive experiments show that AMCNE outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on homophilic and heterophilic graphs and is more robust in the node classification task. \endabstract
