Somewhere in the course of the last two decades a word which conveniently describes our society today, and of this century, has almost dropped out of popular usage. Technology - which Webster defines as “industrial science; the science of systematic knowledge of industrial arts”. Our entire sociological structure is geared to technological advancement - not merely to maintenance of the status quo.
 It was estimated earlier that the approximately 250 men and women in these sessions represent some 1400 years of pure education, largely in mathematics, electronics and other areas directly related to computers - which, in themselves, represent a separate, unique industrial art. Add to these years the aggregate years of experience in the field and the mean of 6 years per man may well double - in a new, young unique industrial art. You represent here, Ladies and Gentlemen, the nucleus of one of the most significant single elements contributing to technological advancement in the world today - the element of knowledgeable computer applications.
