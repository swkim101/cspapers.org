In this paper, we provide an overview of design automation tools and methodology for Monolithic 3D ICs, focusing on the accomplishments in recent years and the gaps that remain to be filled. Monolithic 3D integration is an emerging technology with high 3D interconnect density and performance benefits, but it proposes new challenges for computer-aided design tools. In this paper, we first revisit the current status of design automation tools for Monolithic 3D and highlight the recent developments in tier partitioning, 3D placement and routing, inter-tier via controls, and power and thermal integrity analysis. Then, we discuss the gaps to be met for next-generation system-level heterogeneous Monolithic 3D IC design. Finally, we present our vision for the future of design automation developments for Monolithic 3D ICs.
