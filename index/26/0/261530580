We demonstrate the Misinformation Concierge, a proof-of-concept that provides actionable intelligence on misinformation prevalent in social media. Specifically, it uses language processing and machine learning tools to identify subtopics of discourse and discerns non/misleading posts; presents statistical reports for policy-makers to understand the big picture of prevalent misinformation in a timely manner; and recommends rebuttal messages for specific pieces of misinformation, identified from within the corpus of data - providing means to intervene and counter misinformation promptly.
