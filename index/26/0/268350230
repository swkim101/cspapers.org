Blocks-based programming languages (BBPLs) have proven effective for instructing early learners in programming. Unlike text-based languages, BBPLs eliminate the need to memorize syntax rules by enforcing correct program structure through block assembly. However, the visual nature of BBPLs can pose challenges for children with visual impairments and blindness (VI). Moreover, the existing BBPLs tailored for children with VI are rarely embraced by sighted children due to their limited capabilities. To explore the creation of an inclusive BBPL that can be used by both children with and without VI, we devised a web-based BBPL platform with keyboard accessibility functionalities and personalized audio cues through an incorporated screen reader. Within this platform, called Grid-world, students engage with basic programming concepts, including iteration and selection, through entertaining games and animations-such as navigating a character within a 2D grid space. Notably, Grid-world accommodates children with VI without the need for extra hardware or assistive devices. We conducted two empirical assessments of Grid-world involving participants with and without VI. The observational analysis of participant interaction and survey responses illuminated areas for enhancement. We describe the rationale behind Grid-world's design and accessibility features, incorporating findings from experimental studies, including participants' feedback on the accessibility features.
