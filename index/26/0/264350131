Contributions are essentially the core of every scientific research, highlighting their key values to the academic community. Systems that are capable of identifying the contributions from scientific papers precisely and organizing them into well-structured summaries can facilitate both text processing and human comprehension. In this paper, we present ContributionSum, a dataset consisting of 24K computer science papers with contributions explicitly listed by the authors, which are further classified into different contribution types based on a newly-proposed annotation scheme. In addition, we study the task of generating disentangled contributions that summarize the values of scientific papers into key points. We propose a fine-grained post-training strategy tailored to our task and leverage salient information of different contribution types in the papers. To assess the coherency and coverage of each contribution aspect, we perform summary-level and contribution-level evaluations for our task. Experimental results show that our method improves upon mainstream baselines.
