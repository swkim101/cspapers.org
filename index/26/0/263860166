ShareCam is a robotic pan, tilt, and zoom Web-based camera controlled by simultaneous frame requests from online users. Part I describes the system. This paper, part II, focuses on algorithms. The ShareCam problem is to find a camera frame that optimizes a measure of total user satisfaction. We present a grid-based approximation algorithm: given camera frame requests from n users, and approximation bound /spl epsi/, we analyze the trade of between solution quality and processing speed and prove that the algorithm runs in O(n//spl epsi//sup 3/) time. The algorithm can be distributed to run in O(1//spl epsi//sup 3/) time at each client and in O(n + 1//spl epsi//sup 3/) time at the server. Experiments suggest that performance of the distributed algorithm degrades gracefully as clients fail to complete their part of the computation.
