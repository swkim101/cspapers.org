This paper describes the outcome of an experiment in Computer-Aided Learning (CAL) for Operating Systems using the World-Wide Web (WWW). The purpose of the experiment is to evaluate WWW-based course delivery both in terms of academic performance and in terms of student acceptance. A complete WWW-based offering of an existing third-year university course in Computer Science was produced. Students enrolled in the course were divided into three groups: 1) those taking the course using only the WWW-based resource (no lectures), 2) those taking the course by attending lectures (no access to the WWW-based resource), and 3) those with access to both lectures and the WWW-based resource.Academic results were evaluated and qualitative student impressions were solicited. In general the WWW-only method of course delivery was an equal success compared to the lecture-only delivery, both in terms of academic results and in terms of student acceptance. On average, students in the combined lecture and WWW-based delivery performed better academically than students in the other groups.
