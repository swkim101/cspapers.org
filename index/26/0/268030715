Trending topic diffusion and prediction analysis is an important problem and has been well studied in social networks. Representation learning is an effective way to extract node embeddings, which can help for topic propagation analysis by completing downstream tasks such as link prediction and node classification. In real world, there are often several trending topics or opinion leaders in public opinion space at the same time and they can be regarded as different centers of public opinion. A public opinion field will be formed surrounding every center. These public opinion fields compete for publicâ€™s attention and it will potentially affect the development of public opinion. However, the existing methods do not consider public opinion field effect for trending topics diffusion. In this paper, we introduce three well-known observations about public opinion field effect in media and communication studies, and propose a novel and effective heterogeneous representation learning framework to incorporate public opinion field effect and social circle influence effect. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to consider these effects in representation learning for trending topic diffusion. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the superiority of our model.
