LangXAI is a framework that integrates Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) with advanced vision models to generate textual explanations for visual recognition tasks. Despite XAI advancements, an understanding gap persists for end-users with limited domain knowledge in artificial intelligence and computer vision. LangXAI addresses this by furnishing text-based explanations for classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation model outputs to end-users. Preliminary results demonstrate LangXAI's enhanced plausibility, with high BERTScore across tasks, fostering a more transparent and reliable AI framework on vision tasks for end-users.
