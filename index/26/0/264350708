Extracting users' interests from their behavior, particularly their 1-hop neighbors, has been shown to enhance Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction performance. However, online recommender systems impose strict constraints on the inference time of CTR models, which necessitates pruning or filtering users' 1-hop neighbors to reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, while the graph information of users and items has been proven effective in collaborative filtering models, recursive graph convolution can be computationally costly and expensive to implement. To address these challenges, we propose the Non-Recursive Cluster-scale Graph Interacted (NRCGI) model, which reorganizes graph convolutional networks in a non-recursive and cluster-scale view to enable CTR models to consider deep graph information with low computational cost. NRCGI employs non-recursive cluster-scale graph aggregation, which allows the online recommendation computational complexity to shrink from tens of thousands of items to tens to hundreds of clusters. Additionally, since NRCGI aggregates neighbors in a non-recursive view, each hop of neighbors has a clear physical meaning. NRCGI explicitly constructs meaningful interactions between the hops of neighbors of users and items to fully model users' intent towards the given item. Experimental results demonstrate that NRCGI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three public datasets and one industrial dataset while maintaining efficient inference.
