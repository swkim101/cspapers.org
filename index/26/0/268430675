In this tech demo, we will be presenting the "Smart Greenhouse" project, a transdisciplinary one, incorporating aspects of physical computing, plant science, and data literacy. In this project, students use low-cost sensors and microcontrollers (i.e., Micro:bit) to gather environmental data, with teachers guiding data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. The MakeCode platform is used for coding, which has a block-based interface, aligning with the suggestion of its efficacy in enhancing student learning and interest in coding. Furthermore, the project provides insights into environmental conditions affecting plant health, bridging the gap between computational tasks and real-world applications. For data visualization, the CODAP tool developed by the Concord Consortium is utilized, which features an easier drag-and-drop approach to create graphs. Our demonstration will encompass the collection and visualization of environmental data, coding modifications, and hands-on audience participation. Currently implemented in various educational settings, the project has witnessed teachers' growing confidence in its execution and has shown promise in bolstering students' coding skills. For this demo, participants are encouraged to bring their laptops if they wish to create or modify Micro:bit codes to test with our greenhouse setup.
