Tables are widely used for data storage and presentation due to their high flexibility in layout. The importance of tables as information carriers and the complexity of tabular data understanding attract a great deal of research on large-scale pre-training for tabular data. However, most of the works design models for specific types of tables, such as relational tables and tables with well-structured headers, neglecting tables with complex layouts. In real-world scenarios, there are many such tables beyond their target scope that cannot be well supported. In this paper, we propose GetPt, a unified pre-training architecture for general table representation applicable even to tables with complex structures and layouts. First, we convert a table to a heterogeneous graph with multiple types of edges to represent the layout of the table. Based on the graph, a specially designed transformer is applied to jointly model the semantics and structure of the table. Second, we devise the Alternate Attention Network (AAN) to better model the contextual information across multiple granularities of a table including tokens, cells, and the table. To better support a wide range of downstream tasks, we further employ three pre-training objectives and pre-train the model on a large table dataset. We fine-tune and evaluate GetPt model on two representative tasks, table type classification, and table structure recognition. Experiments show that GetPt outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on these tasks.
