Temporal heterogeneous networks (THNs) investigate the structural interactions and their evolution over time in graphs with multiple types of nodes or edges. Existing THNs describe evolving networks as a sequence of graph snapshots and adopt mechanisms from static heterogeneous networks to capture the spatial-temporal correlation. However, these works are confined to the discrete-time setting and the implementation of stacked mechanisms often introduces a high level of complexity, both conceptually and computationally. Here, we conduct comprehensive examinations and propose STHN, a simplifying THN for continuous-time link prediction. Concretely, to integrate continuous dynamics, we maintain a historical interaction memory for each node. A link encoder that incorporates two components - type encoding and relative time encoding - is introduced to encapsulate implicit heterogeneous characteristics of interaction and extract the most informative temporal information. We further propose to use a patching technique that assists with Transformer feature extractor to support the interaction sequence with long histories. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets empirically demonstrate that STHN outperforms state-of-the-art methods with competitive task accuracy and predictive efficiency on both transductive and inductive settings.
