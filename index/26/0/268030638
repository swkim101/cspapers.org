3D segmentation of nuclei images is a fundamental task for many biological studies. 1 Despite the rapid advances of large-volume 3D imaging acquisition methods and 2 the emergence of sophisticated algorithms to segment the nuclei in recent years, 3 a benchmark with all cells completely annotated is still missing, making it hard 4 to accurately assess and further improve the performance of the algorithms. The 5 existing nuclei segmentation benchmarks either worked on 2D only or annotated 6 a small number of 3D cells, perhaps due to the high cost of 3D annotation for 7 large-scale data. To fulfill the critical need, we constructed NIS3D, a 3D, high 8 cell density, large-volume, and completely annotated Nuclei Image Segmentation 9 benchmark, assisted by our newly designed semi-automatic annotation software. 10 NIS3D provides more than 22,000 cells across multiple most-used species in this 11 area. Each cell is labeled by three independent annotators, so we can measure the 12 variability of each annotation. A confidence score is computed for each cell, allow-13 ing more nuanced testing and performance comparison. A comprehensive review 14 on the methods of segmenting 3D dense nuclei was conducted. The benchmark was 15 used to evaluate the performance of several selected state-of-the-art segmentation 16 algorithms. The best of current methods is still far away from human-level accuracy, 17 corroborating the necessity of generating such a benchmark. The testing results 18 also demonstrated the strength and weakness of each method and pointed out the 19 directions of further methodological development.
