Welcome to MSR 2016, the Thirteenth International Conference on Mining Software Repositories, held on May 14 - 15 in Austin, Texas, and co-located with the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2016). 
 
This year marks the 13th edition of MSR. We are happy to report that the community of MSR researchers continues to grow and mature, while at the same time the research being performed is both deeper, and addressing a larger amounts of themes. Since 2004 MSR has grown from a one-day workshop with 38 submissions to a two-day conference with 170 submissions combined across all submission categories. To account for the growing industrial interest in smart data and data science, the technical track contains an additional submission category of practice papers, which report experiences of applying mining repository algorithms in an industry/open source organization context.
