 The nature of modern products is changing, and design processes need to change accordingly. As products become increasingly software-enabled and with the rise of software-as-a-service models, customer-facing updates can be released more frequently than was previously possible. The development pipelines for software-enabled products are shifting towards agile processes, which emphasize regular product updates, choosing the timing of these updates is important, and requires an understanding of how demand will be influenced by each release. However, the existing discrete-choice models used to predict demand do not capture the dynamic aspects of consumer decision making. To address this gap, we propose a dynamic demand model and demonstrate how it can be used to determine the optimal time to release product updates. The demand model is based on decision field theory (DFT), which enables the modeling of the dynamic and time-varying behavior of human decision makers. The primary contribution in this paper is a product strategy for update release schedules which accounts for the dynamic and time-varying behavior of potential customers. We demonstrate the method using simulations of multiple scenarios.
