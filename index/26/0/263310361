We present an efficient algorithm to solve semirandom planted instances of any Boolean constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). The semirandom model is a hybrid between worst case and average case input models, where the input is generated by (1) choosing an arbitrary planted assignment $x^{*}$, (2) choosing an arbitrary clause structure, and (3) choosing literal negations for each clause from an arbitrary distribution “shifted by $x^{*}$” so that $x^{*}$ satisfies each constraint. For an n variable semirandom planted instance of a k-arity CSP, our algorithm runs in polynomial time and outputs an assignment that satisfies all but a $o(1)$-fraction of constraints, provided that the instance has at least $\tilde{O}\left(n^{k / 2}\right)$ constraints. This matches, up to ${\mathrm {polylog}} (n)$ factors, the clause threshold for algorithms that solve fully random planted CSPs [23], as well as algorithms that refute random and semirandom CSPs [1], [4]. Our result shows that despite having worst case clause structure, the randomness in the literal patterns makes semirandom planted CSPs significantly easier than worst case, where analogous results require $O\left(n^{k}\right)$ constraints [7], [26]. Perhaps surprisingly, our algorithm follows a significantly different conceptual framework when compared to the recent resolution of semirandom CSP refutation. This turns out to be inherent and, at a technical level, can be attributed to the need for relative spectral approximation of certain random matrices — reminiscent of the classical spectral sparsification — which ensures that an SDP can certify the uniqueness of the planted assignment. In contrast, in the refutation setting, it suffices to obtain a weaker guarantee of absolute upper bounds on the spectral norm of related matrices.
