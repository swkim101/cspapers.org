With the development of diffusion models, text-guided image style transfer has demonstrated great controllable and high-quality results. However, the utilization of text for diverse music style transfer poses significant challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of matched audio-text datasets. Music, being an abstract and complex art form, exhibits variations and intricacies even within the same genre, thereby making accurate textual descriptions challenging. This paper presents a music style transfer approach that effectively captures musical attributes using minimal data. We introduce a novel time-varying textual inversion module to precisely capture mel-spectrogram features at different levels. During inference, we utilize a bias-reduced stylization technique to get stable results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can transfer the style of specific instruments, as well as incorporate natural sounds to compose melodies.
