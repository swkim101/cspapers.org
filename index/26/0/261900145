This paper proposes a high-quality 3D placement algorithm to determine the positions of standard cells and inter-die vias to optimize wirelength considering multiple manufacturing technologies for different dies. The algorithm consists of three major novel techniques: (1) a multi-technologies weighted-average (MTWA) wirelength model, (2) a weighted inter-die-connection cost controlling the net-degree distribution of the cut set, and (3) a via-cell co-optimization technique to further improve the quality of placement solutions. Compared with the winners at the 2022 CAD Contest at ICCAD on 3D Placement with D2D Vertical Connections, our placer achieves the best results for all nontrivial cases.
