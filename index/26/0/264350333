This paper presents our pioneering effort in addressing a new and realistic scenario in multi-modal dialogue systems called Multi-modal Real-time Emotion Pre-recognition in Conversations (MREPC). The objective is to predict the emotion of a forthcoming target utterance that is highly likely to occur. We believe that this task can enhance the dialogue system's understanding of the interlocutor's state of mind, enabling it to prepare an appropriate response in advance. However, addressing MREPC poses the following challenges:1) Previous studies on emotion elicitation typically focus on textual modality and perform sentiment forecasting within a fixed contextual scenario. 2) Previous studies on multi-modal emotion recognition aim to predict the emotion of existing utterances, making it difficult to extend these approaches to MREPC due to the absence of the target utterance. To tackle these challenges, we construct two benchmark multi-modal datasets for MREPC and propose a task-specific multi-modal contrastive pre-training approach. This approach leverages large-scale unlabeled multi-modal dialogues to facilitate emotion pre-recognition for potential utterances of specific target speakers. Through detailed experiments and extensive analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed multi-modal contrastive pre-training architecture effectively enhances the performance of multi-modal real-time emotion pre-recognition in conversations.
