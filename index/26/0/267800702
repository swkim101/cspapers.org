In order to be a performance-enhanced, standalone system legged robots are desired to have an effective mechanism and lightweight control hardware. In the context, this paper shows how to design a biped robot adopting a field programmable gate array, or FPGA for short, as the motor controller. Additionally, the onboard electronic hardware system features a digital signal processor (DSP) as the main CPU. By using the FPGA in conjunction with PWM RC servomotors, a more flexible hardware system has been accomplished with the integrated, digital controller.
