Humans effortlessly interpret images by parsing them into part-whole hierarchies; deep learning excels in learning multi-level feature spaces, but they often lack explicit coding of part-whole relations, a prominent property of medical imaging. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Adam-v2, a new self-supervised learning framework extending Adam [69] by explicitly incorporating part-whole hierarchies into its learning objectives through three key branches: (1) Localizability, acquiring discriminative representations to distinguish different anatomical patterns; (2) Composability, learning each anatomical structure in a parts-to-whole manner; and (3) Decomposability, comprehending each anatomical structure in a whole-to-parts manner. Experimental results across 10 tasks, compared to 11 baselines in zero-shot, few-shot transfer, and full fine-tuning settings, showcase Adam-v2's superior performance over large-scale medical models and existing SSL methods across diverse downstream tasks. The higher generality and robustness of Adam-v2's representations originate from its explicit construction of hierarchies for distinct anatomical structures from unlabeled medical images. Adam-v2 preserves a semantic balance of anatomical diversity and harmony in its embedding, yielding representations that are both generic and semantically meaningful, yet overlooked in existing SSL methods.
