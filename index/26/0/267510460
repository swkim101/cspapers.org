Representation learning in unlabeled heterogeneous graphs has gained significant interest. The heterogeneity in graphs not only provides rich information but also poses challenges to model complex relations in self-supervised learning (SSL) manner. Existing SSL-based approaches are usually designed for node-level tasks and are unable to capture global graph-level features. Also, they often employ computationally expensive meta-path-based techniques, to learn the intrinsic graph structure, that are intractable. Importantly, they overlook non-pairwise relationships among nodes in heterogeneous graphs, for instance in protein-protein interaction networks or collaboration networks, limiting the effectiveness of graph-level learning. To address these issues, we propose a novel self-supervised heterogeneous hypergraph learning framework that captures the richness of heterogeneity, and high-order connectivity in graph-level classification. Unlike traditional methods that rely on meta-path-based approaches to incorporate high-order information, we introduce a k-hop neighborhood strategy to construct intra-graph hyperedges, and a shared attribute-based approach for inter-graph hyperedges to construct the heterogeneous hypergraph. Furthermore, we introduce a context-aware graph-level pooling mechanism that facilitates adaptive aggregation of relevant information across the hypergraph, considering both local and global contexts. Lastly, we design a self-supervised contrastive learning framework by introducing a high-order-aware adaptive augmentation mechanism. This enables the model to learn meaningful graph-level representations from less-labeled data. We evaluate our proposed model against graph kernels, graph neural networks, and graph pooling-based baselines on real-world datasets, demonstrating an overall performance improvement of 5.81% that validates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.
