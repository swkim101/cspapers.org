Reinforcement Learning (RL) has experienced rapid advancements in recent years. The widely studied RL algorithms mainly focus on a single input form, such as pixel-based image input or symbolic vector input. These two forms have different characteristics and, in many scenarios, will appear together, while few RL algorithms have studied the problems with mixed input types. Specifically, in the scenario where both pixel and symbolic inputs are available, symbolic input usually offers abstract features with specific semantics, which is more conducive to the agent's focus. Conversely, pixel input provides more comprehensive information, enabling the agent to make well-informed decisions. Tailoring the processing approach based on the properties of these two input types can contribute to solving the problem more effectively. To tackle the above issue, we propose an Internal Logical Induction (ILI) framework that integrates deep RL and rule learning into one system. ILI utilizes the deep RL algorithm to process the pixel input and the rule learning algorithm to induce propositional logic knowledge from symbolic input. To efficiently combine these two mechanisms, we further adopt a reward shaping technique by treating valuable knowledge as intrinsic rewards for the RL procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that the ILI framework outperforms baseline approaches in RL problems with pixel-symbolic input, and its inductive knowledge exhibits transferability advantages when pixel input semantics change.
