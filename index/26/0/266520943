Visible watermarks, while instrumental in protecting image copyrights, frequently distort the underlying content, complicating tasks like scene interpretation and image editing. Visible watermark removal aims to eliminate the interference of watermarks and restore the background content. However, existing methods often implement watermark component removal and background restoration tasks within a singular branch, leading to residual watermarks in the predictions and ignoring cases where watermarks heavily obscure the background. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Removing Interference and Recovering Content Imaginatively (RIRCI) framework. RIRCI embodies a two-stage approach: the initial phase centers on discerning and segregating the watermark component, while the subsequent phase focuses on background content restoration. To achieve meticulous background restoration, our proposed model employs a dual-path network capable of fully exploring the intrinsic background information beneath semi-transparent watermarks and peripheral contextual information from unaffected regions. Moreover, a Global and Local Context Interaction module is built upon multi-layer perceptrons and bidirectional feature transformation for comprehensive representation modeling in the background restoration phase. The efficacy of our approach is empirically validated across two large-scale datasets, and our findings reveal a marked enhancement over existing watermark removal techniques.
