We are living in a world surrounded by diverse and “smart” devices with rich modalities of sensing ability. Conveniently capturing the interactions between us humans and these objects remains far-reaching. In this paper, we present I'm-HOI, a monocular scheme to faithfully capture the 3D motions of both the human and object in a novel setting: using a minimal amount of RGB camera and object-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). It combines general motion inference and category-aware refinement. For the former, we introduce a holistic human-object tracking method to fuse the IMU signals and the RGB stream and progressively recover the human motions and subsequently the companion object motions. For the latter, we tailor a category-aware motion diffusion model, which is conditioned on both the raw IMU observations and the results from the previous stage under over-parameterization representation. It significantly refines the initial results and generates vivid body, hand, and object motions. Moreover, we contribute a large dataset with ground truth human and object motions, dense RGB inputs, and rich object-mounted IMU measurements. Exten-sive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of I'm-HOI under a hybrid capture setting. Our dataset and code will be released to the community.
