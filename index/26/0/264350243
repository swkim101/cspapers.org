Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) have the potential to revolutionize transportation by improving traffic safety and efficiency. As the core component of ADSs, maneuver decision aims to make tactical decisions to accomplish road following, obstacle avoidance, and efficient driving. In this work, we consider a typical but rarely studied task, called Target-Lane-Entering (TLE), where an autonomous vehicle should enter a target lane before reaching an intersection to ensure a smooth transition to another road. For navigation-assisted autonomous driving, a maneuver decision module chooses the optimal timing to enter the target lane in each road section, thus avoiding rerouting and reducing travel time. To achieve the TLE task, we propose a ruLe-aided reINforcement lEarning framework, called LINE, which combines the advantages of RL-based policy and rule-based strategy, allowing the autonomous vehicle to make target-oriented maneuver decisions. Specifically, an RL-based policy with a hybrid reward function is able to make safe, efficient, and comfortable decisions while considering the factors of target lanes. Then a strategy of rule revision aims to help the policy learn from intervention and block the risk of missing target lanes. Extensive experiments based on the SUMO simulator confirm the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that LINE achieves state-of-the-art driving performance with over 95% task success rate.
