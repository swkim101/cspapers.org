Continuum robots with variable stiffness have gained wide popularity in the last decade. Layer jamming (LJ) has emerged as a simple and efficient technique to achieve tunable stiffness for continuum robots. Despite its merits, the development of a control-oriented dynamical model 1 tailored for this specific class of robots remains an open problem in the literature. This paper aims to present the first solution, to the best of our knowledge, to close the gap. We propose an energy-based model that is integrated with the LuGre frictional model for LJ-based continuum robots. Then, we take a comprehensive theoretical analysis for this model, focusing on two fundamental characteristics of LJ-based continuum robots: shape locking and adjustable stiffness. To validate the modeling approach and theoretical results, a series of experiments using our OctRobot-I continuum robotic platform was conducted. The results show that the proposed model is capable of interpreting and predicting the dynamical behaviors in LJ-based continuum robots.
