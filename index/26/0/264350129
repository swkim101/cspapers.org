Researchers who build creativity support tools (CSTs) define abstractions and software representations that align with user needs to give users the power to accomplish tasks. However, these specifications also structure and limit how users can and should think, act, and express themselves. Thus, tool designers unavoidably exert power over their users by enacting a “normative ground” through their tools. Drawing on interviews with 11 creative practitioners, tool designers, and CST researchers, we offer a definition of empowerment in the context of creative practice, build a preliminary theory of how power relationships manifest in CSTs, and explain why researchers have had trouble addressing these concepts in the past. We re-examine CST literature through a lens of power and argue that mitigating power imbalances at the level of technical design requires enabling users in both vertical movement along levels of abstraction as well as horizontal movement between tools through interoperable representations. A lens of power is one possible orientation that lets us recognize the methodological shifts required towards building “artistic support tools.”
