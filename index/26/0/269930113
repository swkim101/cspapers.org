We present the first domain-adapted and fully-trained large language model, RecGPT-7B, and its instruction-following variant, RecGPT-7B-Instruct, for text-based recommendation. Experimental results on rating prediction and sequential recommendation tasks show that our model, RecGPT-7B-Instruct, outperforms previous strong baselines. We are releasing our RecGPT models as well as their pre-training and fine-tuning datasets to facilitate future research and downstream applications in text-based recommendation.
