Recently, research on quantum neural network (QNN) architectures has been attracted in various fields. Among them, the distributed computation of QNN has been actively discussed for privacy-preserving information management due to data and model distribution over multiple computing devices. Based on this concept, this paper proposes quantum split learning (QSL) which splits a single QNN architecture across multiple distributed computing devices to avoid entire QNN architecture exposure. In order to realize QSL design, this paper also proposes cross-channel pooling, which utilizes quantum state tomography. Our evaluation results verifies that QSL preserves privacy in classification tasks and also improves accuracy at most by 6.83% compared to existing methods.
