We consider a generalization of the problem of supporting rank and select queries on binary strings. Given a string of length <i>n</i> from an alphabet of size σ, we give the first representation that supports <i>rank</i> and <i>access</i> operations in <i>O</i>(lg lg σ) time, and <i>select</i> in <i>O</i>(1) time while using the optimal <i>n</i> lg σ + <i>o</i>(<i>n</i> lg σ) bits. The best known previous structure for this problem required <i>O</i>(lg σ) time, for general values of σ. Our results immediately improve the search times of a variety of text indexing methods.
