New NLP benchmarks are urgently needed to align with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs). We present a meticulously designed evaluation benchmark that leverages the knowledge graph. This evaluation comprises 584 level-1 knowledge points and 1,989 level-2 knowledge points, thereby encompassing a comprehensive spectrum of the K12 education domain knowledge. The primary objective is to comprehensively assess the high-level comprehension aptitude and reasoning capabilities of LLMs operating within the Chinese context. Our evaluation incorporates five distinct question types with 39,452 questions. We test the current mainstream LLMs by three distinct modes. Firstly, four prompt evaluation modes were employed to assess the fundamental capacity. Additionally, for choice questions, a result-oriented evaluation approach was designed through data augmentation to assess the model's proficiency in advanced knowledge and reasoning. Moreover, a subset with reasoning process is derived, and the process-oriented testing method is used to test the model's interpretability and higher-order reasoning capacity. We further show models' capability in our knowledge points, and anticipate the evaluation can assist in the assessment of the strengths and deficiencies of LLMs on knowledge points, thus fostering their development within the Chinese context. Our Dataset will be publicly available in https://github.com/tal-tech/chinese-k12-evaluation.
