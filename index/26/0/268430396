This workshop will teach instructors how to incorporate Machine Learning into their mobile course using ML Kit for Firebase. ML Kit provides powerful machine learning functionality to your app running either iOS or Android and is for both experienced and novice machine learning developers. With just a few lines of code, you can use these powerful and easy to use machine learning packages. This workshop will focus on using machine learning in mobile applications to solve real-world problems. In this workshop, we will explore some of the functionality ML Kit provides. Topics include text recognition, facial detection, recognizing points of interest, image characterization, and labeling. We will integrate a few of these features into fully functional apps running on iOS or Android. Additionally, we will explore tradeoffs between executing ML Kit in the cloud and on a device. This workshop is targeted at instructors teaching a web development or mobile application course looking to incorporate cloud and native ML functionality. It is also suited for anyone wanting to deploy ML applications quickly using a feature-rich API. A laptop running Android Studio or Xcode is required. Prior to the workshop participants will be given instructions for software installation.
