The past decades have produced a wide-variety of automated techniques for assessing the correctness of software systems. In practice, when applied to large modern software systems all existing automated program analysis and verification techniques come up short. They might produce false error reports, exhaust available human or computational resources, or be incapable of reasoning about some set of important properties. Whatever their shortcoming, the goal of proving a system correct remains elusive.
