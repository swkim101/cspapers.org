When it comes to computer science capstone courses, quality of projects is often a determining factor in learning outcomes and overall student experience. However, sourcing appropriate and interesting projects-whether devised by instructors or submitted by faculty or industry clients-can be challenging. This birds of a feather session invites educators, administrators, and even former students involved with CS capstones and other project-based courses to share some of the challenges they have encountered (e.g. client recruitment, project quality and variety, IP concerns) and potential strategies, processes, and tools for addressing these challenges.
