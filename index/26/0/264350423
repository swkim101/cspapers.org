Pricing Guidance tools at Airbnb aim to help hosts maximize the earning for each night of stay. For a given listing, the earning-maximization price point of a night can vary greatly with lead-day - the number of days from now until the night of stay. This introduces systematic bias in running marketplace A/B tests to compare the performances of two pricing strategies. Lead-day bias can cause the short-term experiment result to move in the opposite direction to the long-term impact, possibly leading to the suboptimal business decision and customer dissatisfaction. We propose an efficient experimentation approach that corrects for the bias, minimizes the possible negative impact of experimenting, and greatly accelerates the R&D cycle. This paper is the first of its kind to lays out the theoretical framework along with the real-world example that demonstrates the magnitude of the bias. It serves as a conversation starter for such insidious type of experimentation bias that is likely present in other marketplaces of expirable goods such as vacation nights, car rentals, and airline tickets, concert passes, or ride-hailings.
