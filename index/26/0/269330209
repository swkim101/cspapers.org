This paper presents BattleAgent, a detailed emulation demonstration system that combines the Large Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Multi-Agent System (MAS). This novel system aims to emulate complex dynamic interactions among multiple agents, as well as between agents and their environments, over a period of time. The emulation showcases the current capabilities of agents, featuring fine-grained multi-modal interactions between agents and landscapes. It develops customizable agent structures to meet specific situational requirements, for example, a variety of battle-related activities like scouting and trench digging. These components collaborate to recreate historical events in a lively and comprehensive manner. This methodology holds the potential to substantially improve visualization of historical events and deepen our understanding of historical events especially from the perspective of decision making.
