Multi-label unknown intent detection is a challenging task where each utterance may contain not only multiple known but also unknown intents. To tackle this challenge, pioneers proposed to predict the intent number of the utterance first, then compare it with the results of known intent matching to decide whether the utterance contains unknown intent(s). Though they have made remarkable progress on this task, their method still suffers from two important issues: 1) It is inadequate to extract multiple intents using only utterance encoding; 2) Optimizing two sub-tasks (intent number prediction and known intent matching) independently leads to inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose to incorporate segment augmentation rather than only use utterance encoding to better detect multiple intents. We also design a prediction consistency module to bridge the gap between the two sub-tasks. Empirical results on MultiWOZ2.3 show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves the best baseline significantly.
