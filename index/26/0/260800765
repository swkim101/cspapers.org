Constraint acquisition is the task of learning a constraint network from examples of solutions and non-solutions. Existing constraint acquisition systems typically require advance knowledge of the target network's constraint language, which significantly narrows their scope of applicability. In this paper we propose a constraint acquisition method that computes a suitable constraint language as part of the learning process, eliminating the need for any advance knowledge. We report preliminary experiments on various acquisition benchmarks.
