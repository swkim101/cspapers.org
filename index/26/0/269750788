Existing guidelines for designing targets on smartphones often focus on single-tap operations for accurate selection. However, smartphone interfaces can support both tap and swipe actions. We explored user-performance differences between tap and swipe in two crowdsourced experiments using bar and square targets. Results indicated longer operation times, higher error rates, and significantly shifted touch points for swipe compared to tap. Our findings imply that current target-size guidelines may not apply to swipe-operated targets, and they reveal new research opportunities for swipeable-target designs.
