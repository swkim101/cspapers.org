Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a fundamental task in natural language processing, which is widely used in public decision-making. Recently, deep learning have demonstrated great potential to deal with this task. However, prior works have mostly treated SA as a deterministic classification problem, and meanwhile, without quantifying the predictive uncertainty. This presents a serious problem in the SA, different annotator, due to the differences in beliefs, values, and experiences, may have different perspectives on how to label the text sentiment. Such situation will lead to inevitable data uncertainty and make the deterministic classification models feel puzzle to make decision. To address this issue, we propose a new SA paradigm with the consideration of uncertainty and conduct an expensive empirical study. Specifically, we treat SA as the regression task and introduce uncertainty quantification to obtain confidence intervals for predictions, which enables the risk assessment ability of the model and can improve the credibility of SA-aids decision-making. Experiments on five datasets show that our proposed new paradigm effectively quantifies uncertainty in SA while remaining competitive performance to point estimation, in addition to being capable of Out-Of-Distribution~(OOD) detection.
