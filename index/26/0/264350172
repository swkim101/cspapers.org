Logistics audience expansion, the process for logistics companies to find potential long-term customers, is one of the most important tasks for business growth. However, existing methods for conventional audience expansion fall short due to two significant challenges, the intricate interplay of multiple complex factors in the logistics scenario and the emphasis on long-term logistics service usage instead of one-time promotions. To address the above limitations, we design LOGAE-TKG, a logistics audience expansion method based on a temporal knowledge graph, which consists of three components: (i) a temporal logistics knowledge graph pre-trained model to model the effect of multiple complex factors and build a solid logistics knowledge base for contracting and usage prediction; (ii) an intention learning model with data augmentation-based comparison to capture the contracting intention; (iii) a future pattern discovery model to uncover post-contract patterns. We evaluate and deploy our method on the JingDong e-commerce platform. Extensive offline experiment results and real-world deployment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
