Pre-consultation serves as a critical information exchange between healthcare providers and patients, streamlining visits and supporting patient-centered care. Human-led pre-consultations offer many benefits, yet they require significant time and energy from clinical staff. In this work, we identify design goals for pre-consultation chatbots given their potential to carry out human-like conversations and autonomously adapt their line of questioning. We conducted a study with 33 walk-in clinic patients to elicit design considerations for pre-consultation chatbots. Participants were exposed to one of two study conditions: an LLM-powered AI agent and a Wizard-of-Oz agent simulated by medical professionals. Our study found that both conditions were equally well-received and demonstrated comparable conversational capabilities. However, the extent of the follow-up questions and the amount of empathy impacted the chatbotâ€™s perceived thoroughness and sincerity. Patients also highlighted the importance of setting expectations for the chatbot before and after the pre-consultation experience.
