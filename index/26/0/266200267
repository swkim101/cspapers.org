The untethered microrobots driven by multiple external physics fields have promising ability in minimally invasive disease treatments. One common type of the driving fields is gradient magnetic field, which can provide microrobots with adequate driving force in complicated environment. In this study, a control method of microrobot through gradient magnetic field system is presented, which is realized by moving the field free point (FFP) to produce an alterable magnetic driving force. A confirmatory experiment of the robot reciprocating motion control is undertaken in a 1D gradient magnetic robot system. The control method could be applied to further studies on in vivo applications of targeted microrobot drug delivery system.
