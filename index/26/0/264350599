Creativity Support Tools (CSTs) aid in the efficient and effective composition of creative content, such as picture books. However, many existing CSTs only allow for mono-modal creation, whereas previous studies have become theoretically and technically mature to support multi-modal innovative creations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce XCreation, a novel CST that leverages generative AI to support cross-modal storybook creation. Nevertheless, directly deploying AI models to CSTs can still be problematic as they are mostly black-box architectures that are not comprehensible to human users. Therefore, we integrate an interpretable entity-relation graph to intuitively represent picture elements and their relations, improving the usability of the underlying generative structures. Our between-subject user study demonstrates that XCreation supports continuous plot creation with increased creativity, controllability, usability, and interpretability. XCreation is applicable to various scenarios, including interactive storytelling and picture book creation, thanks to its multimodal nature.
