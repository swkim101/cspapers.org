Shared electric micromobility (e.g., shared electric bikes and electric scooters), as an emerging way of urban transportation, has been increasingly popular in recent years. However, managing thousands of micromobility vehicles in a city, such as rebalancing and charging vehicles to meet spatial-temporally varied demand, is challenging. Existing management frameworks generally consider demand as the number of requests without the energy consumption of these requests, which can lead to less effective management. To address this limitation, we design RECOMMEND, a rebalancing and charging framework for shared electric micromobility vehicles with energy-informed demand to improve the system revenue. Specifically, we first re-define the demand from the perspective of energy consumption and predict the future energy-informed demand based on the state-of-the-art spatial-temporal prediction method. Then we fuse the predicted energy-informed demand into different components of a rebalancing and charging framework based on reinforcement learning. We evaluate the RECOMMEND system with 2-month real-world electric micromobility system operation data. Experimental results show that our method can be easily integrated into a general RL framework and outperform state-of-the-art baselines by at least 26.89% in terms of net revenue.
