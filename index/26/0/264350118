Data sharing is necessary for many practical applications. People do, however, frequently worry about the problem of privacy leaking.This study focuses on preventing the disclosure of sensitive information using association rules and frequent itemsets, which are frequently utilized in numerous applications. How to minimize side effects while hiding, particularly side effects on non-sensitive knowledge, is the difficult part of the problem. The majority of association rule hiding techniques currently in use solely consider reducing side effects on frequent itemsets (patterns), rather than rules, in order to conceal sensitive rules by reducing the statistical disclosure of the itemsets that generate such rules. In this study, we provide a concealment technique utilizing potentially risky rules to lessen adverse impacts on non-sensitive rules, not only itemsets. In addition, this method can be tailored to conceal sensitive itemsets, instead of rules. Extensive experiments show that in most cases the proposed solution can bring fewer side effects on rules, frequent patterns or data quality than existing methods.
