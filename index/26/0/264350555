The pervasiveness of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communication technologies results in a proliferation of traffic data in intelligent transportation systems, where traffic prediction is often essential to enable reliability and safety. Many recent studies target traffic prediction using deep learning techniques. They model spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states by deep learning and achieve good overall performance. However, existing studies ignore the bias on traffic prediction models, which refers to non-uniformed performance distribution across road segments, especially the significantly poor prediction results on certain road segments. To solve this issue, we propose a framework named spatio-temporal mixture-of-experts (ST-MoE) that aims to eliminate the bias on traffic prediction. In general, we refer to any traffic prediction model as the based model, and adopt the proposed ST-MoE framework as a plug-in to debias. ST-MoE uses stacked convolution-based networks to learn spatio-temporal representations of individual patterns of road segments and then adaptively assigns appropriate expert layers (sub-networks) to different patterns through a spatio-temporal gating network. To this end, the patterns can be distinguished, and biased performance among road segments can be eliminated by experts tailored for specific patterns, which also further improves the overall prediction accuracy of the base model. Extensive experimental results on various base models and real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of ST-MoE.
