k -means clustering is an important problem in machine learning and statistics. The k -means ++ initialization algorithm has driven new acceleration strategies and theoretical analysis for solving the k -means clustering problem. The state-of-the-art variant, called LocalSearch ++, adds extra local search steps upon k -means ++ to achieve constant approximation error in expectation. In this paper, we propose a new variant named LSDS ++, which improves the sampling efficiency of LocalSearch ++ via a strategy called dual sampling . By defining a new capture graph based on the concept of coreset, we show that the proposed LSDS ++ is able to achieve the same expected constant error with reduced complexity. Experiments are conducted to justify the benefit of LSDS ++ in practice.
