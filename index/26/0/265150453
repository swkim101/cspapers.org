Downstream applications often require text classification models to be accurate and robust. While the accuracy of the state-of-the-art Language Models (LMs) approximates human performance, they often exhibit a drop in performance on noisy data found in the real world. This lack of robustness can be concerning, as even small perturbations in the text, irrelevant to the target task, can cause classifiers to incorrectly change their predictions. A potential solution can be the family of Prototype-Based Networks (PBNs) that classifies examples based on their similarity to prototypical examples of a class (prototypes) and has been shown to be robust to noise for computer vision tasks. In this paper, we study whether the robustness properties of PBNs transfer to text classification tasks under both targeted and static adversarial attack settings. Our results show that PBNs, as a mere architectural variation of vanilla LMs, offer more robustness compared to vanilla LMs under both targeted and static settings. We showcase how PBNs' interpretability can help us to understand PBNs' robustness properties. Finally, our ablation studies reveal the sensitivity of PBNs' robustness to how strictly clustering is done in the training phase, as tighter clustering results in less robust PBNs.
