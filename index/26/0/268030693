Intrusion detection is a form of anomalous activity detection in communication network traffic. Continual learning (CL) approaches to the intrusion detection task accumulate old knowledge while adapting to the latest threat knowledge. Previous works have shown the effectiveness of memory replay-based CL approaches for this task. In this work, we present two novel contributions to improve the performance of CL-based network intrusion detection in the context of class imbalance and scalability. First, we extend class balancing reservoir sampling (CBRS), a memory-based CL method, to address the problems of severe class imbalance for large datasets. Second, we propose a novel approach titled perturbation assistance for parameter approximation (PAPA) based on the Gaussian mixture model to reduce the number of virtual stochastic gradient descent (SGD) parameter computations needed to discover maximally interfering samples for CL. We demonstrate that the proposed approaches perform remarkably better than the baselines on standard intrusion detection benchmarks created over shorter periods (KDDCUPâ€™99, NSL-KDD, CICIDS-2017/2018, UNSW-NB15, and CTU-13) and a longer period with distribution shift (AnoShift). We also validated proposed approaches on standard continual learning benchmarks (SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and CLEAR-10/100) and anomaly detection benchmarks (SMAP, SMD, and MSL). Further, the proposed PAPA approach significantly lowers the number of virtual SGD update operations, thus resulting in training time savings in the range of 12 to 40% compared to the maximally interfered samples retrieval algorithm.
