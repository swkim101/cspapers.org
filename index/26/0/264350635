Multimodal personality assessment aims to identify and express human personality traits in videos. Existing methods primarily focus on multimodal fusion while ignoring the inherent psychological clues essential for this interdisciplinary task. Modality clues: personality traits are stable over time due to their genetic and environmental origins, resulting in stable personality traits in the multimodal data. Trait clues: multiple traits often co-occur with non-negligible correlations, which can collectively aid trait identification. To simultaneously capture the above psychological clues, we propose a novel Psychological Clues Exploration Network (PCENet) for multimodal personality assessment, which is a human-like judgment paradigm with more generalization capability. Specifically, we first devise a multimodal hierarchical disentanglement, which clearly aligns stable representations among different modalities and separates the mutability of each modality. Subsequently, a Transformer-backbone decoder equipped with modality-to-trait attention is exploited to adaptively generate a tailored representation for each trait with the guidance of trait semantics. The trait semantics are obtained by exploiting trait correlations through self-attention. Extensive experiments on the First Impression V2 dataset demonstrate that our PCENet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for multimodal personality assessment.
