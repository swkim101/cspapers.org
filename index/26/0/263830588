Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems have experienced exponential growth in the last couple of years. These systems offer exciting capabilities for CS Education (CSEd), such as generating programs, that students can well utilize for their learning. Among the many dimensions that might affect the effective adoption of GenAI for CSEd, in this paper, we investigate students' trust. Trust in GenAI influences the extent to which students adopt GenAI, in turn affecting their learning. In this paper, we present results from a survey of 253 students at two large universities to understand how much they trust GenAI tools and their feedback on how GenAI impacts their performance in CS courses. Our results show that students have different levels of trust in GenAI. We also observe different levels of confidence and motivation, highlighting the need for further understanding of factors impacting trust.
