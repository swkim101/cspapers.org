In cinematic VR, viewers can only see a limited portion of the scene at any time. As a result, they may miss important events outside their field of view. While there are many techniques which offer spatial guidance (where to look), there has been little work on temporal guidance (when to look). Temporal guidance offers viewers a look-ahead time and allows viewers to plan their head motion for important events. This paper introduces spatiotemporal visual guidance and presents a new widget, RadarVR, which shows both spatial and temporal information of regions of interest (ROIs) in a video. Using RadarVR, we conducted a study to investigate the impact of temporal guidance and explore trade-offs between spatiotemporal and spatial-only visual guidance. Results show spatiotemporal feedback allows users to see a greater percentage of ROIs, with 81% more seen from their initial onset. We discuss design implications for future work in this space.
