In this work, we present a novel binary code design to address a single indel error or the occurrence of simultaneous deletion and insertion errors within a codeword. Our study examines all possible scenarios involving a single indel error and one-deletion and one-insertion errors. Relying on three constraints in the code construction, the proposed code can accurately determine the error values and positions for all error scenarios. Additionally, we suggest a decoding procedure for the proposed code design and provide detailed explanations of this suggested decoding procedure. We also present the redundancy and code rate to show the efficiency of the proposed code.
