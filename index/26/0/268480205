What would happen if generalist K-5 teachers had the technical support to build custom digital tools integrating computing concepts across other fields of study? This could open new avenues for students to learn computational thinking, without compromising time spent in other important subject areas. Furthermore, it could grant teachers the same level of creativity in developing computing resources that they have in other curriculum areas, rather than being limited by available resources or by their own lack of expertise. With this poster, we will cover our approach to co-designing digital tools with K-5 teachers for the primary goal of integrating computing concepts into a variety of other subject areas. We reflect on the observations we made throughout the collaboration and how they impacted our approach moving forward. Additionally, we will highlight some of the tools that came out of the collaboration and how co-designing a specialized digital tool from the ground up granted teachers the flexibility to explore ideas beyond integrating computer science concepts, including student accessibility, engagement, and social emotional learning (SEL).
