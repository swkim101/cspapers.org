NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) computers are vulnerable to errors, which limit the size of verifiable quantum circuits. For large quantum circuits, it is more difficult to obtain reliable results due to errors. A circuit partitioning approach can improve fidelity by separating and reducing the size of circuits processed at once in NISQ devices. In this paper, we propose Quixote (quantum independent execution architecture), that can execute quantum circuits independently as subcircuits to improve the fidelity of NISQ program results. We present methods for decomposing controlled gates into independent subcircuits and additional techniques for reducing circuit costs through identical gate transformation.
