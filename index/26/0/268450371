Scaffolded Projects for the Social Good (SPSG) is an adaptable service-learning framework with a low adoption threshold based on the studio model. Its goal is to enable instructors to easily embed externally sourced projects supporting Computing for the Social Good (CSG) concepts into existing software engineering or similar courses and addresses the barriers common to service learning, as well as other frameworks with similar CSG-related objectives. Establishing connections between computing and its societal benefits has proven to be an effective strategy for attracting students, especially those from underrepresented groups within the discipline. Furthermore, this work supports competency-based learning by offering students an opportunity to solve real-world problems in an authentic environment using current industrial practices and tools coupled with strong mentoring support from volunteer professionals and near-peers. Using a studio model helps overcome the timing impedance between the length of a single academic term and the timeframes required to complete real-world projects with student teams.
