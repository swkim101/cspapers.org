Designing source code and channel code separately is optimal when the code length is very long. For application scenarios requiring short to moderate code lengths, designing source code and channel code jointly can provide a higher coding gain. The main idea of jointly designing source-channel code (JSCC) is to exploit the residual redundancy of the source in the tandem joint source-channel encoding/decoding algorithms so as to achieve coding gains. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have been widely used in many communication systems because of their capacity-approaching error correction capability. Recently, protography-based LDPC codes have been applied to designing JSCC systems. In this talk, we will present the architecture of such JSCC systems, including the encoding and decoding mechanisms. We will also introduce the mathematical techniques for analyzing the thresholds of such systems. Finally, we will show some hardware implementation results and some future research directions.
