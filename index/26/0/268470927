This study aims to investigate innovative mobile virtual reality (VR) interaction designs, using affordable VR devices, for enhancing the learning of computer science concepts and theories. Smartphones have been instrumental in facilitating both augmented reality (AR) and fully immersive VR experiences with low-cost platforms. A diverse range of mobile apps empowers users to engage in AR experiences, allowing them to view virtual elements on their smartphone displays and interact with them within their real-world surroundings. On the other hand, fully immersive mobile VR experiences necessitate a VR viewer device, like Google Cardboard, equipped with a smartphone slot for enhanced immersion. This cost-effective VR platform can be operated with a single button press for interaction controls, which enable users to interact with its virtual objects presented in the immersive 3D view. However, to facilitate more complex interactions, a challenge we must address in the development of smartphone-based VR applications is the limited control options they provide. Without additional controllers, mobile VR applications rely on the movements of its head-mounted device and a single available button for user input. To overcome these control limitations, we proposed implementing a combination of head pointing, dwell selection, and various button operations, including button hold, double-button click, and triple-button click. We implemented and showcased these functions within an educational VR game focused on practicing the minimum spanning tree algorithm. We aim to design innovative mobile VR interactions to facilitate effective learning of abstract computer science concepts and theories.
