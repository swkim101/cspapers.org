Fine-grained community-building information, such as building names and accurate geographical coordinates, is critical for a range of practical applications like navigation and door-to-door services (e.g., on-demand delivery and last-mile delivery). A common practice of traditional methods to gather community-building information usually relies on manual collection, which is typically labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address these issues, we utilize the massive data generated from e-commerce delivery services and design a framework, AutoBuild, for fine-grained large-scale community-building labeling. AutoBuild consists of two main components: (i) a Location Candidate Detection Module that identifies potential building names and coordinates from multi-source delivery data, and (ii) a Progressive Building Matching Model that employs trajectory modeling, human behavior analysis, and heterogeneous graph alignment to match building names and coordinates. To evaluate the performance of AutoBuild, we applied it to two real-world multi-modal datasets from Beijing City and Chengdu City. The results reveal that AutoBuild significantly outperforms multiple baseline models by 50-meter accuracy of 81.8% and 100-meter accuracy of 95.9% in Beijing City. More importantly, we conduct a real-world case study to demonstrate the practical impact of AutoBuild in last-mile delivery.
