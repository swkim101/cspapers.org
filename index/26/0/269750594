Support for story character construction is as essential as characters are for stories. Building upon past research on early character construction stages, we explore how conversation with chatbot avatars embodying characters powered by more recent technologies could support the entire character construction process for creative writing. Through a user study (N=14) with creative writers, we examine thinking and usage patterns of CharacterMeet, a prototype system allowing writers to progressively manifest characters through conversation while customizing context, character appearance, voice, and background image. We discover that CharacterMeet facilitates iterative character construction. Specifically, participants, including those with more linear usual approaches, alternated between writing and personalized exploration through visualization of ideas on CharacterMeet while visuals and audio enhanced immersion. Our findings support research on iterative creative processes and the growing potential of personalizable generative AI creativity support tools. We present design implications for leveraging chatbot avatars in the creative writing process.
