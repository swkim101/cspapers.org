Pre-training is crucial in 3D-related fields such as autonomous driving where point cloud annotation is costly and challenging. Many recent studies on point cloud pre-training, however, have overlooked the issue of incompleteness, where only a fraction of the points are captured by LiDAR, leading to ambiguity during the training phase. On the other hand, images offer more comprehensive information and richer semantics that can bolster point cloud encoders in addressing the incompleteness issue inherent in point clouds. Yet, incorporating images into point cloud pre-training presents its own challenges due to occlusions, potentially causing misalignments between points and pixels. In this work, we propose PRED, a novel image-assisted pre-training framework for outdoor point clouds in an occlusion-aware manner. The main ingredient of our framework is a Birds-Eye-View (BEV) feature map conditioned semantic rendering, leveraging the semantics of images for supervision through neural rendering. We further enhance our model's performance by incorporating point-wise masking with a high mask ratio (95%). Extensive experiments demonstrate PRED's superiority over prior point cloud pre-training methods, providing significant improvements on various large-scale datasets for 3D perception tasks.
