Constrained community detection is one of the popular topics in graph data mining, and it aims to improve the performance by exploiting prior pairwise constraints, such as must-link and cannot-link constraints. However, most of existing methods for constrained community detection are shallow approaches, and are also not robust to handle constraints information with noises. In view of this, we propose a deep conditional generative approach CGMVGAE. It firstly treats pairwise constraints as the priors with different degrees of certainty, and then integrates them into the conditional Gaussian mixture model. By further combing variational graph auto-encoders and the Wasserstein regularization, CGMVGAE can learn the latent node representations preserving community structures in a deep generative manner. Experimental results show that CGMVGAE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, and is also more robust.
