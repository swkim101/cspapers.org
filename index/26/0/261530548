Accurate segmentation of surgical instrument tip is an important task for enabling downstream applications in robotic surgery, such as surgical skill assessment, tool-tissue interaction and deformation modeling, as well as surgical autonomy. However, this task is very challenging due to the small sizes of surgical instrument tips, and significant variance of surgical scenes across different procedures. Although much effort has been made on visual-based methods, existing segmentation models still suffer from low robustness thus not usable in practice. Fortunately, kinematics data from the robotic system can provide reliable prior for instrument location, which is consistent regardless of different surgery types. To make use of such multi-modal information, we propose a novel visual-kinematics graph learning framework to accurately segment the instrument tip given various surgical procedures. Specifically, a graph learning framework is proposed to encode relational features of instrument parts from both image and kinematics. Next, a cross-modal contrastive loss is designed to incorporate robust geometric prior from kinematics to image for tip segmentation. We have conducted experiments on a private paired visual-kinematics dataset including multiple procedures, i.e., prostatectomy, total mesorectal excision, fundoplication and distal gastrectomy on cadaver, and distal gastrectomy on porcine. The leave-one-procedure-out cross validation demon-strated that our proposed multi-modal segmentation method significantly outperformed current image-based state-of-the-art approaches, exceeding averagely 11.2% on Dice.
