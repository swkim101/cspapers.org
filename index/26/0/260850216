The growing population has accelerated the process of urbanisation, and is putting under stress the urban transport infrastructure. This results in increased traffic congestion, with significant health, economy, and social issues.

 Artificial Intelligence techniques are increasingly demonstrating their capabilities in predicting and supporting urban traffic control, by extending the abilities of traffic authorities in planning and reacting to different traffic conditions. In this context, our main research topic fits in the autonomic traffic control theme, with the aim of supporting the design of autonomous traffic control systems.
