Given a million-scale dataset of who-calls-whom data containing imperfect labels, how can we detect existing and new fraud patterns? We propose CallMine, with carefully designed features and visualizations. Our CallMine method has the following properties: (a) Scalable, being linear on the input size, handling about 35 million records in around one hour on a stock laptop; (b) Effective, allowing natural interaction with human analysts; (c) Flexible, being applicable in both supervised and unsupervised settings; (d) Automatic, requiring no user-defined parameters. In the real world, in a multi-million-scale dataset, CallMine was able to detect fraudsters 7,000x faster, namely in a matter of hours, while expert humans took over 10 months to detect them.
