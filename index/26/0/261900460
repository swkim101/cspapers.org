The growing concern about offshore chip manufacturing has created considerable interest in solutions that can ensure the integrity and security of chips. Among various solutions, split manufacturing has received a lot of attention due to its security guarantees. With the recent emergence of new heterogeneous manufacturing technologies, including chiplet-based systems, there is a new opportunity for revisiting the design considerations for split manufacturing to fully exploit the opportunities presented by chiplet-based systems and improve various metrics, such as security, performance, and overhead.This work improves the state-of-the-art in secure chip manufacturing by proposing a new split manufacturing scheme. The key idea is to exploit the capabilities provided by chiplet integration technology for designing a new hybrid split manufacturing scheme that includes both vertical and horizontal splitting. Unlike existing vertical-only split manufacturing mechanisms, that target obfuscation of interconnections by splitting the design at a specific metallization layer into two portions, the proposed hybrid method increases trust by exploiting the chiplet paradigm shift, specifically, breaking the design into sub-designs, each represented by chiplets (independently fabricated), and obfuscating interconnections among them. The proposed obfuscation mechanism targets systems that exploit the chiplet technology to obtain important performance advantages, thus any chiplet-related overhead is not due to obfuscation. We evaluate our method using several experiments and compare it with the state-of-the-art using standard metrics, including area, power, delay, wirelength, and trust. Compared to conventional split manufacturing, our hybrid method achieves up to 245Ã— higher trust, while exhibiting negligible overhead.
