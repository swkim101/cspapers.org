While current augmented reality (AR) authoring tools lower the technical barrier for novice AR designers, they lack explicit guidance to consider potentially harmful aspects of AR with respect to security & privacy (S&P). To address potential threats in the earliest stages of AR design, we developed Reframe, a digital storyboarding tool for designers with no formal training to analyze S&P threats. We accomplish this through a frame-based authoring approach, which captures and enhances storyboard elements that are relevant for threat modeling, and character-driven analysis tools, which personify S&P threats from an underlying threat model to provide simple abstractions for novice AR designers. Based on evaluations with novice AR designers and S&P experts, we find that Reframe enables designers to analyze threats and propose mitigation techniques that experts consider good quality. We discuss how Reframe can facilitate collaboration between designers and S&P professionals and propose extensions to Reframe to incorporate additional threat models.
