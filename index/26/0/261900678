Rapid growth in Deep Neural Network (DNN) workloads has increased the energy footprint of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing realm. For optimum energy efficiency, we propose operating a DNN hardware in the Low-Power Computing (LPC) region. However, operating at LPC causes increased delay sensitivity to Process Variation (PV). Delay faults are an intriguing consequence of PV. In this paper, we demonstrate the vulnerability of DNNs to delay variations, substantially lowering the prediction accuracy. To overcome delay faults, we present STRIVEâ€”a post-fabrication fault detection and reactive error reduction technique. We also introduce a time-borrow correction technique to ensure error-free DNN computation.
