This paper introduces a new structure with shifting excitation position in an antipodal Vivaldi antenna to adjust the electromagnetic (EM) flow to the Vivaldi edge to improve gain. Near-field analysis with Time of arrival (ToA) of the first cluster is implemented to reveal wave propagation process and influences of detailed improved structure to nearfield features in order to achieve the refined modification in shifting excitation position as well as optimization of number and angle of lateral slots in the design.
