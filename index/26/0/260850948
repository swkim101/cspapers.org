The availability of a large amount of unstructured text has generated interest in utilizing it for future decision-making and developing strategies in various critical domains. Despite some progress, automatically generating accurate reasoning models from the raw text is still an active area of research. Furthermore, most proposed approaches focus on a specific do-main. As such, their suggested transformation methods are usually unreliable when applied to other domains. This research aims to develop a framework, SCANER (Semi-automated CAusal Network Extraction from Raw text), to convert raw text into Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs). The framework will then be employed in various domains to demonstrate its utilization as a decision-support tool. The preliminary experiments have focused on three domains: political narratives, food insecurity, and medical sciences. The future focus is on developing BNs from political narratives and modifying them through various methods to reduce the level of aggressiveness or extremity in the narratives without causing conflict among the masses or countries.
