We present a set of experiments utilizing wideband real-time adaptive full-duplex (FD) radios, demonstrating simultaneous transmission and reception on the same frequency channel. Each FD radio consists of a circulator-based antenna interface, a switched-capacitor delay-line-based configurable Radio-Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC) that implements Self-Interference Cancellation (SIC), an FPGA that optimizes the RFIC configuration in under 1.1 sec and can adapt to environmental changes in under 0.3 sec, and a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) transmitting OFDM-like packets. We demonstrate a real-time adaptive FD radio that achieves the SIC necessary to reach the noise floor across a wide bandwidth of 50 MHz. Then, we use two FD radios to create a wireless link and showcase the superior FD throughput.
