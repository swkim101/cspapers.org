Multi-view clustering (MVC) based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and its variants have attracted much attention due to their advantages in clustering interpretability. However, existing NMF-based multi-view clustering methods perform NMF on each view respectively and ignore the impact of between-view. Thus, they canâ€™t well exploit the within-view spatial structure and between-view complementary information. To resolve this issue, we present orthogonal non-negative tensor factorization (Orth-NTF) and develop a novel multi-view clustering based on Orth-NTF with one-side orthogonal constraint. Our model directly performs Orth-NTF on the 3rd-order tensor which is composed of anchor graphs of views. Thus, our model directly considers the between-view relationship. Moreover, we use the tensor Schatten p -norm regularization as a rank approximation of the 3rd-order tensor which characterizes the cluster structure of multi-view data and exploits the between-view complementary information. In addition, we provide an optimization algorithm for the proposed method and prove mathematically that the algorithm always converges to the stationary KKT point. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets indicate that our proposed method is able to achieve satisfactory clustering performance.
