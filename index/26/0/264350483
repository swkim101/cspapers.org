Recommender systems play a pivotal role in navigating users through vast reservoirs of information. However, data sparseness can compromise recommendation accuracy, making it challenging to improve recommendation performance. To address this issue, researchers have explored incorporating multiple data types. Yet, this approach can introduce noise that impairs the recommendations' accuracy. Therefore, it is crucial to denoise the data to enhance recommendation quality. This tutorial highlights the importance of data denoising metrics for improving the accuracy and quality of recommendations. Four groups of data denoising metrics are introduced: feature, item, pattern, and modality level. For each group, various denoising methods are presented. The tutorial emphasizes the significance of selecting the right data denoising methods to enhance recommendation quality. It provides valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers implementing reliable data denoising metrics in recommender systems. Finally, the tutorial proposes open research questions for future studies, making it a valuable resource for the research community.
