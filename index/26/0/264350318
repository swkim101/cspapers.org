The size and cost of electroencephalography (EEG) headsets have been decreasing at a steadfast pace. Prefrontal cortical activity is a promising input source that is also important for affect regulation. We created Joie, a joy-based EEG brain-computer interface (BCI) which uses prefrontal asymmetries associated with joyful thoughts as input to an endless runner game where the userâ€™s character collects coins in response. In a lab study (20 participants, 15 training sessions per participant, up to two weeks of training), we found that our experiment group instructed to imagine positive music, winning awards, and similar strategies, demonstrated significantly greater ability in activating asymmetry compared to our placebo and control groups. In our analysis, Joie demonstrates the ability for prefrontal asymmetries to be used as input to an affective BCI and builds upon prior work in this area. Training these asymmetries can teach mental strategies that have applications in mental health.
