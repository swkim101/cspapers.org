Traditional LiDAR-based object detection research primarily focuses on closed-set scenarios, which falls short in complex real-world applications. Directly transferring existing 2D open-vocabulary models with some known LiDAR classes for open-vocabulary ability, however, tends to suffer from over-fitting problems: The obtained model will detect the known objects, even presented with a novel category. In this paper, we propose OpenSight, a more advanced 2D-3D modeling framework for LiDAR-based open-vocabulary detection. OpenSight utilizes 2D-3D geometric priors for the initial discernment and localization of generic objects, followed by a more specific semantic interpretation of the detected objects. The process begins by generating 2D boxes for generic objects from the accompanying camera images of LiDAR. These 2D boxes, together with LiDAR points, are then lifted back into the LiDAR space to estimate corresponding 3D boxes. For better generic object perception, our framework integrates both temporal and spatial-aware constraints. Temporal awareness correlates the predicted 3D boxes across consecutive timestamps, recalibrating the missed or inaccurate boxes. The spatial awareness randomly places some ``precisely'' estimated 3D boxes at varying distances, increasing the visibility of generic objects. To interpret the specific semantics of detected objects, we develop a cross-modal alignment and fusion module to first align 3D features with 2D image embeddings and then fuse the aligned 3D-2D features for semantic decoding. Our experiments indicate that our method establishes state-of-the-art open-vocabulary performance on widely used 3D detection benchmarks and effectively identifies objects for new categories of interest.
