Robotic avatars and telepresence technology enable people with disabilities to engage in physical work. Despite the recent popularity of the metaverse, few studies have explored the use of virtual avatars and environments by people with disabilities. In this study, seven disabled participants working in a cafe where remote customer service is provided via robotic avatars, were engaged in the development and use of personalized virtual avatars displayed on a large screen in-situ in combination with existing physical robots, creating a hybrid cyber-physical space. We conducted longitudinal semi-structured interviews to investigate the psychological changes experienced by the participants. The results revealed that mass-produced robotic avatars allowed participants to not disclose their disability if they did not want to, but also backgrounded their identities; by contrast, customized virtual avatars shaped without physical constraints, highlighted their personalities. The combined use of robotic and virtual avatars complemented each other and can support pilots in redefining their identity.
