The method of forming accurate charges of rubber composed of different sorts of rubber includes the steps of preparing for each sort a series of bales stored in a ready to feed condition on separate storing conveyors, successively discharging the required number of whole bales from respective series onto a common intermediate feeding conveyor wherefrom the batches of whole bales are supplied via a switching intermediate feeding conveyor to a scaling conveyor of an automatic scale. Part of whole bales is selectively directed to a cutting machine where the bales are successively disintegrated into smaller pieces and distributed according to the rubber sorts on separate storing and dosing conveyors directed to a hopper above the scaling conveyor. The whole plant is controlled by a programmable computer including a comparison stage which compares the actual weight of whole bales with the required weight and feeds via the scale hopper the amount of small rubber pieces from each sort which balances the weight difference. The cutting action of bales of one sort can take place simultaneously with the weighing action of whole bales of the other sort.
