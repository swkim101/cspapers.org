Human writers often *bookend* their writing with ending sentences that relate back to the beginning sentences in order to compose a satisfying narrative that “closes the loop.” Motivated by this observation, we propose RENarGen, a controllable story-generation paradigm that generates narratives by ensuring the first and last sentences are related and then infilling the middle sentences. Our contributions include an initial exploration of how various methods of bookending from Narratology affect language modeling for stories. Automatic and human evaluations indicate RENarGen produces better stories with more narrative closure than current autoregressive models.
