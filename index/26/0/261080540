In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for real-time super-resolution networks on mobile devices. To address this issue, many lightweight super-resolution models have been proposed. However, these models still contain time-consuming components that increase inference latency, limiting their real-world applications on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a novel model for single-image super-resolution based on Equivalent Transformation and Dual Stream network construction (ETDS). ET method is proposed to transform time-consuming operators into time-friendly operations, such as convolution and ReLU, on mobile devices. Then, a dual stream network is designed to alleviate redundant parameters resulting from the use of ET and enhance the feature extraction ability. Taking full advantage of the advance of ET and the dual stream network structure, we develop the efficient SR model ETDS for mobile devices. The experimental results demonstrate that our ETDS achieves superior inference speed and reconstruction quality compared to previous lightweight SR methods on mobile devices.
