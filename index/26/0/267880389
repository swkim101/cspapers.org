The JastAdd Extensible Java Compiler is a high quality Java compiler that is easy to extend in order to build static analysis tools for Java, and to extend Java with new language constructs. It is built modularly, with a Java 1.4 compiler that is extended to a Java 5 compiler. Example applications that are built as extensions include an alternative backend that generates Jimple, an extension of Java with AspectJ constructs, and the implementation of a pluggable type system for non-null checking and inferenc. The system is implemented using JastAdd, a declarative Java-like language. We describe the compiler architecture, the major design ideas for building and extending the compiler, in particular, for dealing with complex extensions that affect name and type analysis. Our extensible compiler compares very favorably concerning quality, speed and size with other extensible Java compiler frameworks. It also compares favorably in quality and size compared with traditional non-extensible Java compilers, and it runs within a factor of three compared to javac.
