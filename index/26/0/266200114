There is increasing evidence of the role of compromised mediolateral balance in falls and the need for rehabilitation specifically focused on mediolateral direction for various populations with motor deficits. To address this need, we have developed a neurorehabilitation platform by integrating a wearable robotic hip abduction-adduction exoskeleton with a visual interface. The platform is expected to influence and rehabilitate the underlying visuomotor mechanisms in individuals by having users perform motion tasks based on visual feedback while the robot applies various controlled resistances governed by the admittance controller implemented in the robot. A preliminary study was performed on 3 non disabled individuals to analyze the performance of the system and observe any adaptation in hip joint kinematics and kinetics as a result of the visuomotor training under 4 different admittance conditions. All three subjects exhibited increased consistency of motion during training and interlimb coordination to achieve motion tasks, demonstrating the utility of the system. Further analysis of observed human-robot torque interactions and electromyography (EMG) signals, and its implication in neurorehabilitation aimed at populations suffering from chronic stroke are discussed.
