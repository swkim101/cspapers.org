Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have gained popularity as a powerful tool for effectively modeling spatio-temporal dependencies in diverse real-world urban applications, including intelligent transportation and public safety. However, the black-box nature of STGNNs limits their interpretability, hindering their application in scenarios related to urban resource allocation and policy formulation. To bridge this gap, we propose an Explainable Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STExplainer) framework that enhances STGNNs with inherent explainability, enabling them to provide accurate predictions and faithful explanations simultaneously. Our framework integrates a unified spatio-temporal graph attention network with a positional information fusion layer as the STG encoder and decoder, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a structure distillation approach based on the Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) principle with an explainable objective, which is instantiated by the STG encoder and decoder. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our STExplainer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of predictive accuracy and explainability metrics (i.e., sparsity and fidelity) on traffic and crime prediction tasks. Furthermore, our model exhibits superior representation ability in alleviating data missing and sparsity issues. The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/STExplainer.
