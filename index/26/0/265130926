For a generalized (or non-central) camera model, the minimal problem for two views of six points has efficient solvers. However, minimal problems of three views with four points and three views of six lines have not yet been explored and solved, despite the efforts from the computer vision community. This paper develops the formulations of these two minimal problems and shows how state-of-the-art GPU implementations of Homotopy Continuation solver can be used effectively. The proposed methods are evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that they are fast, accurate and that they improve on structure from motion estimations, when employed in an hypothesis and test setting.
