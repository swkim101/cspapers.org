 Resilience is broadly understood as the capacity of a system to absorb, adapt, and transform in response to significant changes in its external environment. Improving resilience requires design trade-offs, for example, increases in equipment capacity and capital costs. This paper explores resilience trade-offs for food security and crop production of agricultural systems representing the small-scale farms dominant in low-income regions of the world. In this study, resilience assessment metrics are incorporated into a water-energy-food nexus optimization method to quantify resilience trade-offs. As an illustrative case, the previously developed system modeling and optimization framework INRCD-OPT is applied to the case study of small-scale farming in the Kampala region of Uganda to examine trade-offs between investments in irrigation driven by renewable energy microgrids and farm resilience during drought years. Optimal farm designs for baseline climate parameters show that a tailored microgrid capacity and irrigation strategy is needed to maximize profit under different climate conditions. Results optimizing for average profit across varying climate conditions show that a “resilient” farm design balances a smaller microgrid with a more aggressive irrigation strategy, navigating the trade-off between capital investment, operating cost, and crop yields under drought conditions. This type of analysis can inform long-term planning for resilience and the value of investments to achieve increased food security and crop production stability.
