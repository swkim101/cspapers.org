Quantum computing has shown promise in solving complex problems by leveraging the principles of superposition and entanglement. Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a class of algorithms suited for near-term quantum computers due to their modest requirements of qubits and depths of computation. This paper introduces Tetris â€“ a compilation framework for VQA applications on near-term quantum devices. Tetris focuses on reducing two-qubit gates in the compilation process since a two-qubit gate has an order of magnitude more significant error and execution time than a single-qubit gate. Tetris exploits unique opportunities in the circuit synthesis stage often overlooked by the state-of-the-art VQA compilers for reducing the number of two-qubit gates. Tetris comes with a refined IR of Pauli string to express such a two-qubit gate optimization opportunity. Moreover, Tetris is equipped with a fast bridging approach that mitigates the hardware mapping cost. Overall, Tetris demonstrates a reduction of up to $41.3 \%$ in CNOT gate counts, $37.9 \%$ in circuit depth, and $\mathbf{4 2. 6 \%}$ in circuit duration for various molecules of different sizes and structures compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.
