Simulation systems of robots can facilitate the prediction, development, and debugging of robotic systems. However, they seldom applied in robotics education for primary and secondary school students. In this paper, we present a sim-to-real robotic system that enables students to optimize their algorithms in a simulated environment and validate them in a remote physical laboratory with data logs and remote cameras. Moreover, the system employs an automated submit-test-reset subsystem that minimizes the need for human intervention and provides 24/7 testing support. Experimental data from a trial with 28 students in remote areas show that the sim-to-real robotic experimental environment has comparable learning outcomes to a pure real robot environment and is significantly better than a pure simulation environment. Given the results, we validate that our system can substantially reduce the costs of teaching equipment and space while maintaining high-quality robotics education.
