Diversity is a vital factor in recommendation systems.Improving the diversity in recommendations helps broaden users' horizons, bring good user experience and promote the enterprises' sales. In the past years, many efforts have been devoted to optimizing the diversity in the matching stage and the re-ranking stage of the recommendation system, but few in the ranking stage. The ranking stage is the intermediate stage of the recommendation system. Improving the diversity of the ranking stage can preserve the diversity of the matching stage, and provide a more diversified list for the re-ranking stage. Besides, the ranking models are able to achieve a better balance between accuracy and diversity. In this paper, we aim to improve the diversity in the ranking stage. To address the diversity challenges posed by the pointwise ranking model and biased user interaction history, we propose a Diversity-aware Deep Ranking Network by carefully designing two diversity-aware components that are diversity-aware listwise information fusion and balanced weighting loss. We conduct both offline and online experiments, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model effectively improves the recommendation diversity in the ranking stage while maintaining the accuracy. Moreover, the new model achieves 1.27%, 2.30% and 1.98% improvements in VBR, GMV and Coverage in Meituan, one of the world's largest E-commerce platforms.
