We study a fault-tolerant generalization of the classical uncapacitated facility location problem. We want to open a subset of facilities from a given set F and assign each client j in a given set D to rj ≥ 1 distinct open facilities so as to minimize the sum of the facility opening costs and the client assignment costs. We also consider the fault-tolerant k-median problem where instead of facility costs we are given a number k of facilities that may be opened, and the objective is to minimize only the assignment cost. Multiple facilities provide a safeguard against failures. If the facility closest to a client ‘fails’, the other facilities assigned to it could be used to serve it, e.g., in designing a network involving the placement of caches or routers, one would like to connect a client to multiple caches or routers so as to be resistant under node or link failures. We consider the case where the distances, cij , form a metric.
