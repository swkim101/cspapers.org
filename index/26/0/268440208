The aim of this poster is to present and discuss a curricular methodology to introduce computability topics to social sciences and economics students during the study of their CS subjects in the first courses. These TCS topics give rise to algorithmic impossibility and computational undecidability results which serve to increase students' motivation in their CSE in relation to their university studies. In addition, it allows them to acquire paradoxical and computational thinking skills, with which to deepen and raise computability questions in later courses. To support the impact of the new methodology with evidence, we have analyzed preliminary student results.
