Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a core task in recommender systems. Existing methods (IDRec for short) rely on unique identities to represent distinct users and items that have prevailed for decades. On one hand, IDRec often faces significant performance degradation on cold-start problem; on the other hand, IDRec cannot use longer training data due to constraints imposed by iteration efficiency. Most prior studies alleviate the above problems by introducing pre-trained knowledge(e.g. pre-trained user model or multi-modal embeddings). However, the explosive growth of online latency can be attributed to the huge parameters in the pre-trained model. Therefore, most of them cannot employ the unified model of end-to-end training with IDRec in industrial recommender systems, thus limiting the potential of the pre-trained model. To this end, we propose a pre-trained plug-in CTR model, namely PPM. PPM employs multi-modal features as input and utilizes large-scale data for pre-training. Then, PPM is plugged in IDRec model to enhance unified model's performance and iteration efficiency. Upon incorporating IDRec model, certain intermediate results within the network are cached, with only a subset of the parameters participating in training and serving. Hence, our approach can successfully deploy an end-to-end model without causing huge latency increases. Comprehensive offline experiments and online A/B testing at JD E-commerce demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PPM.
