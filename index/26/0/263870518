Interactive graphical applications implicitly contain a large number of constraints -- relationships between objects, such as widgets and the underlying model they control. Encapsulation, a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming, is only guaranteed in a very limited sense by most object-oriented languages. ConstrainedJava provides a constraint system built upon stronger encapsulation guarantees which allows constraints to depend on entire aggregated objects.
