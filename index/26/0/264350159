Warehouse-distribution integration has been adopted by many e-commerce retailers (e.g., Amazon, TAOBAO, and JD) as an efficient business mode. In warehouse-distribution integration e-commerce, one of the most important problems is to estimate the full-link delivery time for better decision-making. Existing solutions for traditional warehouse-distribution separation mode are challenging to address this problem due to two unique features in the integration mode including (i) contextual influence caused by neighbor units in heterogeneous delivery networks, (ii) uncertain delivery time caused by the dynamic temporal data (e.g., online sales volume) and heterogeneity of delivery units. To incorporate these new factors, we propose Heterogeneous Spatial-Temporal Graph Transformer (HST-GT), a novel full-link delivery time estimation method under the warehouse-distribution integration mode, where we (i) develop heterogeneous graph transformers to capture hierarchical heterogeneous information; and (ii) design a set of spatial-temporal transformers based on heterogeneous features to fully exploit the correlation of spatial and temporal information. We extensively evaluate our method based on one-month real-world data consisting of hundreds of warehouses and sorting centers, and millions of historical orders collected from one of the largest e-commerce retailers in the world. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.
