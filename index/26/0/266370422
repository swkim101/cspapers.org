Social media has become an integral part of the lives of young people, who, despite being regarded as digital natives, lack essential skills in terms of the reflective use of data, thus underscoring the potential of computing education to empower their data literacy. To this end, this paper presents InstaClone, an innovative educational tool for classrooms that allows students to engage with social media platforms within a secure learning environment. With an appearance and functionality resembling Instagram, InstaClone offers a lifelike learning environment in which students can generate data, which are then processed and visualized on integrated data analytics dashboards, facilitating the development of individual data literacy. A case study with year 9 and year 10 students in a K-12 computer science class demonstrated that InstaClone convincingly emulates the real platform and that students benefit from using the tool by developing a deeper understanding of the data collected by social media platforms and the underlying algorithms.
