In recent few years, DeepFakes are posing serve threats and concerns to both individuals and celebrities, as realistic DeepFakes facilitate the spread of disinformation. Model attribution techniques aim at attributing the adopted forgery models of DeepFakes for provenance purposes and providing explainable results to DeepFake forensics. However, the existing model attribution techniques rely on the trace left in the DeepFake creation, which can become futile if such traces were disrupted. Motivated by our observation that certain traces served for model attribution appeared in both the high-frequency and low-frequency domains and play a divergent role in model attribution. In this work, for the first time, we propose a novel training-free evasion attack, TraceEvader, in the most practical non-box setting. Specifically, TraceEvader injects a universal imitated traces learned from wild DeepFakes into the high-frequency component and introduces adversarial blur into the domain of the low-frequency component, where the added distortion confuses the extraction of certain traces for model attribution. The comprehensive evaluation on 4 state-of-the-art (SOTA) model attribution techniques and fake images generated by 8 generative models including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs) demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Overall, our TraceEvader achieves the highest average attack success rate of 79% and is robust against image transformations and dedicated denoising techniques as well where the average attack success rate is still around 75%. Our TraceEvader confirms the limitations of current model attribution techniques and calls the attention of DeepFake researchers and practitioners for more robust-purpose model attribution techniques.
