Despite efforts to raise awareness of societal and ethical issues in CS education, research shows students often do not act upon their new awareness (Problem 1). One such issue, well-established by HCI research, is that much of technology contains barriers impacting numerous populations—such as minoritized genders, races, ethnicities, and more. HCI has inclusive design methods that help—but these skills are rarely taught, even in HCI classes (Problem 2). To address Problems 1 and 2, we created the Matchmaker Curriculum to pair CS faculty—including non-HCI faculty—with inclusive design elements to allow for inclusive design skill-building throughout their CS program. We present the curriculum and a field study, in which we followed 18 faculty along their journey. The results show how the Matchmaker Curriculum equipped 88% of these faculty with enough inclusive design teaching knowledge to successfully embed actionable inclusive design skill-building into 13 CS courses.
