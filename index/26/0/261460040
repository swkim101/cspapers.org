In e-commerce sites, customer questions on the product details-page express the customers' information needs about the product. The answers to these questions often provide the necessary information. In this work, we present and address the novel task of generating product insights from community questions and answers (Q&A). These insights can be presented to customers to assist them in their shopping journey. Our method first generates concise, self-contained sentences based on the information in the Q&A. Then insights are selected based on the prominence of their associated questions. Empirical evaluation attests to the effectiveness of our approach in generating well-formed, objective, and helpful insights that are often not available in the product description or in summaries of customer reviews.
