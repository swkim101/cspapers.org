Recommendation systems have attracted attention from academia and industry due to their wide range of application scenarios. However, cold start remains a challenging problem limited by sparse user interactions. Some scholars propose to transfer the dense information from the source domain to the target domain through cross-domain recommendation, but most of the work assumes that there is a small amount of historical interaction in the target domain. However, this approach essentially presupposes the existence of at least some historical interaction within the target domain. In this paper, we focus on the domain-level zero-shot recommendation (DZSR) problem. To address the above challenges, we propose a knowledge-aware cross-semantic alignment (K-CSA) framework to learn transferable source domain semantic information. The motivation is to establish stable alignments of interests in different domains through class semantic descriptions (CSDs). Specifically, due to the lack of effective information in the target domain, we learn semantic representations of source and target domain items based on knowledge graphs. Moreover, we conduct multi-view K-means to extract item CSDs from the learned semantic representations. Further, K-CSA learns universal user CSDs through the designed multi-head self-attention. To facilitate the transference of user interest from the source domain to the target domain, we devise a cross-semantic contrastive learning strategy, grounded in the prototype distribution matrix. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world cross-domain datasets, and the experimental results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed K-CSA compared with other baselines.
