In many practical binary classification applications, such as financial fraud detection or medical diagnosis, it is crucial to optimize a model's performance on high-confidence samples whose scores are higher than a specific threshold, which is calculated by a given false positive rate according to practical requirements. However, the proportion of high-confidence samples is typically extremely small, especially in long-tailed datasets, which can lead to poor recall results and an alignment bias between realistic goals and loss. To address this challenge, we propose a novel loss reweighting framework called Momentum Threshold-Oriented Loss (MTOL) for binary classification tasks and propose two instantiated losses of it. Given a limited FPR range, MTOL aims to improve the recall of binary classification models at that FPR range by incorporating a batch memory queue and momentum estimation mechanisms. The MTOL adaptively estimates thresholds of FPR during the model training iterations and up-weights the loss of samples in the threshold range, with little consumption of storage and computation. Our experimental results on various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate the significant effect of MTOL in improving the recall at low FPR especially in class imbalance settings. These results suggest that MTOL is a promising approach in scenarios where the model's performance in the low FPR range is of utmost importance.
