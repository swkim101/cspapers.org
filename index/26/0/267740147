Short videos on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts (i.e. short-form videos) have become a primary source of information and entertainment. Many short-form videos are inaccessible to blind and low vision (BLV) viewers due to their rapid visual changes, on-screen text, and music or meme-audio overlays. In our formative study, 7 BLV viewers who regularly watched short-form videos reported frequently skipping such inaccessible content. We present ShortScribe, a system that provides hierarchical visual summaries of short-form videos at three levels of detail to support BLV viewers in selecting and understanding short-form videos. ShortScribe allows BLV users to navigate between video descriptions based on their level of interest. To evaluate ShortScribe, we assessed description accuracy and conducted a user study with 10 BLV participants comparing ShortScribe to a baseline interface. When using ShortScribe, participants reported higher comprehension and provided more accurate summaries of video content.
