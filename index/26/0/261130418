Wearable devices like smartwatches and smart wristbands have gained substantial popularity in recent years. However, their small interfaces create inconvenience and limit computing functionality. To fill this gap, we propose ViWatch, which enables robust finger interactions under deployment variations, and relies on a single IMU sensor that is ubiquitous in COTS smartwatches. To this end, we design an unsupervised Siamese adversarial learning method. We built a real-time system on commodity smartwatches and tested it with over one hundred volunteers. Results show that the system accuracy is about 97% over a week. In addition, it is resistant to deployment variations such as different hand shapes, finger activity strengths, and smartwatch positions on the wrist. We also developed a number of mobile applications using our interactive system and conducted a user study where all participants preferred our unsupervised approach to supervised calibration.
