It is neither effective nor profitable for individuals to attempt to bypass Ant Group's comprehensive risk control system. However, there are still criminals (such as underground loan sharks and professional hackers,), who may teach borrowers how to use hacking techniques to circumvent Ant Group and its partners' risk control system. Despite the fact that our risk control system has greatly reduced fraud losses for merchants in practice, a significant number of intermediary-related frauds still occur. During our investigation into fraud events at Zhima Credit Renting (ZCR), we discovered that more than 30 percent of fraud cases were directly linked to malicious intermediaries. To address this issue, we propose an anti-abettor fraud detection framework, called FAF (Fraud-Abettor-Fraud), specifically designed to combat intermediary-related frauds on an industry-wide scale. We have developed a series of algorithms under the FAF framework, which outperform commonly used risk detection methods and meet real-world business requirements. In this paper, we use ZCR's risk management application as a real-world example-which has deployed FAF for over 1 year-to demonstrate the superiority of the FAF framework compared to existing methods.
