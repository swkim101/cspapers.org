Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) play a crucial role in creating immersive spatial audio experiences. However, HRTFs differ significantly from person to person, and traditional methods for estimating personalized HRTFs are expensive, time-consuming, and require specialized equipment. We imagine a world where your personalized HRTF can be determined by capturing data through earbuds in everyday environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for deriving personalized HRTFs that only relies on in-the-wild binaural recordings and head tracking data. By analyzing how sounds change as the user rotates their head through different environments with different noise sources, we can accurately estimate their personalized HRTF. Our results show that our predicted HRTFs closely match ground-truth HRTFs measured in an anechoic chamber. Furthermore, listening studies demonstrate that our personalized HRTFs significantly improve sound localization and reduce front-back confusion in virtual environments. Our approach offers an efficient and accessible method for deriving personalized HRTFs and has the potential to greatly improve spatial audio experiences.
