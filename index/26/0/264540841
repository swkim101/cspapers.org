Trajectory optimization methods have become ubiquitous for the motion planning and control of underactuated robots for e.g., quadrupeds, humanoids etc. While they have been extensively used in the case of serial or tree type robots, they are seldomly used for planning and control of robots with closed loops. Series-parallel hybrid topology is quite commonly used in the design of humanoid robots, but they are often neglected during trajectory optimization and the movements are computed for a serial abstraction of the system and then the solution is mapped to the actuator coordinates. As a consequence, the full capability of the robot cannot be exploited. This paper presents a case study of trajectory optimization for series-parallel hybrid robot by taking into account all the holonomic constraints imposed by the closed kinematic loops present in the system. We demonstrate the advantages of this consideration with a weightlifting task on RH5 Manus humanoid in both simulation and experiments.
