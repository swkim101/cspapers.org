Dictionary learning, which approximates data samples by a set of shared atoms, is a fundamental task in representation learning. However, dictionary learning over graphs, namely graph dictionary learning (GDL), is much more challenging than vectorial data as graphs lie in disparate metric spaces. The sparse literature on GDL formulates the problem from the reconstructive view and often learns linear graph embeddings with a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) Mixture Model named F RA M E to address the GDL problem from the generative view. Equipped with the graph generation function based on the radial basis function kernel and FGW distance, F RA M E generates nonlinear embedding spaces, which, as we theoretically proved, provide a good approximation of the original graph spaces. A fast solu-tion is further proposed on top of the expectation-maximization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained node and graph embeddings, and our algorithm achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.
