Broad adoption of online travel platforms (OTPs) has led to increasing focus on hotel dynamic pricing algorithms, which directly affect the revenue of platform and hotels. Existing approaches, which directly model the correlation between price and occupancy, have limitations in improving occupancy prediction accuracy while ensuring interpretability for dynamic pricing. Moreover, these methods struggle to address the significant data sparsity issue in hotel pricing scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Causality-driven Hotel Dynamic Pricing Model (CANDY) that captures the essential causal relationship between price and occupancy, enhancing occupancy prediction accuracy and interpretability for dynamic pricing. Specifically, we decompose confounders into three orthogonal groups of factors: characteristic factors, competitive factors, and temporal factors, and design submodules to capture the features of each dimension. To address the treatment bias and sample imbalance issues faced by existing causal inference methods in hotel pricing scenarios, we propose a novel data augmentation method based on the monotonic relationship between price and occupancy, and further design a multi-task learning framework tailored to multi-valued treatment scenarios, simultaneously alleviating the data sparsity issue. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CANDY in occupancy prediction and dynamic pricing. CANDY has been successfully deployed to provide price suggestion service at Fliggy, a leading OTP in China, serving thousands of hotel operators.
