A major challenge for narrative reasoning 001 is to learn narrative coherence. Existing 002 works mainly follow the contrastive learning 003 paradigm. However, the negative samples 004 in their methods can be easily distinguished, 005 which makes their methods unsatisfactory. In 006 this work, we devise two strategies for mining 007 hard negatives, including (1) crisscrossing a 008 narrative and its contrastive variants; and (2) 009 event-level replacement. To obtain contrastive 010 variants, we utilize the Brownian Bridge pro-011 cess to guarantee the quality of generated con-012 trastive narratives. We evaluate our model on 013 several tasks. The result proves the effective-014 ness of our method, and shows that our method 015 is applicable to many applications. 016
