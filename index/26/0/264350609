As malicious bots reside in a network to disrupt network stability, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as one of the most popular bot detection methods. However, in most cases these graphs are significantly class-imbalanced. To address this issue, graph oversampling has recently been proposed to synthesize nodes and edges, which still suffers from graph heterophily, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose HOVER, which implements Homophilic Oversampling Via Edge Removal for bot detection on graphs. Instead of oversampling nodes and edges within initial graph structure, HOVER designs a simple edge removal method with heuristic criteria to mitigate heterophily and learn distinguishable node embeddings, which are then used to oversample minority bots to generate a balanced class distribution without edge synthesis. Experiments on TON IoT networks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HOVER on bot detection with high graph heterophily and extreme class imbalance.
