Individuals with low vision (LV) can experience vision-related challenges when participating in sports, especially those with fast-moving objects. We introduce ARTennis, a prototype for wearable augmented reality (AR) that utilizes real-time computer vision (CV) to enhance the visual saliency of tennis balls. Preliminary findings indicate that while ARTennis is helpful, combining both visual and auditory cues may be more effective. As AR and CV technologies continue to improve, we expect head-worn AR to broaden the inclusivity of sports.
