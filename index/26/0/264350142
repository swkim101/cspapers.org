As an emerging learning paradigm, lifelong learning intends to solve multiple consecutive tasks over long-time scales upon previously accumulated knowledge. When facing with a new task, existing lifelong learning approaches need first gather sufficient training data to identify task relationships before knowledge transfer can succeed. However, annotating large number of training data persistently for every coming task is time-consuming, which can be prohibitive for real-world lifelong regression problems. To reduce this burden, we propose to incorporate weak regression into lifelong learning so as to enhance training data and improve predictive performance. Specifically, the weak prediction is first produced by single-task predictor, which is encoded as feature vectors that contain essential prior output information. This weak regression is further linked with task model via coupled dictionary learning. The integration of weak regression and task model can facilitate both cross-task and inter-task knowledge transfer, thus improving the overall performance. More critically, the weak regression can backup the task model especially when there is insufficient training data to construct an accurate model. Three real-world datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Results show that our method outperforms existing lifelong models and single-task models even if training data is minimal.
