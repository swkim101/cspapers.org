Accessible high-quality data is the bread and butter of machine learning research, 1 and the demand for data has exploded as larger and more advanced ML models are 2 built across different domains. Yet, real data often contain sensitive information, 3 subject to various biases, and are costly to acquire, which compromise their quality 4 and accessibility. Synthetic data have thus emerged as a complement, sometimes 5 even a replacement, to real data for ML training. However, the landscape of 6 synthetic data research has been fragmented due to the large number of data
