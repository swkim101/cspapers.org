The UC Berkeley CS Kickstart initiative represents a novel approach in addressing the underrepresentation of women in the tech industry. This paper evaluates the efficacy of its one-week intensive curriculum in computer science, particularly focusing on first-year female-identifying university students. The 2023 program cohort witnessed the introduction of a dual-track system, accommodating both beginners and students with prior experience. This study emphasizes the findings from enhanced survey methods and involved detailed pre-program and post-program assessments that gauged the initiative's success in imparting foundational knowledge and fostering enthusiasm in computer science. The findings reveal that such targeted, short-term educational programs significantly contribute to advancing diversity and inclusion in computer science education. The results suggest that early intervention at the university level can play a pivotal role in shaping a more diverse future in the tech landscape.
