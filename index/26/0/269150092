â€”Diverse solutions to the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem are essential for thorough testing and verification of software and hardware designs, ensuring reliability and applicability to real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel differentiable sampling method, called D IFF S AMPLER , which employs gradient descent (GD) to learn diverse solutions to the SAT problem. By formulating SAT as a supervised multi-output regression task and minimizing its loss function using GD, our approach enables performing the learning operations in parallel, leading to GPU-accelerated sampling and comparable run time performance w.r.t. heuristic samplers. We demonstrate that D IFF S AMPLER can generate diverse uniform-like solutions similar to conventional samplers.
