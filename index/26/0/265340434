In this paper, we propose a solution to improve the reliability of the SPC in VLC system via concatenating the messages of each pair of users in the downlink and power allocation. The codeword of concatenated message is spread over frequency and power domains according to the OMANOMA technique to satisfy the stringent latency constraints under limited system resources. The proposed solution is validated via normal approximation (NA) results, which demonstrate superior performance compared with existing solutions.
