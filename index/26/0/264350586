Proactive streaming analytics continuously extract real-time business value from massive data that stream in data centers or clouds. This requires (a) to process the data while they are still in motion; (b) to scale the processing to multiple machines, often over various, dispersed computer clusters, with diverse Big Data technologies; and (c) to forecast complex business events for proactive decision-making. Combining the necessary facilities for proactive streaming analytics at scale entails: (I) deep knowledge of the relevant state-of-the-art, (II) cherry-picking cutting edge research outcomes based on desired features and with the prospect of building interoperable components, and (III) building components and deploying them into a holistic architecture within a real-world platform. In this tutorial, we drive the audience through the whole journey from (I) to (III), delivering cutting edge research into a commercial analytics platform, for which we provide a hands-on experience.
