Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the anonymous user's next-click items by modeling the short-term sequence pattern. As most existing SBR models generally generate item representations based only on information propagation over the short sequence while ignoring additional valuable knowledge, their expressive abilities are somewhat limited by data sparsity caused by short sequence. Though there have been some attempts on utilizing items' attributes, they basically embed attributes into items directly, ignoring the fact that 1) there is no contextual relationship among attributes; and 2) users have varying levels of attention to different attributes, which still leads to unsatisfactory performance. To tackle the issues, we propose a novel Attribute-enhanced Dual Channel Representation Learning (ADRL) model for SBR, in which we independently model session representations in attribute-related pattern and sequence-related pattern. Specifically, we learn session representations with sequence patterns from the session graph, and we further design an frequency-driven attribute aggregator to generate the attribute-related session representations within a session. The proposed attribute aggregator is plug-and-play, as it can be coupled with most existing SBR models. Extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ADRL over several state-of-the-art baselines, as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of our attribute aggregator module.
