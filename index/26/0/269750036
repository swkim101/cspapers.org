Measuring the subjective experience of digital game players is essential to player experience research. Recently, the Player Experience Inventory (PXI) was developed, which assesses both functional and psychosocial consequences of digital gameplay. We present a pre-registered independent online study with a large sample to provide additional evidence of psychometric quality for the PXI. Responses from 1518 participants were collected, rating a recent or memorable experience playing a digital game using the PXI and related measures. While our results from standard psychometric reliability and validity analyses generally favored the PXI, we also identified challenges with the immersion construct. Further, we find a ten-factor model, or alternatively, an 11-factor should enjoyment be measured, to fit our collected data best. In sum, the PXI is a valuable tool to measure a variety of constructs central to player experience.
