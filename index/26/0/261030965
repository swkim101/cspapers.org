Thriving underwater applications demand efficient extreme compression technology to realize the transmission of underwater images (UWIs) in very narrow underwater bandwidth. However, existing image compression methods achieve inferior performance on UWIs because they do not consider the characteristics of UWIs: (1) Multifarious underwater styles of color shift and distance-dependent clarity, caused by the unique underwater physical imaging; (2) Massive redundancy between different UWIs, caused by the fact that different UWIs contain several common ocean objects, which have plenty of similarities in structures and semantics. To remove redundancy among UWIs, we first construct an exhaustive underwater multi-scale feature dictionary to provide coarse-to-fine reference features for UWI compression. Subsequently, an extreme UWI compression network with reference to the feature dictionary (RFD-ECNet) 1 is creatively proposed, which utilizes feature match and reference feature variant to significantly remove redundancy among UWIs. To align the multifarious underwater styles and improve the accuracy of feature match, an underwater style normalized block (USNB) is proposed, which utilizes underwater physical priors extracted from the underwater physical imaging model to normalize the underwater styles of dictionary features toward the input. Moreover, a reference feature variant module (RFVM) is designed to adaptively morph the reference features, improving the similarity between the reference and input features. Experimental results on four UWI datasets show that our RFD-ECNet is the first work that achieves a significant BDrate saving of 31% over the most advanced VVC.
