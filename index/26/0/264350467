The data heterogeneity has been a challenging issue in federated learning in both training and inference stages, which motivates a variety of approaches to learn either personalized models for participating clients or test-time adaptations for unseen clients. One such approach is employing a shared feature representation and a customized classifier head for each client. However, previous works either neglect the global head with rich knowledge or assume the new clients have enough labeled data, which significantly limit their broader practicality. In this work, we propose a lightweight framework to tackle with the label shift issue during the model deployment by test priors estimation and model prediction calibration. We also demonstrate the importance of training a balanced global model in FL so as to guarantee the general effectiveness of prior estimation approaches. Evaluation results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework for model adaptation in unseen clients with unknown label shifts.
