This work proposes and analyzes IncepSeqNet which is a new model combining the Inception Module with the innovative Multi-Shape Augmentation technique. IncepSeqNet excels in feature extraction from sequence signal data consisting of a number of complex numbers to achieve superior classification accuracy across various SNR(Signal-to-Noise Ratio) environments. Experimental results demonstrate IncepSeqNetâ€™s outperformance of existing models, particularly at low SNR levels. Furthermore, we have confirmed its applicability in practical 5G systems by using real-world signal data.
