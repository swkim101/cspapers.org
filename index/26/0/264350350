The rapid rise and prevalence of social platforms have created great demands on effective schemes to limit the influence of negative information, e.g., blocking key vertices for influence minimization. However, there is currently no system providing practical schemes to solve the negative influence minimization problem with a blocking budget effectively and efficiently in the literature. In this demo, we present IMinimize, the first interactive system that provides audiences with vertex-blocking schemes over different budgets and demonstrates via visualization for comparison vividly and directly, aiming to help minimize the negative influence spreading in networks. Our IMinimize system applies an advanced greedy algorithm to select blocked vertices with both high efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, we extend IMinimize to the application of epidemic controlling and prevention and show the usability of IMinimize through two case studies of real-life applications.
