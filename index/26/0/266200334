This study extends the whole-body control (WBC) formulation for bipedal humanoid robots that include closed (parallel) kinematic chains in their structure. Along with general formulation, we also stress the implementation of this formulation on Kangaroo, which is a highly dynamic humanoid robot developed by PAL Robotics. This 76-DOF robot includes 24 independent closed-kinematic chains in its structure and constitutes a good case study for our approach. We discuss the WBC formulation for various control structures, including inverse dynamics control (IDC) and Modular Passive Tracking Control (MPTC). As a test scenario, we employ a 3D spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) jumping trajectory with disturbance rejection as the desired CoM trajectory.
