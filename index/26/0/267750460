We analyze how numerical experiments regarding elections were conducted within computational social choice literature (focusing on papers published in the IJCAI, AAAI, and AAMAS conferences). We analyze the sizes of the studied elections and the methods of generating preference data, thereby making previously hidden standards and practices explicit. In particular, we survey a number of statistical cultures for generating elections and their commonly used parameters.
