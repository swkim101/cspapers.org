GNN-based recommender systems have shown their vulnerability to shilling attacks in recent studies. By conducting shilling attacks on recommender systems, the attackers aim to have homogeneous impacts on all users. However, such indiscriminate attacks suffer from a waste of resources because even if the target item is promoted to users who are not interested, they are unlikely to click on them. In this paper, we conduct targeted shilling attacks in GNN-based recommender systems. By automatically constructing the features and edges of the fake users, our proposed framework AutoAttack achieves accurate attacks on a specific group of users while minimizing the impact on non-target users. Specifically, the features of fake users are generated based on a similarity function, which is optimized according to the features of target users. The structure of fake users is learned by conducting spectral clustering on the target users based on their graph Laplacian matrix, which contains the degree and adjacency information that provides guidance to the edge generation of fake users. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets in different GNN-based RS and evaluate the performance of our method on the shilling attack and recommendation tasks comprehensively, showing the effectiveness and flexibility of our framework.
