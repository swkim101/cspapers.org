Despite significant progress in recent years, few-shot learning (FSL) still faces two critical challenges. Firstly, most FSL solutions in the training phase rely on exploiting auxiliary tasks, while target tasks are underutilized. Secondly, current benchmarks sample numerous target tasks, each with only an N-way C-shot shot query set in the evaluation phase, which is not representative of real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Guidepost, a target-oriented FSL method that can implicitly learn task similarities using a task-level learn-to-learn mechanism and then re-weight auxiliary tasks. Additionally, we introduce a new FSL benchmark that satisfies realistic needs and aligns with our target-oriented approach. Mainstream FSL methods struggle under this new experimental setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Guidepost outperforms two classical few-shot learners, i.e., MAML and ProtoNet, and one state-of-the-art few-shot learner, i.e., RENet, on several FSL image datasets. Furthermore, we implement Guidepost as a domain adaptor to achieve high accuracy wireless sensing on our collected WiFi-based human activity recognition dataset.
