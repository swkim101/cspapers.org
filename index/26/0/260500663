Artificial Intelligence (AI) has enabled breakthroughs on sports analytics in recent years by allowing the extraction of valuable insights and new understandings from vast amounts of sports data. However, due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of the topic, cross-pollination of ideas and methodologies between AI and sports science as well as across different sports remain limited. To address the gap, we propose the first KDD workshop on Data Science and AI for Sports. We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners working on a broad array of sports-related AI/ML use cases, to exchange research ideas, draw connection among various disciplines, and identify challenges and new research questions for future work.
