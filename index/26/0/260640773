The Web Mashup Scripting Language (WMSL) enables an end-user (you) working from his browser, e.g. not needing any other infrastructure, to quickly write mashups that integrate any two, or more, web services on the Web. The end-user accomplishes this by writing a web page that combines HTML, metadata in the form of mapping relations, and small piece of code, or script. The mapping relations enable not only the discovery and retrieval of the WMSL pages, but also affect a new programming paradigm that abstracts many programming complexities from the script writer. Furthermore, the WMSL Web pages or scripts that disparate end-users (you) write, can be harvested by Crawlers to automatically generate the concepts needed to build lightweight ontologies containing local semantics of a web service and its data model, to extend context ontologies or middle ontologies, and to develop links, or mappings, between these ontologies. This enables an open-source model of building ontologies based on the WMSL Web page or scripts that end users (you) write.
