Prior compositional methods in LTLf to DFA conversion have focussed on improving the composition phase. In this work, we examine improvements to the decomposition phase that result in overall improvements in LTLf to DFA translation. Our work is based on reducing the structure of the underlying Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a formula such that the new AST results in fewer composition operations.
