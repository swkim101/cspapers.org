With the widespread development of decentralized storage, it is increasingly popular for users to store their data to the decentralized database systems for the well-understood benefits of outsourced storage. To ensure the data privacy, systems commonly require users to securely keep their private keys. Thus, the secure storage of private keys is an important issue in these systems. However, existing key-management schemes commonly rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP), which raises critical security concerns such as the single point of failure and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose HasDPSS, a secure and efficient blockchain-based key-management scheme for decentralized storage systems. It uses secret sharing, a lightweight cryptographic technique, to build the decentralized key-management scheme. Considering that the reliability of managing participants has inherent heterogeneity, we introduce the hierarchical access structure to achieve fine-grained key management. Meanwhile, to adapt the node churn of decentralized key management, HasDPSS enables a dynamic management committee to provide reliable services with a proactive refresh mechanism while protecting the integrity and security of private keys. In our design, we use the dimension switch method of polynomials in the evolving process to achieve the committee change of the hierarchical access structure. The reliability of participants is guaranteed by the customized commitment protocol and the immutable property of the blockchain. We thoroughly analyze security strengths and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the practicality of our design.
