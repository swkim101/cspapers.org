 This paper proposes a method for optimizing the orientation of multi-directionally reinforced materials that exhibit rotational symmetry, such as woven CFRP sheets or laminated CFRP sheets. The orientation is represented in a “relaxed” Cartesian format, and symmetry modifications are employed to prevent overlapping design variables for identical material constants. The optimal orientation is estimated using topological derivatives for anisotropic materials, and the orientation distribution is subsequently optimized based on this estimate. The proposed method is validated using a range of numerical examples of elasticity problems.
