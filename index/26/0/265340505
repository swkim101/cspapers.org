The Han-Nom language, an ancient language of Vietnam, played a significant role in the countryâ€™s history. Its script, known as the Nom script, evolved and flourished between the 10th and 20th centuries. Initially employed for recording names of individuals and locations, the Nom script gradually gained popularity and became integrated into the cultural fabric of the nation. However, over time, the usage and knowledge of the Han-Nom language have waned, leading to its gradual obscurity. To address this issue, we present an innovative translation tool in this article, leveraging the power of deep learning techniques. Our tool focuses on translating Han-Nom script to Vietnamese, the contemporary language of Vietnam. For the translation task, we employ two popular deep learning models: the Transformer and Seq2Seq models. The results obtained from our experiments indicate that both the Transformer and Seq2Seq models achieve satisfactory translations, with the Transformer model exhibiting slightly better performance compared to the Seq2Seq model in terms of BLEU scores. While the translations may not yet be flawless, these initial outcomes provide promising prospects for the preservation and understanding of the Han-Nom language using deep learning techniques.
