Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are a collection of facts describing entities connected by relationships. KG embeddings map entities and relations into a vector space while preserving their relational semantics. This enables effective inference of missing knowledge from the embedding space. Most KG embedding approaches focused on triple-shaped KGs. A great amount of real-world knowledge, however, cannot simply be represented by triples. In this tutorial, we give a systematic introduction to KG embeddings that go beyond the triple representation. In particular, the tutorial will focus on temporal facts where the triples are enriched with temporal information, hyper-relational facts where the triples are enriched with qualifiers, n-ary facts describing relationships between multiple entities, and also facts that are augmented with literal and text descriptions. During the tutorial, we will introduce both fundamental knowledge and advanced topics for understanding recent embedding approaches for beyond-triple representations.
