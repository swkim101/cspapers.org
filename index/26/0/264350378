This paper studies the problem of spatial-temporal modeling for traffic demand forecasting. In practice, the temporal-spatial dependencies are complex. Conventional methods using graph convolutional networks and gated recurrent units cannot fully explore the patterns of demand evolution. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Graph Neural Diffusion (AGND) for spatial-temporal graph modeling. Specifically, complex spatial relations are modeled with a diffusion process by the graph neural diffusion. The spatial attention mechanism and a data-driven semantic adjacency matrix are used to describe the diffusivity function in the graph neural diffusion, which provides both local and global spatial information. Long-term temporal dependencies are modeled by the temporal attention mechanism. The proposed method is applied to two real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
