Many Virtual Reality (VR) locomotion techniques have been proposed, but those explored for and with blind people are often custom-made or require specialized equipment. Consequently, it is unclear how popular techniques can support blind people’s VR locomotion, blocking access to most VR experiences. We implemented three popular techniques — Arm Swinging, Linear Movement (joystick-based steering), and Point & Teleport — with minor adaptations for accessibility. We conducted a study with 14 blind participants consisting of navigation tasks with these techniques and a semi-structured interview. We found no differences in overall performance (e.g., completion time), but contrasting preferences. Findings highlight the challenges and advantages of each technique and participants’ strategies. We discuss, among others, how augmenting the techniques enabled blind people to navigate in VR, the greater control of movement of Arm Swinging, the simplicity and familiarity of Linear Movement, and the potential for efficiency and for scanning the environment of Point & Teleport.
