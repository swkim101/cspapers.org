Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for complex multi-turn conversations across diverse real-world applications. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on single-turn evaluations, overlooking the models’ capabilities in multi-turn interactions. To address this gap, we introduce , a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the multi-turn conversational abilities of LLMs. By analyzing human-LLM conversations, we categorize interaction patterns into four types: recollection, expansion, refinement, and follow-up. We construct multi-turn queries for each category either by augmenting existing datasets or creating new examples using GPT-4 with a human-in-the-loop process to avoid data leakage. To study the factors impacting multi-turn abilities, we create single-turn versions of the 1170 multi-turn queries and compare performance. Our evaluation of 10 well-known LLMs shows that while closed-source models generally surpass open-source ones, certain open-source models exceed GPT-3.5-Turbo in specific tasks. We observe significant performance degradation in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn settings in most models, which is not correlated with the models’ fundamental capabilities. Moreover, we identify the distance to relevant content and susceptibility to error propagation as the key factors influencing multi-turn performance.
