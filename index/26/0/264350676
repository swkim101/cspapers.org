In computational argumentation, so-called quality dimensions such as coherence or rhetoric are often used for ranking arguments. However, the literature often only predicts which argument is more persuasive, but not why this is the case. In this paper, we introduce AQUAPLANE, a transparent and easy-to-extend application that not only decides for a pair of arguments which one is more convincing with respect to a statement, but also provides an explanation.
