Deep nets such as GPT are at the core of the current advances in many systems and applications. Things are moving very fast, and it appears that techniques are out of date within weeks. How can we take advantage of new discoveries and incorporate them into our existing work? Are these radical new developments, repetitions of older concepts, or both? In this tutorial, we aim to bring interested researchers and practitioners up to speed on the recent and ongoing techniques around ML and Deep learning in the context of IR and NLP. Additionally, our goal is to clarify terminology, emphasize fundamentals, and outline new research opportunities.
