People who are blind use screen readers for browsing web pages. Since screen readers read out content serially, a naive readout tends to mix irrelevant and relevant content thereby disrupting the coherency of the material being read out and confusing the listener. To address this problem we can partition web pages into coherent segments and narrate each such piece separately. Extant methods to do segmentation use visual and structural cues without taking the semantics into account and consequently create segments containing irrelevant material. In this paper, we describe a new technique for creating coherent segments by tightly coupling visual, structural, and linguistic features present in the content. A notable aspect of the technique is that it produces segments with little irrelevant content. Preliminary experiments indicate that the technique is effective in creating highly coherent segments and the experiences of an early adopter who is blind suggest that it enriches the overall browsing experience.
