We present a new approach for propagating spam scores in web graphs, in order to combat link spam. The resulting spam rating is then used for propagating popularity scores like PageRank. Both propagations work even in presence of censure links that represent distrust. Initial testing using a C++ prototype on small examples show more reasonable results than other published approaches.
