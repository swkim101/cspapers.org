Industrial recommender systems usually need to serve multiple scenarios at the same time. In practice, there are various heterogeneous scenarios, since users frequently engage in scenarios with varying intentions and the items within each scenario typically belong to diverse categories. Existing works of multi-scenario recommendation mainly focus on modeling homogeneous scenarios which have similar data distributions. They equally transfer knowledge to each scenario without considering the diversity of heterogeneous scenarios. In this paper, we argue that the heterogeneity in multi-scenario recommendations is a key problem that needs to be solved. To this end, we propose an industrial framework named Scenario-Aware Model-Agnostic Meta Distillation (SAMD) for the multi-scenario recommendation. SAMD aims to provide scenario-aware and model-agnostic knowledge sharing across heterogeneous scenarios by modeling scenarios' relationship and conducting heterogeneous knowledge distillation. Specifically, SAMD first measures the comprehensive representation of each scenario and then proposes a novel meta distillation paradigm to conduct scenario-aware knowledge sharing. The meta network first establishes the potential scenarios' relationships and generates the strategies of knowledge sharing for each scenario. Then the heterogeneous knowledge distillation utilizes scenario-aware strategies to share knowledge across heterogeneous scenarios through intermediate features distillation without the restriction of the model architecture. In this way, SAMD shares knowledge across heterogeneous scenarios in a scenario-aware and model-agnostic manner, which addresses the problem of heterogeneity. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, extensive offline experiments, and online A/B testing demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed SAMD framework, especially in heterogeneous scenarios.
