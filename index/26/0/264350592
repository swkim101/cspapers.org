Personalized review summarization is a challenging task in recommender systems, which aims to generate condensed and readable summaries for product reviews. Recently, some methods propose to adopt the sentiment signals of reviews to enhance the review summarization. However, most previous works only share the semantic features of reviews via preliminary multi-task learning, while ignoring the rich personalized information of users and products, which is crucial to both sentiment identification and comprehensive review summarization. In this paper, we propose a sentiment-aware review summarization method with an elaborately designed multi-task fine-tuning framework to make full use of personalized information of users and products effectively based on Pretrained Language Models (PLMs). We first denote two types of personalized information including IDs and historical summaries to indicate their identification and semantics information respectively. Subsequently, we propose to incorporate the IDs of the user/product into the PLMs-based encoder to learn the personalized representations of input reviews and their historical summaries in a fine-tuning way. Based on this, an auxiliary context-aware review sentiment classification task and a further sentiment-guided personalized review summarization task are jointly learned. Specifically, the sentiment representation of input review is used to identify relevant historical summaries, which are then treated as additional semantic context features to enhance the summary generation process. Extensive experimental results show our approach could generate sentiment-consistent summaries and outperforms many competitive baselines on both review summarization and sentiment classification tasks.
