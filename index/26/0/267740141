Robotic manipulation of deformable linear objects (DLOs) is an active area of research, though emerging applications, like automotive wire harness installation, introduce constraints that have not been considered in prior work. Confined workspaces and limited visibility complicate prior assumptions of multi-robot manipulation and direct measurement of DLO configuration (state). This work focuses on single-arm manipulation of stiff DLOs (StDLOs) connected to form a DLO network (DLON), for which the measurements (output) are the endpoint poses of the DLON, which are subject to unknown dynamics during manipulation. To demonstrate feasibility of output-based control without state estimation, direct input-output dynamics are shown to exist by training neural network models on simulated trajectories. Output dynamics are then approximated with polynomials and found to contain well-known rigid body dynamics terms. A composite model consisting of a rigid body model and an online data-driven residual is developed, which predicts output dynamics more accurately than either model alone, and without prior experience with the system. An adaptive model predictive controller is developed with the composite model for DLON manipulation, which completes DLON installation tasks, both in simulation and with a physical automotive wire harness.
