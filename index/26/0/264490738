Regression tasks in computer vision such as age estimation or counting are often formulated into classification by quantizing the target space into classes. Yet real-world data is often imbalanced - the majority of training samples lie in a head range of target values while a minority of samples span a usually larger tail range. By selecting the class quantization one can adjust imbalanced re-gression targets into balanced classification outputs though there are trade-offs in balancing classification accuracy and quantization error. To improve regression performance over the entire range of data we propose to construct hierarchical classifiers for solving imbalanced regression tasks. The fine-grained classifiers limit the quantization error while being modulated by the coarse predictions to ensure high accuracy. Standard hierarchical classification approaches when applied to the regression problem fail to ensure that predicted ranges remain consistent across the hierarchy. As such we propose a range-preserving distillation process that effectively learns a single classifier from the set of hierarchical classifiers. Our novel hierarchical classification adjustment (HCA) for imbalanced regression shows superior results on three diverse tasks age estimation crowd counting and depth estimation.
