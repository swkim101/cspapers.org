This work presents an accurate and robust method for estimating normals from point clouds. In contrast to predecessor approaches that minimize the deviations between the annotated and the predicted normals directly, leading to direction inconsistency, we first propose a new metric termed Chamfer Normal Distance to address this issue. This not only mitigates the challenge but also facilitates network training and substantially enhances the network robustness against noise. Subsequently, we devise an innovative architecture that encompasses Multi-scale Local Feature Aggregation and Hierarchical Geometric Information Fusion. This design empowers the network to capture intricate geometric details more effectively and alleviate the ambiguity in scale selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, particularly in scenarios contaminated by noise.
