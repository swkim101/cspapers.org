The Exploring Computer Science (ECS) program, designed to increase underrepresented groups' participation in computer science (CS), adapted its web development unit in Milwaukee during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new curriculum uses the ECS Web Lab (ECS-WL) platform, which facilitates real-time HTML and CSS compilation, allowing students to create and submit web pages for teacher feedback. Each day in the curriculum, students research specific topics of interest and incorporate those ideas into the websites they develop. This hands-on approach, tailored to students' interests, aims to enhance engagement and learning effectiveness. A comprehensive assessment strategy will analyze data from ECS-WL to gauge the program's impact on inclusivity and engagement in computer science education (CSE). These findings will guide future enhancements, ensuring ECS's commitment to diversifying CSE.
