Large scale field-phenotyping approaches have the potential to solve important questions about the relationship of plant genotype to plant phenotype. Computational approaches to measuring the phenotype (the observable plant features) are required to address the problem at a large scale, but machine learning approaches to extract phenotypes from sensor data struggle without access to (a) sufficiently large, organized multi-sensor datasets, (b) field trials that have a large scale and significant number of genotypes, (c) full genetic sequencing of those phenotypes, and (d) datasets sufficiently organized so that algorithm centered researchers can directly address the real biological problems. Here, we present SG × P , a novel benchmark dataset from a large-scale field trial consisting of the complete genotype of over 300 sorghum varieties, and time sequences of imagery from several field plots growing each variety, taken with RGB and laser 3D scanner imaging. To lower the barrier to entry and facilitate further developments, we provide a set of well organized, multi-sensor imagery and corresponding genomic data. We implement baseline deep learning based phenotyping approaches to create baseline results for individual sensors and multi-sensor fusion for detecting genetic mutations with known impacts. We also provide and support an open-ended challenge by identifying thousands of genetic mutations whose phenotypic impacts are currently unknown. A web interface for machine learning researchers and practitioners to share approaches, visualizations and hypotheses supports engagement with plant biologists to further the understanding of the sorghum genotype × phenotype relationship.
