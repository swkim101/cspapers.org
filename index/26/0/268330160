Developing expertise in vulnerability research is critical to closing the cybersecurity workforce shortage. However, very few institutions have adopted vulnerability research into their cybersecurity curriculum, and fewer have examined how to teach this skill to students. The recent emergence of lightweight, container-based virtualization presents a unique opportunity to address this challenge by offering reproducible environments that ease course facilitation. This paper presents an undergraduate vulnerability course design. Our approach leverages a hands-on methodology that challenges students to develop complex binary exploits over our lectures, labs, and exams. We share our detailed design, labs, experiences, lessons learned, and a lightweight virtual environment for this course for others to build on our initial success.
