Additive models have been burgeoning in data analysis due to their flexible representation and desirable interpretability. However, most existing approaches are constructed under empirical risk minimization (ERM), and thus perform poorly in situations where average performance is not a suitable criterion for the problems of interest, e.g., data with complex non-Gaussian noise, imbalanced labels or both of them. In this paper, a novel class of sparse additive models is proposed under tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM), which addresses the deficiencies in ERM by imposing tilted impact on individual losses, and is flexibly capable of achieving a variety of learning objectives, e.g., variable selection, robust estimation, imbalanced classification and multi-objective learning. On the theoretical side, a learning theory analysis which is centered around the generalization bound and function approximation error bound (under some specific data distributions) is conducted rigorously. On the practical side, an accelerated optimization algorithm is designed by integrating Prox-SVRG and random Fourier acceleration technique. The empirical assessments verify the competitive performance of our approach on both synthetic and real data.
