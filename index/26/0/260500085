Search clarification in conversational search systems exhibits a clarification pane composed of several candidate aspect items and a clarifying question. To generate a pane, existing studies usually rely on unstructured document texts. However, important structured information in search results is not effectively considered, making the generated panes inaccurate in some cases. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of structured information in search results for improving search clarification. We propose enhancing unstructured documents with two kinds of structured information: one is "In-List'' relation obtained from HTML list structures, which helps extract groups of high-quality items with abundant parallel information. Another is "Is-A'' relation extracted from knowledge bases, which is helpful to generate good questions with explicit prompts. To avoid introducing excessive noises, we design a relation selection process to filter out ineffective relations. We further design a BART-based model for generating clarification panes. The experimental results show that the structured information is good supplement for generating high-quality clarification panes.
