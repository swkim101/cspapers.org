In pursuit of fairness and balanced development, recommender systems (RS) often prioritize group fairness, ensuring that specific groups maintain a minimum level of exposure over a given period. For example, RS platforms aim to ensure adequate exposure for new providers or specific categories of items according to their needs. Modern industry RS usually adopts a two-stage pipeline: stage-1 (retrieval stage) retrieves hundreds of candidates from millions of items distributed across various servers, and stage-2 (ranking stage) focuses on presenting a small-size but accurate selection from items chosen in stage-1. Existing efforts for ensuring amortized group exposures focus on stage-2, however, stage-1 is also critical for the task. Without a high-quality set of candidates, the stage-2 ranker cannot ensure the required exposure of groups. Previous fairness-aware works designed for stage-2 typically require accessing and traversing all items. In stage-1, however, millions of items are distributively stored in servers, making it infeasible to traverse all of them. How to ensure group exposures in the distributed retrieval process is a challenging question. To address this issue, we introduce a model named FairSync, which transforms the problem into a constrained distributed optimization problem. Specifically, FairSync resolves the issue by moving it to the dual space, where a central node aggregates historical fairness data into a vector and distributes it to all servers. To trade off the efficiency and accuracy, the gradient descent technique is used to periodically update the parameter of the dual vector. The experiment results on two public recommender retrieval datasets showcased that FairSync outperformed all the baselines, achieving the desired minimum level of exposures while maintaining a high level of retrieval accuracy.
