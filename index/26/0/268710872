Recently, arbitrary text style transfer (TST) has made significant progress with the paradigm of prompt learning. In this paradigm, researchers often design or search for a fixed prompt for any input. However, existing evidence shows that large language models (LLMs) are prompt-sensitive and it is sub-optimal to apply the same prompt to any input for downstream TST tasks. Besides, the prompts obtained by searching are often unreadable and unexplainable to humans. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Prompt Routing (APR) framework to adaptively route prompts from a human-readable prompt set for various input texts and given styles. Specifically, we first construct a candidate prompt set of diverse and human-readable prompts for the target style. This set consists of several seed prompts and their variants paraphrased by an LLM. Subsequently, we train a prompt routing model to select the optimal prompts efficiently according to inputs. The adaptively selected prompt can guide the LLMs to perform a precise style transfer for each input sentence while maintaining readability for humans. Extensive experiments on 4 public TST benchmarks over 3 popular LLMs (with parameter sizes ranging from 1.5B to 175B) demonstrate that our APR achieves superior style transfer performances, compared to the state-of-the-art prompt-based and fine-tuning methods.
