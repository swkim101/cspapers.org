Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a crucial role in industrial manufacturing by providing geometry information and the construction workflow for manufactured objects. The construction information enables effective re-editing of parametric CAD models. While boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard format for representing geometry structures, JSON format is an alternative due to the lack of uniform criteria for storing the construction workflow. Regrettably, most CAD models available on the Internet only offer geometry information, omitting the construction procedure and hampering creation efficiency. This paper proposes a learning approach CADParser to infer the underlying modeling sequences given a B-Rep CAD model. It achieves this by treating the CAD geometry structure as a graph and the construction workflow as a sequence. Since the existing CAD dataset only contains two operations (i.e., Sketch and Extrusion), limiting the diversity of the CAD model creation, we also introduce a large-scale dataset incorporating a more comprehensive range of operations such as Revolution, Fillet, and Chamfer. Each model includes both the geometry structure and the construction sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can compete with the existing state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively. Data is available at https://drive.google.com/CADParserData.
