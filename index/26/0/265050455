We study the problem of aligning a video that captures a local portion of an environment to the 2D LiDAR scan of the entire environment. We introduce a method (VioLA) that starts with building a semantic map of the local scene from the image sequence, then extracts points at a fixed height for registering to the LiDAR map. Due to reconstruction errors or partial coverage of the camera scan, the reconstructed semantic map may not contain sufficient information for registration. To address this problem, VioLA makes use of a pre-trained text-to-image inpainting model paired with a depth completion model for filling in the missing scene content in a geometrically consistent fashion to support pose registration. We evaluate VioLA on two real-world RGB-D benchmarks, as well as a self-captured dataset of a large office scene. Notably, our proposed scene completion module improves the pose registration performance by up to 20%.
