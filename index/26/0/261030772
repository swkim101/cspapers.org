Bokeh is widely used in photography to draw attention to the subject while effectively isolating distractions in the background. Computational methods can simulate bokeh effects without relying on a physical camera lens, but the inaccurate lens modeling in existing filtering-based meth-ods leads to artifacts that need post-processing or learning-based methods to fix. We propose Dr.Bokeh, a novel ren-dering method that addresses the issue by directly correcting the defect that violates physics in the current filtering-based bokeh rendering equation. Dr.Bokeh first preprocesses the input RGBD to obtain a layered scene representation. Dr.Bokeh then takes the layered representation and user-defined lens parameters to render photo-realistic lens blur based on the novel occlusion-aware bokeh rendering method. Experiments show that the non-learning based renderer Dr.Bokeh outperforms state-of-the-art bokeh ren-dering algorithms in terms of photo-realism. In addition, extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that the more accurate lens model pushes the limit of depth-from-defocus.
