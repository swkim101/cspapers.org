Predicting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of drugs is one of the most critical steps in drug development. By pre-estimating the adverse reactions, researchers and drug development companies can greatly prevent the potential ADR risks and tragedies. However, the current ADR prediction methods suffer from several limitations. First, the prediction results are based on pure drug-related information, which makes them impossible to be directly applied for the personalized ADR prediction task. The lack of personalization of models also makes rare adverse events hard to be predicted. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop a new personalized ADR prediction method by introducing additional sources, e.g., patient health records. However, few methods have tried to use additional sources. In the meantime, the variety of different source formats and structures makes this task more challenging. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel personalized multi-sourced-based drug adverse reaction prediction model named pADR. pADR first works on every single source to transform them into proper representations. Next, a hierarchical multi-sourced Transformer is designed to automatically model the interactions between different sources and fuse them together for the final adverse event prediction. Experimental results on a new multi-sourced ADR prediction dataset show that pADR1 outperforms state-of-the-art drug-based baselines. Moreover, the case and ablation studies also illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategies and the reasonableness of each module design.
