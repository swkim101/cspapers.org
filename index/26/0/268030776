Constructing a directed cyclic graph (DCG) is challenged by both algorithmic difﬁculty and computational burden. Comparing multiple DCGs is even more difﬁcult, compounded by the need to identify dynamic causalities across graphs. We propose to unify multiple DCGs with a single structural model and develop a limited-information-based method to simultaneously construct multiple networks and infer their disparities, which can be visualized by appropriate correspondence analysis. The algorithm provides DCGs with robust non-asymptotic theoretical properties. It is designed with two sequential stages, each of which involves parallel computation tasks that are scalable to the network complexity. Taking advantage of high-performance clusters, our method makes it possible to evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of DCGs using the bootstrap method. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our method by applying it to synthetic and real datasets.
