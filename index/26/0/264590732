Collaboration is used in Software Engineering (SE) to develop software. Industry seeks SE graduates with collaboration skills to contribute to productive software development. SE educators can use Collaborative Learning (CL) to help students develop collaboration skills. This paper uses a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to examine the application of the CL educational theory in SE Education. The SMS identified 14 papers published between 2011 and 2022. We used qualitative analysis to classify the papers into four CL paradigms: Conditions, Effect, Interactions, and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). We found a high interest in CSCL, with a shift in student interaction research to computer-mediated technologies. We discussed the 14 papers in depth, describing their goals and further analysing the CSCL research. Almost half the papers did not achieve the appropriate level of supporting evidence; however, calibrating the instruments presented could strengthen findings and support multiple CL paradigms, especially opportunities to learn at the social and community levels, where research was lacking. Though our results demonstrate limited CL educational theory applied in SE Education, we discuss future work to layer the theory on existing study designs for more effective teaching strategies.
