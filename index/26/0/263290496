Immunoassays play a pivotal role in detecting and quantifying specific proteins within biological samples. However, its sensitivity and turnaround time are constrained by the passive diffusion of target molecules towards the sensors. ACET (Alternating Current Electrothermal) enhanced reaction emerges as a solution to overcome this limitation. The ACET-enhanced biosensor works by inducing vortices through electrothermal force, which stirs the analyte within the microchannel and promotes a reaction process. In this study, a comprehensive two-dimensional finite element study is conducted to optimize the binding efficiency and detection time of an ACET-enhanced biosensor without external pumping. Optimal geometries for interdigitated electrodes are estimated to achieve significant improvements in terms of probe utilization and enhancement factor. The studyâ€™s findings demonstrate enhancement factors of 3.21, 2.15, and 3.09 along with 71.22%, 75.80%, and 57.52% normalized binding for C-reactive protein (CRP), immunoglobulin (IgG), and SARS-CoV-2, respectively.
