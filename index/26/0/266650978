3D motion transfer aims at transferring the motion from a dynamic input sequence to a static 3D object and outputs an identical motion of the target with high-fidelity and realistic visual effects. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Transformer framework called LART for 3D motion transfer. With carefully-designed architectures, LART is able to implicitly learn the correspondence via a flexible geometry perception. Thus, unlike other existing methods, LART does not require any key point annotations or pre-defined correspondence between the motion source and target meshes and can also handle large-size full-detailed unseen 3D targets. Besides, we introduce a novel latent metric regularization on the Transformer for better motion generation. Our rationale lies in the observation that the decoded motions can be approximately expressed as linearly geometric distortion at the frame level. The metric preservation of motions could be translated to the formation of linear paths in the underlying latent space as a rigorous constraint to control the synthetic motions occurring in the construction of the latent space. The proposed LART shows a high learning efficiency with the need for a few samples from the AMASS dataset to generate motions with plausible visual effects. The experimental results verify the potential of our generative model in applications of motion transfer, content generation, temporal interpolation, and motion denoising.
