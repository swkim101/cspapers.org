In recent years, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have gained increasing attention due to their excellent performance in applications. However, the lack of high-quality benchmarks in new fields has become a critical limitation for developing and applying HGNNs. To accommodate the urgent need for emerging fields and the advancement of HGNNs, we present two large-scale, real-world, and challenging heterogeneous graph datasets from real scenarios: risk commodity detection and takeout recommendation. Meanwhile, we establish standard benchmark interfaces that provide over 40 heterogeneous graph datasets. We provide initial data split, unified evaluation metrics, and baseline results for future work, making it fair and handy to explore state-of-the-art HGNNs. Our interfaces also offer a comprehensive toolkit to research the characteristics of graph datasets. The above new datasets are publicly available on https://zenodo.org/communities/hgd, and the interface codes are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/hgbi.
