We present a research project carried out to enable a Call Categorization Service (CCS) for Dynamics 365 Sales Conversation Intelligence. CCS identifies prevalent types of sales calls based on their transcription, for the purpose of automating manual sales processes and making informed business decisions. We sift through R&D process, and provide clear evidence that purpose-focused fine-tuned transformers out-perform GPT-3 in this text classification task. Additionally we share: an efficient, non-trivial data annotation approach suited to the problem of finding data related to rare categories in a highly unbalanced data source; Considerations regarding zero-shot and in-context learning (i.e. few-shot learning) when using LLMs for classification and cost and performance analysis that opt in favor of fine-tuned transformers as well.
