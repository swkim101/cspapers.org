Spreadsheets are widely used for storing, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data. Features such as conditional formatting, formulas, sorting, and filtering play an important role when understanding and analyzing data in spreadsheets. They employ visual cues, but we have little understanding of the experiences of blind screen reader (SR) users with such features. We conducted a study with 12 blind SR users to gain insights into their challenges, workarounds, and strategies in understanding and extracting information from a spreadsheet consisting of multiple tables that incorporated data analysis features. We identified five factors that impact blind SR users’ experiences: cognitive overload, time-information trade-off, lack of awareness and expertise, inadequate system feedback, and delayed and absent SR responses. Drawn from these findings, we discuss design suggestions and future research agenda to improve SR users’ spreadsheet experiences.
