We introduce our view of the relation between symbolic gestures and manipulations in multi-touch Natural User Interfaces (NUI). We identify manipulations not gestures as the key to truly natural interfaces. Therefore we suggest that future NUI research should be more focused on designing visual workspaces and model-world interfaces that are especially appropriate for multi-touch manipulations.
