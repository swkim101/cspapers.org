Programming is increasingly being taught in high schools and in non-CS majors at universities. However, the interests of this wide population are often different from those of students who decided to study computer science. Programming graphics is a great way to cater to these interests and motivate students to learn programming with examples that go beyond the more traditional "Hello World" or mathematical exercises. In this workshop, we demonstrate how to use PyTamaro, a Python library designed to teach programming with graphics to novices. PyTamaro's design removes the need to use and explain sophisticated programming language features and directs learners' attention towards fundamental concepts of programming. The workshop combines unplugged activities and Python programming. Graphics are first created using colored paper cutouts and cards that represent PyTamaro functions; then, the composition is written as a Python program. The programming part will be carried out on the PyTamaro web platform, which also contains more than a hundred activities of varying levels of difficulty and on different themes that instructors can directly use or take inspiration from.
