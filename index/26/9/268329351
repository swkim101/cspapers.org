With the increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, there is a growing need to integrate natural language processing (NLP) into K-12 education to better prepare young learners for the future AI landscape. NLP, a sub-field of AI that serves as the foundation of LLMs and many advanced AI applications, holds the potential to enrich learning in core subjects in K-12 classrooms. In this experience report, we present our efforts to integrate NLP into science classrooms with 98 middle school students across two US states, aiming to increase students' experience and engagement with NLP models through textual data analyses and visualizations. We designed learning activities, developed an NLP-based interactive visualization platform, and facilitated classroom learning in close collaboration with middle school science teachers. This experience report aims to contribute to the growing body of work on integrating NLP into K-12 education by providing insights and practical guidelines for practitioners, researchers, and curriculum designers.
