Adversarial attacks involve adding perturbations to the source image to cause misclassification by the target model, which demonstrates the potential of attacking face recognition models. Existing adversarial face image generation methods still canâ€™t achieve satisfactory performance because of low transferability and high detectability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework Adv-Diffusion that can generate imperceptible adversarial identity perturbations in the latent space but not the raw pixel space, which utilizes strong inpainting capabilities of the latent diffusion model to generate realistic adversarial images. Specifically, we propose the identity-sensitive conditioned diffusion generative model to generate semantic perturbations in the surroundings. The designed adaptive strength-based adversarial perturbation algorithm can ensure both attack transferability and stealthiness. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the public FFHQ and CelebA-HQ datasets prove the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods without an extra generative model training process.
