Genetic algorithms (GA) mimic natural reproduction to search for complex problem solutions. Their principles are shortly explained. A point of interest is the regular and repetititve structure of computation involving communication, data exchanges, and control phases. Interaction with presentation and analysis tools is also a requirement. This make sense for the definition of a general framework allowing fast building of parallel applications in an object-oriented system. A GA workbench is developed using the Smalltalk-80 system with parallel machine code generation in mind.
