Causal relationships have been utilized in almost all disciplines, and the research into causal discovery has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. Traditionally, causal relationships are identified by making use of interventions or randomized controlled experiments. However, conducting such experiments is often expensive or even impossible due to cost or ethical concerns. Therefore, there has been an increasing interest in discovering causal relationships based on observational data, and in the past few decades, significant contributions have been made to this field by computer scientists. Following the success of CD 2016 - CD 2021, CDPD 2023 continues to serve as a forum for researchers and practitioners in data mining and other disciplines to share their recent research in causal discovery in their respective fields and to explore the possibility of interdisciplinary collaborations in the study of causality. Based on the platform of KDD, this workshop is especially interested in attracting contributions that link data mining/machine learning research with causal discovery, and solutions to causal discovery in large scale datasets.
