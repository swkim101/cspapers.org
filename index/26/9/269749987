The increasing demand for home fitness solutions underscores the need for interactive displays that enhance user experiences. This study introduces a technology that autonomously adjusts display height using the skeletal information of demonstrators from videos, catering to home fitness needs. A user study involving thirty participants compared fixed height, manual adjustment, and automatic adjustment conditions. Head flexion angles and NASA-TLX survey responses were used for evaluation. Results showed a significant reduction in head flexion angles with automatic adjustment, promoting proper spinal alignment. NASA-TLX responses indicated lower mental, effort, and frustration ratings, along with improved performance and perceived support in the automatic adjustment condition compared to other conditions. These findings confirm that motion-based height adjustment improves posture and enhances the overall interactive experience. This research demonstrates the feasibility of integrating responsive ergonomics into interactive displays and suggests the importance of further personalization, conducting diverse user studies, and refining algorithms to fully leverage the potential of this technology.
