Augmented Reality (AR) devices, emerging as prominent mobile interaction platforms, face challenges in user safety, particularly concerning oncoming vehicles. While some solutions leverage onboard camera arrays, these cameras often have limited field-of-view (FoV) with front or downward perspectives. Addressing this, we propose a new out-of-view semantic segmentation task and Segment Beyond View (SBV), a novel audio-visual semantic segmentation method. SBV supplements the visual modality, which miss the information beyond FoV, with the auditory information using a teacher-student distillation model (Omni2Ego). The model consists of a vision teacher utilising panoramic information, an auditory teacher with 8-channel audio, and an audio-visual student that takes views with limited FoV and binaural audio as input and produce semantic segmentation for objects outside FoV. SBV outperforms existing models in comparative evaluations and shows a consistent performance across varying FoV ranges and in monaural audio settings.
