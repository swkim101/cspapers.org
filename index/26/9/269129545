Ads are integral to the contemporary Android ecosystem, gener-ating revenue for free-to-use applications. However, injected as third-party content, ads are displayed on native apps in pervasive ways that affect easy navigation. Ads can prove more disruptive for blind users, who rely on screen readers for navigating an app. While the literature has looked into either the accessibility of web advertisements or the privacy and security implications of mobile ads, a research gap on the accessibility of mobile ads remains, which we aim to bridge. We conduct an empirical study analyzing 500 ad screens in Android apps to categorize and examine the accessi-bility issues therein. Additionally, we conduct 15 qualitative user interviews with blind Android users to better understand the impact of those accessibility issues, how users interact with ads and their preferences. Based on our findings, we discuss the design and practical strategies for developing accessible ads.
