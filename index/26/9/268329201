Insufficient exposure to computer science and a lack of role models hinder students' pursuit and success in the field. Research suggests that students without early exposure are less likely to enroll in college-level computer science courses and may experience reduced success compared to their peers with prior experience. To address this, CodeBears, a two-week computer science camp, was developed to provide comprehensive exposure, education, and role models for rural and low-income students. CodeBears caters to upper elementary and middle school students, adapting concepts to diverse cultures, challenging stereotypes, and showcasing the diverse backgrounds of computer scientists. This paper outlines the design of CodeBears, examines the experiences of 40 participating students, and highlights engaging lessons using Sphero Bolt, Sphero Rover, Tello Drones, Lego Spike Prime, and Scratch. The camp also collects data on students' favorite activities to gauge their interests and preferences. The discussion focuses on effective strategies for participant recruitment, establishing trust within the target demographic, developing professional programs for facilitators, organizing camp activities, and promoting personal and socially relevant projects. By sharing the challenges and lessons learned, this paper aims to provide insights to researchers and practitioners in similar educational endeavors. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing will drive ongoing improvements in future camps, advancing computer science education.
