The machine learning community has witnessed a drastic change in the training pipeline, pivoted by those “foundation models” with unprecedented scales. However, the field of adversarial training is lagging behind, predominantly centered around small model sizes like ResNet-50, and tiny and low-resolution datasets like CIFAR-10. To bridge this transformation gap, this paper provides a modern re-examination with adversarial training, investigating its potential benefits when applied at scale. Additionally, we introduce an efficient and effective training strategy to enable adversarial training with giant models and web-scale data at an affordable computing cost. We denote this newly introduced framework as AdvXL. Empirical results demonstrate that AdvXL establishes new state-of-the-art robust accuracy records under AutoAttack on ImageNet-1K. For example, by training on DataComp-1B dataset, our AdvXL empowers a vanilla ViT-g model to substantially surpass the previous records of l∞-, l2-, and l1-robust accuracy by margins of 11.4%, 14.2% and 12.9%, respectively. This achievement posits AdvXL as a pioneering approach, charting a new trajectory for the efficient training of robust visual representations at significantly larger scales.
