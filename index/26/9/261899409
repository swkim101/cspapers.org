As an Ethernet-based communication protocol with timing determinism, TSN (time-sensitive networking) has become a well-recognized promising in-vehicle network solution for increasingly automated automobiles. To satisfy the reliability requirement of safety-critical applications, existing works towards fault-tolerant TSN trade too much bandwidth for redundancy, limiting their scope of applicability. Targeting mixed-critical traffic, which is widely found in practice, we define a shared fault-tolerant segment that is compatible with the TSN standard. It serves the critical flows when faults occur, to improve their reliability and serves the non-critical flows when otherwise, to improve their quality of service (QoS). On top of this, we propose a space-time redundancy scheduling algorithm, aiming to make the most efficient use of bandwidth, i.e., to fulfill both the reliability as well as hard real-time requirements, and maximize the QoS with the least bandwidth. In essence, we formulate a bi-objective design space exploration problem with hundreds of thousands of decision variables and solve it with customized heuristics. Experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our reported work increases the number of critical flows that can be accommodated on a resource-constrained network by 3 to 4 times, and achieve the highest QoS with an average reduction of 60.3% in bandwidth. As the first work along sharing of bandwidth between mixed-critical traffic in fault-tolerant TSN, this idea can be further pursued towards higher efficiency and may be applied in general autonomous systems.
