Given the sheer volume of contemporary e-commerce applications, recommender systems (RSs) have gained significant attention in both academia and industry. However, traditional cloud-based RSs face inevitable challenges, such as resource-intensive computation, reliance on network access, and privacy breaches. In response, a new paradigm called on-device recommender systems (ODRSs) has emerged recently in various industries like Taobao, Google, and Kuaishou. ODRSs unleash the computational capacity of user devices with lightweight recommendation models tailored for resource-constrained environments, enabling real-time inference with users' local data. This tutorial aims to systematically introduce methodologies of ODRSs, including (1) an overview of existing research on ODRSs; (2) a comprehensive taxonomy of ODRSs, where the core technical content to be covered span across three major ODRS research directions, including on-device deployment and inference, on-device training, and privacy/security of ODRSs; (3) limitations and future directions of ODRSs. This tutorial expects to lay the foundation and spark new insights for follow-up research and applications concerning this new recommendation paradigm.
