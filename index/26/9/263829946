This paper presents sign.mt, an open-source application for real-time multilingual bi-directional translation between spoken and signed languages. Harnessing state-of-the-art open-source models, this tool aims to address the communication divide between the hearing and the deaf, facilitating seamless translation in both spoken-to-signed and signed-to-spoken translation directions. To provide reliable and unrestricted communication, sign.mt offers offline functionality, crucial in areas with limited internet connectivity. It enhances user engagement by providing customizable photorealistic sign language avatars, encouraging a more personalized and authentic user experience. Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, sign.mt signifies an important stride towards open, inclusive communication.The app can be used and modified for personal and academic purposes and even supports a translation API, fostering integration into a wider range of applications. However, it is by no means a finished product. We invite the NLP community to contribute towards the evolution of sign.mt. Whether it be the integration of more refined models, the development of innovative pipelines, or user experience improvements, your contributions can propel this project to new heights. Available at https://sign.mt, it stands as a testament to what we can achieve together, as we strive to make communication accessible to all.
