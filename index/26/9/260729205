As computer science educators, we are being pushed to define (by accreditation agencies, within our institutions, etc.) our courses and programs in terms of measurable outcomes. The Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) is responsible for reviewing and accrediting computer sciences departments across the United States. As part of this review process, computer science departments must specify and measure student learning objectives and outcomes (see criteria at http://www.abet.org/cac1.html). The same is true for institution-wide accreditation (for example, by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education). Also, faculty who are composing proposals for NSF or other funding agencies are expected to provide descriptions of objectives and outcomes and how these are to be measured.
