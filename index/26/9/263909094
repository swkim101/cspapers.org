BERT-based models have had strong performance on leaderboards, yet have been demon-strably worse in real-world settings requiring generalization. Limited quantities of training data is considered a key impediment to achieving generalizability in machine learning. In this paper, we examine the impact of training data quality , not quantity, on a model’s generalizability. We consider two characteristics of training data: the portion of human-adversarial ( h-adversarial ), i.e. sample pairs with seemingly minor differences but different ground-truth labels, and human-affable ( h-affable ) training samples, i.e. sample pairs with minor differences but the same ground-truth label. We find that for a fixed size of training samples, as a rule of thumb, having 10-30% h-adversarial instances improves the precision, and therefore F 1 , by up to 20 points in the tasks of text classification and relation extraction. Increasing h-adversarials beyond this range can result in performance plateaus or even degradation. In contrast, h-affables may not contribute to a model’s generalizability and may even degrade generalization performance.
