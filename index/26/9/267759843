The prediction has served as a crucial scientific method in modern social studies. With the recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), efforts have been made to leverage LLMs to predict the human features in social life, such as presidential voting. These works suggest that LLMs are capable of generating human-like responses. However, we find that the promising performance achieved by previous studies is because of the existence of input shortcut features to the response. In fact, by removing these shortcuts, the performance is reduced dramatically. To further revisit the ability of LLMs, we introduce a novel social prediction task, Soc-PRF Prediction, which utilizes general features as input and simulates real-world social study settings. With the comprehensive investigations on various LLMs, we reveal that LLMs cannot work as expected on social prediction when given general input features without shortcuts. We further investigate possible reasons for this phenomenon that suggest potential ways to enhance LLMs for social prediction.
