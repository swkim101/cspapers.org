The computing landscape has undergone significant transformations in recent decades. Modern computation systems involve multiple layers across software and hardware architecture, exposing various security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. In this paper, we review security threats in these systems and provide insights into future directions in the topic of cross-layer security.
