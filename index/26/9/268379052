Understanding the mechanisms behind Vision Transformer (ViT), particularly its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, is crucial for addressing challenges in its real-world applications. Existing ViT adversarial attackers rely on labels to calculate the gradient for perturbation, and exhibit low transferability to other structures and tasks. In this paper, we present a label-free white-box attack approach for ViT-based models that exhibits strong transferability to various black-box models, including most ViT variants, CNNs, and MLPs, even for models developed for other modalities. Our inspiration comes from the feature collapse phenomenon in ViTs, where the critical attention mechanism overly depends on the low-frequency component of features, causing the features in middle-to-end layers to become increasingly similar and eventually collapse. We propose the feature diversity attacker to naturally accelerate this process and achieve remarkable performance and transferability.
