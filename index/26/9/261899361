This lightning talk introduces the motivations of the needs of formal properties that can be used modularly to compose safe and tight analysis and optimization for the scheduler design and schedulability test problems for cyber-physical real-time systems. The key challenge is the correct and precise translation from different schedule functions to proper mathematical properties that can be further used for property-based modulable designs.
