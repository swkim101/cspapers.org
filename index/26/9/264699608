Selections for these awards are made by the Best Paper Committee on the recommendation of a number of peer judges who review the individual papers and attend the technical sessions. Clarity of presentation and significance of technical content are of prime importance to the judges. The papers are also judged on the adherence to the allotted time, SI units, and emphasis on the technical rather than promotional aspects of the paper.
