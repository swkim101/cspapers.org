Counting integer solutions of linear constraints has found interesting applications in various fields. It is equivalent to the problem of counting lattice points inside a polytope. However, state-of-the-art algorithms for this problem become too slow for even a modest number of variables. In this paper, we propose a new framework to approximate the lattice counts inside a polytope with a new random-walk sampling method. The counts computed by our approach has been proved approximately bounded by a (epsilon, delta)-bound. Experiments on extensive benchmarks show that our algorithm could solve polytopes with dozens of dimensions, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art counters.
