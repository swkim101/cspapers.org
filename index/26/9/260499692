We study a novel problem of continuously predicting a number of user-subscribed continuous analytics targets (CATs) in dynamic networks. Our architecture includes any dynamic graph neural network model as the back end applied over the network data, and per CAT front end models that return results with their confidence to users. We devise a data filtering algorithm that feeds a provably optimal subset of data in the embedding space from back end model to front end models. Secondly, to ensure fairness in terms of query result accuracy for different CATs and users, we propose a fairness metric and a fairness-aware training scheduling algorithm, along with accuracy guarantees on fairness estimation. Our experiments over five real-world datasets show that our proposed solution is effective, efficient, fair, extensible, and adaptive.
