Studies of the human brain during natural activities, such as locomotion, would benefit from the ability to image deep brain structures during these activities. While Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can image these structures, the bulk and weight of current scanners are not compatible with the desire for a wearable device. This has motivated the design of a robotic system to support a PET imaging system around the subject's head and to move the system to accommodate natural motion. We report here the design and experimental evaluation of a prototype robotic system that senses motion of a subject's head, using parallel string encoders connected between the robot-supported imaging ring and a helmet worn by the subject. This measurement is used to robotically move the imaging ring (coarse motion correction) and to compensate for residual motion during image reconstruction (fine motion correction). Minimization of latency and measurement error are the key design goals, respectively, for coarse and fine motion correction. The system is evaluated using recorded human head motions during locomotion, with a mock imaging system consisting of lasers and cameras, and is shown to provide an overall system latency of about 80 ms, which is sufficient for coarse motion correction and collision avoidance, as well as a measurement accuracy of about 0.5 mm for fine motion correction.
