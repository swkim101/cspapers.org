Key-Value Solid State Drive (KV-SSD), a key addressable SSD technology, promises to simplify storage management for unstructured data and improve system performance with minimal host-side intervention. However, we find that the current state-of-the-art KV-SSD exhibits indexing peculiarities that limit their widespread adoption. Through experiments, we observe that the performance degrades as more data are stored, and the KV-SSD can only store a limited number of key-value pairs even though the amount of data stored on the device is significantly lower than its capacity. We introduce RHIK, a reconfigurable hash-bashed indexing for KV-SSD, for high performance and high occupancy. We implement our proposed indexing scheme on the open-source KV-SSD emulator that is validated against a real KV-SSD, and demonstrate its effectiveness using real workload traces and synthetic microbenchmarks.
