Tor hidden services (HSs) are used to provide anonymous services to users on the Internet without revealing the location of the servers. However, existing approaches have proven ineffective in mitigating the misuse of hidden services. Our investigation reveals that the latest iteration of Tor hidden services still exhibits vulnerabilities related to Hidden Service Directories (HSDirs). Building upon this identified weakness, we introduce the HSDirSniper attack, which leverages a substantial volume of descriptors to inundate the HSDir's descriptor cache. This results in the HSDir purging all stored descriptors, thereby blocking arbitrary hidden services. Notably, our attack represents the most practical means of blocking hidden services within the current high-adversarial context. The advantage of the HSDirSniper attack lies in its covert nature, as the targeted hidden service remains unaware of the attack. Additionally, the successful execution of this attack does not require the introduction of a colluding routing node within the Tor Network. We conducted comprehensive experiments in the real-world Tor Network, and the experimental results show that an attacker equipped with a certain quantity of hidden servers can render arbitrary hidden services inaccessible up to 90% of the time. To ascertain the potential scope of damage that the HSDirSniper attack can inflict upon hidden services, we provide a formal analytical framework for quantifying the cost of the HSDirSniper attack. Finally, we discuss the ethical concerns and countermeasures.
