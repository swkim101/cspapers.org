This paper presents Ske2Grid, a new representation learning framework for improved skeleton-based action recognition. In Ske2Grid, we define a regular convolution operation upon a novel grid representation of human skeleton, which is a compact image-like grid patch constructed and learned through three novel designs. Specifically, we propose a graph-node index transform (GIT) to construct a regular grid patch through assigning the nodes in the skeleton graph one by one to the desired grid cells. To ensure that GIT is a bijection and enrich the expressiveness of the grid representation, an up-sampling transform (UPT) is learned to interpolate the skeleton graph nodes for filling the grid patch to the full. To resolve the problem when the one-step UPT is aggressive and further exploit the representation capability of the grid patch with increasing spatial size, a progressive learning strategy (PLS) is proposed which decouples the UPT into multiple steps and aligns them to multiple paired GITs through a compact cascaded design learned progressively. We construct networks upon prevailing graph convolution networks and conduct experiments on six mainstream skeleton-based action recognition datasets. Experiments show that our Ske2Grid significantly outperforms existing GCN-based solutions under different benchmark settings, without bells and whistles.
