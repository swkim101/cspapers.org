A model for reference use in communication is proposed, from a representationist point of view. Both the sender and the receiver of a message handle representations of their common environment, including mental representations of objects. Reference resolution by a computer is viewed as the construction of object representations using referring expressions from the discourse, whereas often only coreference links between such expressions are looked for. Differences between these two approaches are discussed.The model has been implemented with elementary rules, and tested on complex narrative texts (hundreds to thousands of referring expressions). The results support the mental representations paradigm.
