Utilizing massive web-scale datasets has led to unprecedented performance gains in machine learning models, but also imposes outlandish compute requirements for their training. In order to improve training and data efficiency, we here push the limits of pruning large-scale multimodal datasets for training CLIP-style models. Today's most effective pruning method on ImageNet clusters data samples into separate concepts according to their embedding and prunes away the most prototypical samples. We scale this approach to LAION and improve it by noting that the pruning rate should be concept-specific and adapted to the complexity of the concept. Using a simple and intuitive complexity measure, we are able to reduce the training cost to a quarter of regular training. By filtering from the LAION dataset, we find that training on a smaller set of high-quality data can lead to higher performance with significantly lower training costs. More specifically, we are able to outperform the LAION-trained OpenCLIP-ViT-B32 model on ImageNet zero-shot accuracy by 1.1p.p. while only using 27.7% of the data and training compute. Despite a strong reduction in training cost, we also see improvements on ImageNet dist. shifts, retrieval tasks and VTAB. On the DataComp Medium benchmark, we achieve a new state-of-the-art Imagehttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsNet zero-shot accuracy and a competitive average zero-shot accuracy on 38 evaluation tasks.
