Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gripped modern society as a viable approach to revolutionize operational capabilities across multiple industries. One critical application area that could stand to benefit from the capabilities of AI is cybersecurity. Increasingly, federal funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation are calling for enhanced AI-enabled analytics capabilities to improve cyber threat intelligence, cyber defense generation, and more. To this end, this half-day workshop, not in its third year at ACM KDD, sought to attain significant contributions related to various aspects of AI-enabled cybersecurity analytics. This workshop received a record number of submissions. Submissions were reviewed by a highly-qualified, interdisciplinary group of AI for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners spanning academia and private industry firms.
