Video deblurring aims to restore the latent video frames from their blurred counterparts. Despite the remarkable progress, most promising video deblurring methods only investigate the temporal priors in the spatial domain and rarely explore their its potential in the frequency domain. In this paper, we revisit the blurred sequence in the Fourier space and figure out some intrinsic frequency-temporal priors that imply the temporal blur degradation can be accessibly decoupled in the potential frequency domain. Based on these priors, we propose a novel Fourier-based frequency-temporal video deblurring solution, where the core design accommodates the temporal spectrum to a popular video deblurring pipeline of feature extraction, alignment, aggregation, and optimization. Specifically, we design a Spectrum Prior-guided Alignment module by leveraging enlarged blur information in the potential spectrum to mitigate the blur effects on the alignment. Then, Temporal Energy prior-driven Aggregation is implemented to replenish the original local features by estimating the temporal spectrum energy as the global sharpness guidance. In addition, the customized frequency loss is devised to optimize the proposed method for decent spectral distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model performs favorably against other state-of-the-art methods, thus confirming the effectiveness of frequency-temporal prior modeling.
