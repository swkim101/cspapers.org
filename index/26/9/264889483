In recent years, the field of drug delivery has seen a significant shift towards the exploration and utilization of nanoparticles (NPs) as versatile carriers for therapeutic agents. With its ability to provide exact control over NPsâ€™ characteristics, microfluidics has emerged as a potent platform for the efficient and controlled synthesis of NPs. Microfluidic devices designed for precise fluid manipulation at the micro-scale offer a unique platform for tailoring NP properties, enabling enhanced control over NP properties such as size, morphology, and size distribution while ensuring high batch-to-batch reproducibility. Microfluidics can be used to produce liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymer-based NPs, and lipid-polymer hybrid NPs, as well as a variety of inorganic NPs such as silica, metal, metal oxide, quantum dots, and carbon-based NPs, offering precise control over composition and surface properties. Its unique precision in tailoring NP properties holds great promise for advancing NP-based drug delivery systems in both clinical and industrial settings. Although challenges with large-scale production still remain, microfluidics offers a transformative approach to NP synthesis. In this review, starting from the historical development of microfluidic systems, the materials used to create the systems, microfabrication methods, and system components will be discussed in order to provide the reader with an overview of microfluidic systems. In the following, studies on the fabrication of nanoparticles such as lipid NPs, polymeric NPs, and inorganic NPs in microfluidic devices are included.
