Let X be a family of k-element subsets of [n] and let {fs:s→Σ  :   s∈ X} be an ensemble of local functions, each defined over a subset s⊂ [n]. Is there a global function G:[n]→Σ such that fs = G|s for all s∈ X ? An agreement test is a randomized property tester for this question. One such test is the V-test, that chooses a random pair of sets s1,s2∈ X with prescribed intersection size and accepts if fs1,fs2 agree on the elements in s1∩ s2. The low acceptance (or 1%) regime is concerned with the situation that the test succeeds with low but non-negligible probability Agree({fs}) ≥ ε>0. A “classical” low acceptance agreement theorem says Agree ({f_s}) > ε =⇒  ∃G:[n]→Σ, Prs[f_s0.99≈ G|_s](ε).   (*) Such statements are motivated by PCP questions. The case X={s ⊆ [n]   :   |s|=k} is well-studied and known as “direct product testing”, which is related to the parallel repetition theorem. Finding sparser families X that satisfy (*) is known as derandomized direct product testing. Prior to this work, the sparsest family satisfying (*) had |X|≈ n25, and we show X with |X|≈ n2. We study the general behavior of high dimensional expanders with respect to agreement tests in the low acceptance regime. High dimensional expanders, even very sparse ones with |X|=O(n), are known to satisfy the high acceptance variant (where ε =1−o(1)). It has been an open challenge to analyze the low acceptance regime. Surprisingly, topological covers of X play an important role. We show that: If X has no connected covers, then (*) holds, provided that X satisfies an additional expansion property, called swap cosystolic expansion. If X has a connected cover, then (*) fails. If X has a connected cover (and swap-cosystolic-expansion), we replace (*) by a statement that takes covers into account: Agree({f_s})> ε=⇒ ∃ cover ρ:Y↠X, and G:Y(0)→Σ, such that Prs↠s[f_s 0.99≈ G|_s] (ε),   (**) where s↠ s means that ρ(s)=s. Our main result is a proof of (LFD) for complexes X whose links are spherical buildings. The property of swap-cosystolic-expansion holds for quotients of the Bruhat Tits buildings. As a corollary we derive (*) for X being a spherical building, yielding a derandomized family with |X| ≈ n2. We also derive (**) for LSV complexes X, for which |X|=O(n).
