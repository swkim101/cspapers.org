What will people experience when drones become common in home environments? How will their functions and distances impact human experiences? To explore the potential usage of indoor drones, we conducted a mixed-methods study (N=60) on the reported perceptions of a small flying robot. We employed a factorial experimental design, involving four intended drone functions (camera, education, pet, unknown) at two distances (near, far). Our findings suggest that intended functions significantly influence participantsâ€™ perceptions. Among the functions examined, participants found the camera useful but annoying, and the pet useless but pleasant. The education emerged as the most favored function, while the unknown function was the least preferred one. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for designing positive interactions between humans and indoor drones, considering aspects such as context, transparency, privacy, technical factors, and personalization.
