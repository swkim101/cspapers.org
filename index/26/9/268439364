Technology has become an indispensable part of daily life, yet the number of individuals with the knowledge and skills to advocate for and develop technology with accessibility in mind remains small. Introducing accessibility best practices to students early in their college career provides them the opportunity to learn about resources and strategies that they can carry into their jobs or other activities to improve digital accessibility in their communities. This poster describes a first-year seminar at Kalamazoo College that focuses on technology for accessibility as the basis for engaging in discussion, learning about college resources and college life, and for improving students' critical thinking and expository writing skills. The structure and content of this seminar could be easily replicated or modified to work with other models of first-year seminars.
