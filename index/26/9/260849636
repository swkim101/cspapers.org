The learnware paradigm proposed by Zhou [2016] devotes to constructing a market of numerous well-performed models, enabling users to solve problems by reusing existing efforts rather than starting from scratch. A learnware comprises a trained model and the specification which enables the model to be adequately identified according to the user's requirement. Previous studies concentrated on the homogeneous case where models share the same feature space based on Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME) specification. However, in real-world scenarios, models are typically constructed from different feature spaces. If such a scenario can be handled by the market, all models built for a particular task even with different feature spaces can be identified and reused for a new user task. Generally, this problem would be easier if there were additional auxiliary data connecting different feature spaces, however, obtaining such data in reality is challenging. In this paper, we present a general framework for accommodating heterogeneous learnwares without requiring additional auxiliary data. The key idea is to utilize the submitted RKME specifications to establish the relationship between different feature spaces. Additionally, we give a matrix factorization-based implementation and propose the overall procedure for constructing and exploiting the heterogeneous learnware market. Experiments on real-world tasks validate the efficacy of our method.
