Since this is the 25 anniversary of RTSS, I begin this Keynote presentation by highlighting, with a critical eye, a number of key technical successes from the past 25 years. While it is satisfying that our field has been very successful and productive, I prefer to emphasize the future. Consequently, a large part of the presentation focuses on multiple technical ideas and research directions for the future of real-time computing. One theme for the proposed future directions is “We need to get the real into real-time computing.” If I am feeling brave I will conclude with several things we should not be pursuing.
