Active learning strives to reduce the need for costly data annotation, by repeatedly querying an annotator to label the most informative samples from a pool of unlabeled data, and then training a model from these samples. We identify two problems with existing active learning methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation. First, they overlook the severe class imbalance inherent in LiDAR semantic segmentation datasets. Second, to bootstrap the active learning loop when there is no labeled data available, they train their initial model from randomly selected data samples, leading to low performance. This situation is referred to as the cold start problem. To address these problems we propose BaSAL, a size-balanced warm start active learning model, based on the observation that each object class has a characteristic size. By sampling object clusters according to their size, we can thus create a size-balanced dataset that is also more class-balanced. Furthermore, in contrast to existing information measures like entropy or CoreSet, size-based sampling does not require a pretrained model, thus addressing the cold start problem effectively. Results show that we are able to improve the performance of the initial model by a large margin. Combining warm start and size-balanced sampling with established information measures, our approach achieves comparable performance to training on the entire SemanticKITTI dataset, despite using only 5% of the annotations, outperforming existing active learning methods. We also match the existing state-of-the-art in active learning on nuScenes. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Tony-WJR/BaSAL.
