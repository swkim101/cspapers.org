The DNN models are now pervasively used for various applications. Meanwhile, the computing hardware has shifted towards heterogeneous system composed of various accelerators. The intertwined complexity of DNN models and hardware makes it challenging for mapping DNN models. Existing mapping frameworks suffer from inefficiencies due to under utilization of computation and bandwidth in heterogeneous SoC. In this paper, we propose COMB, a mapping framework that coordinates the memory and computation and data transfer overhead of heterogeneous accelerators to achieve latency improvement and energy efficiency with two optimizations: dataflow grouping and accelerator mapping. Dataflow grouping maps multiple independent DNN layers to the same accelerator at the same time to spatially share the hardware resources; accelerator mapping finds the optimized placement of the layer groups to accelerators to reduce data transfer overhead. These two optimizations provide a huge design space for heterogeneous DNN mapping. To explore the space efficiently, we present a hybrid scheduling algorithm by combining greedy algorithm and genetic algorithm. In evaluation, COMB achieves 1.28× and 1.37× speedup for latency compared to MAGMA and H2H; COMB also reduces 22.7% and 29.2% energy consumption compared to MAGMA and H2H.
