Traditional security solutions such as public key cryptosystems can provide a high level of security but are costly regarding memory footprint, computational complexity and power consumption. Therefore, they are unsuitable for Internet of Things devices with limited resources. One way to improve the security of IoT systems is to use a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), a unique digital fingerprint of each device. This paper proposes a lightweight authentication protocol based on Strong PUFs with fuzzy matching and secure boot for IoT devices. The proposed system containing a RISC-V subsystem, a block cipher module and an Arbiter PUF has been successfully implemented on Xilinx FPGA Development Kit Arty A7 100T.
