Recent advancements in instruction-tuned large language models offer new potential for enhancing students' experiences in large-scale classes. Deploying LLMs as student-facing assistants, however, presents challenges. Key issues include integrating class-specific content into responses and applying effective pedagogical techniques. This study addresses these challenges through retrieval and prompting techniques, focusing on mitigating hallucinations in LLM-generated responses, a crucial concern in education. Furthermore, practical deployment brings further challenges related to student data privacy and computational constraints. This research strives to enhance the quality and relevance of LLM responses while addressing practical deployment issues, with an emphasis on creating a versatile system for diverse domains and teaching styles.
