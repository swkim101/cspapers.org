Workscape is a clean-slate design for an office document management product. It was developed through a unique collaboration among the staffs of Digital and MAYA. From earliest concepts to current refinements and productization, Workscape has benefited from interdisciplinary design methods involving specialists from the fields of human factors, computer science, and visual design. Extensive use of mockups, in a variety of media, proved particularly effective in bridging differences of terminology and methodology between these three disciplines.
