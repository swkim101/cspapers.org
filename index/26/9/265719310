For close to two decades, the International Conference on Management of Data (COMAD), modeled along the lines of ACM SIGMOD, has been the premier international database conference hosted in India. The first COMAD was held in Hyderabad in 1989, and the most recent version was hosted in Nagpur during December 2010. The 17th edition in the COMAD series will be held at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIITB), during December 19-21, 2011. Bangalore, also called Bengaluru, is nicknamed the Garden City, and was once called a pensioner's paradise. Today, it is better known as the primary hub for India's Information Technology sector. 
 
COMAD seeks to provide the community of researchers, practitioners, developers and users of data management technologies, a forum to present and discuss problems, solutions, innovations, experiences and emerging trends. During the past few years, the scope of COMAD 2011 has expanded to include, in addition to traditional database areas, topics in Web, Information Retrieval and Data Mining.
