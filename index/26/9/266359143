Decentralized learning has emerged as an alternative method to the popular parameter-server framework which suffers from high communication burden, single-point failure and scalability issues due to the need of a central server. However, most existing works focus on a single shared model for all workers regardless of the data heterogeneity problem, rendering the resulting model performing poorly on individual workers. In this work, we propose a novel personalized decentralized learning algorithm named DePRL via shared representations. Our algorithm relies on ideas from representation learning theory to learn a low-dimensional global representation collaboratively among all workers in a fully decentralized manner, as well as a user-specific low-dimensional local head leading to a personalized solution for each worker. We show that DePRL achieves, for the first time, a provable \textit{linear speedup for convergence} with general non-linear representations (i.e., the convergence rate is improved linearly with respect to the number of workers). Experimental results support our theoretical findings showing the superiority of our method in data heterogeneous environments.
