Embedded systems are increasingly adopting heterogeneous templates integrating hardware accelerators and application-specific processors, which poses novel challenges. In particular, it is difficult to have accurate control of task activities in Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) System on Chips (SoCs), due to complex main memory sharing mechanisms among different computing engines. To address this problem, bandwidth regulation approaches based on monitoring and throttling are widely adopted. Existing solutions, however, are either too coarse-grained, limiting the control over computing engines activities, or platform-dependent, addressing the problem only for specific SoCs. In this paper we propose an innovative, fine-grained and platform-independent approach that can accurately control main memory bandwidth usage in an FPGA-based Heterogeneous System on Chip (HeSoC). Experimental results conducted on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ platform demonstrate that our approach enables solutions not feasible with state-of-the-art bandwidth regulation methods.
