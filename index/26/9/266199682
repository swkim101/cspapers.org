This paper presents a water walking robot with 6 feet which consists of a rimless wheel and a flywheel, and has a foot attached to the tip of each leg. First, in order to make the robot walk on water, we propose a foot control method by imitating the legs of some animals that can walk on water. Second, in order to increase the robot's forward speed, we improved the control method. In addition we have analysed the effect of some different physical parameters on the motion of the robot. This research is aimed at building a versatile water walking model for such applications as marine exploration.
