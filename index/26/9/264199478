Best-fit is the best known algorithm for on-line bin-packing, in the sense that no algorithm is known to behave better both in the worst case (when Best-fit has performance ratio 1.7) and in the average uniform case, with items drawn uniformly in the interval [0, l] (then Best-fit has expected wasted space O(n'/2(log n) " / ")). In practical applications, Best-fit appears to perform within a few percent of optimal. In this paper, in the spirit of previous work in computational geometry, we study the expected performance ratio, taking the worst-case multiset of items L, and assuming that the elements of L are inserted in random order, with all permutations equally likely. We show a lower bound of 1.08. .. and an upper bound of 1.5 on the random order performance ratio of Best-fit. The upper bound contrasts with the result that in the worst case, any (deterministic or randomized) on-line bin-packing algorithm has performance ratio at least 1.54.. . .
