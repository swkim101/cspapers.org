This experience report details the pedagogical approach and curriculum for an introductory programming course for non-majors that combines creative coding, ungrading, and project-based learning, with typical enrollment between 120-140 students. Through a series of skills labs, a term-long group project, and regular self-evaluation milestones, students both build their confidence and motivation to learn programming, as well as typical introductory programming skills. Key to the course's success is the integration of project-based learning with a self-evaluation approach to ungrading. In this paper, I present the design of the course, the underlying pedagogical approach leading to course design decisions, and offer resources for adopting this approach in similar CS1 courses. The paper closes with discussion reflecting on the experiences observed throughout teaching this course, and suggests that the approach of blending ungrading with project-based learning shows promise as an inherently flexible course design that supports student wellbeing, confidence, and motivation.
