A robotic finger is successfully designed, fabricated, analyzed, and examined. The finger consists of bones, joint ligaments, and an extensor hood. Driven by two tendons, it is two degrees on the freedom finger. Although the behavior of this design is not uniform, it provides useful dexterity, sensitivity, and versatility. The artificial bone is lightweight and compact. The actuation is backdrivable in good visibility. Tendon muscles effectively actuate the finger in a grasp direction. This exceptional behavior has the potential to be suitable for a flexible task and may lead to a next-generation gripper and prosthetic hand.
