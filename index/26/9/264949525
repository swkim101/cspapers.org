A power-assisting device is being developed to help older persons and people with disabilities move themselves from beds to wheelchairs. The device is intended to contribute to a more independent life for these people and to greater utilization of their latent abilities. Self-support assistance, i.e., the support provided by a power-assisting device to the person without the need for aid from a caregiver, and capability of the device to assist the movements of the people are discussed. A method for the production of power assistance and motion guidance is then proposed for the device. Finally, a test of the performance of the developed system is described.
