We want to facilitate an interactive gathering of faculty from a variety of disciplines and institutions - including primary, secondary, and tertiary schools - who are interested in exchanging ideas related to the learning and teaching of ethical concepts and skills in a CS or related curriculum, and evaluating the success of those efforts. We understand "curriculum" broadly to include both course and lab instruction and out-of-class experiences. Participants will leave with a set of open-access teaching resources, guidance for how best to use those resources at their own institutions, and ideas for evaluating any courses, curriculum, or programs they develop as a result.
