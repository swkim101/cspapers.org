We characterize the streaming space complexity of every symmetric norm l (a norm on ℝn invariant under sign-flips and coordinate-permutations), by relating this space complexity to the measure-concentration characteristics of l. Specifically, we provide nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the space complexity of calculating a (1 ± ε)-approximation to the norm of the stream, for every 0 < ε ≤ 1/2. (The bounds match up to (ε-1 logn) factors.) We further extend those bounds to any large approximation ratio D≥ 1.1, showing that the decrease in space complexity is proportional to D2, and that this factor the best possible. All of the bounds depend on the median of l(x) when x is drawn uniformly from the l2 unit sphere. The same median governs many phenomena in high-dimensional spaces, such as large-deviation bounds and the critical dimension in Dvoretzky's Theorem. The family of symmetric norms contains several well-studied norms, such as all lp norms, and indeed we provide a new explanation for the disparity in space complexity between p ≤ 2 and p > 2. In addition, we apply our general results to easily derive bounds for several norms that were not studied before in the streaming model, including the top-k norm and the k-support norm, which was recently employed for machine learning tasks. Overall, these results make progress on two outstanding problems in the area of sublinear algorithms (Problems 5 and 30 in http://sublinear.info.
