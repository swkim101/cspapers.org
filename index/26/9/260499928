In recent years, the AI community has witnessed an exciting acceleration in innovation across foundation models, deep learning, new AI applications across numerous verticals, and more. In addition, AI innovations driven by both academic and industry research labs have rapidly been adopted by big tech companies and startups to deliver value-differentiated products and services. For many machine learning researchers looking at commercializing their work, one of the frequently wondered questions is - "How do I kickstart a startup that can commercialize my research innovations?". For many ML practitioners in the KDD community, there is always curiosity on how big tech and startups take AI research and innovations, and scale it to be used by millions of users. This interactive workshop aims to achieve two goals: First, the workshop will bring together invited AI thought leaders working in academia, big tech as well as startups to share their perspective on the next big AI ideas that will change the world, and deliver impact. Second, the workshop will invite startup founders (from both academia and industry) to share their journey of acquiring customers, building a team, pitching for initial funding, and commercializing their research into successful enterprises
