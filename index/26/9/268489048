Computer-based testing (CBT) is becoming more common in CS Education spaces, and offers many advantages over paper-based modalities. For example, computerized assessments make it easier for students to learn from a wider range of questions in problem sets through problem randomization. Students can then work on problem after problem in a formative assessment mode of learning. While computer-based assessments help facilitate randomized prob- lem generation, solution feedback is typically delivered in static text or image formats, or perhaps a video may be provided. Typically these show or describe the instructor solving a generic problem, not this particular randomized problem. The Dynamic Animation Feedback Tool (DAFT) aims to support mastery learning by helping instructors automatically create algo- rithm visualization animations to explain their solutions, customized to the problem the student was given. The instructor would write code to randomly generate a graph using the CBT system, and ask the student some algorithmic question (e.g., what's the sequence of nodes visited in a depth-first search). Then, that same graph would have its nodes animated (by running the hidden instructor solution to "fill in" each node as it was visited). This allows an instructor to ask a question about any algorithm on any randomized graph, and if the student didn't get it right, the animation of the solution on that exact same graph would be available. DAFT provides a visually rich, problem-specific animated solution that hopes to be valuable resource for students to interpret problem solutions and achieve mastery learning
