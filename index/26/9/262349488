On behalf of the Executive Committee of ACM's Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI), welcome to CHI 97, SIGCHI's annual conference on Human- Computer Interaction. Each CHI conference offers a snapshot of the HCI field as it grows and evolves, of the people who define the HCI field and of the people who collectively form SIGCHI. Each CHI conference provides an opportunity to examine the state-of-the-art, explore new areas and look to the future. This year is no exception.While the CHI conference is the most visible activity of SIGCHI, we also:•support conferences in computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), multimedia (MM), user interface software and technology (UIST), design.of interactive systems (DIS) and intelligent user interfaces (IUI).•distribute the highly-respected quarterly SIGCHI Bulletin to members and others.•supported the "birth" and continue to support the evolution of two new publicationsmTransactions on Computer-Human Interactions (TOCHI), a member of the ACM Transactions series and interactions, ACM's first magazine devoted to HCI practitioners.•provide support to a number of activities proposed by our members that provide benefit both to SIGCHI and the field of HCI. The SIGCHI Development Fund supports many of these activities and Calls for Proposals appear frecluently in the SIGCHI Bulletin.SIGCHI is a world-wide group of volunteers who share an interest in the many facets of HCh SIGCHI is committed both to advancing the field of HCI and to communicating information within the SIGCHI community.This conference is one of the forums that SIGCHI provides for people to meet, both formally and informally, to exchange views, to share experiences and to learn. This conference is also a good time to explore taking a more active role in SIGCHI activities. You can do this by contacting us through the ACM Booth at the conference, or by attending the SIGCHI Business Meeting at the conference.
