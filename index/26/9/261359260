This paper presents a new Bayesian topical trend analysis. We regard the parameters of topic Dirichlet priors in latent Dirichlet allocation as a function of document timestamps and optimize the parameters by a gradient-based algorithm. Since our method gives similar hyperparameters to the documents having similar timestamps, topic assignment in collapsed Gibbs sampling is affected by timestamp similarities. We compute TFIDF-based document similarities by using a result of collapsed Gibbs sampling and evaluate our proposal by link detection task of Topic Detection and Tracking.
