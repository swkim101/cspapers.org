Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) faces numerous threats that can lead to its destruction. While the emergence of short video platforms provides opportunities for fostering innovation and communication among ICH practitioners and viewers, it is still understudied how different stakeholders present, explain, and manage ICH via short videos. To address this, we conduct a mixed-method study of ICH-related videos on Douyin, a popular short video platform in China with an extensive user base and wealth of ICH content. By adopting the Critical Heritage Studies (CHS) framework, we propose a taxonomy of frames that construct the landscape of ICH short videos and then investigate the interactions among different groups regarding power, identity, and knowledge. Additionally, we analyze viewer responses to different frames and groups based on audience metrics (e.g., # of likes and comments) and comments. Our research reveals that government-affiliated and indigenous groups dominate the promotion and presentation of ICH on Douyin. Contrary to previous literature, viewer responses show a preference for videos from external ICH groups and ordinary individuals, suggesting a tendency to counter authority and exclusivity associated with ICH. Moreover, it highlights a lack of sustainable debates and negotiations among different groups involved in ICH discourse. Situated within CHS, we provide design implications for ICH safeguarding and sustainability through short videos and online media.
