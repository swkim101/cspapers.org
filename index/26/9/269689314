Multimodal recommender systems have acquired applications in broad web scenarios such as e-commerce businesses and short-video platforms. Existing multimodal recommendation methods generally boost performance by introducing item-side multimodal content as supplement information. However, the common training paradigm, i.e., encoding unimodal content respectively and fusing them to fit user preference scores, makes the model biased towards items with prevailing modality content under non-uniform training data. This results in a serious item-side unfairness issue, i.e., some items with prevailing modality content are over-recommended while a large number of items don't receive adequate recommendation opportunities, leaving corresponding content providers at great disadvantage. Aiming to eliminate such modality bias and promote item-side fairness, we propose a fairness-aware modality debiasing framework based on counterfactual inference. In the training stage, we additionally introduce unimodal prediction branches to capture the modality bias. In the inference stage, we conduct a fairness-aware counterfactual inference to adaptively eliminate the modality bias. The proposed framework is model-agnostic and flexible to be implemented in various multimodal recommendation models. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly enhance item-side fairness while providing competitive recommendation accuracy. Our proposed framework is expected to help mitigate the unfair treatment experienced by vulnerable content providers on multimedia web platforms.
