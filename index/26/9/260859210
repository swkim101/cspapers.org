Compensation is a strategy that a semantics may follow when it faces

dilemmas between quality and quantity of attackers. It allows several weak

attacks to compensate one strong attack. It is based on compensation degree,

which is a tuple that indicates (i) to what extent an attack is weak and (ii) the

number of weak attacks needed to compensate a strong one.

Existing principles on compensation do not specify the parameters, thus it is unclear

whether semantics satisfying them compensate at only one degree or several degrees, and which ones.

This paper proposes a parameterised family of gradual semantics, which

unifies multiple semantics that share some principles but differ in their

strategy regarding solving dilemmas. Indeed, we show that the two semantics taking

the extreme values of the parameter favour respectively quantity and quality, while all

the remaining ones compensate at some degree. We define three classes of compensation

degrees and show that the novel family is able to compensate at all of them while

none of the existing gradual semantics does.
