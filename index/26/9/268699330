The goal of this thesis is to address knowledge graph completion tasks using neuro-symbolic methods. Neuro-symbolic methods allow the joint utilization of symbolic information defined as meta-rules in ontologies and knowledge graph embedding methods that represent entities and relations of the graph in a low-dimensional vector space. This approach has the potential to improve the resolution of knowledge graph completion tasks in terms of reliability, interpretability, data-efficiency and robustness.
