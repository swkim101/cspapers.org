This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of several machine translation (MT) models and aggregation methods in a multi-domain setting under fair conditions and explore a direction for tackling multi-domain MT. We mainly compare the performance of the single model approach by jointly training all domains and the multi-expert models approach with a particular aggregation strategy. We conduct experiments on multiple domain datasets and demonstrate that a combination of smaller domain expert models can outperform a larger model trained for all domain data
