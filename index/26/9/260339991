Cryogenic CMOS circuits operate at temperatures close to absolute zero and are essential in many applications such as controllers for quantum computing but also medical engineering, space technology, or physical instruments. However, operating circuits at cryogenic temperatures fundamentally changes the underlying semiconductor physics that governs the CMOS transistorâ€”rendering existing design automation approaches infeasible. In this work, we propose and implement the first end-to-end approach that enables design automation for cryogenic CMOS circuits. To this end, we (1) perform the first-of-its-kind measurements of commercial 5nm FinFET transistors from 300K down to 10K, (2) use the results to validate and calibrate the first cryogenic-aware industrial-standard compact model for FinFET technology, (3) create cryogenic-aware standard cell libraries that are compatible with the existing EDA tool flows, and (4) propose an initial cryogenic-aware logic synthesis approach that re-uses established design automation expertise but optimizes it for cryogenic purposes. Evaluations, comparisons, and discussions of all these novel contributions confirm the applicability and validity of the resulting cryogenic-aware design automation flow.
