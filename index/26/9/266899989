The language-conditioned robotic manipulation aims to transfer natural language instructions into executable actions, from simple "pick-and-place" to tasks requiring intent recognition and visual reasoning. Inspired by the dual-process theory in cognitive science—which suggests two parallel systems of fast and slow thinking in human decision-making—we introduce Robotics with Fast and Slow Thinking (RFST), a framework that mimics human cognitive architecture to classify tasks and makes decisions on two systems based on instruction types. Our RFST consists of two key components: 1) an instruction discriminator to determine which system should be activated based on the current user’s instruction, and 2) a slow-thinking system that is comprised of a fine-tuned vision-language model aligned with the policy networks, which allow the robot to recognize user’s intention or perform reasoning tasks. To assess our methodology, we built a dataset featuring real-world trajectories, capturing actions ranging from spontaneous impulses to tasks requiring deliberate contemplation. Our results, both in simulation and real-world scenarios, confirm that our approach adeptly manages intricate tasks that demand intent recognition and reasoning.
