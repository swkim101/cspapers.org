The flexure-based XYZ micropositioner with hybrid configuration has become more prevalent due to the characteristics of less mechanism decoupling and high motion precision. However, traditional mechanism design suffers from a large plane occupation with Z stage stacking, which leads to a low space-utilization efficiency. To address this issue, a novel conceptual design is proposed in this paper by integrating a spatially structured XY stage and an embedded Z stage together. After completing the design of the mechanism, the driving stiffness of the stage in three axes is evaluated by the mechanics analysis. Then, the model is verified by performing finite element analysis simulation study and experimental test. The theoretical model, simulation results, and experimental data indicate a good agreement. Experimental results show that the proposed flexure-based XYZ micropositioner can deliver a stroke of $\boldsymbol{4.15 \text{mm} \times 4.06 \text{mm} \times 0.04}$ mm with a physical size of $\boldsymbol{116 \text{mm} \times 116 \text{mm} \times 45 \text{mm}. }$ The performance comparison reveals that it has a superior space-utilization efficiency. In consideration of the feasibility of the proposed conceptual design, it provides a reference for diversified and refined design of XYZ micropositioners.
