Layered asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (LACO-OFDM), efficiently using subcarriers without a DC bias, is the key to the widespread adoption of visible light communications (VLC). However, one significant challenge of this scheme is that more clipping noise is added on the higher layers. Conventional transmission systems that use a fixed modulation scheme for all layers tend to have degraded BER performance in the higher layers. Therefore, the modulation scheme of each layer is not optimized, leading to poor throughput performance. To achieve throughput enhancement of LACO-OFDM, we propose a novel adaptive modulation scheme to optimally switch the modulation scheme of each layer according to the effect of clipping noise. Results from the simulation indicate that the proposed scheme enhances throughput performance compared to the conventional schemes.
