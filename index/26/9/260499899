This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners across different strands of data science research and a wide range of important real-world application domains. The objective is to share the current state of research and practice, explore future work directions, and create collaboration opportunities. In addition, the workshop will emphasize highlighting data science approaches for tackling the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (see preliminary agenda below). The organizers believe that data science research has an important role to play in providing unique insights about critical challenges faced by marginalized communities around the world; we encourage submissions from both data science researchers as well as social workers, agronomists, epidemiologists, health policy researchers, and other domain experts who are interested in engaging with the SIGKDD community.
