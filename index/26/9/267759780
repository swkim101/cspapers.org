This paper introduces a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (N-MPC) framework exploiting a Deep Neural Network for processing onboard-captured depth images for collision avoidance in trajectory-tracking tasks with UAVs. The network is trained on simulated depth images to output a collision score for queried 3D points within the sensor field of view. Then, this network is translated into an algebraic symbolic equation and included in the N-MPC, explicitly constraining predicted positions to be collision-free throughout the receding horizon. The N-MPC achieves real time control of a UAV with a control frequency of 100Hz. The proposed framework is validated through statistical analysis of the collision classifier network, as well as Gazebo simulations and real experiments to assess the resulting capabilities of the N-MPC to effectively avoid collisions in cluttered environments. The associated code is released open-source.
