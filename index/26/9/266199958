Due to the advantages of high flexibility, large workspace, and good human-body compatibility, flexible tendon-driven surgical continuum robots have attracted a lot of attention in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However, due to the coupling of the position and angle of the continuum robot, and the easy deformation of the external force, its inverse kinematics solution has always been a challenge. This paper proposes a fast inverse kinematics solver for surgical continuum robots with a variable curvature model. Firstly, the deformation of the continuum robot is analyzed, and a representation method of the variable curvature model is proposed. Next, to solve the inverse kinematics problem when the continuum robot deforms under load, FABRIKv is proposed by improving the Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK). During the inverse kinematics solution, the algorithm preserves the real-time nature of FABRIK and corrects for deformation effects caused by the load. Finally, the experiment verifies the rationality and effectiveness of the variable curvature model representation method, as well as the fastness and accuracy of the FARIKv solver.
