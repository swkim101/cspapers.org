Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight perturbations in the graph structure can lead to erroneous predictions. However, current robust models for defending against such attacks inherit the transductive limitations of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). As a result, they are constrained by fixed structures and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here, we discover that transductive GCNs inherently possess a distillable robustness, achieved through a wave-induced resonance process. Based on this, we foster this resonance to facilitate inductive and robust learning. Specifically, we first prove that the signal formed by GCN-driven message passing (MP) is equivalent to the edge-based Laplacian wave, where, within a wave system, resonance can naturally emerge between the signal and its transmitting medium. This resonance provides inherent resistance to malicious perturbations inflicted on the signal system. We then prove that merely three MP iterations within GCNs can induce signal resonance between nodes and edges, manifesting as a coupling between nodes and their distillable surrounding local subgraph. Consequently, we present Graph Resonance-fostering Network (GRN) to foster this resonance via learning node representations from their distilled resonating subgraphs. By capturing the edge-transmitted signals within this subgraph and integrating them with the node signal, GRN embeds these combined signals into the central node's representation. This node-wise embedding approach allows for generalization to unseen nodes. We validate our theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that GRN generalizes robustness to unseen nodes, whilst maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy on perturbed graphs.
