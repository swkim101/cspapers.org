In this study, we introduce AV-PedAware, a self-supervised audio-visual fusion system designed to improve dynamic pedestrian awareness for robotics applications. Pedestrian awareness is a critical requirement in many robotics applications. However, traditional approaches that rely on cameras and LIDARs to cover multiple views can be expensive and susceptible to issues such as changes in illumination, occlusion, and weather conditions. Our proposed solution replicates human perception for 3D pedestrian detection using low-cost audio and visual fusion. This study represents the first attempt to employ audio-visual fusion to monitor footstep sounds for the purpose of predicting the movements of pedestrians in the vicinity. The system is trained through self-supervised learning based on LIDAR-generated labels, making it a cost-effective alternative to LIDAR-based pedestrian awareness. AV-PedAware achieves comparable results to LIDAR-based systems at a fraction of the cost. By utilizing an attention mechanism, it can handle dynamic lighting and occlusions, overcoming the limitations of traditional LIDAR and camera-based systems. To evaluate our approach's effectiveness, we collected a new multimodal pedestrian detection dataset and conducted experiments that demonstrate the system's ability to provide reliable 3D detection results using only audio and visual data, even in extreme visual conditions. We will make our collected dataset and source code available online for the community to encourage further development in the field of robotics perception systems.
