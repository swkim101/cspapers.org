This paper describes a new theory of how spreading activation may occur in associative memory models formulated as parallel activation networks. The theory postulates that competition for activation by nodes/concepts in a network is a fundamental principle of memory retrieval. Using only excitatory connections between concepts, a specific implementation of this model is able to demonstrate "virtual lateral inhibition" between competitors and other interesting behaviors that have required use of explicit inhibitory connections in the past.
