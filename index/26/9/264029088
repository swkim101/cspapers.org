This year's Symposium on Security and Privacy is sixth in a se!ies of annual symposia which helped establish computer security as a distinct discipline of computer science and engineering. As a discipline of computer science and engineering, computer security demands a blend of both theoretical and practical thinking. It offers rich opportunities for contributions from either direction and for the creative application of theoretical results in real systems. Undoubtedly, this Symposium continues the established tradition of fostering this interplay of needs and ideas. The computer security topics addressed by this year's Symposium cover a wide range, including verification methods and tools, network security, cryptographic algorithms and techniques, security policy, and OS and DBMS security mechanisms. The growing interest in this Symposium is reflected by the large number of submissions. We received 63 submissions of papers and 2 panel proposalsâ€”a substantial increase over previous years. Each paper was reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. The results of the review process led to the selection of the 25 papers for inclusion in the three-day, nine-session program. For the first time, the best papers from this Symposium will be published in an issue of IEEE Software during 1985. We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers to the Symposium and the Program Committee members who, despite their geographic distribution and a demanding review schedule, responded promptly to all our demands. Last but not least our thanks are due to Ms. Lee Blue of the IEEE Computer Society for her efforts and patience in producing the Symposium Proceedings.
