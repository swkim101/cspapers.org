Self-deletion is a well-known strategy frequently utilized by malware to evade detection. Recently, this technique has found its way into client-side JavaScript code, significantly raising the complexity of JavaScript analysis. In this work, we systematically study the emerging client-side JavaScript self-deletion behavior on the web. We tackle various technical challenges associated with JavaScript dynamic analysis and introduce JSRay, a browser-based JavaScript runtime monitoring system designed to comprehensively study client-side script deletion. We conduct a large-scale measurement of one million popular websites, revealing that script self-deletion is prevalent in the real world. While our findings indicate that most developers employ self-deletion for legitimate purposes, we also discover that self-deletion has already been employed together with other anti-analysis techniques for cloaking suspicious operations in client-side JavaScript.
