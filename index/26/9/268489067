Broadening participation in computing (BPC) is a focus in industry and academia. Extant research focuses on what broadening participation in computing (BPC) efforts are pursued, while we propose focusing on how change happens. Our qualitative study applied John Kotter's (2012) eight-stage change framework to analyze interviews with faculty and staff engaged in BPC efforts. Illustrative examples from our interviews elucidate each of the eight stages and how they can be applied to pursue organizational change efforts that support BPC.
