Constraint Programming (CP) has been successfully used to model and solve complex combinatorial problems. However, modeling is often not trivial and requires expertise, which is a bottleneck to wider adoption. In Constraint Acquisition (CA), the goal is to assist the user by automatically learning the model.
In (inter)active CA, this is done by interactively posting queries to the user, e.g. does this partial solution satisfy your (unspecified) constraints or not.
While interactive CA methods learn the constraints, the learning is related to symbolic concept learning, as the goal is to learn an exact representation. 
However, a large number of queries is required to learn the model, which is a major limitation. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this limitation by tightening the connection of CA and Machine Learning (ML), by, for the first time in interactive CA, exploiting statistical ML methods. We propose to use probabilistic classification models to guide interactive CA queries to the most promising parts. We discuss how to train classifiers to predict whether a candidate expression from the bias is a constraint of the problem or not, using both relation-based and scope-based features. We then show how the predictions can be used in all layers of interactive CA: the query generation, the scope finding, and the lowest-level constraint finding. We experimentally evaluate our proposed methods using different classifiers and show that our methods greatly outperform the state of the art, decreasing the number of queries needed to converge by up to 72%.
