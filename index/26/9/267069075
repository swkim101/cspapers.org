Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) poses the challenge of identifying relationships between entities within a document. Existing approaches rely on logical reasoning or contextual cues from entities. This paper reframes document-level RE as link prediction over a Knowledge Graph (KG) with distinct benefits: 1) Our approach amalgamates entity context and document-derived logical reasoning, enhancing link prediction quality. 2) Predicted links between entities offer interpretability, elucidating employed reasoning. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets - DocRED, ReDocRED, and DWIE. The results indicate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models and suggests that incorporating context-based Knowledge Graph link prediction techniques can enhance the performance of document-level relation extraction models.
