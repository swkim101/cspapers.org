This paper proposes a single-layer filtering patch antenna with dual-band dual-polarized radiation. It consists of a rectangular patch fed by two orthogonal T-shaped feeds to generate the dual-polarization. Each feeding structure is composed of a microstrip-line, a pair of $\lambda$/4 resonators, and a via, which is coupled in proximity to the patch for broadband and filtering characteristics. The dual-band operation is obtained by choosing the resonant lengths of the T-shaped feeds and the patch dimensions. For verification, a prototype operating at 5.4 and 7.8 GHz with horizontal and vertical polarization, respectively, is fabricated and tested. The antenna achieves an impedance bandwidth of 5.30 – 5.63 GHz / 7.22 – 8.27 GHz, a port-to-port isolation of ≥ 30 dB, peak gains of 7.5/8.0 dBi, and out-of-band suppression of ≥ 28 dB.
