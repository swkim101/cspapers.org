Human-aware planning involves generating plans that are explicable as well as providing explanations when such plans cannot be found. In this paper, we bring these two concepts together and show how an agent can achieve a trade-off between these two competing characteristics of a plan. In order to achieve this, we conceive a first of its kind planner MEGA that can augment the possibility of explaining a plan in the plan generation process itself. We situate our discussion in the context of recent work on explicable planning and explanation generation and illustrate these concepts in two well-known planning domains, as well as in a demonstration of a robot in a typical search and reconnaissance task. Human factor studies in the latter highlight the usefulness of the proposed approach.
