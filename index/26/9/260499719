Real-world graphs such as social networks, communication networks, and rating networks are constantly evolving over time. Many deep learning architectures have been developed to learn effective node representations using both graph structure and dynamics. While being crucial for practical applications, the robustness of these representation learners for dynamic graphs in the presence of adversarial attacks is highly understudied. In this work, we design a novel adversarial attack on discrete-time dynamic graph models where we desire to perturb the input graph sequence in a manner that preserves the temporal dynamics of the graph while dropping the performance of representation learners. To this end, we motivate a novel Temporal Dynamics-Aware Perturbation (TDAP) constraint, which ensures that perturbations introduced at each time step are restricted to only a small fraction of the number of changes in the graph since the previous time step. We present a theoretically-motivated Projected Gradient Descent approach for dynamic graphs to find effective perturbations under the TDAP constraint. Experiments on two tasks - dynamic link prediction and node classification, show that our approach is up to 4x more effective than the baseline methods for attacking these models. We extend our approach to a more practical online setting where graphs become available in real-time and show up to 5x superior performance over baselines We also show that our approach successfully evades state-of-the-art neural approaches for anomaly detection, thereby promoting the need to study robustness as a part of representation-learning approaches for dynamic graphs.
