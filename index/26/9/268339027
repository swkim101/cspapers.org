This experience report presents results from a quasi-experiment comparing course performance and student-reported survey constructs between two groups of students. One group took a Data Structures course with traditional, in-person modality. The second group took the same course with flexible, online modality. The work was motivated by the rapid adjustments computer science instructors made due to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a response to these forced changes, this study was set up to investigate the differences between pre- and post- pandemic modalities. There are 212 students in the study, which took place in Fall 2021 at an R1, minority serving institution in the Midwestern United States. The study found that students in both groups performed similarly on common course components like projects, labs, homework, and a final Data Structures assessment. There were not significant differences in their self-reported ease of learning, enjoyment, belongingness, attitude, mindset, and self-efficacy. However, when taking into consideration gender, we found that women's performance was lower than men's in the traditional modality course. Women's performance in the flexible modality course was on par with men. Lastly, we present some feedback from students relating to assessments and modality.
