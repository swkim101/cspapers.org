Ethically compliant autonomous systems (ECAS) are the prevailing approach to building robotic systems that perform sequential decision making subject to ethical theories in fully observable environments. However, in real-world robotics settings, these systems often operate under partial observability because of sensor limitations, environmental conditions, or limited inference due to bounded computational resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a partially observable ECAS (PO-ECAS), bringing this work one step closer to being a practical and useful tool for roboticists. First, we formally introduce the PO-ECAS framework and a MILP-based solution method for approximating an optimal ethically compliant policy. Next, we extend an existing ethical framework for prima facie duties to belief space and offer an ethical framework for virtue ethics inspired by Aristotleâ€™s Doctrine of the Mean. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is effective in a simulated campus patrol robot domain.
