In recent years, UAVs have been applied in many fields, both civil and military. Combining individual UAVs into a swarm makes it possible for them to accomplish complex tasks and meet special requirements. With the advantages of a centralized network that is low cost, easy to deploy, and easy to manage, we focus on connecting the child UAV s through the parent UAV to create a central network. However, the centralized network still has some disadvantages that need to be improved: the systemâ€™s fault tolerance is still poor, and the quality of service is not good (it is difficult to meet important events). To solve the above challenges, we propose a centralized network model improvement system with the parent UAV as the central UAV connecting the child UAVs and a backup UAV; combined with Ground Control Station. Based on solutions in nature: backup and prioritization, the proposed system has overcome the abovementioned disadvantages of the centralized network.
