In this paper, we tackle the control and trajectory planning problems for the cooperative transportation system of cable-suspended payload with multi Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Firstly, a payload controller is presented considering the dynamic coupling between the UAV and the payload to accomplish the active suppression of payload swing and the complex payload trajectory tracking. Secondly, different from the simplification of obstacles in most approaches, we propose three Insetting Formation (IF) algorithms for the complete obstacle shape to generate collision-free waypoints for the cooperative transportation system. An IF strategy is proposed by integrating three IF algorithms to improve the success rate of obstacle avoidance and reduce the algorithm complexity for performing the aggressive flight. Finally, we verify the robustness and high performance of the proposed algorithm through benchmark comparison and real-world experiments. Moreover, our source code is released as an open-source ros package.
