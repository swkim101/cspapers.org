Established techniques that enable robots to learn from demonstrations are based on learning a stable dynamical system (DS). To increase the robotsâ€™ resilience to perturbations during tasks that involve static obstacle avoidance, we propose incorporating barrier certificates into an optimization problem to learn a stable and barrier-certified DS. Such optimization problem can be very complex or extremely conservative when the traditional linear parameter-varying formulation is used. Thus, different from previous approaches in the literature, we propose to use polynomial representations for DSs, which yields an optimization problem that can be tackled by sum-of-squares techniques. Finally, our approach can handle obstacle shapes that fall outside the scope of assumptions typically found in the literature concerning obstacle avoidance within the DS learning framework.
