A pad, especially an athletic pad, and particularly a pad for use in contact sports to protect the wearer, in which a film of plastic material is deposited on a support and then a body of the same material with a blowing agent therein is placed on the film and the pad member is then cured (gelled and fused) with simultaneous blowing of the added body of material. The pad member is formed so that different regions thereof are different in thickness to provide for increased protection in the thicker regions while flexibility is maintained in the thinner regions of the pad member. The addition of at least one elastic strap element to the pad for retaining it in position on the body completes the construction of the pad member.
