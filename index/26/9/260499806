Manufacturing data analytics tasks are traditionally undertaken with Mechanism Models (MMs), which are domain-specific mathematical equations modeling the underlying physical or chemical processes of the tasks. Recently, Deep Learning (DL) has been increasingly applied to manufacturing. MMs and DL have their individual pros and cons, motivating the development of Mechanism-guided Deep Learning Models (MDLMs) that combine the two. Existing MDLMs are often tailored to specific tasks or types of MMs, and can fail to effectively 1) utilize interconnections of multiple input examples, 2) adaptively self-correct prediction errors with error bounding, and 3) ensemble multiple MMs. In this work, we propose a generic, task-agnostic MDLM framework that can embed one or more MMs in deep networks, and address the 3 aforementioned issues. We present 2 diverse use cases where we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our models.
