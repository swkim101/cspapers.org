TV White Spaces has recently been in the interest of the networking community as an alternative to alleviate the spectrum crunch, incentivizing the need to understand the dynamics of congestion of the occupied spectrum and the quantification of the free spectrum. In this respect, many regulatory organizations may provide references for the legal allocation of the spectrum and therefore allow primary and secondary users to plan their deployments. In this article, we present the motivations and challenges to collect spectrum measurements as a global challenge. We discuss a prototype to massively collect spectrum footprints at low-cost to make it available to communities.
