Processing SPARQL queries over large federations of SPARQL endpoints is crucial for keeping the Semantic Web decentralized. Despite the existence of hundreds of SPARQL endpoints, current federation engines only scale to dozens. One major issue comes from the current definition of the source selection problem, i.e., finding the minimal set of SPARQL endpoints to contact per triple pattern. Even if such a source selection is minimal, only a few combinations of sources may return results. Consequently, most of the query processing time is wasted evaluating combinations that return no results. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Result-Aware query plans. This concept ensures that every subquery of the query plan effectively contributes to the result of the query. To compute a Result-Aware query plan, we propose FedUP, a new federation engine able to produce Result-Aware query plans by tracking the provenance of query results. However, getting query results requires computing source selection, and computing source selection requires query results. To break this vicious cycle, FedUP computes results and provenances on tiny quotient summaries of federations at the cost of source selection accuracy. Experimental results on federated benchmarks demonstrate that FedUP outperforms state-of-the-art federation engines by orders of magnitude in the context of large-scale federations.
