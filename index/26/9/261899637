As the resolution continues to increase, the scale of the power grid of the flat panel display (FPD) becomes huge. This imposes a severe computational challenge for analysis and storage. In this paper, based on the highly periodic FPD structure, we present an efficient simulator which contains a novel stamping scheme and a fast structural solver. Experiments on real industrial cases show that compared to the conventional stamping scheme, our proposed stamping scheme achieves up to 118× speedup in 74× less memory; compared to the state-of-art direct solver, Cholmod, our proposed structural solver achieves up to 17× speedup in 5× less memory.
