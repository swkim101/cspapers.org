This paper presents an efficient application of a model based predictive control in parallel mechanisms. A predictive functional control strategy based on a simplified dynamic model is implemented. Experimental results are shown for the H4 robot, a fully parallel structure providing 3 degrees of freedom (dof) in translation and 1 dof in rotation. Predictive functional control, computed torque control and PID control strategies are compared in complex machining tasks trajectories. The tracking performances are enlightened.
