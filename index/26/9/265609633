Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) excel in photorealistically rendering static scenes. However, rendering dynamic, long-duration radiance fields on ubiquitous devices remains challenging, due to data storage and computational constraints. In this paper, we introduce VideoRF, the first approach to enable real-time streaming and rendering of dynamic human-centric radiance fields on mobile platforms. At the core is a serialized 2D feature image stream representing the 4D radiance field all in one. We introduce a tailored training scheme directly applied to this 2D domain to impose the temporal and spatial redundancy of the feature image stream. By leveraging the redundancy, we show that the feature image stream can be efficiently compressed by 2D video codecs, which allows us to exploit video hardware accelerators to achieve real-time decoding. On the other hand, based on the feature image stream, we propose a novel rendering pipeline for VideoRF, which has specialized space mappings to query radiance properties efficiently. Paired with a deferred shading model, VideoRF has the capability of real-time rendering on mobile devices thanks to its efficiency. We have developed a real-time interactive player that enables online streaming and rendering of dynamic scenes, offering a seamless and immersive free-viewpoint experience across a range of devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
