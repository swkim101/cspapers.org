We revisit the question of how many virtual networks (VNs) are required to provably avoid deadlock in a cache coherence protocol. The textbook way of reasoning about VNs says that the number of VNs depends on the longest chain of message dependencies in the protocol. We show that this conventional wisdom is incorrect and results in a number of virtual networks that is neither necessary nor sufficient for the general system model of an arbitrary interconnection network (ICN) topology and multiple directories. We have created a formalism for modeling coherence protocols and their interactions with ICN queueing. Using that formalism, we have developed an algorithm that (a) determines the minimum number of virtual networks required to avoid deadlock and (b) generates the mappings from message types to virtual networks.
