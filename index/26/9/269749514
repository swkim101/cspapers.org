Many families often live geographically apart from each other due to work, education, or marriage. Therefore, long-distance families frequently use computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools to stay connected. While CMC tools have significantly improved family communication, they cannot fully mediate social presence. To examine the potential of telepresence robots for improving long-distance family communication, we conducted a two-week qualitative in situ study involving eight families. We analyzed recorded videos of their family interactions and conducted pre- and post-deployment interviews. Our findings highlight telepresence robotsâ€™ potential as family communication tools, enabling immersive, natural, and dynamic interactions through physical embodiment and autonomy. Particularly, we identified five categories of family interaction mediated by telepresence robots: engaging in multi-party family communication, exploring home, restoring family routines, providing support, and having joint physical activities. Based on our findings, we present design guidelines for leveraging telepresence robots as effective family communication tools.
