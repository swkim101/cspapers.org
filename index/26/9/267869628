Constant propagation is a well known global flow analysis problem. The goal of constant propagation is to discover values that are constant on all possible executions of a program and to propagate these constant values as far forward through the program as possible. Expressions that have all constant operands can be evaluated at compile time and the results further propagated. The use of the algorithms presented here can result in smaller and faster compiled programs.
