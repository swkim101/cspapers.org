Most existing targeted password guessing models view users’ reuse behaviors as sequences of edit operations (e.g., insert and delete) performed on old passwords. These atomic edit operations are limited to modifying one character at a time and cannot fully cover users’ complex password modiﬁca-tion behaviors (e.g., modifying the password structure). This partially leads to a signiﬁcant gap between the proportion of users’ reused passwords and the success rates that existing targeted guessing models can achieve. To ﬁll this gap, this paper models users’ reuse behaviors by focusing on two key components: (1) What they want to copy/keep; (2) What they want to tweak. More speciﬁcally, we introduce the pointer mechanism and propose a new targeted guessing model, namely P OINT - ER G UESS . By hierarchically redeﬁning password reuse from both personal and population-wide perspectives, we can accurately and comprehensively characterize users’ password reuse behaviors. Moreover, we propose MS-P OINTER G UESS , which can employ the victim’s multiple leaked passwords. By employing 13 large-scale real-world password datasets, we demonstrate that P OINTER G UESS is effective: (1) When the victim’s password at site A (namely pw A ) is known, within 100 guesses, the average success rate of P OINTER G UESS in guessing her password at site B (namely pw B , pw A (cid:2) = pw B ) is 25.21% (for common users) and 12.34% (for security-savvy users), respectively, which is 21.23% ∼ 71.54% (38.37% on average) higher than its
