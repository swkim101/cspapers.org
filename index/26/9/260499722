Along with the rapid technological and commercial innovation on the e-commerce platforms, there are an increasing number of frauds that bring great harm to these platforms. Many frauds are conducted by organized groups of fraudsters for higher efficiency and lower costs, which are also known as group-based frauds. Despite the high concealment and strong destructiveness of group-based fraud, there is no existing research work that can thoroughly exploit the information within the transaction networks of e-commerce platforms for group-based fraud detection. In this work, we analyze and summarize the characteristics of group-based frauds, based on which we propose a novel end-to-end semi-supervised Group-based Fraud Detection Network (GFDN) to support such fraud detection in real-world applications. Experimental results on large-scale e-commerce datasets from Taobao and Bitcoin trading datasets show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model for group-based fraud detection on bipartite graphs.
