It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense -- MTD 2014. 
 
The static nature of current computing systems has made them easy to attack and harder to defend. Adversaries have an asymmetric advantage in that they have the time to study a system, identify its vulnerabilities, and choose the time and place of attack to gain the maximum benefit. The idea of moving target defense is to impose the same asymmetric disadvantage on the attacker by making systems dynamic and harder to predict. With a constantly changing system and its ever adapting attack surface, the attacker will have to deal with a great deal of uncertainty just like defenders do today. The ultimate goal is to level the cybersecurity playing field for defenders versus attackers. This workshop was created to bring together researchers from academia, government, and industry to report on the latest research efforts on MTD and related topics, and to have productive discussion and constructive debate on this topic.
