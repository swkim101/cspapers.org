Diagnosis in histopathology requires a global whole slide images (WSIs) analysis, requiring pathologists to compound evidence from different WSI patches. The gigapixel scale of WSIs poses a challenge for histopathology multimodal models. Training multi-model models for histopathology requires instruction tuning datasets, which currently contain information for individual image patches, without a spatial grounding of the concepts within each patch and without a wider view of the WSI. To bridge this gap, we introduce QUILT-INSTRUCT, a large-scale dataset of107, 131 histopathology-specific instruction question/answer pairs, grounded within diagnostically relevant image patches that make up the WSI. Our dataset is collected by leveraging educational histopathology videos from YouTube, which provides spatial localization of narrations by automatically extracting the narrators' cursor positions. QUILT-INSTRUCT supports contextual reasoning by extracting diagnosis and supporting facts from the entire WSI. Using QUILT-INSTRUCT, we train QUILT-LLAVA, which can reason beyond the given single image patch, enabling diagnostic reasoning across patches. To evaluate QUILT-LLAVA, we propose a compre-hensive evaluation dataset created from 985 images and 1283 human-generated question-answers. We also thor-oughly evaluate QUILT-LLAVA using public histopathology datasets, where QUILT-LLAVA significantly outperforms SOTA by over 10% on relative GPT-4 score and 4% and 9% on open and closed set VQA11Our code, data, and model is publicly accessible at quilt-llava.github.io..
