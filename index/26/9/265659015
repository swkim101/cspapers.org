We present HumanNeRF-SE, a simple yet effective method that synthesizes diverse novel pose images with sim-ple input. Previous HumanNeRF works require a large number of optimizable parameters to fit the human images. Instead, we reload these approaches by combining explicit and implicit human representations to design both general-ized rigid deformation and specific non-rigid deformation. Our key insight is that explicit shape can reduce the sam-pling points used to fit implicit representation, and frozen blending weights from SMPL constructing a generalized rigid deformation can effectively avoid overfitting and im-prove pose generalization performance. Our architecture involving both explicit and implicit representation is sim-ple yet effective. Experiments demonstrate our model can synthesize images under arbitrary poses with few-shot input and increase the speed of synthesizing images by 15 times through a reduction in computational complexity without using any existing acceleration modules. Compared to the state-of-the-art HumanNeRF studies, HumanNeRF-SE achieves better performance with fewer learnable parame-ters and less training time.
