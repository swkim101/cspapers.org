Glass interposers enable 3D stacking between the chiplets embedded into the substrate and the ones stacked directly on top, which is not possible in silicon. In this work, we demonstrate the benefits of such stacking in glass interposers over silicon in terms of key system-level metrics including area, wirelength, signal, power, and thermal integrity. We achieve this goal with GDS layouts of both chiplets and interposers and sign-off simulations. Our experiments show that glass offers 2.6X area, 21X wirelength, 17.72% full-chip power, 64.7% signal integrity, and 10X power integrity improvement over silicon at the cost of 15% increase in temperature.
