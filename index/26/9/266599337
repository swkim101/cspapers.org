Anomaly detection (AD), often termed outlier detection, is a key machine learning (ML) task, aiming to identify uncommon yet crucial patterns in data. With the increasing complexity of the modern world, the applications of AD span wideâ€”from NASA's spacecraft monitoring to early patient prioritization at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Technology giants like Google and Amazon also leverage AD for service disruption identification. Here, I will traverse my AD works with promising new directions, particularly emphasizing reproducible benchmarks (Part 1), automated algorithms (Part 2), and scalable systems (Part 3).
