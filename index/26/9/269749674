The research centers on examining the utilization of instant messaging (IM) in remote work interactions between supervisors and subordinates. Through a series of one-on-one in-depth interviews (n = 12), our findings unveil distinct nuances in how subordinates and supervisors perceive and engage with IM, encompassing aspects such as response strategies, interaction frequency, and interaction nature. Notably, a significant finding emerged concerning the practice of self-censorship in IM, acting as a strategy for impression management, predominantly adopted by subordinates in their interactions with supervisors. Additionally, our investigation sheds light on a contrasting viewpoint regarding the social use of IM. While supervisor participants acknowledged its potential to bolster work-related collaboration, this perspective appeared less pronounced among subordinate participants. Our study concludes by delving into the design implications for IM application design, offering insights that can shape collaborative dynamics within remote work environments.
