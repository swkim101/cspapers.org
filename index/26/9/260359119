Recent breakthroughs in atomically precise manufacturing are paving the way for Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) to become a real-world post-CMOS technology. This drives the need for efficient and scalable physical design automation methods. However, due to the problemâ€™s NP-completeness, existing solutions either generate designs of high quality, but are not scalable, or generate designs in negligible time but of poor quality. In an attempt to balance scalability and quality, we created and evaluated a hybrid approach that combines the best of established design methods and deep reinforcement learning. This paper summarizes the obtained results.
