As emerging digital assets, NFTs are susceptible to anomalous trading behaviors due to the lack of stringent regulatory mechanisms, potentially causing economic losses. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic analysis of four non-fungible tokens (NFT) markets. Specifically, we analyze more than 25 million transactions within these markets, to explore the evolution of wash trade activities. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm that integrates the network characteristics of transactions with behavioral analysis, to detect wash trading activities in NFT markets. Our findings indicate that NFT markets with incentivized structures exhibit higher proportions of wash trading volume compared to those without incentives. Notably, the LooksRare and X2Y2 markets are detected with wash trading volume proportions as high as 94.5% and 84.2%, respectively.
