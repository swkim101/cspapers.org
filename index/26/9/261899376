Recently, stochastic computing (SC) is increasingly popular in constructing MAC for on-edge DNNs benefiting from its outstanding energy-efficiency, including its adequate precision and gate-level operation. However, current SC-DNN systems always include a lot of costly SNGs/APCs for inevitably switches between binary and stochastic domains, which mortgages incongruous resources to pay the "bill" of the domain-switches and impedes highly-concurrent deployments. In this work, PseudoSC, a binary approximation to low-discrepancy SC, is proposed to totally remove the domain-switch for SNG/APC-free SC-DNNs. Its basic idea is to virtually re-arrange a couple of stochastic operands into a 2-D latent op-space, in which, original Monte Carlo sampling can be partitioned into three sub-ops, i.e., two fixed binary-ops and a fractal recursion. In theory, the recursion forms an isomorphic partition of the sampling repeated in smaller scales until the binary base-case achieved, as a result, a SC-op is well approximated only with binary-ops. Based on above theory, a multi-lane micro-architecture is designed to unroll the recursion within a few cycles and its advantages on hardware saving is verified under popular DNNs. The evaluation shows that the DNN-models with our schemes achieve 98.7% accuracy of the fixed-point implementations, which significantly outperform other SOTA methods. In addition, its reduced structure improves the power efficiency by 3.67 times on average.
