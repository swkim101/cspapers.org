CSP solvers usually search a partial assignment search tree. We present a new formalization for CSP solvers, which spans a conceptually different search tree, where each node represents subsets of the original domains for the variables. We experiment with a simple backtracking algorithm for this search tree and show that it outperforms a simple backtracking algorithm on the traditional search tree in many cases.
