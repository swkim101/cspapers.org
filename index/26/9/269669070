Drones connected via the web are increasingly being used for crowd anomaly detection (CAD). Existing solutions, however, face many challenges, such as low accuracy and high latency due to drones' dynamic shooting distances and angles as well as limited computing and networking capabilities. In this paper, we propose Air-CAD, an edge-assisted multi-drone network that uses air-ground cooperation to achieve fast and accurate CAD. Air-CAD consists of two stages: person detection and multi-feature analysis. To improve CAD accuracy, Air-CAD dynamically adjusts the inference of person detection model based on drones' shooting distances and assigns appropriate feature analysis tasks to drones shooting at variable angles. To achieve fast CAD, edge devices connected to drones are deployed to offload assigned feature analysis tasks from drones. Air-CAD schedules the connection between each drone and edge to accelerate processing based on drone's assigned task and the computing/network resources of the edge device. To validate the performance of Air-CAD, we generate a new simulated human stampede dataset captured from various drone-view recordings. We deploy and evaluate Air-CAD in both simulation and real-world testbed. Experimental results show that Air-CAD achieves 95.33% AUROC and real-time inference latency within 0.47 seconds.
