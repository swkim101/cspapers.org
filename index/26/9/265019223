Recent advances in vision-language learning have achieved notable success on complete-information question-answering datasets through the integration of extensive world knowledge. Yet, most models operate passively, responding to questions based on pre-stored knowledge. In stark contrast, humans possess the ability to actively explore, accumulate, and reason using both newfound and existing information to tackle incomplete-information questions. In response to this gap, we introduce $Conan$, an interactive open-world environment devised for the assessment of active reasoning. $Conan$ facilitates active exploration and promotes multi-round abductive inference, reminiscent of rich, open-world settings like Minecraft. Diverging from previous works that lean primarily on single-round deduction via instruction following, $Conan$ compels agents to actively interact with their surroundings, amalgamating new evidence with prior knowledge to elucidate events from incomplete observations. Our analysis on $Conan$ underscores the shortcomings of contemporary state-of-the-art models in active exploration and understanding complex scenarios. Additionally, we explore Abduction from Deduction, where agents harness Bayesian rules to recast the challenge of abduction as a deductive process. Through $Conan$, we aim to galvanize advancements in active reasoning and set the stage for the next generation of artificial intelligence agents adept at dynamically engaging in environments.
