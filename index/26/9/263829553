Generalizable implicit neural representation (INR) enables a single continuous function, i.e., a coordinate-based neural network, to represent multiple data instances by modulating its weights or intermediate features using latent codes. However, the expressive power of the state-of-the-art modulation is limited due to its inability to localize and capture fine-grained details of data entities such as specific pixels and rays. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for generalizable INR that combines a transformer encoder with a locality-aware INR decoder. The transformer encoder predicts a set of latent tokens from a data instance to encode local information into each latent token. The locality-aware INR decoder extracts a modulation vector by selectively aggregating the latent tokens via cross-attention for a coordinate input and then predicts the output by progressively decoding with coarse-to-fine modulation through multiple frequency bandwidths. The selective token aggregation and the multi-band feature modulation enable us to learn locality-aware representation in spatial and spectral aspects, respectively. Our framework significantly outperforms previous generalizable INRs and validates the usefulness of the locality-aware latents for downstream tasks such as image generation.
