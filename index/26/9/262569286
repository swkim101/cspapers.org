Developing a new working computer systcm can now cost hundreds of millions of dollars, atl expended at great risk. Company managers who must take twponsibility for m,aking development decisions arc loath 10 do so without being able to see and understand the systcm they will be “buying.” When Sunsoft launched the Starfire pro!ccl to develop a next-generation interface, we turned to wdeo prototyping, in the form of a short 35 mm film delivered in video. Not only were we thus able m show in malure form many key specifics of our new in(dacc design, bu[ we were able m communicate a strong sense of the resulting overall user experience. This paper dcscrilws observations and guidelines we developed during the early smgcs of the film, and what our expcricncxx were in applying them.
