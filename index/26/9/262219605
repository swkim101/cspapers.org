In approval-based committee (ABC) elections, the goal is to select a fixed-size subset of the candidates, a so-called committee, based on the voters' approval ballots over the candidates. One of the most popular classes of ABC voting rules are ABC scoring rules, for which voters give points to each committee and the committees with maximal total points are chosen. While the set of ABC scoring rules has recently been characterized in a model where the output is a ranking of all committees, no full characterization of these rules exists in the standard model where a set of winning committees is returned. We address this issue by characterizing two important subclasses of ABC scoring rules in the standard ABC election model, thereby both extending the result for ABC ranking rules to the standard setting and refining it to subclasses. In more detail, by relying on a consistency axiom for variable electorates, we characterize (i) the prominent class of Thiele rules and (ii) a new class of ABC voting rules called ballot size weighted approval voting. Based on these theorems, we also infer characterizations of three well-known ABC voting rules, namely multi-winner approval voting, proportional approval voting, and satisfaction approval voting.
