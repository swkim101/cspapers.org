Robotic adaptation to unanticipated operating conditions is crucial to achieving persistence and robustness in complex real world settings. For a wide range of cutting-edge robotic systems, such as micro- and nano-scale robots, soft robots, medical robots, and bio-hybrid robots, it is infeasible to anticipate the operating environment a priori due to complexities that arise from numerous factors including imprecision in manufacturing, chemo-mechanical forces, and poorly understood contact mechanics. Drawing inspiration from data-driven modeling, geometric mechanics (or gauge theory), and adaptive control, we employ an adaptive system identification framework and demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing the performance of principally kinematic locomotors (those governed by Rayleigh dissipation or zero momentum conservation). We showcase the capability of the adaptive model to efficiently accommodate varying terrains and iteratively modified behaviors within a behavior optimization framework. This provides both the ability to improve fundamental behaviors and perform motion tracking to precision. Notably, we are capable of optimizing the gaits of the Purcell swimmer using approximately 10 cycles per link, which for the nine-link Purcell swimmer provides a factor of ten improvement in optimization speed over the state of the art. Beyond simply a computational speed up, this tenfold improvement may enable this method to be successfully deployed for in-situ behavior refinement, injury recovery, and terrain adaptation, particularly in domains where simulations provide poor guides for the real world.
