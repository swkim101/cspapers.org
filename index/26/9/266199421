This work studies how force measurement/estimation biases affect the force-based cooperative manipulation of a beam-like load suspended with cables by two aerial robots. Indeed, force biases are especially relevant in a force-based manipulation scenario in which direct communication is not relied upon. First, we compute the equilibrium configurations of the system. Then, we show that inducing an internal force in the load augments the robustness of the load attitude error and its sensitivity to force-bias variations. Eventually, we propose a method for zeroing the load position error. The results are validated through numerical simulations and experiments.
