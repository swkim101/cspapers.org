Soft fluidic actuators are becoming popular for their backdrivability, potential for high power density, and their support for power supply through flexible tubes. Control and design of such actuators requires serviceable models that describe how they relate fluid pressure and flow to mechanical force and motion. We present a simple 2-port model of a bellows actuator that accounts for the relationships among fluid and mechanical variables imposed by the kinematics of the deforming bellows structure and accounts for elastic energy stored in the actuator's thermoplastic material structure. Elastic energy storage due to axial deformation is captured by revolving a differential strip whose linear elastic behavior is a nonlinear function of the actuator length. The model is evaluated through experiments in which either actuator length and pressure or force and pressure are imposed. The model has an error of 9.8% of the force range explored and yields insight into the effects of geometry changes. The resulting model can be used for model-based control or actuator design across the full operating range and can be exercised under either imposed force or imposed actuator length.
