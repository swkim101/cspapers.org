In anomaly segmentation for complex driving scenes, state-of-the-art approaches utilize anomaly scoring functions to calculate anomaly scores. For these functions, accurately predicting the logits of inlier classes for each pixel is crucial for precisely inferring the anomaly score. However, in real-world driving scenarios, the diversity of scenes often results in distorted manifolds of pixel embeddings in the space. This effect is not conducive to directly using the pixel embeddings for the logit prediction during inference, a concern overlooked by existing methods. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called Random Walk on Pixel Manifolds (RWPM). RWPM utilizes random walks to reveal the intrinsic relationships among pixels to refine the pixel embeddings. The refined pixel embeddings alleviate the distortion of manifolds, improving the accuracy of anomaly scores. Our extensive experiments show that RWPM consistently improve the performance of the existing anomaly segmentation methods and achieve the best results.
