In this paper, we prove the universal consistency of wide and deep ReLU neural network classifiers trained on the logistic loss. We also give sufficient conditions for a class of probability measures for which classifiers based on neural networks achieve minimax optimal rates of convergence. The result applies to a wide range of known function classes. In particular, while most previous works impose explicit smoothness assumptions on the regression function, our framework encompasses more general settings. The proposed neural networks are either the minimizers of the logistic loss or the $0$-$1$ loss. In the former case, they are interpolating classifiers that exhibit a benign overfitting behavior.
