This paper describes a new model-driven development framework, called Modeling Turnpike (or mTurnpike). It allows developers to model and program domain-specific concepts, and to gradually transform them to the final (compilable) source code. By leveraging UML metamodeling and attribute-oriented programming, mTurnpike provides an abstraction to represent domain-specific concepts at the modeling and programming layers simultaneously. This paper overviews the design, implementation and performance implications of mTurnpike.
