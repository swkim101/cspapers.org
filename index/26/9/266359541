Offline imitation learning (IL) refers to learning expert behavior solely from demonstrations, without any additional interaction with the environment. Despite significant advances in offline IL, existing techniques find it challenging to learn policies for long-horizon tasks and require significant re-training when task specifications change. Towards addressing these limitations, we present GO-DICE an offline IL technique for goal-conditioned long-horizon sequential tasks. GO-DICE discerns a hierarchy of sub-tasks from demonstrations and uses these to learn separate policies for sub-task transitions and action execution, respectively; this hierarchical policy learning facilitates long-horizon reasoning.Inspired by the expansive DICE-family of techniques, policy learning at both the levels transpires within the space of stationary distributions. Further, both policies are learnt with goal conditioning to minimize need for retraining when task goals change. Experimental results substantiate that GO-DICE outperforms recent baselines, as evidenced by a marked improvement in the completion rate of increasingly challenging pick-and-place Mujoco robotic tasks. GO-DICE is also capable of leveraging imperfect demonstration and partial task segmentation when available, both of which boost task performance relative to learning from expert demonstrations alone.
