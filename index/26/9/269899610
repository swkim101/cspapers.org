We present a template for the Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) which is NP-hard but does not satisfy the current state-of-the-art hardness condition [ACMTCT'21]. We introduce a new "injective" condition based on the smooth version of the layered PCP Theorem and use this new condition to confirm that the problem is indeed NP-hard. In the second part of the article, we establish a dichotomy for Boolean PCSPs defined by templates with polymorphisms in the set of linear threshold functions. The reasoning relies on the new injective condition.
