This paper presents predictive techniques that suggest a path to accelerated analysis and optimization of the yield of ultra-low power analog/mixed signal designs operating at cryogenic temperatures for use in future quantum computing applications. Analysis of 6Ïƒ variation is accelerated using mixture importance sampling (MixIS) techniques, with key studied specifications being compliance to spurious tone requirements at the quantum state controller output and optimization of design power consumption, both in the context of the high levels of modeling and matching uncertainties associated with cryogenic circuit design.
