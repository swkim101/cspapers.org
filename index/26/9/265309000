Most attention in K-12 artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) education has been given to having youths train models, with much less attention to the equally important testing of models when creating machine learning applications. Testing ML applications allows for the evaluation of models against predictions and can help creators of applications identify and address failure and edge cases that could negatively impact user experiences. We investigate how testing each other's projects supported youths to take perspective about functionality, performance, and potential issues in their own projects. We analyzed testing worksheets, audio and video recordings collected during a two week workshop in which 11 high school youths created physical computing projects that included (audio, pose, and image) ML classifiers. We found that through peer-testing youths reflected on the size of their training datasets, the diversity of their training data, the design of their classes and the contexts in which they produced training data. We discuss future directions for research on peer-testing in AI/ML education and current limitations for these kinds of activities.
