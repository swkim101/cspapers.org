Heavy quadrupedal drives have great potential for overcoming obstacles, showing great possibilities for transportation industries in complex environments. Ground reaction force (GRF) is a crucial state variable for quadrupedal control. Most GRF observations are implemented in lightweight quadrupeds, with little consideration of the loading being static or slippery on the body. However, the load information is vital to the heavy-duty quadruped applied in transportation tasks. In this paper, we disassembled the whole-body dynamics into the body dynamics combined with the individual floating single-leg dynamics and completed observing the virtual coupling effects between the body and legs. Based on the observed coupling force and centroidal dynamics (CD), the GRF of a stance leg is obtained without the awareness of body weight, movement, and load information. Furthermore, we utilized the body dynamics and the observed virtual force to obtain the body's unknown payload. By reconstructing the moment balance equation, we obtained the payload's position concerning the body coordinate. Compared to conventional quadrupedal GRF observation methods, this framework achieves higher observation accuracy in heavy quadrupeds without load and body information. Additionally, it enables real-time calculation of load magnitude and position.
