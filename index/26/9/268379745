Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) has shown impressive performance for histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis using bags or pseudo-bags. It involves instance sampling, feature representation, and decision-making. However, existing MIL-based technologies at least suffer from one or more of the following problems: 1) requiring high storage and intensive preprocessing for numerous instances (sampling); 2) potential over-fitting with limited knowledge to predict bag labels (feature representation); 3) pseudo-bag counts and prior biases affect model robustness and generalizability (decision-making). Inspired by clinical diagnostics, using the past sampling instances can facili-tate the final WSI analysis, but it is barely explored in prior technologies. To break free these limitations, we integrate the dynamic instance sampling and reinforcement learning into a unified framework to improve the instance selection and feature aggregation, forming a novel Dynamic Policy Instance Selection (DPIS) scheme for better and more cred-ible decision-making. Specifically, the measurement of feature distance and reward function are employed to boost continuous instance sampling. To alleviate the over-fitting, we explore the latent global relations among instances for more robust and discriminative feature representation while establishing reward and punishment mechanisms to correct biases in pseudo-bags using contrastive learning. These strategies form the final Dynamic Policy-Driven Adaptive Multi-Instance Learning (PAMIL) method for WSI tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that our PAMIL method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.8% on CAMELYON16 and 4.4% on TCGA lung cancer datasets.
