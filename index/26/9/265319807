At the very least, vessel detection is an important factor to consider in limiting vessel accidents at sea. Identification of marine vessels is yet another significant feature. Internationally, the standard for marine vessel detection and identification is the Automatic Identification System (AIS). As part of an attempt to develop a low-cost AIS, it is the aim of this paper to present a method of implementing its transmit and receive functions, especially the needed firmware. These basic functions allow the detection and identification of ships at sea. The proposed method makes use of a development board that allows the design and implementation of an AIS that costs modestly for small marine vessels.
