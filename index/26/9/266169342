Few-shot classification aims to learn a discriminative feature representation to recognize unseen classes with few labeled support samples. While most few-shot learning methods focus on exploiting the spatial information of image samples, frequency representation has also been proven essential in classification tasks. In this paper, we investigate the effect of different frequency components on the few-shot learning tasks. To enhance the performance and generalizability of few-shot methods, we propose a novel Frequency-Guided Few-shot Learning framework (dubbed FGFL), which leverages the task-specific frequency components to adaptively mask the corresponding image information, with a novel multi-level metric learning strategy including a triplet loss among original, masked and unmasked image as well as a contrastive loss between masked and original support and query sets to exploit more discriminative information. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks under several few-shot scenarios, i.e., standard, cross-dataset, cross-domain, and coarse-to-fine annotated classification, are conducted. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that our proposed FGFL scheme can attend to the class-discriminative frequency components, thus integrating those information towards more effective and generalizable few-shot learning.
