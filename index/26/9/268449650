The Latinx community is underrepresented in tech-oriented fields, which aligns with the lack of culturally relevant learning experiences in CS for Latinx youth, hindering their ability to conceptualize technology as a tool for transformation and vehicle for cultural expression. This study takes on a restorying approach at the elementary level, where 9 fourth-grade students engaged in focus group discussions over three days to generate prompts for a generative AI art. Through the lens of restorying, the prompts had students conceptualize a future with a focus on their Mexican-American heritage, local community, and technology. The study revealed that students associated their heritage with symbolic representations such as food and music, and characterized the community as a commercialized space while also emphasizing locations conducive to family-oriented activities. As a result, technology in community spaces was associated with consumerism. However, when envisioning a futuristic, transformed community, they made deeper connections between the role of technology in the community, making intricate connections between community improvements and technology-based solutions. This underscores the need for computing education to dedicate time for young learners to reflect on the role technology has on their current culture and community to make deeper connections.
