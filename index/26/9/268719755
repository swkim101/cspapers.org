A fundamental task in the realms of computer vision, Low-Rank Matrix Recovery (LRMR) focuses on the inherent low-rank structure precise recovery from incomplete data and/or corrupted measurements given that the rank is a known prior or accurately estimated. However, it remains challenging for existing rank estimation methods to accurately estimate the rank of an ill-conditioned matrix. Also, existing LRMR optimization methods are heavily dependent on the chosen parameters, and are therefore difficult to adapt to different situations. Addressing these issues, A novel LEarning-based low-rank matrix recovery with Rank Estimation (LERE) is proposed. More specifically, considering the characteristics of the Gerschgorin disk's center and radius, a new heuristic decision rule in the Gerschgorin Disk Theorem is significantly enhanced and the low-rank boundary can be exactly located, which leads to a marked improvement in the accuracy of rank estimation. According to the estimated rank, we select row and column sub-matrices from the observation matrix by uniformly random sampling. A 17-iteration feedforward-recurrent-mixed neural network is then adapted to learn the parameters in the sub-matrix recovery processing. Finally, by the correlation of the row sub-matrix and column sub-matrix, LERE successfully recovers the underlying low-rank matrix. Overall, LERE is more efficient and robust than existing LRMR methods. Experimental results demonstrate that LERE surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
