Recent prolific advances in artificial intelligence through the incorporation of domain knowledge have constituted a new paradigm for AI and data mining communities. For example, the human feedback-based language generation in ChatGPT (a large language model (LLM)), the use of Protein Bank in DeepMind's AlphaFold, and the use of 23 rules of safety in DeepMind's Sparrow have demonstrated the success of teaming human knowledge and AI. In addition, the knowledge retrieval-guided language modeling methods have strengthened the association between knowledge and AI. However, translating research methods and resources into practice presents a new challenge for the machine learning and data/knowledge mining communities. For example, in DARPA's Explainable AI seminar, the need for explainable contextual adaptation is seen as the 3rd phase of AI, facilitating the interplay between data and knowledge for explainability, safety, and, eventually, trust. However, policymakers and practitioners assert serious usability and privacy concerns that constrain adoption, notably in high-consequence domains, such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and other social good domains. In addition, limitations in output quality, measurement, and interactive ability, including both the provision of explanations and the acceptance of user preferences, result in low adoption rates in such domains. This workshop aims to accelerate our pace towards creating innovative methods for integrating knowledge into contemporary AI and data science methods and develop metrics for assessing performance in various applications.
