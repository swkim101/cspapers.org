In this paper, we present a next-best-view planning approach to autonomously size apple fruitlets. State-of-the-art viewpoint planners in agriculture are designed to size large and more sparsely populated fruit. They rely on lower resolution maps and sizing methods that do not generalize to smaller fruit sizes. To overcome these limitations, our method combines viewpoint sampling around semantically labeled regions of interest, along with an attention-guided information gain mechanism to more strategically select viewpoints that target the small fruitsâ€™ volume. Additionally, we integrate a dual-map representation of the environment that is able to both speed up expensive ray casting operations and maintain the high occupancy resolution required to informatively plan around the fruit. When sizing, a robust estimation and graph clustering approach is introduced to associate fruit detections across images. Through simulated experiments, we demonstrate that our viewpoint planner improves sizing accuracy compared to state of the art and ablations. We also provide quantitative results on data collected by a real robotic system in the field.
