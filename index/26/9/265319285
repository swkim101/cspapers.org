Focusing electromagnetic waves into or through a disordered media is a challenging yet vital problem to address. Due to the in-homogeneous nature of disorder media, the traveling wavefront of the electromagnetic wave is distorted. However, most of the existing studies require complex and expensive instruments. Therefore, this paper investigates a simulation framework based on finite-difference frequency-domain to verify some of these optimization schemes.
