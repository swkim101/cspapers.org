Creative design is a nonlinear process where designers generate diverse ideas in the pursuit of an open-ended goal and converge towards consensus through iterative remixing. In contrast, AI-powered design tools often employ a linear sequence of incremental and precise instructions to approximate design objectives. Such operations violate customary creative design practices and thus hinder AI agents’ ability to complete creative design tasks. To explore better human-AI co-design tools, we first summarize human designers’ practices through a formative study with 12 design experts. Taking graphic design as a representative scenario, we formulate a nonlinear human-AI co-design framework and develop a proof-of-concept prototype, OptiMuse. We evaluate OptiMuse and validate the nonlinear framework through a comparative study. We notice a subconscious change in people’s attitudes towards AI agents, shifting from perceiving them as mere executors to regarding them as opinionated colleagues. This shift effectively fostered the exploration and reflection processes of individual designers.
