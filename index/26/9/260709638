For the beginning student of computer science parallel computation appears to be intuitively a simple and natural extension of the classical Von Neumann model. The computational power gained from using more than one processor is “obvious”. C)nly by formal study of parallel computation and use of a parallel system does the power truly become apparent, as well as the problems of synchronization and communication. Discussions of parallel algorithms and parallel program design should be included in introductory courses. The opportunist y to construct and implement parallel algorithms must be a part of the laboratory assignments as well. These experiences will give valuable insight into the power and challenge of parallel computation.
