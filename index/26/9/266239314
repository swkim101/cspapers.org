Objective—To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a novel commercial formulation of ivermectin after administration to goats. Animals—6 healthy adult goats. Procedure—Ivermectin (200 μg/kg) was initially administered IV to each goat, and plasma samples were obtained for 36 days. After a washout period of 3 weeks, each goat received a novel commercial formulation of ivermectin (200 μg/kg) by SC injection. Plasma samples were then obtained for 42 days. Drug concentrations were quantified by use of high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Results—Pharmacokinetics of ivermectin after IV administration were best described by a 2-compartment open model; values for main compartmental variables included volume of distribution at a steady state (9.94 L/kg), clearance (1.54 L/kg/d), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC; 143 [ng•d]/mL). Values for the noncompartmental variables included mean residence time (7.37 days), AUC (153 [ng•d]/mL), and clearance (1.43 L/kg/d). After ...
