The assessment of student learning is essential, with instructors using end-of-course assessments against Course Objectives and Student Learning Objectives (SLOs), typically through assignments and exams against a predetermined benchmark. However, the reliance on outdated paper-based systems can delay crucial information access and lead to errors and inconsistencies in assessments. Therefore, a pilot study is underway to explore the benefits of transitioning from paper-based to electronic-based assessment systems. This shift aims to facilitate easier monitoring and more consistent tracking of course objectives, potentially enhancing the quality of courses and curriculum. All faculty-submitted assessment data is securely stored on a server, which supports the creation of an interactive data visualization tool. This tool is primarily designed to aid faculty in making informed decisions to better engage, motivate, and improve the learning experience for students. Moreover, the electronic system promises significant efficiency improvements by streamlining information retrieval and standardizing annual assessment processes.
