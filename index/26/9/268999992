A style of homework assignment is presented, called explorations. An exploration is part of an introductory programming course, specifically designed to help first-time programmers overcome common hurdles, such as misconceptions about the nature of computers and programs. An exploration is a structured lab where the student makes predictions about a program's behavior, then runs the program to compare the actual result with the predicted result. The questions are deliberately designed to challenge common errors and preconceived notions of computers and programming languages. Guided questions help the students refine their mental models of computers. Successful explorations have resulted in significant gains in comprehension, retention, and student satisfaction. Several guidelines are presented to help teachers write effective explorations.
