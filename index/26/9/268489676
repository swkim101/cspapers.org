There is greater demand for Computer Science (CS) to be taught in elementary education as more states pass policies requiring it. Integrating CS into elementary education provides a viable avenue to teach CS to all students and can result in more equitable outcomes. However, our research demonstrates many elementary educators have concerns about not having enough time, training, knowledge, curricula, resources, and/or support to teach or integrate CS in their general education classrooms. This session will bring together educators, curriculum developers, professional learning providers, researchers, and practitioners interested in fostering CS and computational thinking skills among young learners. Topics will include how CS is currently being taught or integrated into elementary education, reasons why teachers are or are not integrating CS, resources and supports to address barriers to teaching CS, and what is needed to increase the integration of CS in elementary education on larger scales. Attendees will have the opportunity to share their experiences, challenges, successes, and learnings related to teaching and/or integrating CS in elementary education toward the goals of learning from diverse perspectives and building collaborations to enhance their work. The discussion will delve into the importance of and barriers to early CS education, identify best practices and inclusive resources to make it accessible and engaging, and facilitate connections to others with similar interests to build a supportive CS learning community. This session will provide a comprehensive exploration of various perspectives in CS education.
