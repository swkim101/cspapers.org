Numerical reasoning is an essential task for supporting machine learning applications, such as recommendation and information retrieval. The reasoning task aims to compare two items and infer new facts (e.g., is taller than) by leveraging existing relational information and numerical attributes (e.g., the height of an entity) in knowledge graphs. However, most existing methods rely on leveraging attribute encoders or additional loss functions to predict numerical relations. Therefore, the prediction performance is often not robust in cases when attributes are sparsely observed. In this paper, we propose a Relation-AAware attribute representation learning-based Knowledge Graph Embedding method for numerical reasoning tasks, which we call RAKGE. RAKGE incorporates a newly proposed attribute representation learning mechanism, which can leverage the association between relations and their corresponding numerical attributes. In addition, we introduce a robust self-supervised learning method to generate unseen positive and negative examples, thereby making our approach more reliable when numerical attributes are sparsely available. In the evaluation of three real-world datasets, our proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of up to 65.1% in Hits@1 and up to 52.6% in MRR compared to the best competitor.
