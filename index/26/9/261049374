We prove a new generalization of the higher-order Cheeger inequality for partitioning with buffers. Consider a graph $G=(V,E)$. The buffered expansion of a set $S \subseteq V$ with a buffer $B \subseteq V \setminus S$ is the edge expansion of $S$ after removing all the edges from set $S$ to its buffer $B$. An $\varepsilon$-buffered $k$-partitioning is a partitioning of a graph into disjoint components $P_i$ and buffers $B_i$, in which the size of buffer $B_i$ for $P_i$ is small relative to the size of $P_i$: $|B_i| \le \varepsilon |P_i|$. The buffered expansion of a buffered partition is the maximum of buffered expansions of the $k$ sets $P_i$ with buffers $B_i$. Let $h^{k,\varepsilon}_G$ be the buffered expansion of the optimal $\varepsilon$-buffered $k$-partitioning, then for every $\delta>0$, $$h_G^{k,\varepsilon} \le O_\delta(1) \cdot \Big( \frac{\log k}{ \varepsilon}\Big) \cdot \lambda_{\lfloor (1+\delta) k\rfloor},$$ where $\lambda_{\lfloor (1+\delta)k\rfloor}$ is the $\lfloor (1+\delta)k\rfloor$-th smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian of $G$. Our inequality is constructive and avoids the ``square-root loss'' that is present in the standard Cheeger inequalities (even for $k=2$). We also provide a complementary lower bound, and a novel generalization to the setting with arbitrary vertex weights and edge costs. Moreover our result implies and generalizes the standard higher-order Cheeger inequalities and another recent Cheeger-type inequality by Kwok, Lau, and Lee (2017) involving robust vertex expansion.
