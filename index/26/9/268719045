We present an imagification approach for multivariate time-series data tailored to constrained NN-based forecasting model training environments. Our imagification process consists of two key steps: Re-stacking and time embedding. In the Re-stacking stage, time-series data are arranged based on high correlation, forming the first image channel using a sliding window technique. The time embedding stage adds two additional image channels by incorporating real-time information. We evaluate our method by comparing it with three benchmark imagification techniques using a simple CNN-based model. Additionally, we conduct a comparison with LSTM, a conventional time-series forecasting model. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves three times faster model training termination while maintaining forecasting accuracy.
