This paper presents a feedback-control framework for in-hand manipulation (IHM) with dexterous soft hands that enables the acquisition of manipulation skills in the real-world within minutes. We choose the deformation state of the soft hand as the control variable. To control for a desired deformation state, we use coarsley approximated Jacobians of the actuation-deformation dynamics. These Jacobian are obtained via explorative actions. This is enabled by the self-stabilizing properties of compliant hands, which allow us to use linear feedback control in the presence of complex contact dynamics. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we show the generalization capabilities for a learned manipulation skill to variations in object size by 100 %, 360 degree changes in palm inclination and to disabling up to 50 % of the involved actuators. In addition, complex manipulations can be obtained by sequencing such feedback-skills.
