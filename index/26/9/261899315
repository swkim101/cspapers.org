In this paper, we propose a new space-efficient key-value store called ZoneKV for ZNS (Zoned Namespace) SSDs. We observe that existing work on adapting RocksDB to ZNS SSDs will cause fragmentation of zones and severe space amplification. Thus, we propose a lifetime-based zone storage model and a level-specific zone allocation algorithm to store SSTables with a similar lifetime in the same zone. We evaluate ZoneKV on a real ZNS SSD. The results show that ZoneKV can reduce up to 60% space amplification and maintain higher throughputs than two competitors, RocksDB and ZenFS.
