Modern version control tools and workflow practices are required skills for nearly all production software development, making them essential for students and in high demand among employers. Since these tools and processes were created for distributed, asynchronous collaboration on large scale projects, teaching them in an authentic context that makes clear their utility and design presents myriad challenges for both faculty and students. The GitKit is a snapshot of the FarmData2 Humanitarian Free and Open Source (HFOSS) project's artifacts (code, issues, documentation, etc.) frozen at a particular point in time and packaged with learning activities, an instructor guide, and a choice of containerized development environments. The GitKit thus provides students with the authentic context of a real-world project in which to learn and practice key Git and GitHub skills and workflows, while mitigating many of the challenges of doing so in an educational setting. The GitKit, including its learning activities and development environments are described in sufficient detail to encourage instructor adoption and feedback. A pilot study of student experiences with the GitKit is promising, suggesting that students gained an understanding of FOSS concepts and key skills, noticed automated guidance and feedback built into the development environment, and found it helpful in their learning. Future plans for the GitKit based on these surveys and instructor experiences with pilot uses are described along with plans for the development of HFOSS Kits for teaching and learning of other software development and aligned skills in authentic contexts.
