This paper proposes to correct the rolling shutter (RS) distorted images by estimating the distortion flow from the global shutter (GS) to RS directly. Existing methods usually perform correction using the undistortion flow from the RS to GS. They initially predict the flow from consecutive RS frames, subsequently rescaling it as the displacement fields from the RS frame to the underlying GS image using time-dependent scaling factors. Following this, RS-aware forward warping is employed to convert the RS image into its GS counterpart. Nevertheless, this strategy is prone to two shortcomings. First, the undistortion flow estimation is rendered inaccurate by merely linear scaling the flow, due to the complex non-linear motion nature. Second, RS-aware forward warping often results in unavoidable artifacts. To address these limitations, we introduce a new framework that directly estimates the distortion flow and rectifies the RS image with the backward warping operation. More specifically, we first propose a global correlation-based flow attention mechanism to estimate the initial distortion flow and GS feature jointly, which are then refined by the following coarse-to-fine decoder layers. Additionally, a multi-distortion flow prediction strategy is integrated to mitigate the issue of inaccurate flow estimation further. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency.
