We investigate the timestamp allocation scheme in classical concurrency controls of the database management systems (DBMS) on many-core machines. Then we discuss a distributed logical timestamp allocation scheme with uniqueness and fairness to improve the performance of DBMS concurrency control algorithms on many-core machines. Further, the proposed logical timestamp generator is free of bottlenecks such as accessing the system clock counter, calling for atomic add operation, and synchronization. Finally, we experiment with an optimistic concurrency control algorithm based on the proposed and other allocation schemes. The results show that the performance of an optimistic concurrency control algorithm based on the proposed timestamp allocation outperforms one based on other allocations. Furthermore, it has better linear scalability under heavy loads.
