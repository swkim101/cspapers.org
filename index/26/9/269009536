To enhance the dining experience, prior studies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and gastrophysics have demonstrated that modifying the static shape of solid foods can amplify taste perception. However, the exploration of dynamic shape-changing mechanisms in liquid foods remains largely untapped. In the present study, we employ cymatics, a scientific discipline focused on utilizing sound frequencies to generate patterns in liquids and particlesâ€”to augment the drinking experience. Utilizing speakers, we dynamically reshaped liquids exhibiting five distinct taste profiles and evaluated resultant changes in taste perception and drinking experience. Our research objectives extend beyond merely augmenting taste from visual to tactile sensations; we also prioritize the experiential aspects of drinking. Through a series of experiments and workshops, we revealed a significant impact on taste perception and overall drinking experience when mediated by cymatics effects. Building upon these findings, we designed and developed tableware to integrate cymatics principles into gastronomic experiences.
