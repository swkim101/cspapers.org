Exercise recommendation is a fundamental and important task in the E-learning system, facilitating students' personalized learning. Most existing exercise recommendation algorithms design a scoring criterion (e.g., weakest mastery, lowest historical correctness) in conjunction with experience, and then recommend the recommended knowledge concepts (KCs). These algorithms rely entirely on the scoring criteria by treating exercise recommendations as a centralized system. However, it is a complex problem for the centralized system to choose a limited number of exercises in a period of time to consolidate and learn the KCs efficiently. Moreover, different groups of students (e.g., different countries, schools, or classes) have different solutions for the same group of KCs according to their own situations, in the spirit of competency-based instructing. Therefore, we propose Meta Multi-Agent Exercise Recommendation (MMER). Specifically, we design the multi-agent exercise recommendation module, in which the KCs involved in exercises are considered agents with competition and cooperation among them. And the meta-training stage is designed to learn a robust recommendation module for new student groups. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the satisfactory performance of the proposed model. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the multi-agent and meta-training part is demonstrated for the model in recommendation applications.
