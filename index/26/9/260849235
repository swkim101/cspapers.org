Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gradually attracted attention in the field of artistic creation, resulting in a debate on the evaluation of AI artistic outputs. However, there is a lack of common criteria for objective artistic evaluation both of human and AI creations. This is a frequent issue in the field of dance, where different performance metrics focus either on evaluating human or computational skills separately. This work proposes a methodological approach for the artistic evaluation of both AI and human artistic creations in the field of robotic dance. First, we define a series of common initial constraints to create robotic dance choreographies in a balanced initial setting, in collaboration with a group of human dancers and choreographer. Then, we compare both creation processes through a human audience evaluation. Finally, we investigate which choreography aspects (e.g., the music genre) have the largest impact on the evaluation, and we provide useful guidelines and future research directions for the analysis of interconnections between AI and human dance creation.
