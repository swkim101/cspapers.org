This study presents a bistable tensegrity robot that can perform repetitive jumps using one motor. This robot is based on a tensegrity structure that uses rigid plate-shaped compressors. To achieve bistability in this structure, we optimized the position of additional springs using a physics simulator that considers geometric constraints attributed to the collision between compression materials. A prototype was constructed based on the simulation model. To achieve jumping repeatability, we used one motor to control three tendons, each used; to control the additional spring strain, trigger the snap-through motion, and reform the structure to its original form. The prototype could jump using snap-through motion and reform back to its original form based on motor rotation. Furthermore, the robot demonstrated its ability to jump over flights of stairs by attaching a stand with a slight angle and using jumping repeatability.
