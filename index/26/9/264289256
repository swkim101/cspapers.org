The heterogeneous information network (HIN), which contains rich semantics depicted by meta-paths, has emerged as a potent tool for mitigating data sparsity in recommender systems. Existing HIN-based recommender systems operate under the assumption of centralized storage and model training. However, real-world data is often distributed due to privacy concerns, leading to the semantic broken issue within HINs and consequent failures in centralized HIN-based recommendations. In this paper, we suggest the HIN is partitioned into private HINs stored on the client side and shared HINs on the server. Following this setting, we propose a federated heterogeneous graph neural network (FedHGNN) based framework, which facilitates collaborative training of a recommendation model using distributed HINs while protecting user privacy. Specifically, we first formalize the privacy definition for HIN-based federated recommendation (FedRec) in the light of differential privacy, with the goal of protecting user-item interactions within private HIN as well as users' high-order patterns from shared HINs. To recover the broken meta-path based semantics and ensure proposed privacy measures, we elaborately design a semantic-preserving user interactions publishing method, which locally perturbs user's high-order patterns and related user-item interactions for publishing. Subsequently, we introduce an HGNN model for recommendation, which conducts node- and semantic-level aggregations to capture recovered semantics. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods by a substantial margin (up to 34% in HR@10 and 42% in NDCG@10) under a reasonable privacy budget (e.g., Îµ=1).
