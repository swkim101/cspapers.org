Due to the universality of graph data, node classification shows its great importance in a wide range of real-world applications. Despite the successes of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), GNN based methods rely heavily on rich connections and perform poorly on low-degree nodes. Since many real-world graphs follow a long-tailed distribution in node degrees, they suffer from a substantial performance bottleneck as a significant fraction of nodes is of low degree. In this paper, we point out that under-represented self-representations and low neighborhood homophily ratio of low-degree nodes are two main culprits. Based on that, we propose a novel method Grace which improves the node representation by self-distillation, and increases neighborhood homophily ratio of low-degree nodes by graph completion. To avoid error propagation of graph completion, label propagation is further leveraged. Experimental evidence has shown that our method well supports real-world graphs, and is superior in balancing degree-related bias and overall performance on node classification tasks.
