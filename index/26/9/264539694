This paper presents a new MEMS varactor that uses repulsive actuation to achieve an ultra-linear capacitance-to-voltage response. The approach proposed involves actuating the moveable electrode away from the fixed electrode, instead of the conventional closing-the-gap direction. This increasing-gap movement reduces the capacitance as the actuation voltage increases. The MEMS variable capacitor is fabricated using PolyMUMPs technology and exhibits an excellent linearity factor of 99.7% in capacitance-to-voltage response, and a capacitance tuning ratio of 11Ã— was achieved. The proposed strategy will enable the development of high-performance MEMS-based tunable devices for various applications.
