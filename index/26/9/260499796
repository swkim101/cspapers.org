Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare applications. However, the reproducibility of many studies in this field is limited by the lack of accessible code implementations and standard benchmarks. To address the issue, we create PyHealth, a comprehensive library to build, deploy, and validate DL pipelines for healthcare applications. PyHealth supports various data modalities, including electronic health records (EHRs), physiological signals, medical images, and clinical text. It offers various advanced DL models and maintains comprehensive medical knowledge systems. The library is designed to support both DL researchers and clinical data scientists. Upon the time of writing, PyHealth has received 633 stars, 130 forks, and 15k+ downloads in total on GitHub. This tutorial will provide an overview of PyHealth, present different modules, and showcase their functionality through hands-on demos. Participants can follow along and gain hands-on experience on the Google Colab platform during the session.
