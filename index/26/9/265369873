 3D-printing or additive manufacturing (AM) can be a size-constrained and time-consuming manufacturing method compared to those traditionally used. Printing larger structures as a net could be a possible solution to this limitation. The intent behind this work is to establish a methodology for creating 3D structures with discretized planner segments using smaller printer envelopes. Nets of solids are capable of folding into an enclosed body from coplanar shapes. Nets can be utilized to create larger objects not otherwise possible due to space limitations in manufacturing methods. Chain nets are particularly useful for AM, which can avoid collision between the segmented part net and printer topology. To prevent interference with the printer, the shape must be unfolded in a chain net. Unfolding algorithms of this type can be simplified to a Hamiltonian pathfinding problem. This method can be particularly useful when used in conjunction with printing on a flexible substrate, i.e., fabric. Larger solids can be created by printing each side separately and using the fabric as a joint between the faces. When the sides of the solids are printed, the print bed no longer limits the size of solids that can be manufactured. This would also allow collaborative printing with multiple printer platforms to print different faces of the net simultaneously.
