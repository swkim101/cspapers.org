High-performance computing communities are increasingly adopting Neural Networks (NN) as surrogate models in their applications to generate scientific insights. Replacing an execution phase in the application with NN models can bring significant performance improvement. However, there is a lack of tools that can help domain scientists automatically apply NN-based surrogate models to HPC applications. We introduce a framework, named AutoHPC-net, to democratize the usage of NN-based surrogates. AutoHPC-net is the first end-to-end framework that makes past proposals for the NN-based surrogate model practical and disciplined. AutoHPC-net introduces a workflow to address unique challenges when applying the approximation, such as feature acquisition and meeting the application-specific constraint on the quality of final computation outcome. We show that AutoHPC-net can leverage NN for a set of HPC applications and achieve 5.50× speedup on average (up to 16.8× speedup and with data preparation cost included) while meeting the application-specific constraint on the final computation quality.
