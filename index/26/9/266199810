In this work, we consider a team of heterogeneous robots equipped with various types and quantities of resources, and tasked with supplying these resources to multiple dynamic demand locations. We present an adaptive control policy that enables robots to serve a dynamic demand: we allow demand to deplete as robots supply resources, and we allow demand injection and movement of demand locations. We show that the demand is input-to-state stable (ISS) under our proposed resource dynamics, and thus the robots can drive the demand to a steady state. Finally, we present simulations and hardware experiments to demonstrate our approach, and demonstrate the benefits of coverage over a persistent monitoring approach.
