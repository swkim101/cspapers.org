Timing closure is crucial across the circuit design flow. Since obtaining sign-off performance needs a time-consuming routing flow, all the previous early-stage timing optimization works only focus on improving early timing metrics, e.g., rough timing estimation using linear RC model or pre-routing path-length. However, there is no consistency guarantee between early-stage metrics and sign-off timing performance. To enable explicit early-stage optimization on the sign-off timing metrics, we propose a novel timing optimization framework, TSteiner. This paper demonstrates the ability of the learning framework to perform robust and efficient timing optimization in the early stage with comprehensive and convincing experimental results on real-world designs.
