Welcome to the Third ACM International Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental Evaluation and CHaracterization (WiNTECH'08), held in conjunction with ACM MobiCom 2008 in San Francisco, California. Three years ago, WiNTECH was created to promote experimental evaluation of wireless network protocols/applications using realistic testbeds and characterization using traces from operational wireless networks of which the importance has been increasingly recognized by the research community. Following the success of WiNTECH'06 and WiNTECH'07, also held in conjunction with MobiCom, WiNTECH'08 continues as a forum focusing on research issues concerning the experimental wireless network community. 
 
WiNTECH'08 received 22 regular paper submissions from around the world. Members of the Technical Program Committee reviewed the submissions rigorously, with the help of a few external reviewers. Each paper had three reviews on average. Twelve regular were accepted for publication. The accepted papers cover a wide range of topics from tools and methodologies to metro-area testbeds. In addition, we are holding a contest for technical demonstrations, which will have at least ten participants. Cash prizes for the demo contest are being sponsored by Nokia Siemens Networks, BBN Technologies and ViaSat. We hope that the demo contest will spark more creative uses of testbeds and also serve as a conduit for increased awareness in the research and development community of new innovations. Finally, we are very pleased that the workshop will feature a keynote speech by Professor Nitin Vaidya. The talk is titled "Can theory meet practice? The case of multi-channel wireless networks."
