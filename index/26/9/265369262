 This paper presents a novel methodology for control co-design (CCD) with approximate explicit model predictive controllers. This paper also investigates how approximation errors impact the decision-making for design of dynamic systems. The explicit nonlinear control policies are approximated and represented as surrogate models by a function of states and plant parameters, which allows for offline solving control problems and reducing the computational time required for CCD optimization. Set invariance theory and Lyapunov stability theory are employed to ensure the stability of designed systems. To facilitate design exploration, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to trade-off between performance and probability of state-constraint satisfaction. A probability assessment for system stability with the sampled initial states and multiple pre-computed controllers is included in the optimization constraints. The approach is benchmarked using a numerical example and an engineering case study of a satellite attitude control system. Some of the non-dominated designs are selected to visualize their state and control trajectories for comparison. The visualization shows the successful implementation of explicit model predictive controllers in CCD problems while ensuring stability. The results of this study highlight the importance of including plant design and performing CCD to achieve system-optimal solutions and better understand dynamic characteristics.
