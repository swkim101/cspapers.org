Continuous media applications, which require a guaranteed transfer rate of the data, are becoming an integral part of daily computational life. However, conventional file systems do not provide rate guarantees, and are therefore not suitable for the storage and retrieval of continuous media data (e.g., audio, video). To meet the demands of these new applications, continuous media file systems, which provide rate guarantees by managing critical storage resources such as memory and disks, must be designed.
In this paper, we highlight the issues in the storage and retrieval of continuous media data. We first present a simple scheme for concurrently retrieving multiple continuous media streams from disks. We then introduce a a clever allocation technique for storing continuous media data that eliminates disk latency and thus, drastically reduces RAM requirements. We present, for video data, schemes for implementing the operations fast-forward, rewind and pause. Finally, we conclude by outlining directions for future research in the storage and retrieval of continuous media data.
