Modern data generation has grown to enormous proportions, with events occurring at increasingly higher rates. Yet for graph analytics, this growth in scale and velocity has not been matched by improved algorithm or infrastructure techniques: most systems still focus on post-mortem or static analysis. This paper builds on an efficient graph processing abstraction that enables online analysis of dynamically evolving graphs at scale. Integral to this abstraction is that events tied to both graph topology changes as well as algorithmic maintenance occur and are processed asynchronously, concurrently, and autonomously (i.e., without shared state). We offer a case study for online analytics of an evolving graph and make two key contributions: on the one side, we develop an online solution for PageRank. This solution tracks vertices' PageRank scores as a graph evolves over time, and quickly converges identically to the result offered by the well-known power iteration method when requested by the user. On the other side, we show that fine-grained temporal analysis of evolving PageRank scores in real-time is feasible. Our approach offers generic applicability, as it:(i) works for directed or undirected graphs, on generic or personalized PageRank,(ii) handles sink vertices correctly,(iii) handles topology changes and complex temporal sliding-window graphs, and(iv) scales to billion edge graphs even on commodity hardware.
