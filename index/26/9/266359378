Video Correlation Learning (VCL), which aims to analyze the relationships between videos, has been widely studied and applied in various general video tasks. However, applying VCL to instructional videos is still quite challenging due to their intrinsic procedural temporal structure. Specifically, procedural knowledge is critical for accurate correlation analyses on instructional videos. Nevertheless, current procedure-learning methods heavily rely on step-level annotations, which are costly and not scalable. To address this problem, we introduce a weakly supervised framework called Collaborative Procedure Alignment (CPA) for procedure-aware correlation learning on instructional videos. Our framework comprises two core modules: collaborative step mining and frame-to-step alignment. The collaborative step mining module enables simultaneous and consistent step segmentation for paired videos, leveraging the semantic and temporal similarity between frames. Based on the identified steps, the frame-to-step alignment module performs alignment between the frames and steps across videos. The alignment result serves as a measurement of the correlation distance between two videos. We instantiate our framework in two distinct instructional video tasks: sequence verification and action quality assessment. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in providing accurate and interpretable correlation analyses for instructional videos.
