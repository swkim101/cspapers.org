Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at transition metal/oxide interfaces plays a significant role in technological applications such as magnetic storage and spintronics. In this study, we investigate the effects of thermal annealing and Pt ultrathin interlayers on the magnetic anisotropy in Ni/NiO multilayers. Ni/NiO/Pt multilayers were fabricated via radiofrequency magnetron sputtering and natural oxidation. The static magnetic properties of the samples were studied using temperature-dependent SQUID magnetometry. We focus on a sample with a Nickel thickness of 6.7 nm in each multilayer period. This multilayer in Ni/NiO form showed the maximum enhancement of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy after mild thermal annealing in past work. In this work, we study the effects of ultrathin Pt interlayers on the magnetic properties of such a Ni/NiO multilayer before and after annealing. We have observed a further increase in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and we study the temperature-dependent magnetic properties of this system, which combines the favorable magnetic properties of Ni/Pt and Ni/NiO multilayers.
