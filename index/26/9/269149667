Precise ego-motion measurement is crucial for various applications, including robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. In this poster, we propose mmPhase, an odometry framework based on single-chip millimetre-wave (mmWave) radar for robust ego-motion estimation in mobile platforms without requiring additional modalities like the visual, wheel, or inertial odometry. mmPhase leverages a phase-based velocity estimation approach to overcome the limitations of conventional doppler resolution. For real-world evaluations of mmPhase we have developed an ego-vehicle prototype. Compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, mmPhase shows superior performance in ego-velocity estimation.
