The 5G Radio Unit (RU) is the most critical device in the 5G network. The growing demand for 5G connections makes it a challenge for manufacturers to keep the highest stability of RU because RU devices are placed on the top of the base station and operated in changeable weather. We classify RU operations into two types: boot process and runtime process. In this paper, we focus on the boot process and propose a method to detect errors in boot time and change from the current Operation System (OS) to Alternative Operating System in case of boot failures. The method is designed, implemented, and tested on the Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+. The outstanding advantage of this method is that the boot process is totally monitored by internal Central Processing Units (CPUs) in the Xilinx SoC without using any external supervisors or peripherals. It increases SoC independence and saves money. Furthermore, the proposed method also mentions the Rescue Boot Mechanism, which is the next stage after detecting boot errors. We place Primary OS in NOR Flash and Alternative OS in NAND Flash. By default, the Xilinx SoC will use NOR Flash as the preferred boot device.
