This work presents a dataset of human-operated robot motion to be used within the context of assistive robotics and assorted fields, such as learning from demonstrations, machine-learning based robot control, and activity recognition. The data consists of individual sequences of intentional robot motion performing a task in an environment of daily living. There are 2973 sequences generated in a high-resolution simulation and 986 sequences performed in reality, totaling to 1.16 M datapoints. The data includes labels for the robot's pose, motion and activity. This paper also provides data augmentation methods and a detailed dataset analysis as well as simple models trained on the dataset as a baseline for future research.
