This paper presents INTELMO, an easy-to-use toolkit to help model developers adopt user-faced interactive interfaces for their language models. The toolkit provides default style patterns over interaction-based categorization, ensuring that developers can build fully interactive interfaces with minimal and intuitive additional code. Moreover, INTELMO employs a multi-granular hierarchical abstraction to provide developers with flexible control over the generation process. INTELMO is under active development, with document available at https://intelmo.github.io/
