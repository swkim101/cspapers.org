 The design of floating offshore wind turbines requires a rigorous method for handling the complex multi-systems and multi-physics interactions involved. The traditional method optimizes subsystems of different disciplines sequentially and independently and the control is always implemented at the last step. This neglects the coupling between sub-systems and may miss the global optimum. Control co-design could formulate the plant and control in a single formula for reaching the global optimum. The floating offshore wind turbine is a complex system with the interaction of aerodynamics, structural, hydrodynamics, and control, which causes the difficulty of co-design problem formulation. In this study, a framework for the co-design of platform hydrodynamics and structural control is established using the coupled time-domain simulation. A case study is conducted with the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine and the NAUTILUS-10 semi-submersible platform for demonstration. The platform shapes and tuned mass dampers are co-optimized by establishing and solving a formula with eight design variables under the constraints of power generation and platform stability. An efficient Kriging model-enhanced genetic algorithm solves problems for minimizing platform mass. Compared with the baseline model, the platform mass is reduced with the lowered platform motion, which increased the annual energy production by 2.96%. The time history analysis on rated condition suggests lowered blade tip deflection and rotor thrust. This demonstrates the improvement made by the co-design method under limited numbers of constraints and loading conditions.
