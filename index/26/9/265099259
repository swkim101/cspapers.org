We present fully polynomial approximation schemes for concurrent multicommodity flow problems that run in time independent of the number of commodities k. We show that by modifying the algorithms by Garg & Köönemann [5] and Fleischer [3] we can reduce their running time to a logarithmic dependence on k, and essentially match the running time of [3] for the maximum multicommodity flow problem.
