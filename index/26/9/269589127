With the widespread development of database systems, data security has become crucial when it comes to sharing among users and servers. A straightforward approach involves using searchable encryption to ensure the confidentiality of shared data. However, in certain scenarios, varying user tiers are granted disparate data searching privileges, and administrators need to restrict the searcha-bility of ciphertexts to select users exclusively. To address this issue, public key encryption with authorized keyword search (PEAKS) was proposed, wherein solely authorized users possess the ability to conduct targeted keyword searches. Nonetheless, it is vulnerable to resist quantum computing attacks. As a result, research focusing on authorizing users to search for keywords while achieving quantum security is far-reaching. In this paper, we propose a lattice-based variant of PEAKS (L-PEAKS) that enables keyword dataset authorization for outsourced data management. Unlike existing schemes, our design incorporates identity-based encryption (IBE) to overcome the bottleneck of public key management. Besides, we utilize several lattice sampling algorithms to defend against attacks from quantum adversaries. Specifically, each authorized user must obtain a search privilege from an authority. The authority distributes an authorized token to the user within a specific time period, and the user generates a trapdoor for any authorized keywords. Our scheme is proven to be secure against IND-sID-CKA and T-EUF security in a quantum setting. We also conduct comprehensive evaluations on a commodity machine to assess completeness and provide theoretical complexity comparisons with existing state-of-the-art schemes.
