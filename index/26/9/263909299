The multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem seeks collision-free paths for a team of agents from their current positions to their pre-set goals in a known environment, and is an essential problem found at the core of many logistics, transportation, and general robotics applications. Existing learning-based MAPF approaches typically only let each agent make decisions based on a limited field-of-view (FOV) around its position, as a natural means to fix the input dimensions of its policy network. However, this often makes policies shortsighted, since agents lack the ability to perceive and plan for obstacles/agents beyond their FOV. To address this challenge, we propose ALPHA, a new framework combining the use of ground truth proximal (local) information and fuzzy distal (global) information to let agents sequence local decisions based on the full current state of the system, and avoid such myopicity. We further allow agents to make short-term predictions about each others’ paths, as a means to reason about each others’ path intentions, thereby enhancing the level of cooperation among agents at the whole system level. Our neural structure relies on a Graph Transformer architecture to allow agents to selectively combine these different sources of information and reason about their inter-dependencies at different spatial scales. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that ALPHA outperforms both globally-guided MAPF solvers and communication-learning based ones, showcasing its potential towards scalability in realistic deployments.
