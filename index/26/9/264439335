We show that LLMs hallucinate because their output is not constrained to be synonymous with claims for which they have evidence: a condition that we call evidential closure. Information about the truth or falsity of sentences is not statistically identified in the standard neural probabilistic language model setup, and so cannot be conditioned on to generate new strings. We then show how to constrain LLMs to produce output that does satisfy evidential closure. A multimodal LLM must learn about the external world (perceptual learning); it must learn a mapping from strings to states of the world (extensional learning); and, to achieve fluency when generalizing beyond a body of evidence, it must learn mappings from strings to their synonyms (intensional learning). The output of a unimodal LLM must be synonymous with strings in a validated evidence set. Finally, we present a heuristic procedure, Learn-Babble-Prune, that yields faithful output from an LLM by rejecting output that is not synonymous with claims for which the LLM has evidence.
