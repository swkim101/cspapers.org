Neoliberal capitalism - the favoring of privatization, marketization, and deregulation of public resources - is hegemonic in education. It shapes our institutions and everyday life, including educational practices. The increasing push for market driven computing curriculum and large tech companies' involvement in research grants and educational programs are some examples of neoliberal influences in CS education. It is not only industry and industry-backed not-for-profits such as Code.org that reify neoliberal agendas, but in many cases, our very own communities, educational institutions, and curricula. Thus, a critical and reflective examination of our educational practices is necessary. In this Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session, we aim to conduct reflections and discussions on the role and influence of neoliberal capitalism in computing education. We will explore 1) the influence of deregulation, 2) public-private partnerships, 3) state-subsidized corporate wealth accumulation, and 4) centralization on pedagogy, research, and academic "success". We will discover reflective questions and practices that could help us critically examine our roles and responsibilities as computing educators and professionals. Eventually, we hope to begin a larger conversation and form a community to develop collective strategies and pedagogical ideologies to resist neoliberal influences, reimagine alternatives, and repair damages caused by neoliberal computing education.
