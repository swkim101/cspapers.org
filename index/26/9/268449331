As our community seeks to make Computer Science education more accessible amidst a global mental health crisis and with many students living with chronic illnesses and other medical conditions, it becomes more and more urgent to address student health concerns in CS classes and in the spaces that we create. Despite the important and long overdue increase in the number of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives in CS, these efforts run the risk of overlooking the needs of students living with ongoing mental health and medical conditions, who are underrepresented and marginalized in our field. This session seeks to explore ways in which current DEIA efforts in CS in higher education can be expanded to be more inclusive of students living with mental health and medical conditions. We seek to create a space for a constructive and open conversation in which we will discuss how current outreach efforts, recruitment and retention strategies, supportive accommodations, mentorship opportunities, community building, and career advancement can be broadened and modified to meet the unique needs of these students, while at the same time seeking to erase any stigma and misconceptions that may cause others to marginalize and exclude them. Participants will have an opportunity to discuss issues that affect CS students living with mental health and medical conditions, share resources that are available for both students and educators, and describe efforts to create and foster a culture of understanding and support for these communities within our field.
