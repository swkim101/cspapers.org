This paper proposes a novel efficient multi-phase trajectory generation algorithm for dynamic dexterous manipulation tasks, such as throwing, catching, dynamic regrasping, and dynamic handover, which can be decomposed into multiple manipulation primitives, including sticking, rolling, approaching, separating, colliding, and grasping. Each manipulation primitive is formulate as a free-terminal optimal control problem (OCP), aimed at computing the optimal pose (position and orientation) trajectories of the object and the robot subject to the pose and force linkage constraints between them and the expected force maintenance at contact. A single-arm regrasping task and a dual-arm dynamic handover task are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
