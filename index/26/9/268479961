Internship experiences allow students to authentically participate in industry while still obtaining mentorship and development opportunities. The Morehouse Center for Broadening Participation in Computing, in collaboration with the Atlanta University Center (AUC) Data Science Initiative, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon Photos joined forces to expand a PreFreshmen eXperience (PFX) program that supports student exposure to programming and interviewing skills. Specifically, incoming Computer Science and Software Engineering freshmen at Morehouse College, Spelman College, and Clark Atlanta University were eligible to apply to the program. The goal of this program was to not only prepare students for courses but also expose them to technical interviewing skills, resources, tools, and experiences in hopes that they will use this information to apply to an internship following their freshman year.
