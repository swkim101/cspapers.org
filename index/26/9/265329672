Wearable devices with continuous ECG recording have become more popular because of their comfort and compactness. However, ECG signals measured by wearable devices can be less reliable because muscle noise, baseline noise, and motion artifacts affect it. If all those signals are sent, it causes unnecessary power consumption while the deviceâ€™s battery capacity is limited. On the server side, the costs, such as power consumption and memory usage can also be wasted. There is a demand to classify the quality of the signal in order only to send good signals to the server. This paper proposes novel Signal Quality Indices (SQI) based on the gain of amplitude difference between adjacent peaks. The results show that the proposed algorithm has higher sensitivity than previous SQI methods, such as template matching and high-order statistical methods based on the ECG amplitude for both noise-free and noisy signals. The proposed method has a sensitivity of 97.19% for noise-free signals, 97.01% for noisy signals, and 98.51% for a database from the Physionet challenge, which contains data collected from mobile phones. The results prove the high feasibility of the algorithm applied to ECG wearable devices.
