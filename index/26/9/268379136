Maps are crucial in conveying geospatial data in diverse contexts such as news and scientific reports. This research, utilizing thematic maps, probes deeper into the underexplored intersection of text framing and map types in influencing map interpretation. In this work, we conducted experiments to evaluate how textual detail and semantic content variations affect the quality of insights derived from map examination. We also explored the influence of explanatory annotations across different map types (e.g., choropleth, hexbin, isarithmic), base map details, and changing levels of spatial autocorrelation in the data. From two online experiments with N = 103 participants, we found that annotations, their specific attributes, and map type used to present the data significantly shape the quality of takeaways. Notably, we found that the effectiveness of annotations hinges on their contextual integration. These findings offer valuable guidance to the visualization community for crafting impactful thematic geospatial representations.
