Rhythmic Gymnastics is an Olympic sport that demands an exceptional level of expertise. From early age, athletes relentlessly practise exercises until they can flawlessly perform them before an audience and a panel of judges. Technology can potentially support rhythmic gymnasts’ training by monitoring gymnasts’ exercises and providing feedback on their execution. However, the limited understanding of the training nuances in Rhythmic Gymnastics restricts the development of technologies to support training. Drawing on the observation of training sessions and on interviews with athletes and coaches, this paper uncovers how coaches personalise feedback timing, type, form, format, and quantity, to adapt it to the gymnasts’ skill level and type of exercise. Taking stock of our findings, we draw out five implications that can inform the design of systems to support feedback in Rhythmic Gymnastics training.
