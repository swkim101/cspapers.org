This study explores links between attributes of computing students, such as prior programming experience (PE) and gender, with expectations for success and the perception of challenges. Using Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT), we investigate their major intentions and the impact of these factors post-CS1. Data was gathered using surveys at the beginning and end of an introductory programming course, focusing on demographics, expectations of success, and perceptions of challenges. Application status for the computing major was also recorded. Our results revealed that men and students with PE generally perceived greater potential for success and reported facing fewer challenges. In contrast, women and students without PE more often indicated concerns about intellectual ability and perceived challenges less positively. Notably, while gender appears in the preceding results, an intersectional analysis indicates that PE is the central factor. PE is also linked to persistence in the field of computing. Our results further highlight the importance of providing students with opportunities to develop experience, as it can help shape their expectations, perceived challenges, and retention in computing.
