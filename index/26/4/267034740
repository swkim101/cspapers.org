In recent years, image editing has advanced remarkably. With increased human control, it is now possible to edit an image in a plethora of ways; from specifying in text what we want to change, to straight up dragging the contents of the image in an interactive point-based manner. However, most of the focus has remained on editing single images at a time. Whether and how we can simultaneously edit large batches of images has remained understudied. With the goal ofmin-imizing human supervision in the editing process, this paper presents a novel method for interactive batch image editing using StyleGAN as the medium. Given an edit specified by users in an example image (e.g., make the face frontal), our method can automatically transfer that edit to other test images, so that regardless of their initial state (pose), they all arrive at the same final state (e.g., all facing front). Ex-tensive experiments demonstrate that edits performed using our method have similar visual quality to existing single-image-editing methods, while having more visual consis-tency and saving significant time and human effort.
