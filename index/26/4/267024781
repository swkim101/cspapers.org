Vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) depends on discriminative representation encoders to abstract the observation states. Despite the great success of increasing CNN parameters for many supervised computer vision tasks, reinforcement learning with temporal-difference (TD) losses cannot benefit from it in most complex environments. In this paper, we analyze that the training instability arises from the oscillating self-overfitting of the heavy-optimizable encoder. We argue that serious oscillation will occur to the parameters when enforced to fit the sensitive TD targets, causing uncertain drifting of the latent state space and thus transmitting these perturbations to the policy learning. To alleviate this phenomenon, we propose a novel asymmetric interactive cooperation approach with the interaction between a heavy-optimizable encoder and a supportive light-optimizable encoder, in which both their advantages are integrated including the highly discriminative capability as well as the training stability. We also present a greedy bootstrapping optimization to isolate the visual perturbations from policy learning, where representation and policy are trained sufficiently by turns. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in utilizing larger visual models by first-person highway driving task CARLA and Vizdoom environments.
