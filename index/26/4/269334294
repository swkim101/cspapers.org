Decompilation is an important part of analyzing threats in computer security. Unfortunately, decompiled code contains less information than the corresponding original source code, which makes understanding it more difﬁcult for the reverse engineers who manually perform threat analysis. Thus, the ﬁdelity of decompiled code to the original source code matters, as it can inﬂuence reverse engineers’ productivity. There is some existing work in predicting some of the missing information using statistical methods, but these focus largely on variable names and variable types. In this work, we more holistically evaluate decompiler output from C-language exe-cutables and use our ﬁndings to inform directions for future decompiler development. More speciﬁcally, we use open-coding techniques to identify defects in decompiled code beyond missing names and types. To ensure that our study is robust, we compare and evaluate four different decompilers. Using thematic analysis, we build a taxonomy of decompiler defects. Using this taxonomy to reason about classes of issues, we suggest speciﬁc approaches that can be used to mitigate ﬁdelity issues in decompiled code.
