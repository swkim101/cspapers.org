This paper presents and analyzes user behavior and network performance in a public-area wireless network using a workload captured at a well-attended ACM conference. The goals of our study are: (1) to extend our understanding of wireless user behavior and wireless network performance; (2) to characterize wireless users in terms of a parameterized model for use with analytic and simulation studies involving wireless LAN traffic; and (3) to apply our workload analysis results to issues in wireless network deployment, such as capacity planning, and potential network optimizations, such as algorithms for load balancing across multiple access points (APs) in a wireless network.
