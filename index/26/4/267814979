The Internet of Things (IoTS) is expected to seamlessly connect everything and everyone and bring about the promise of smart environments, industry 4.0, intelligent infrastructure management, environmental monitoring and disaster recover, etc. In fact, ABI Research [MI-ABI2013] and Gartner [MI-Gartner2013] estimate that there will be between 20 and 30 billion devices on the IoTS by 2020. The explosion in the number of interconnected devices makes it a challenge to guarantee their security, the security of their networks and the privacy of the data collected by them. The Workshop on Trustworthy Embedded Devices (TrustED) focuses on all aspects of security and privacy related to embedded systems and the IoTS. TrustED 2014 continues a successful series of workshops, which were held in conjunction with ESORICS 2011, IEEE Security & Privacy 2012, and ACM CCS 2013 (see http://www.trusted-workshop.de for details). The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts from academia and research institutes, industry, and government in the field of security and privacy in cyber physical systems.
