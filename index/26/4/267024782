Semi-supervised learning has attracted increasing attention in the large-scale land cover mapping task. However, existing methods overlook the potential to alleviate the class imbalance problem by selecting a suitable set of unlabeled data. Besides, in class-imbalanced scenarios, existing pseudo-labeling methods mostly only pick confident samples, failing to exploit the hard samples during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a unified Class-Aware Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation framework. The proposed framework consists of three key components. To construct a better semi-supervised learning dataset, we propose a class-aware unlabeled data selection method that is more balanced towards the minority classes. Based on the built dataset with improved class balance, we propose a Class-Balanced Cross Entropy loss, jointly considering the annotation bias and the class bias to re-weight the loss in both sample and class levels to alleviate the class imbalance problem. Moreover, we propose the Class Center Contrast method to jointly utilize the labeled and unlabeled data. Specifically, we decompose the feature embedding space using the ground truth and pseudo-labels, and employ the embedding centers for hard and easy samples of each class per image in the contrast loss to exploit the hard samples during training. Compared with state-of-the-art class-balanced pseudo-labeling methods, the proposed method improves the mean accuracy and mIoU by 4.28% and 1.70%, respectively, on the large-scale Sentinel-2 dataset with 24 land cover classes.
