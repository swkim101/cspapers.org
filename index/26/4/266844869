Federated Recommendation (FedRec) systems have emerged as a solution to safeguard users' data in response to growing regulatory concerns. However, one of the major challenges in these systems lies in the communication costs that arise from the need to transmit neural network models between user devices and a central server. Prior approaches to these challenges often lead to issues such as computational overheads, model specificity constraints, and compatibility issues with secure aggregation protocols. In response, we propose a novel framework, called Correlated Low-rank Structure (CoLR), which leverages the concept of adjusting lightweight trainable parameters while keeping most parameters frozen. Our approach substantially reduces communication overheads without introducing additional computational burdens. Critically, our framework remains fully compatible with secure aggregation protocols, including the robust use of Homomorphic Encryption. The approach resulted in a reduction of up to 93.75% in payload size, with only an approximate 8% decrease in recommendation performance across datasets.
