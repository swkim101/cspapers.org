Real-time high-speed gaze estimation can enable next-generation gaze-based interaction. The event camera, which captures intensity variations at high frequency, has been employed to this end. However, pupil tracking based only on events is difficult because events are sparse and limited. We propose high-speed pupil tracking using an event camera based on the bright and dark pupil effect. Two illumination sources generate events in the pupil area, and the pupil center is determined in real time at over 2000 Hz without requiring complete image from the events. We implemented gaze target estimation using smooth-pursuit eye movements and confirmed high-speed pupil tracking that may reduce the delay in gaze-based interaction.
