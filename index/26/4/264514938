We designed Joie, a joy-based electroencephalography (EEG) brain-computer interface (BCI). Users interact with Joie by imagining joyous thoughts and images that alter their prefrontal EEG asymmetries. These asymmetries control their characterâ€™s movement in an endless runner video game, where joyous thoughts cause left prefrontal asymmetry that leads to receiving a reward. In this demonstration, we present Joie with a wearable, dry skin conformal polymer electrode EEG headband. We conducted a pilot evaluation (11 participants, 3 training sessions per participant) to assess neurofeedback efficacy and workload. We observed that our participants were able to perform relative left activation significantly greater than right activation and create single-session improvements in resting baseline asymmetry. We also report on perceived user demand, effort and performance.
