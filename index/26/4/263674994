Scientific programmers must optimize the total time-to-solution, the combination of software development and refinement time and actual execution time. The increasing complexity at all levels of supercomputing architectures, coupled with advancements in sequential performance and a growing degree of hardware parallelism, has increasingly placed the bulk of the time-to-solution cost into the software development and tuning phase. Performance analysis tools have been useful for reducing the time-to-solution for message-passing applications; however, there is insufficient tool support for programs developed using Global-Address-Space (GAS) programming models. With the aim of maximizing user productivity, the Parallel Performance Wizard (PPW) fills this void by providing a full range of visualizations and analyses specifically designed for GAS models. To facilitate accurate instrumentation and measurement of GAS programs in PPW, a portable, model-independent performance tool interface (GASP) has been developed and successfully used with Berkeley UPC.
