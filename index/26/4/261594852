Lithium nickel–cobalt–aluminum oxide (NCA) is a promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its high energy density of more than 274 mAh/g. However, thermal runaway inhibits its practical applications. Lithium ferromanganese phosphate (LFMP), due to its olivine structure, can effectively stabilize the surface stability of NCA and reduce the exothermic reactions that occur during thermal runaway. LFMP can also inhibit cathode expansion and contraction during charging and discharging. To improve the conductivity of an NCM–LFMP composite electrode, three different conductive additives, namely carbon black, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene, were introduced into the electrode. Finally, battery safety tests were conducted on 1.1 Ah pouch cells fabricated in the present study. The energy density of the NCA–LFMP 1.1 Ah lithium-ion pouch cells with only 0.16% CNT content reached 224.8 Wh/kg. The CNT–NCA–LFMP pouch cell was also the safest among the cells tested. These results provide a strategy for designing high-energy-density and safe pouch cells for energy storage device applications.
