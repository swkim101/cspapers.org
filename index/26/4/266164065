Folk tales are strong cultural and social inﬂu-ences in children’s lives, and they are known to teach morals and values. However, existing studies on folk tales are largely limited to European tales. In our study, we compile a large corpus of over 1,900 tales originating from 27 diverse cultures across six continents. Using a range of lexicons and correlation analyses, we examine how human values, morals, and gender biases are expressed in folk tales across cultures. We discover differences between cultures in prevalent values and morals, as well as cross-cultural trends in problematic gender biases. Furthermore, we ﬁnd trends of reduced value expression when examining public-domain ﬁction stories, extrin-sically validate our analyses against the multicultural Schwartz Survey of Cultural Values, and ﬁnd traditional gender biases associated with values, morals, and agency. This large-scale cross-cultural study of folk tales paves the way for future studies on how literature in-ﬂuences and reﬂects cultural norms.
