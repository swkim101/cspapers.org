Designing a user interface is an ill-defined problem making cooperative problem solving systems a promising approach to support user interface designers. Cooperative problem solving systems are modular systems that support the human designer with multiple, independent system components. We present a system architecture and an implemented system, FRAMER, that demonstrate the cooperative problem solving approach. FRAMER represents design knowledge in formal, machine-interpretable knowledge sources such as critics and dynamic specification sheets, and in semi-formal knowledge sources such as a palette of user interface building blocks and a checklist. Each of these components contributes significantly to the overall usefulness of the system while requiring only limited resources to be designed and implemented.
