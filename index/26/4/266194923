In this paper, we present a new approach to the control of continuum robot sections using IMU quaternion feedback. We use a discrete time root finding algorithm to steer a continuum section in the desired shape space direction. We found that the approach lacks end effector positioning accuracy when used by itself, however, when used in conjunction with a feedforward model it actively counters the influence of unmodeled factors. The approach is implemented on a single section of a continuum hose robot developed for 3D printing of concrete in construction applications. The results demonstrate significant improvements in positioning accuracy compared to standalone kinematics/mechanics-based position control of tendon lengths. Additionally, this approach can be implemented using low cost sensing and control hardware.
