Learning sparse coordination graphs adaptive to the coordination dynamics among agents is a long-standing problem in cooperative multi-agent learning. This paper studies this problem by proposing several value-based and observation-based schemes for learning dynamic topologies and evaluating them on a new Multi-Agent COordination (MACO) benchmark. The benchmark collects classic coordination problems in the literature, increases their difﬁculty, and classiﬁes them into different types. By analyzing the individual advantages of each learning scheme on each type of problem and their overall performance, we propose a novel method using the variance of utility difference functions to learn context-aware sparse coordination topologies. Moreover, our method learns action representations that effectively reduce the inﬂuence of utility functions’ estimation errors on graph construction. Experiments show that our method signiﬁcantly outperforms dense and static topologies across the MACO and StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark.
