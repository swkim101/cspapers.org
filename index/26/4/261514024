 
 In addressing a verb bias in syntactic analysis we present the beginnings of a noun-driven analysis paradigm. Such a paradigm may complement and compensate for some weaknesses in the existing verb-driven paradigm (in which the noun is subordinated) as applied to information sources or contexts in which the data is structured in objects and more than in events.
