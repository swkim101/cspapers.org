Contemporary advances in the field of deep learning have embarked upon an exploration of the underlying geometric properties of data, thus encouraging the investigation of techniques that consider general manifolds, for example, hyperbolic or orthogonal neural networks. However, the optimization algorithms for training such geometric deep models still remain highly under-explored. In this paper, we introduce Riemannian SAM by generalizing conventional Euclidean SAM to Riemannian manifolds. We successfully formulate the sharpness-aware minimization on Riemannian manifolds, leading to one of a novel instantiation, Lorentz SAM. In addition, SAM variants proposed in previous studies such as Fisher SAM can be derived as special examples under our Riemannian SAM framework. We provide the convergence analysis of Riemannian SAM under a less aggressively decaying ascent learning rate than Euclidean SAM. Our analysis serves as a theoretically sound contribution encompassing a diverse range of manifolds, also providing the guarantees for SAM variants such as Fisher SAM, whose convergence analyses are absent. Lastly, we illustrate the superiority of Riemannian SAM in terms of generalization over previous Riemannian optimization algorithms through experiments on knowledge graph completion and machine translation tasks.
