Caregivers of older adults often undertake their caregiving journey driven by filial obligation, facing inherent expectations and multifaceted roles. While Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research has explored these roles, some invisible work in managing them remains under-examined. To address this gap, we interviewed 19 informal caregivers of older adults to uncover their invisible work and the potential role of technology in supporting these complex responsibilities. Our findings detail the caregiversâ€™ lived experiences, highlighting the challenges and strategies they employ in managing multiple roles. We discuss design opportunities that include facilitating the identification and reflection on existing roles, leveraging this understanding for coordination, aiding in role-based scheduling with acknowledgment, and providing support for the dynamic roles transitioning between various responsibilities. These insights could inform future caregiving technology design, enhancing support for caregivers in their multifaceted roles.
