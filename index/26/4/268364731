SSH (Secure Shell) is widely used for remote access to systems and cloud services. This access comes with the persistent threat of SSH password-guessing brute-force attacks (BFAs) directed at sshd -enabled devices connected to the Internet. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of such attacks on a production facility (CloudLab), offering previously unreported insight. Our study provides a detailed analysis of SSH BFAs occurring on the Internet today through an in-depth analysis of sshd logs collected over a period of four years from over 500 servers. We report several patterns in attacker behavior, present insight on the targets of the attacks, and devise a method for tracking individual attacks over time across sources. Leveraging our insight, we develop a defense mechanism against SSH BFAs that blocks 99.5% of such attacks, signiﬁcantly outperforming the 66.1% coverage of current state-of-the-art rate-based blocking while also cutting false positives by 83%. We have deployed our defense in production on CloudLab, where it catches four-ﬁfths of SSH BFAs missed by other defense strategies.
