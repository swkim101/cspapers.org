This volume contains the proceedings of the Joint Meeting of the Twenty-Third Annual EACSL Conference on Computer Science Logic (CSL) and the Twenty-Ninth Annual ACM/ IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS). CSL is the annual meeting of the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL) intended for computer scientists whose research activities involve logic, as well as for logicians working on issues significant for computer science. LICS is an annual international forum on theoretical and practical topics in computer science that relate to logic. Every 3--4 years, LICS has been part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC). Given that FLoC was to be held as part of the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL) during July 2014, the organizers of CSL and LICS have chosen to merge the 2014 editions of these meetings into a single event within FLoC and VSL. Thus, in 2014, the joint meeting had one program committee, one program, and one proceedings.
