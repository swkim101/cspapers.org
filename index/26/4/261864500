This paper presents a new robot which produces four motions for high speed handling (three translations and one rotation about a given axis in world coordinates). This machine is an evolution of H4's architecture. First, H4's advantages are recalled, and some limitations are mentioned. To compensate for these limitations a new design of the traveling plate is proposed. A description of the whole mechanism is given. The structure's ability to provide Scara motions is presented. Geometrical conditions that must be followed in order to obtain desired motions are discussed. Kinematics models are derived. The design of the first prototype is described.
