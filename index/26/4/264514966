We introduce a novel method called ‘spraying sound’ for immersive auditory and spatial experiences. Our prototype SoundMist disperses sound into the surrounding space, enhancing immersion and spatial perception. Through user tests with 11 participants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enriching the auditory experience and expanding possibilities for spatial auditory interactions. This research opens up opportunities to explore immersive spatial experiences with sound and makes a contribution by proposing a novel method of sound-space interaction through a system that sprays sound in a spatial context.
