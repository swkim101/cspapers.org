Aisen is an innovative web-based communication tool that integrates the WebGazer.js library [5] with advanced large language models (LLMs). Designed as an affordable communication solution for those with communication challenges, Aisen facilitates expression through a unique word-selection interface. Rather than using a traditional keyboard, Aisen introduces a two-tiered "word card" system. This system includes a static set of cards tailored to the patient’s specific needs and a "dynamic" set where cards are intelligently generated by LLMs based on user input and preferences. Our research delineated three specific user personas, emphasizing Aisen’s applicability for elderly patients. The platform integrates an eye-tracking mechanism, a gaze-responsive interface, and a word card repository enriched with LLMs. This endeavor highlights the transformative potential of web-enabled eye-tracking and LLMs in enhancing communication for individuals with impairments.
