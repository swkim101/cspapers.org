We present Melody Slot Machine on iPhone, an iPhone application using the melodic morphing method on the basis of the Generative Theory of Tonal Music (GTTM). We previously developed a demonstration system called Melody Slot Machine to introduce the melodic morphing method and presented it at international conferences and exhibitions. Since in-person demonstrations were reduced due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, we implemented an application with the same functionality and made it available for downloading to experience it. Our Melody Slot Machine on iPhone currently has two contents available for download, and we plan to add more contents in the future.
