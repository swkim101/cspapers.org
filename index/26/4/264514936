Prior research has offered a plethora of wearables centred around sensing bodily actions ranging from more explicit data, such as movement and physiological response, to implicit information, such as ocular and brain activity. Bodily augmentations that physically extend the user’s body along with altering body schema and image have been proposed recently as well, owing to factors such as accessibility and improving communication. However, these attempts have usually consisted of uncomfortable interfaces that either restrict the user’s movement or are intrusive in nature. In this work, we present Pneunocchio, a playful nose augmentation based on the lore of Pinocchio. Pneunocchio consists of a pneumatic-based inflatable that a user wears on their nose to play a game of two truths and a lie. With our work, we aim to explore expressive bodily augmentations that respond to a player’s physiological state that can alter the perception of their body while serving as an expressive match for a current part of the body.
