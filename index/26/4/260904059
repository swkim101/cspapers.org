Every day a large volume of legal documents are produced, and lawyers need support for the analysis of the big documents, especially in corporate litigation. Typically corporate litigation has the aim of finding evidence for or against the litigation claims. Identifying the critical legal points from large volumes of legal text is time consuming and costly, but recent advances in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning have provided new enthusiasm for improved management of legal texts and the identification of legal relationships. I believe that developing tools to automatically, or semi-automatically confirm entailment relationships between legal texts is fundamental to legal text understanding. Many researchers are interested in developing question-answering tools which help novice users obtain information about their questions in law, and an initial important step is the development of a question answering system for Yes/No questions.
