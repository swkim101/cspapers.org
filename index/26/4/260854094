Recent work for extracting relations from texts has achieved excellent performance. However, existing studies mainly focus on simple relation extraction, these methods perform not well on overlapping triple problem because the tags of shared entities would conflict with each other. Especially, overlapping entities are common and indispensable in Chinese. To address this issue, this paper proposes PasCore, which utilizes a global pointer annotation strategy for overlapping relation extraction in Chinese. PasCore first obtains the sentence vector via general pre-training model encoder, and uses classifier to predicate relations. Subsequently, it uses global pointer annotation strategy for head entity annotation, which uses global tags to label the start and end positions of the entities. Finally, PasCore integrates the relation, head entity and its type to mark the tail entity. Furthermore, PasCore performs conditional layer normalization to fuse features, which connects all stages and greatly enriches the association between relations and entities. Experimental results on both Chinese and English real-world datasets demonstrate that PasCore outperforms strong baselines on relation extraction and, especially, shows superior performance on overlapping relation extraction.
