The classical human-robot interface in uncalibrated image-based visual servoing (UIBVS) relies on either human annotations or semantic segmentation with categorical labels. Both methods fail to match natural human communication and convey rich semantics in manipulation tasks as effectively as natural language expressions. In this paper, we tackle this problem by using referring expression segmentation, which is a prompt-based approach, to provide more in-depth information for robot perception. To generate high-quality segmentation predictions from referring expressions, we propose CLIPUNetr - a new CLIP-driven referring expression segmentation network. CLIPUNetr leverages CLIPâ€™s strong vision-language representations to segment regions from referring expressions, while utilizing its "U-shaped" encoder-decoder architecture to generate predictions with sharper boundaries and finer structures. Furthermore, we propose a new pipeline to integrate CLIPUNetr into UIBVS and apply it to control robots in real-world environments. In experiments, our method improves boundary and structure measurements by an average of 120% and can successfully assist real-world UIBVS control in an unstructured manipulation environment.
