We present WineSensed , a large multimodal wine dataset for studying the relations 1 between visual perception, language, and flavor. The dataset encompasses 897k im-2 ages of wine labels and 824k reviews of wines curated from the Vivino platform. It 3 has over 350k unique bottlings, annotated with year, region, rating, alcohol percent-4 age, price, and grape composition. We obtained fine-grained flavor annotations on 5 a subset by conducting a wine-tasting experiment with 256 participants who were 6 asked to rank wines based on their similarity in flavor, resulting in more than 5k 7 pairwise flavor distances. We propose a low-dimensional concept embedding algo-8 rithm that combines human experience with automatic machine similarity kernels.
