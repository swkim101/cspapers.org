In this work, we proposed and designed a web-based educational technology to support sustainable living. It is called Waste Genie. Waste Genie integrates formal and informal learning features to help users learn about waste management. A field trial was conducted to evaluate its effectiveness, and the results indicated the platform was well-received by the users.
