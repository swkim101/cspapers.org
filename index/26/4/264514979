We demonstrate Visual Blocks for ML, a visual programming platform that facilitates rapid prototyping of ML-based multimedia applications. As the public version of Rapsai [3], we further integrated large language models and custom APIs into the platform. In this demonstration, we will showcase how to build interactive AI pipelines in a few drag-and-drops, how to perform interactive data augmentation, and how to integrate pipelines into Colabs. In addition, we demonstrate a wide range of community-contributed pipelines in Visual Blocks for ML, covering various aspects including interactive graphics, chains of large language models, computer vision, and multi-modal applications. Finally, we encourage students, designers, and ML practitioners to contribute ML pipelines through https://github.com/google/visualblocks/tree/main/pipelines to inspire creative use cases.
