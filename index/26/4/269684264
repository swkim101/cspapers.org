With the development of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), data is becoming increasingly important, while the right of data to be forgotten, which is defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and permits data owners to remove information from AIGC models, is also arising. To protect this right in a distributed manner corresponding to federated learning, federated unlearning is employed to eliminate history model updates and unlearn the global model to mitigate data effects from the targeted clients intending to withdraw from training tasks. To diminish centralization failures, the hierarchical federated framework that is distributed and collaborative can be integrated into the unlearning process, wherein each cluster can support multiple AIGC tasks. However, two issues remain unexplored in current federated unlearning solutions: 1) getting remaining clients, those not withdraw from the task, to join the unlearning process, which demands additional resources and notably has fewer benefits than federated learning, particularly in achieving the original performance via alternative unlearning processes and 2) exploring mechanisms for dynamic unlearning in the selection of remaining clients possessing unbalanced data to avoid starting the unlearning from scratch. We initially consider a two-level incentive and unlearning mechanism to address the aforementioned challenges. At the lower level, we utilize evolutionary game theory to model the dynamic participation process, aiming to attract remaining clients to participate in retraining tasks. At the upper level, we integrate deep reinforcement learning into federated unlearning to dynamically select remaining clients to join the unlearning process to mitigate the bias introduced by the unbalanced data distribution among clients. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms outperform comparative methods, enhancing utilities and improving accuracy.
