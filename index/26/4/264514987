We propose using a LLM to breathe life into our existing dance learning app in the form of an AI dance coach persona. The current app guides the user through dance practice plans, using the webcam and pose estimation to give feedback. Using the LLM, voice recognition, speech synthesis, and affect recognition, we plan to transform the interface from a mechanical click-on-screen experience to a hands-free speak-with-the-coach interaction. In particular, we’ll use the LLM to announce coaching guidance, provide encouragement, communicate feedback, and interpret the user’s spoken intent.
