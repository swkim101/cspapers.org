NLPers frequently face reproducibility crisis in a comparison of various models of a real-world NLP task. Many studies have empirically showed that the standard splits tend to produce low reproducible and unreliable conclusions, and they attempted to improve the s-plits by using more random repetitions. However, the improvement on the reproducibility in a comparison of NLP models is limited attributed to a lack of investigation on the relationship between the reproducibility and the estimator induced by a splitting strategy. In this paper, we formulate the reproducibility in a model comparison into a probabilistic function with regard to a conclusion. Furthermore, we theoretically illustrate that the reproducibility is qualitatively dominated by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a model performance estimator obtained on a corpus splitting strategy. Speciﬁcally, a higher value of the SNR of an estimator probably indicates a better reproducibility. On the basis of the theoretical motivations, we develop a novel mixture estimator of the performance of an NLP model with a regularized corpus splitting strategy based on a blocked 3 × 2 cross-validation. We conduct numerical experiments on multiple NLP tasks to show that the proposed estimator achieves a high SNR, and it substantially increases the reproducibility. Therefore, we recommend the NLP practitioners to use the proposed method to compare NLP models instead of the method-s based on the widely-used standard splits and the random splits with multiple repetitions.
