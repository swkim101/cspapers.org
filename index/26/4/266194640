We explore the idea of robotic mechanisms that can shift between soft and rigid states, with the long-term goal of creating robots that marry the flexibility and robustness of soft robots with the strength and precision of rigid robots. We present a simple yet effective method to achieve large and rapid stiffness variations by compressing and relaxing a flexure using cables. Next, we provide a differentiable modeling framework that can be used for motion planning, which simultaneously reasons about the modulated stiffness joints, tendons, rigid joints, and basic hydrodynamics. We apply this stiffness tuning and simulation recipe to create SoRiTu, an untethered soft-rigid robotic sea turtle capable of various swimming maneuvers.
