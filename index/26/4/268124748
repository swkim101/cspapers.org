1. SUMMARY Computational Thinking [1] is a universal metaphor of reasoning used by both mankind and machines. From this perspective it has the potential to be a comprehensive umbrella for capturing the intrinsic nature of computing and conveying this in an understandable way to students and the general public. It represents a broad spectrum of reasoning across time and disciplines. Learning to count is a beginning of human computational thinking, followed naturally by arithmetic computation and abstract levels of symbol based thinking, often starting with algebra. Counting, arithmetic, symbols and abstract thinking are fundamental to the study of computing.
