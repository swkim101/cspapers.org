Logic synthesis for soft error mitigation is increasingly important in a wide range of applications of FPGAs. We present R2, an algorithm for rewiring a post-layout LUT-based circuit that reduces the overall criticality of the circuit, where criticality is the fraction of primary inputs that lead to observable errors at the primary outputs if an single event upset inverts a configuration bit. Our algorithm explicitly optimizes the robustness of the interconnect, the dominant component of FPGAs. The key idea of R2 is to exploit Boolean flexibilities in the circuit implementation to replace wires with high criticality with those with lower criticality while preserving the circuit functionality. We estimate criticalities using a Monte Carlo fault simulation. We represent flexibilities using SPFDs (Set of Pairs of Functions to be Distinguished), and use criticality information to choose candidates for rewiring, assigning the maximum flexibility to high criticality wires. Compared to IPR, a recent robust logic optimization, our implementation increases MTTF (Mean Time to Failure) by 24%, showing for the first time, the advantages of exploiting Boolean flexibilities in optimizing for robustness. In addition, R2 achieves 5% and 2% more reduction on the number of wires and LUTs in an FPGA than that obtained by the existing rewiring algorithm for area minimization.
