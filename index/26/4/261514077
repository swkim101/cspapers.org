Choreography refers to creation of dance motions according to both music and dance knowledge, where the created dances should be style-specific and consistent. However, most of the existing methods generate dances using the given music as the only reference, lacking the stylized dancing knowledge, namely, the flag motion patterns contained in different styles. Without the stylized prior knowledge, these approaches are not promising to generate controllable style or diverse moves for each dance style, nor new dances complying with stylized knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a novel music-to-dance generation framework guided by style embedding, considering both input music and stylized dancing knowledge. These style embeddings are learnt representations of style-consistent kinematic abstraction of reference dance videos, which can act as controllable factors to impose style constraints on dance generation in a latent manner. Hence, we can make the style embedding fit into any given style while allowing the flexibility to generate new compatible dance moves by modifying the style embedding according to the learnt representations of a certain style. We are the first to achieve knowledge-driven style control in dance generation tasks. To support this study, we build a large multi-style music-to-dance dataset referred to as I-Dance. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the advantage of the proposed framework, as well as the ability to synthesize diverse moves under a dance style directed by style embedding.
