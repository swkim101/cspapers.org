There are high expectations in all sectors of society for immediate access to biological knowledge of all kinds. To fully exploit and manage the value of biological resources, society must have the intellectual tools to store, retrieve, collate, analyze, and synthesize organism-level and ecological scale information. However, it currently is difficult to discover, access, and use biodiversity data because of the long history of “bottom-up” evolution of scientific biodiversity information, the mismatch between the distribution of biodiversity itself and the distribution of the data about it, and, most importantly, the inherent complexity of biodiversity and ecological data. This stems from, among many factors, numerous data types, the nonexistence of a common underlying (binary) language, and the multiple perceptions of different researchers/data recorders across spatial or temporal distance or both. The challenge presented to the computer science and information technology community by the biodiversity and ecological information domain is worthy of all the time and talent that can be brought to bear, because the continued existence of the species Homo sapiens depends upon gaining an understanding of this spaceship Earth and our fellow passengers upon it.
