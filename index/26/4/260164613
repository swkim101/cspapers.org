Palmprint recently shows great potential in recognition applications as it is a privacy-friendly and stable biometric. However, the lack of large-scale public palmprint datasets limits further research and development of palmprint recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel realistic pseudo-palmprint generation (RPG) model to synthesize palmprints with massive identities. We first introduce a conditional modulation generator to improve the intra-class diversity. Then an identity-aware loss is proposed to ensure identity consistency against unpaired training. We further improve the Bézier palm creases generation strategy to guarantee identity independence. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining significantly boosts the recognition model performance. For example, our model improves the state-of-the-art BézierPalm by more than 5% and 14% in terms of TAR@FAR=1e-6 under the 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 Open-set protocol. When accessing only 10% of the real training data, our method still outperforms ArcFace with 100% real training data, indicating that we are closer to real-data-free palmprint recognition.
