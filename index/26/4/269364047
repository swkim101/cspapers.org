Changes in enterprise networks require updated configurations. However, manual configurations with slow update efficiency, poor performance, and handling limitations, lead to the unavailability of updated networks. Therefore, we propose an efficient network renascence framework, NetRen, which synthesizes OSPF/BGP configurations driven by service and traffic migration. We follow the workflow of sketch extraction, configuration synthesis, and repair. Initially, comprehensive graphs are constructed to represent configuration sketches. We propose a GraphTrans synthesizer with Transformer's benefits of long-range focus and parallel reasoning. Training samples with the optimization relationship enable the synthesizer to achieve a mapping that optimizes performance based on configurations. To overcome the satisfiability barrier, configurations from the synthesizer are input to the stepwise configuration repairer as well-initialized solutions, achieving rapid configuration repair. Experiments demonstrate that the consistency of network configurations output by the GraphTrans synthesizer averages 98%. NetRen achieves a 312.4Ã— increase in synthesis efficiency and a 5.83% improvement in network performance.
