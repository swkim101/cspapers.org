Traditional collection and analysis of feline urine samples for health monitoring are invasive, expensive, and infrequent. This paper introduces PURRtentio, a novel litter box system utilizing an electrochemical biosensor to monitor analytes in feline urine. The system comprises a DIY biosensor, potentiostat, microcontroller, distance sensor, and mobile application. Performance validation compared PURRtentio with an industry-grade potentiostat. PURRtentio presents an innovative and non-invasive approach for consistent monitoring of chemistry elements in feline urine, enabling early detection and management of catâ€™s health conditions. This technology has the potential to revolutionize feline health monitoring, providing a solution for veterinarians and pet owners.
