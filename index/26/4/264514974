Differentiating from commonly-seen Olfactory Displays (ODs) that utilize rigid mechanisms within HCI, we propose ScentCarving, a controllable, lightweight, and flexible odor-release mechanism through a thin, multi-layered structure. ScentCarving consists of four layers, including the (1) paper-based substrate, (2) odor layer containing the ink-based aroma, (3) odor-sealing layer by introducing a thermoplastic material, and (4) a heating module using conductive cooper to soften the sealing layer and release the scent. ScentCarving also involves an easy-to-access Odor Printing technique capable of engraving fragrances onto thin and flexible substrates. We conducted a small-scale user study to test the scent-releasing behavior in terms of smell distance and responsive time.
