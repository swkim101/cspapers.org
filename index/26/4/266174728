In many real-world situations, there is often not enough information to know that a certain strategy will succeed in achieving the goal, but there is a good reason to believe that it will. The paper introduces the term "doxastic" for such strategies.

The main technical contribution is a sound and complete logical system that describes the interplay between doxastic strategy and belief modalities.
