We study taste reproduction using taste sensors, with a particular emphasis on accurately measuring and reproducing the taste of garlic while reducing the associated bad breath. We measured and reproduced the taste of garlic using a combination of odorless substances. We also developed a fork integrated with a mechanism for releasing the aroma of allicin to provide controlled exposure to the nose for a complete eating experience. Through our experiments, we successfully achieved identical taste and smell experiences, effectively eliminating the occurrence of bad breath. To validate our findings, participants tasted a dish of spaghetti and reported that the culinary experience was very similar to that of normal garlic-infused dishes, with no detectable bad breath.
