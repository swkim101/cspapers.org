LogicWriter Actual (https://tinyurl.com/logicwriteractual) is a web app that helps early undergraduate CS students write with symbolic logic notation (↔, ∃, ∧, Greek letters, etc.). It designed with a quick start easy-to-use interface and is compatible with most writing programs. LogicWriter Actual is designed to minimize cognitive demands on software operation so that students can focus on mathematical writing. LogicWriter Actual has been used in our foundational CS logic class for the past three years. Preliminary results indicate that students typically learn to use it in five minutes or less and rate it favorably. Collaboration is sought for synergistic use with scaffolded software and other instructional efforts in proof writing and mathematical exposition.
