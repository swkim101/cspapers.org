The hair structure, a characteristic object that can be formed using 3D printers, is used to enrich the expressivity and haptic sensation of a printed object. However, in conventional 3D printing techniques, the hair structure is printed using a uniform and general plastic such as Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA). In this study, we attempt to print the hair structure using conductive and magnetic iron filaments, commonly used to allow an Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printer to create a functional object, to extend the possibility of the 3D printed hair technique. Furthermore, we planted the printed hair in the soft resin used for resin crafts. We provide detailed material information and validate the printability of each filament. With these methods, we demonstrate applications, such as hairy devices that can detect when a human touches hair, brushes attracted by magnet arrays, and flexible attachment of hair structures to the human body.
