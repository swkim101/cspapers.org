This paper proposes Meta Parallel Graph Neural Network (MPGNN) to establish a scalable Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) for large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) networks. MPGNN leverages a meta-learning framework to optimize the parallelism of GNN-based NIDS. The core of MPGNN is a coalition formation policy that generates meta-knowledge for partitioning a massive graph into multiple coalitions/subgraphs in a way that maximizes the performance and efficiency of parallel coalitional NIDSs. We propose an offline reinforcement learning algorithm, called Graph-Embedded Adversarially Trained Actor-Critic (G-ATAC), to learn a coalition formation policy that jointly optimizes intrusion detection accuracy, communication overheads, and computational complexities of coalitional NIDSs. In particular, G-ATAC learns to capture the temporal dependencies of network states and coalition formation decisions over offline data, eliminating the need for expensive online interactions with large IoT networks. Given generated coalitions, MPGNN employs E-GraphSAGE to establish coalitional NIDSs which then collaborate via ensemble prediction to accomplish intrusion detection for the entire network. We evaluate MPGNN on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method with substantial improvements in F1 score, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by 0.38 and 0.29 for the respective datasets. Compared to the centralized NIDS, MPGNN reduces the training time of NIDS by 41.63% and 22.11%, while maintaining an intrusion detection performance comparable to centralized NIDS.
