The trunk movements of an individual paralyzed by spinal cord injury (SCI) can be restored by Functional Neuromuscular Stimulation (FNS), a technique that applies low-level current to motor nerves to activate the muscles generating torques, and thus, produce trunk motions. FNS can be modulated to control trunk movements. However, a stabilizing modulation policy (i.e., control law) is difficult to derive due to the complexity of neuromusculoskeletal dynamics, which consist of skeletal dynamics (i.e., multi-joint rigid body dynamics) and neuromuscular dynamics (i.e., a highly nonlinear, non-autonomous, and input redundant dynamics). Therefore, an FNS-based control method that can stabilize the trunk without knowing the accurate skeletal and neuromuscular dynamics is desired. This work proposed an FNS generator, which consists of a robust nonlinear controller (RNC) that provides stabilizing torque command and an artificial neural network (ANN)-based torque-to-activation (T-A) map to ensure that the muscle generates the stabilizing torque to the skeleton. Due to the robustness and learning capability of this control framework, full knowledge of the trunk neuromusculoskeletal dynamics is not required. The proposed control framework has been tested in a simulation environment where an anatomically realistic 3D musculoskeletal model of the human trunk was manipulated to follow a time-varying reference that moves in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. From the results, it can be seen that the trunk motion converges to a satisfactory trajectory while the ANN is being updated. The results suggest the potential of this control framework for trunk tracking tasks in a clinical application.
