One of the challenges facing educators in computer science is to develop programming projects which not only engage students intellectually, but which also excite and motivate them. Given the highly visual orientation of today's students, if is important that we consider not only the conceptual underpinnings of our programming projects, but also their visual impact. This paper focuses upon a set of programming projects which use the traditional elements from a data structures course to produce visually engaging applications.
