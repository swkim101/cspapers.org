Although programming is part of primary school curricula in many countries, barriers persist for elementary students learning programming such as an insufficient understanding of the underlying mathematics, complex concepts, and purpose of programming. These challenges often lead to disinterest. Herein we present an innovative game-design-based programming education tool. Students progressively enhance a classic game, Puyo Puyo, using fundamental programming concepts and selecting the appropriate code. This engaging approach improves students' computational thinking abilities as they transform code into a functional game. Here, we describe the tool's background and structure. Then we detail a workshop using the tool, including analyzing the changes in students' programming skills, computational thinking, and interest in programming. Finally, we summarize the findings and future research directions.
