Hybrid wheeled-legged quadrupeds have the potential to navigate challenging terrain with agility and speed and over long distances. However, obstacles can impede their progress by requiring the robots to either slow down to step over obstacles or modify their path to circumvent the obstacles. We propose a motion optimization framework for quadruped robots that incorporates non-steerable wheels and dynamic jumps, enabling them to perform hybrid wheeled-legged locomotion while overcoming obstacles without slowing down. Our approach involves a model predictive controller that uses a time-varying rigid body dynamics model of the robot, including legs and wheels, to track dynamic motions such as jumping. We also introduce a method for driving with minimal leg swings to reduce energy consumption by sparing the effort involved in lifting the wheels. Our method was tested successfully on the wheeled Mini Cheetah and the Unitree AlienGo robots. Further videos and results are available at https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/âˆ¼hosseini/iros2023
