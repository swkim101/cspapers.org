Today, we are at an inflection point in computing where emerging Generative AI services are placing unprecedented demand for compute while the existing architectural patterns for improving efficiency have stalled. In this talk, we will discuss the likely needs of the next generation of computing infrastructure and use recent examples at Google from networks to accelerators to servers to illustrate the challenges and opportunities ahead. Taken together, we chart a course where computing must be increasingly specialized and co-optimized with algorithms and software, all while fundamentally focusing on security and sustainability.
