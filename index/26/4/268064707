Privacy-Preserving Action Recognition (PPAR) aims to transform raw videos into anonymous ones to prevent privacy leakage while maintaining action clues, which is an increasingly important problem in intelligent vision applications. Despite recent efforts in this task, it is still challenging to deal with novel privacy attributes and novel privacy attack models that are unavailable during the training phase. In this paper, from the perspective of meta-learning (learning to learn), we propose a novel Meta Privacy-Preserving Action Recognition (MPPAR) framework to improve both generalization abilities above (i.e., generalize to novel privacy attributes and novel privacy attack models ) in a unified manner. Concretely, we simulate train/test task shifts by constructing disjoint support/query sets w.r.t. privacy attributes or attack models. Then, a virtual training and testing scheme is applied based on support/query sets to provide feedback to optimize the modelâ€™s learning towards better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-arts.
