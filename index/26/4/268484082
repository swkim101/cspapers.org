In an era where digital platforms like TikTok and Instagram redefine interaction, integrating active learning in large-scale computer science (CS) courses presents both a unique challenge and opportunity. This lightning talk intends to discuss a two-step strategy piloted within a second-year large-scale (i.e., over 500 students) introductory course to software engineering at a Southeast North American university. First, we tasked CS students to create a video tutorial as their midterm exam deliverable. The exam consisted of four questions: three open-ended questions for concepts on software engineering and one diagramming question that had them transform a descriptive context into a UML domain model diagram. Next, students took part in a double-masked peer review process that had them evaluate their peers' deliverables and explanations. Overall, we intended to assess students' understanding of software engineering concepts while enabling them to reflect upon their learning processes as they taught what they learned. Also, by having them peer-review among themselves, we aimed to foster an experience to enrich students' engagement and develop feedback skills. This lightning talk is to gather feedback from the CS Education community on this instructional strategy and possibly collaborate for a more extensive study on student-created artifacts in large-scale CS courses.
