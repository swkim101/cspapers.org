One of the most serious factors compromising driving safety is when people in drivers' non-line-of-sight areas rush out suddenly. Existing studies on non-line-of-sight imaging rely on expensive equipment or are limited to severe laboratory conditions (e.g., massive planar reflectors and controlled illumination), rendering these technologies inapplicable in complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose a non-line-of-sight moving obstacle detection system Ghost-Probe, which can provide an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) with sufficient time to respond and stop safely. We design a shadow signal discriminator to assess the weak shadows created by a moving obstacle, such as pedestrians in the blind area, while simultaneously filtering out the impacts of other complicated illumination. Note that we merely use commercial monocular cameras and our system is robust to a wide range of lighting scenarios and planar reflectors. We evaluate the generalizability of our approach using the datasets collected in real-world driving scenarios with a variety of road surface and lighting circumstances. The results indicate that our system can detect the moving pedestrian in the non-line-of-sight area at a distance of 20 meters and offer the ADAS system advance warning to keep a safe distance.
