In Ghana people who struggle to articulate speech as a result of different conditions experience barriers in interacting with others due to difficulties in being understood. Automatic speech recognition software can be used to help listeners understand people with communication difficulties. However, studies have not looked at the practical feasibility of these technologies beyond the Global North. We present a novel user study examining the introduction of one such technology, Google Project Relate, to Ghana. This freely available mobile application can create personalised speech recognition models in English for non-standard speech to support communication. Our user study spans the training of local speech and language therapists and 20 people with communication difficulties. We utilise the Technology Amplification Theory to contribute insights on the need for technological adaptations, awareness and support to reduce differential gaps of access, capacity and motivation to expand the reach of these technologies rather than exacerbating inequalities.
