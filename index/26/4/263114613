We shall analyze and optimize the parameters of the following two types of power saving of IEEE 802.16e in presence of downlink traffic: (i) Type I classes: Under the sleep mode operation, sleep and listen windows are interleaved as long as there is no downlink traffic destined to the node. During listen windows, the node checks with the base station whether there is any buffered downlink traffic destined to it in which case it leaves the sleep mode. Each sleep window is twice the size of the previous one but it is not greater than a specified final value. The initial sleep window is Tmin, the multiplicative factor is a (a = 2 in the standard) and the final value aTmin depends on the exponent l. (ii) Type II classes: All sleep windows are of the same size as the initial window (i.e. a = 1). Sleep and listen windows are interleaved as in type I classes. To model these classes, we analyze an M/G/1 queue in which the server begins a vacation of random length each time that the system becomes empty. If the server returns from a vacation to find an empty queue, a new random vacation initiates; otherwise, the server works until the system empties (exhaustive service regime). Request arrivals are assumed to form a Poisson process with parameter λ. Let σ denote a generic random variable having the same (general) distribution as the queue service times. The queue regenerates each time it empties and the cycles are i.i.d. Each regeneration cycle consists of (see Fig. 1):
