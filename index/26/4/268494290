CS50.dev is a cloud-based programming environment offered to students taking CS50 and other CS courses at Harvard University, both on-campus or online. Built atop GitHub Codespaces, CS50.dev simplifies the initial challenges commonly faced by students and instructors because of the complexities involved in setting up programming environments at term's start. This demo offers an in-depth exploration of CS50.dev's architecture and presents a detailed guide on customizing Docker images and development container (devcontainers) to meet the specific needs of courses within GitHub Codespaces. The demo will also provide general guidance on how to help students transition from CS50.dev to using VS Code independently on their local machines at the term's end.
