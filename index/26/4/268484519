In the last decades, teaching methods in computing are shifting towards active learning. Among these, a notable case are debate-based classes which can be used to develop skills such as critical thinking which, are in high demand in the workplace. The choice of debate topic is a particularly controversial theme, since it can influence the students' motivation, experience, and understanding of the course's content. In this poster, we propose an evolution of a debate-based teaching methodology, called Tech Battles, to include the reading of science fiction short stories as a preparatory activity. The intervention takes place in an Innovation and Entrepreneurship course for computing students at the University of Trento, where science fiction can help students develop critical thinking about technology and innovation, but also aid them in understanding the debate's context, and ultimately enhance their learning. We conclude our reflections by exploring possible implications of this change, connecting it to existing traditions that leverage science fiction as a pedagogical tool.
