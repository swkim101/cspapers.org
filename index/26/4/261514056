Deep learning algorithms are widely used to extend modern biometric authentication mechanisms in resource-constrained environments like smartphones, providing ease-of-use and user comfort, while maintaining a non-invasive nature. 
In this paper, an alternative is proposed, that uses both facial recognition and the unique movements of that particular face while uttering a password. The proposed model is language independent, the password doesn't necessarily need to be a set of meaningful words or numbers, and also, is a contact-less system. When evaluated on the standard MIRACL-VC1 dataset, the proposed model achieved a testing accuracy of 98.1%, underscoring its effectiveness.
