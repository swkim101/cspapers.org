A poorly designed knowledge base can be as cryptic as an arbitrary program and just as difficult to maintain. Representing control knowledge abstractly, separately from domain facts and relations, makes the design more transparent and explainable. A body of abstract control knowledge provides a generic framework for constructing knowledge bases for related problems in other domains and also provides a useful starting point for studying the nature of strategies.
