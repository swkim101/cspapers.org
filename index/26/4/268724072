Most domain adaptation (DA) methods are based on either a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or a vision transformers (ViTs). They align the distribution differences between domains as encoders without considering their unique characteristics. For instance, ViT excels in accuracy due to its superior ability to capture global representations, while CNN has an advantage in capturing local representations. This fact has led us to design a hybrid method to fully take advantage of both ViT and CNN, called Explicitly Class-specific Boundaries (ECB). ECB learns CNN on ViT to combine their distinct strengths. In particular, we leverage ViT's properties to explicitly find class-specific decision boundaries by maximizing the discrepancy between the out-puts of the two classifiers to detect target samples far from the source support. In contrast, the CNN encoder clusters target features based on the previously defined class-specific boundaries by minimizing the discrepancy between the prob-abilities of the two classifiers. Finally, ViT and CNN mutually exchange knowledge to improve the quality of pseudo labels and reduce the knowledge discrepancies of these models. Compared to conventional DA methods, our ECB achieves superior performance, which verifies its effectiveness in this hybrid model. The project website can be found here.
