Camera-based tactile sensing is a low-cost, popular approach to obtain highly detailed contact geometry information. However, most existing camera-based tactile sensors are fingertip sensors, and longer fingers often require extraneous elements to obtain an extended sensing area similar to the full length of a human finger. Moreover, existing methods to estimate proprioceptive information such as total forces and torques applied on the finger from camera-based tactile sensors are not effective when the contact geometry is complex. We introduce GelSight Svelte, a curved, human finger-sized, single-camera tactile sensor that is capable of both tactile and proprioceptive sensing over a large area. GelSight Svelte uses curved mirrors to achieve the desired shape and sensing coverage. Proprioceptive information, such as the total bending and twisting torques applied on the finger, is reflected as deformations on the flexible backbone of GelSight Svelte, which are also captured by the camera. We train a convolutional neural network to estimate the bending and twisting torques from the captured images. We conduct gel deformation experiments at various locations of the finger to evaluate the tactile sensing capability and proprioceptive sensing accuracy. To demonstrate the capability and potential uses of GelSight Svelte, we conduct an object holding task with three different grasping modes that utilize different areas of the finger.
