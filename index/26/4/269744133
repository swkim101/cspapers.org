COPD is an incurable Chronic Respiratory Disease that results in restricted airflow and respiratory issues. India faces rising pollution and health infrastructure challenges, significantly contributing to the prevalence of respiratory diseases like COPD. Studies have reported that COPD is India’s second leading cause of death and Disability Adjusted Life Years. Our study delves into the current state of COPD care and awareness in India. Our mixed-methods research, encompassing online surveys with medical personnel (n=9) and individuals (n=141) and semi-structured interviews (n=13) with various stakeholders (patients, doctors and caregivers), revealed a noteworthy lack of COPD awareness amongst the public, consequently affecting the COPD diagnosis, treatment and management strategies. We further explored how COPD affects patients’ self-perception and quality of life while identifying the barriers to COPD care. Finally, we conclude with design recommendations for technology-based interventions which can support the management of COPD patients in the Indian context.
