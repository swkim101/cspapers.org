Smart glasses are promising devices that allow the user to experience augmented reality (AR) and watch movies as on a big screen. As their design is primarily focused on their function as output devices, their input functionality is limited. We propose LensTouch, which enhances the input vocabulary by using touches on the lens of the smart glasses as inputs. The user can place his/her finger on the lens while viewing both the finger and the image displayed. An experiment shows the user can select the target quickly and/or accurately depending on the setting.
