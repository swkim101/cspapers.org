In this paper, we present the first polarization-guided video glass segmentation propagation solution (PGVS-Net) that can robustly and coherently propagate glass segmentation in RGB-P video sequences. By leveraging spatiotemporal polarization and color information, our method combines multi-view polarization cues and thus can alleviate the view dependence of single-input intensity variations on glass objects. We demonstrate that our model can outperform glass segmentation on RGB-only video sequences as well as produce more robust segmentation than per-frame RGB-P single-image segmentation methods. To train and validate PGVS-Net, we introduce a novel RGB-P Glass Video dataset (PGV-117) containing 117 video sequences of scenes captured with different types of camera paths, lighting conditions, dynamics, and glass types.
