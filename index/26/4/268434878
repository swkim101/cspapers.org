With the recent surge in interest in Computer Science, many challenges have emerged, ranging from faculty turnover to providing adequate resources and an inclusive environment for students throughout their academic journey. As part of our ongoing efforts, we introduce the concept of "Undergraduate Learning Assistants" (ULAs) - undergraduates carefully selected and trained by our department to serve as peer tutors for core Computer Science courses, such as CS1, CS2, and CS3. This program, driven not only by technical considerations but also by the goal of fostering a more inclusive and accessible learning community, seeks to enhance students' sense of belonging and encourage undergraduates to explore potential teaching roles. In this article, we share our experiences and present our assessments of this program.
