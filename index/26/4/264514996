Specifying designs for additive manufacturing using machine toolpaths unlocks design attributes such as surface textures and shapes determined by material and machine constrains compared to higher level representations like 3D geometries. Current methodologies for authoring these designs necessitate a high level of programming or geometric understanding, posing a significant barrier to entry and limited control. Additionally, the confinement of these workflows within computer screens obscures the comprehension of material and dimensional constraints. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the direct manipulation of machine toolpaths in Augmented Reality for clay 3D printing. Our application relies on hand interactions to edit path control points. We also provide a set of options that allow the user to control how their changes to one control points are broadcast to others to determine surface shapes and textures. By leveraging AR interactions in a physical context, our proposal aims to leverage existing physical workflows and enable practitioners to apply their understanding of material properties and visual understanding of physical 3D objects.
