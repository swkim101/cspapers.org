Parity reasoning is challenging for Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) SAT solvers. This has been observed even for simple formulas encoding two contradictory parity constraints with different variable orders (Chew and Heule 2020). We provide an analytical explanation for their hardness by showing that they require exponential resolution refutations with high probability when the variable order is chosen at random. We obtain this result by proving that these formulas, which are known to be Tseitin formulas, have Tseitin graphs of linear treewidth with high probability. Since such Tseitin formulas require exponential resolution refutations, our result follows. We generalize this argument to a new class of formulas that capture a basic form of parity reasoning involving a sum of two random parity constraints with random orders. Even when the variable order for the sum is chosen favorably, these formulas remain hard for resolution. In contrast, we prove that they have short DRAT refutations. We show experimentally that the running time of CDCL SAT solvers on both classes of formulas grows exponentially with their treewidth.
