The proliferation of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems has revolutionized translation and transcription. However, challenges persist in ensuring inclusive communication for non-native English speakers. This study quantifies the gap between accented and native English speech using Wav2Vec 2.0, a state-of-the-art transformer model. Notably, we found that accented speech exhibits significantly higher word error rates of 30-50%, in contrast to native speakersâ€™ 2-8% (Baevski et al. 2020). Our exploration extends to leveraging accessible online datasets to highlight the potential of enhancing speech recognition by fine-tuning the Wav2Vec 2.0 model. Through experimentation and analysis, we highlight the challenges with training models on accented speech. By refining models and addressing data quality issues, our work presents a pipeline for future investigations aimed at developing an integrated system capable of effectively engaging with a broader range of individuals with diverse backgrounds. Accurate recognition of accented speech is a pivotal step toward democratizing AI-driven communication products.
