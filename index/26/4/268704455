The growing demand for precise sports analysis has been explored to improve athlete performance in various sports (e.g., basketball, soccer). However, existing methods for different sports face challenges in validating strategies in environments due to simple rule-based opponents leading to performance gaps when deployed in real-world matches. In this paper, we propose the CoachAI Badminton Environment, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) environment with realistic opponents for badminton, which serves as a compelling example of a turn-based game. It supports researchers in exploring various RL algorithms with the badminton context by integrating state-of-the-art tactical-forecasting models and real badminton game records. The Badminton Benchmarks are proposed with multiple widely adopted RL algorithms to benchmark the performance of simulating matches against real players. To advance novel algorithms and developments in badminton analytics, we make our environment open-source, enabling researchers to simulate more complex badminton sports scenarios based on this foundation.
