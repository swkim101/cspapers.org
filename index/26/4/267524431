In Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), sensor data integrity is crucial since acting on malicious sensor data can cause serious consequences, given the tight coupling between cyber components and physical systems. While extensive works focus on sensor attack detection, attack diagnosis that aims to find out when the attack starts has not been well studied yet. This temporal sensor attack diagnosis problem is equally important because many recovery methods rely on the accurate determination of trustworthy historical data. To address this problem, we propose a lightweight data-driven solution to achieve real-time sensor attack diagnosis. Our novel solution consists of five modules, with the attention and diagnosis ones as the core. The attention module not only helps accurately predict future sensor measurements but also computes statistical attention scores for the diagnosis module. Based on our unique observation that the score fluctuates sharply once an attack launches, the diagnosis module determines the onset of an attack through monitoring the fluctuation. Evaluated on high-dimensional high-fidelity simulators and a testbed, our solution demonstrates robust and accurate temporal diagnosis results while incurring millisecond-level computational overhead on Raspberry Pi.
