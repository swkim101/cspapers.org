It is our great pleasure to welcome you to PLDI 2013, the 34th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation. PLDI is the premier research conference on programming languages and their implementation. This year's program includes research papers, tutorials, keynotes, a Student Research Competition (SRC), a Fun and Interesting Thoughts (FIT) session, and several co-located conferences (SAS, ISMM, and LCTES) and workshops (PASTE, PLAS, SOAP, MSPC, X10, SASB, TAPAS, SSP, PSY, and PLOOC). 
 
PLDI 2013 received a record 267 submissions, of which 46 were selected for presentation, an acceptance rate of 17%. Reviewing was "first read double-blind", meaning that author identities were withheld from reviewers until they submitted an initial review, to avoid potential bias. Together, the 31 members of the Program Committee (PC), the 66 members of the External Review Committee (ERC), and 40 additional outside reviewers wrote over 1000 reviews. Authors were given the opportunity to comment on these reviews during the January 15-18 rebuttal period. Over 1000 messages were contributed by the PC and ERC during the January 19-30 on-line discussion period. Subsequently, the program committee met for two days at the University of California, Santa Cruz, to select the final program. For submissions co-authored by a PC member, reviewing was done exclusively by the ERC and outside reviewers, and acceptance required a consensus among reviewers that the submission was in the top 80% of accepted PLDI papers from prior years.
