As compute clusters continue to grow in scale and complexity, the frequency of detected anomalies in their operation significantly increases. Timely detection of anomalous events is vital to maintain system efficiency and availability. This study presents an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for detecting anomalies in clusters at the compute node level and for providing detailed root cause analysis. We show the effectiveness of attention-based GNNs to accurately detect and localize anomalies on real-world datasets
