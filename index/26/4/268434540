Research has shown incorporating game programming and relatable topics benefits student learning and increases engagement. When enrolled in our CS-2 object-oriented analysis and design course, students complete a series of individual and group projects. We seek to gauge how incorporating these large-scale game-based programming assignments based on relatable topics affect students' learning outcomes and (self) assessment of their knowledge in terms of their confidence and capabilities. Our assessment is conducted through pre- and post-surveys that include knowledge areas such as object-oriented analysis, design and testing that map to learning outcomes of the course. We additionally assess learning outcomes through demonstrations of their implemented coding projects and feedback. We present initial findings of these results.
