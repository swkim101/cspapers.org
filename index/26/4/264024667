This talk will provide a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research and technological developments on the architectures, protocols, and applications of the wirelesspowered communication networks. The talk will start with an introduction to the circuit design of wireless-powered communication devices. Then the talk will discuss about the architecture and protocol design issues for the wireless-powered communication networks. Different wireless network architectures including single-hop networks, multihop relay networks, centralized and decentralized networks, and multi-antenna systems for RF energy harvesting and wireless energy transfer will be covered. Then the talk will delve into different physical, radio link/MAC, and network layer protocol design issues to support and utilize wireless energy harvesting and transfer capability. Next the talk will discuss about applications of energy harvesting and transfer in different wireless networking scenarios, for example, those in cellular networks, sensor networks, cognitive radio networks, mobile ad hoc and delay tolerant networks. In addition to reviewing the existing approaches for architecture, protocol, and application design in wireless powered communication networks, the talk will outline some emerging research directions in this area.
