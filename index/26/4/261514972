In the course of understanding a text, different readers use different inference strategies to guide their choice of interpretations of the events in the text. This is in contrast to previous computer models of understanding, which all use the same (single) strategy while concentrating on details of content-driven inference. The separate strategies are theorized to be composed of the same component inference processes, but of different rules for application of the processes. The use of different strategies occasionally results in different interpretations of a single text. This paper presents both the results of new experimental data and a working computer program, called STRATEGIST, that models both strategy-driven and content-driven inference behavior. The rules which make up two of these strategies are presented.
