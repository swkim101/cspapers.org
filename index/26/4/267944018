Some analyses are presented of talk between designers and a potential user in a participatory design session where a prototype application was worked with to determine future requirements. We explore the ways in which design suggestions are formulated and argued for, and how requirements emerge as a negotiated product of interaction. On this basis, we re-examine user participation in design and the relationship between protot yping and user requirements. We conclude by offering a notion (gradients of resistance in design space) to help understanding the interplay of the social and the technical in design.
