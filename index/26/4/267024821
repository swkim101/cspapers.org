Pseudo-Labeling (PL) is a critical approach in semisupervised 3D object detection (SSOD). In PL, delicately selected pseudo-labels, generated by the teacher model, are provided for the student model to supervise the semisupervised detection framework. However, such a paradigm may introduce misclassified labels or loose localized box predictions, resulting in a sub-optimal solution of detection performance. In this paper, we take PL from a noisy learning perspective: instead of directly applying vanilla pseudo-labels, we design a noise-resistant instance supervision module for better generalization. Specifically, we soften the classification targets by considering both the quality of pseudo labels and the network learning ability, and convert the regression task into a probabilistic modeling problem. Besides, considering that self-supervised learning works in the absence of labels, we incorporate dense pixel-wise feature consistency constraints to eliminate the negative impact of noisy labels. To this end, we propose NoiseDet, a simple yet effective framework for semi-supervised 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on competitive ONCE and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current semisupervised approaches by a large margin. Notably, our NoiseDet achieves state-of-the-art performance under various dataset scales on ONCE dataset. For example, NoiseDet improves its NoiseyStudent baseline from 55.5 mAP to 58.0 mAP, and further reaches 60.2 mAP with enhanced pseudo-label generation.
