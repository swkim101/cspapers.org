Cross-domain Graph Meta-learning (CGML) has shown its promise, where meta-knowledge is extracted from few-shot graph data in multiple relevant but distinct domains. However, several recent efforts assume target data available, which commonly does not established in practice. In this paper, we devise a novel Cross-domain Data Augmentation for Graph Meta-Learning (CDA-GML), which incorporates the superiorities of CGML and Data Augmentationï¼Œ has addressed intractable shortcomings of label sparsity, domain shift, and the absence of target data simultaneously. Specifically, our method simulates instance-level and task-level domain shift to alleviate the cross-domain generalization issue in conventional graph meta-learning. Experiments show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.
