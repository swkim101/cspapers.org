Even as efforts to promote K-12 CS education forge ahead, there is a growing consensus that students must also be taught artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in order to be prepared for the fast-changing world powered by AI/ML. How can ensure that we leverage learnings from two decades of CS education research and practice, and build on successes while mitigating missteps? This panel invites researchers with deep expertise in 'CSForAll' efforts for a timely discussion and sharing of valuable lessons from CS education efforts about pedagogies, attention to equity, and teacher preparation that will also benefit K-12 AI education.
