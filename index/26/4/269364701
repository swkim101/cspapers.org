Computing is critical to address some of the most pressing needs of humanity today, including climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, it is also the source of a significant and steadily increasing carbon toll, attributed in part to the exponential growth in energy-demanding workloads, such as artificial intelligence (AI). Due to the demise of Dennard scaling, we can no longer count on exponentially-improve energy efficiency of general-purpose processors. Therefore, today's operational efficiency gains rely on specialized hardware. In this talk I will discuss the promise and the perils of harnessing specialization on the road to sustainable computing.
