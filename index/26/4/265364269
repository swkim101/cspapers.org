 This paper presents a topology optimization method for rarefied gas devices. Based on the discrete velocity method, which is a conventional iterative scheme to solve the Boltzmann equation, we propose an extension to include a pseudo design density that characterizes distribution of materials in the design domain. Using a discrete version of the optimization problem, we obtain a system of discrete adjoint equations, which can be solved by recording necessary information during the discrete velocity method calculation. Design sensitivity to maximize (or minimize) an objective function can be calculated from the solution of the adjoint equations. Validity of the optimization method is demonstrated through optimization of a bent pipe.
