Radar sensors have recently been explored in the industrial and consumer Internet of Things (IoT). However, such applications often require self-sustainable or untethered operations, which are at odds with the high power consumption of radar. This paper proposes NeuroRadar, a neuromorphic radar sensor, to achieve low-power wireless sensing. NeuroRadar jointly optimizes the analog hardware and the computation model, in order to mimic the highly efficient biological sensing and neural processing system. NeuroRadar features a highly simplified radar front end, which eliminates the power-hungry components in conventional radars. It directly "encodes" ambient motion into spiking signals, which can be processed using spiking neural networks running on energy-efficient neuromorphic computing platforms. We have prototyped NeuroRadar and evaluated its performance in two use cases: gesture sensing and localization. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroRadar can achieve high sensing accuracy, at orders of magnitude lower power consumption compared with traditional radar.
