This paper discusses human semantic knowledge and processing in terms of the SCHOLAR system. In one major section we discuss the imprecision, the incompleteness, the open-endedness, and the uncertainty of people's knowledge. In the other major section we discuss strategies people use to make different types of deductive, negative, and functional inferences, and the way uncertainties combine in these inferences.
