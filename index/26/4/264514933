In this demo, we present ChromoCloth, a flexible and portable light source for reprogrammable multi-color texture on photochromic objects, whose color can be reprogrammed with external light sources. While prior work used external projectors to trigger the color change, ChromoCloth initiates the color change by covering the object. ChromoCloth consists of a textile substrate, 3D printed diffusive housing glued on top of the substrate and a flexible LED strip that is weaved through the housings.
