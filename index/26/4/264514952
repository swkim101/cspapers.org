This paper presents a system that addresses the challenges faced by novice learners by identifying and tracking their learning topics and current knowledge status, and providing a suitable, dynamically updated learning path. The system represents the dependencies between learning objects using a directed graph, and utilizes a binary questionnaire interface to continuously determine and update the user’s learning topics and knowledge status. This system enables users to clearly understand where they are in their learning process and what they should learn next, thereby improving learning efficiency, motivation, and self-efficiency. We conducted an experiment involving 9 participants, and our results implied that the proposed system is beneficial for beginners, particularly in reducing learners’ cognitive load and enhancing their motivation and self-efficacy.
