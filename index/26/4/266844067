When planning with an inaccurate dynamics model, a practical strategy is to restrict planning to regions of state-action space where the model is accurate: also known as a model precondition. Empirical real-world trajectory data is valuable for defining data-driven model preconditions regard-less of the model form (analytical, simulator, learned, etcâ€¦). However, real-world data is often expensive and dangerous to collect. In order to achieve data efficiency, this paper presents an algorithm for actively selecting trajectories to learn a model precondition for an inaccurate pre-specified dynamics model. Our proposed techniques address challenges arising from the sequential nature of trajectories, and potential benefit of prioritizing task-relevant data. The experimental analysis shows how algorithmic properties affect performance in three planning scenarios: icy gridworld, simulated plant watering, and real-world plant watering. Results demonstrate an improvement of approximately 80% after only four real-world trajectories when using our proposed techniques.
