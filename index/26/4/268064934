Survival analysis is a crucial semi-supervised task in machine learning with signifi-1 cant real-world applications, especially in healthcare. The most common approach 2 to survival analysis, Coxâ€™s partial likelihood, can be interpreted as a ranking model 3 optimized on a lower bound of the concordance index. We follow these connec-4 tions further, with listwise ranking losses that allow for a relaxation of the pairwise 5 independence assumption. Given the inherent transitivity of ranking, we explore
