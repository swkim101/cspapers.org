Current Multimedia interfaces are created primarily by intuition. Development of a method for analysis and design of Multimedia presentation interfaces is described. The study investigates task based information analysis, persistence of information, selective attention and concurrency in presentation. The method gives an agenda of issues, diagrams and techniques for specification, and guidelines for media selection and presentation scripting. Use of the method is illustrated with an example from a shipboard emergency management system.
