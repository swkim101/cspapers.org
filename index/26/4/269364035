We are at the start of the technology cycle for compute express link (CXL) memory, which is a significant opportunity and challenge for architecture, operating systems, and programming languages. The 3.0 CXL specification allows multiple, physically attached hosts to dynamically share memory. We call such a configuration a CXL pod. Pods provide an intermediate hardware configuration between a network of machines, each with their private memory, and a shared memory multiprocessor with a unified memory, accessible to all machines. This talk will discuss system support for single-node applications to attain scalable performance and high availability across a CXL pod as well as pointing out likely technical challenges for future systems. Along with the technical content, the talk categorizes computer systems research using the model of storytelling with a beginning, a middle and an end. We also examine the fascination popular culture has with personal aha moments and weigh their importance for a group working on an impending submission deadline.
