Immersion with a foreign language is key to increased motivation, satisfaction, and learning success. However, this can be hindered by anxiety and lack of access to immersive settings. LingoLand will address this by immersing people in foreign language learning environments designed to mimic real scenarios. Using generative machine learning, LingoLand presents players with personalized missions where they can freely interact with game characters, all endlessly patient and supportive of new language learners. Players receive instant feedback through a natural, voice-based interaction. Through LingoLand, players gain an understanding of different cultures while building practical language skills in a fun way.
