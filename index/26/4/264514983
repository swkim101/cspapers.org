We introduce ProactiveAgent, a proactive application that harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and personal agents to provide context-aware, personalized reminders and suggestions. By assimilating real-time environmental data, user histories, and verbal interactions, the system discerns user intent and offers tailored recommendations. The application captures visual activity and spoken interactions, integrating them into short and long-term memory storage for context-rich decision support. We propose scenarios where ProactiveAgent could be valuable: suggesting snack options depending on the time, offering culinary options based on dietary preferences, and even guiding users in their daily tasks. In envisioned use cases, ProactiveAgent could potentially track user attributes during their shopping experience, such as time spent on items and other cues, leading towards insightful product recommendations. Our work represents a potential advancement in the realm of personalized assistance, merging LLM strengths with personal agent technologies to enhance user decision-making in dynamic real-world scenarios.
