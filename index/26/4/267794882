The phrase 'paradigm shift' has largely been used to describe a dichotomy between imperative and object oriented styles of development [2]. However the changes in the nature of software products, and hence of the processes used to produce them, have been much more extensive. This richer view of the nature of computing is inherent within the experiences of students entering higher education and is at variance with the implicit model enshrined within academic computing curricula. A direct implication of this is that radical changes may be needed in computing curricula; but there are many principled and pragmatic objections.
