Our study investigates the effectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, to generate responses to student reflections. Acknowledging the intensive nature of manually handling reflections, our investigation centers on crafting prompts to automate reflection response generation. Driven by fast and meaningful response generation to student reflections, we explored both Zero-Shot learning (ZSL) and Few-Shot learning (FSL) methodologies. Our research meticulously examined the facets of each approach, highlighting the significance of consistent and meaningful responses. The Few-Shot prompting approach involves creating a fundamental prompt based on reflection questions and desired responses, striving for consistency while facing challenges such as GPT-3.5 computational time and issues related to content "hallucinations." In contrast, Zero-Shot prompting utilizes the base prompt and response without the assistance of examples. The evaluation process entails a meticulous examination of the quality of GPT-3.5 responses compared to the original student reflections. In the future, our study foresees integrating our devised prompting techniques as a resource for educators to promptly grasp students' learning concerns and issues. Despite challenges, Few-Shot prompting stands out as the more reliable and relevant approach, particularly in the context of email-based formats. As Machine Learning and AI continue to advance, overcoming challenges and adjusting to fluctuations in student emotions and content remains a pivotal factor in fully harnessing the capabilities of LLMs for automating the generation of responses to student reflections.
