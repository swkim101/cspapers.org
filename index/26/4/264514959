We are at a transformational junction in computing, in the midst of an explosion in capabilities of foundational AI models that may soon match or exceed typical human abilities for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, a milestone often termed Artifcial General Intelligence (AGI). Achieving AGI (or even closely approaching it) will transform computing, with ramifcations permeating through all aspects of society. This is a critical moment not only for Machine Learning research, but also for the feld of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In this talk, I will defne what I mean (and what I do NOT mean) by “AGI” (and related concepts, like superintelligence), and my journey from AGI skeptic to believing we are within fve to ten years of reaching this milestone. I will then discuss how this new era of computing necessitates a new sociotechnical research agenda on methods and interfaces for studying and interacting with AGI. For instance, how can we extend status quo design and prototyping methods for envisioning novel experiences at the limits of our current imaginations? What novel interaction modalities might AGI (or superintelligence) enable (e.g., “ESP”)? How do we create interfaces for computing systems that may intentionally or unintentionally
