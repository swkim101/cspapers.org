With the widespread adoption of IoT, wearable devices, and sensors, time series data from human subjects are significantly increasing in the healthcare domain. Due to the laborious nature of manual annotation in time series data and the requirement for human experts, self-supervised learning methods are attempted to alleviate the limited label situations. While existing self-supervised methods have been successful to achieve comparable performance to the fully supervised methods, there are still some limitations that need to be addressed, considering the nature of time series data from human subjects: In real-world clinical settings, data labels (e.g., sleep stages) are usually annotated by subject-level, and there is a substantial variation in patterns between subjects. Thus, a model should be designed to deal with not only the label scarcity but also subject-wise nature of data to ensure high performance in real-world scenarios. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework for human subject time series data: Subject-Aware Time Series Clustering (SA-TSC). In the unsupervised representation learning phase, SA-TSC adopts a subject-wise learning strategy rather than instance-wise learning which randomly samples data instances from different subjects within the batch during training. Specifically, we generate subject-graphs with our graph construction method based on Gumbel-Softmax and perform graph spectral clustering on each subject-graph. In addition, we utilize graph neural networks to capture dependencies between channels and design our own graph learning module motivated from self-supervised loss. Experimental results show the outstanding performance of our SA-TSC with the limited & subject-wise label setting, leading to its high applicability to the healthcare industry.
