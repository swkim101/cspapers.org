X-ray, known for its ability to reveal internal structures of objects, is expected to provide richer information for 3D reconstruction than visible light. Yet, existing NeRF algorithms overlook this nature of X-ray, leading to their limitations in capturing structural contents of imaged objects. In this paper, we propose a framework, Structure-Aware X-ray Neural Radiodensity Fields (SAX-NeRF), for sparse-view X-ray 3D reconstruction. Firstly, we design a Line Segment-based Transformer (Lineformer) as the backbone of SAX-NeRF. Linefomer captures internal structures of objects in 3D space by modeling the dependencies within each line segment of an X-ray. Secondly, we present a Masked Local-Global (MLG) ray sampling strategy to extract contextual and geometric information in 2D projection. Plus, we collect a larger-scale dataset X3D covering wider X-ray applications. Experiments on X3D show that SAX-NeRF surpasses previous NeRF-based methods by 12.56 and 2.49 dB on novel view synthesis and CT reconstruction. https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/SAX-NeRF
