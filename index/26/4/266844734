To address the limitations of traffic prediction from location-bound detectors, we present Geographical Cellular Traffic (GCT) flow, a novel data source that leverages the extensive coverage of cellular traffic to capture mobility patterns. Our extensive analysis validates its potential for transportation. Focusing on vehicle-related GCT flow prediction, we propose a graph neural network that integrates multivariate, temporal, and spatial facets for improved accuracy. Experiments reveal our model's superiority over baselines, especially in long-term predictions. We also highlight the potential for GCT flow integration into transportation systems.
