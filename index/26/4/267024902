Recent studies have substantiated that machine learning algorithms including convolutional neural networks often suffer from unreliable generalizations when there is a significant gap between the source and target data distributions. To mitigate this issue, a predetermined distribution shift has been addressed independently (e.g., single domain generalization, de-biasing). However, a distribution mismatch cannot be clearly estimated because the target distribution is unknown at training. Therefore, a conservative approach robust on unexpected diverse distributions is more desirable in practice. Our work starts from a motivation to allow adaptive inference once we know the target, since it is accessible only at testing. Instead of assuming and fixing the target distribution at training, our proposed approach allows adjusting the feature space the model refers to at every prediction, i.e., instance-wise adaptive inference. The extensive evaluation demonstrates our method is effective for generalization on diverse distributions.
