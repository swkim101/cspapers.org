This paper addresses the weighted vertex coloring problem (WVCP) which is an NP-hard variant of the graph coloring problem with various applications.

Given a vertex-weighted graph, the problem consists of partitioning vertices in independent sets (colors) so as to minimize the sum of the maximum weights of the colors.

We first present an iterative procedure to reduce the size of WVCP instances and prove new upper bounds on the objective value and the number of colors.

Alternative constraint programming models are then introduced which rely on primal and dual encodings of the problem and use symmetry breaking constraints.

A large number of experiments are conducted on benchmark instances.

We analyze the impact of using specific bounds to reduce the search space and speed up the exact resolution of instances.

New optimality proofs are reported for some benchmark instances.
