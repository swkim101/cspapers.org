Online sentiment analysis has emerged as a crucial component in numerous data-driven applications, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and online reputation management. Despite their importance, current methodologies falter in effectively managing the continuously evolving nature of data streams, largely due to their reliance on substantial, pre-existing labelled datasets. This paper presents SentiStream , a novel co-training framework specifically designed for efficient sentiment analysis within dynamic data streams. Comprising unsupervised, semi-supervised, and stream merge modules, SentiStream guarantees constant adaptability to evolving data landscapes. This research delves into the continuous adaptation of language models for online sentiment analysis, focusing on real-world applications. Experimental evaluations using data streams derived from five benchmark sentiment analysis datasets confirm that our proposed methodology surpasses existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency 1 .
