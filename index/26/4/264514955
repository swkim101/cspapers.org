Writing an academic paper requires significant time and effort to find, read, and organize many related papers, which is a complex knowledge task. We present a novel interactive system that allows users to perform these tasks quickly and easily on the 2D canvas with pen and multitouch inputs. Our system turns usersâ€™ sketches and handwriting into a node-link diagram of papers and citations that users can iteratively expand in situ toward constructing a coherent narrative when writing Related Work sections.
