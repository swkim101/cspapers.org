Mindfulness meditation has vast benefits, yet is challenging for many. We designed a novel targeted warmth somaesthetic wearable and evaluated how the thermal sensation is perceived during meditation. In a qualitative study, twenty participants explored the wearable during meditation. Findings reveal participantsâ€™ rich experiences, sensations, and feelings. They perceived the technology as an appropriate tool for self-exploration. Even when participants initially felt the wearable was distracting their meditation process, they easily learned how to leverage it in their introspection process. We report on four potential roles for warmth technology: functional (pulling focal of attention), behavioral (motivating to "get back to the practice"), emotional (comforting during the lonely process), and therapeutic feelings. We conclude with design guidelines, highlighting that warmth is a promising technology for meditation if designed to encourage self-exploration of body sensations and emotions while not compromising the natural meditation practice.
