We describe our methodology for classifying ASL (American Sign Language) gestures. Rather than operate directly on raw images of hand gestures, we extract coor-dinates and render wireframes from individual images to construct a curated training dataset. This dataset is then used in a classifier that is memory efficient and provides effective performance (94% accuracy). Because we con-struct wireframes that contain information about several angles in the joints that comprise hands, our methodolo-gy is amenable to training those interested in learning ASL by identifying targeted errors in their hand gestures.
