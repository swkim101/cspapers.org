In this work, we introduce Ducho 2.0, the latest stable version of our framework. Differently from Ducho, Ducho 2.0 offers a more personalized user experience with the definition and import of custom extraction models fine-tuned on specific tasks and datasets. Moreover, the new version is capable of extracting and processing features through multimodal-by-design large models. Notably, all these new features are supported by optimized data loading and storing to the local memory. To showcase the capabilities of Ducho 2.0, we demonstrate a complete multimodal recommendation pipeline, from the extraction/processing to the final recommendation. The idea is to provide practitioners and experienced scholars with a ready-to-use tool that, put on top of any multimodal recommendation framework, may permit them to run extensive benchmarking analyses.
