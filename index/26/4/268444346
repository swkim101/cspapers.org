There is a growing movement in the education community to re-evaluate grading practices and find ways of evaluating students that are more flexible, equitable, and focused on student growth. A wide variety of alternative evaluation systems have been developed, including mastery grading, specifications grading, contract grading and ungrading. In this work, we perform a systematic literature search to find studies of alternative evaluation models in computer science education. A total of 37 papers were analyzed and coded on three metrics: Intervention, Evaluation, and Population. This map represents a tool for educators to find and evaluate research on alternative evaluation systems, a resource for researchers to identify areas of future research, and a foundation for a future detailed literature analysis.
