In this session, we aim to foster a community of computer science faculty across many primarily undergraduate institutions. We will foster an inclusive environment through activities that allow for multiple forms of engagement (e.g. shows of hands, small group introductions, and full group discussion). We will facilitate discussions about ways computer science is changing at PUIs and brainstorm ways that our community can be sustained outside of the SIGCSE TS.
