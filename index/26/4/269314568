Graph processing is widely used in cloud services; however, current frameworks face challenges in efficiency and cost-effectiveness when deployed under the Infrastructure-as-a-Service model due to its limited elasticity. In this paper, we present FaaSGraph, a serverless-native graph computing scheme that enables efficient and economical graph processing through the co-design of graph processing frameworks and serverless computing systems. Specifically, we design a data-centric serverless execution model to efficiently power heavy computing tasks. Furthermore, we carefully design a graph processing paradigm to seamlessly cooperate with the data-centric model. Our experiments show that FaaS-Graph improves end-to-end performance by up to 8.3X and reduces memory usage by up to 52.4% compared to state-of-the-art IaaS-based methods. Moreover, FaaSGraph delivers steady 99%-ile performance in highly fluctuated workloads and reduces monetary cost by 85.7%.
