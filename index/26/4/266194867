Analytical expressions are derived for actuator demands in quadrupedal locomotion of constant speed and height by using a reduction from a trot/ pace 6-bar model to a single-legged model and employing two widely used two-segmented leg architectures, the serial and the parallel. A method is developed that outputs optimal gait characteristics and leg designs for a robot to move with maximum efficiency or speed. Also, generic guidelines are presented, which answer questions such as: which speed should be selected for maximum efficiency, or which is the optimal leg architecture (serial/ parallel) and leg length for maximum efficiency or speed.
