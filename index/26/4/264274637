It is our great pleasure to welcome you to ACM Networking and Digital Object Memories for Internet of Things (NOMe-IoT), in conjunction with ACM UBICOMP 2011, and to the historical and beautiful city, Beijing, China. 
 
NOMe-IoT seeks to provide a foundation for discussing these challenges and to lay out the future roadmap for IoT research. It is also the successor of two successful workshop series, ACM DIPSO/DOMe-IoT 2007-2010, in conjunction with UbiComp 2007-2010. By bringing in several system and networking experts from academia and industry, this year's event extends the workshop's scope and aims to provide a forum to discuss and exchange ideas on recent research work, point out the directions for future research, and seek collaboration opportunities on all aspects of the IoT Systems. 
 
This year's NOMe-IoT features a very strong technical program, after carefully evaluating all submitted papers, considering the merits of each through detailed reviews, and selecting a technical program of the highest caliber. We owe a great deal of thanks to the program committee members and the reviewers. The success of this year's NOMe-IoT would not be possible without their hard work, and their professional contributions maintain the high standards of this year's technical program. We are also grateful to all the Organizing Committee members for their helpful advices and constant support.
