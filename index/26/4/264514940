In this demonstration, we showcase a suite of 3D printed magnetophoretic displays using the techniques proposed in [8]. These examples include a printed Stanford bunny with customizable appearances, a small espresso mug that can double as a post-it note surface, a board game figurine with a computationally updated display, and a collection of flexible wearable accessories with editable visuals. We will demonstrate the 3D printer design as well as the primary process of printing these magnetophoretic displays.
