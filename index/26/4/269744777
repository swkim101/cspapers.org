Tactile interfaces such as embossment facilitate information transfer through touch in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Traditional embossing methods, while enabling the creation of intricate patterns, face limitations due to mold reliance and material thickness restrictions, hindering bespoke embossment creation. In this study, we propose High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) as an alternative technique to produce tailored embossed designs on acrylic without the need for traditional molds. We uncover specific HIFU parameters, such as amplitude, irradiation time, and distance that directly impact essential qualities of embossment including embossment height, transparency, and line generation. Additionally, the capability of embossing without the use of molds expands the applications for quick prototyping and customization of embossed designs within HCI. Furthermore, we introduce a user interface developed to streamline the design and application of customizable tactile graphics using HIFU, aimed at non-expert users. Preliminary user studies reveal positive feedback on the interfaceâ€™s intuitiveness and the quality of the HIFU embossment. Our study indicates that HIFU embossment presents a viable approach for creating embossed features in interactive systems, with the potential to offer methods for personal customization in the design of tactile materials.
