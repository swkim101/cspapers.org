Blockchain is a decentralized distributed system on which a large number of financial applications have been deployed. The consensus process in it plays an important role, which guarantees that legal transactions on the chain can be executed and recorded fairly and consistently. However, because of Consensus Failure Bugs (CFBs), many blockchain systems do not provide even this basic guarantee. The validity and consistency of blockchain systems rely on the soundness of complex consensus logic implementation. Any bugs which cause the blockchain consensus failure can be crucial.In this work, we introduce Tyr, an open-source tool for detecting CFBs in blockchain systems with a large number of abnormal divergent consensus behaviors. First, we design four oracle detectors to monitor the behaviors of nodes and analyze the violation of consensus properties. To trigger these oracles effectively, Tyr harnesses a behavior divergent model to constantly generate consensus messages and make nodes behave as differently as possible. We implemented and evaluated Tyr on six widely used commercial blockchain consensus systems, including IBM Fabric, WeBank FISCO-BCOS, ConsenSys Quorum, Facebook Diem, Go-Ethereum, and EOS. Compared with the state-of-the-art tools Peach, Fluffy, and Twins, Tyr covers 27.3%, 228.2%, and 297.1% more branches, respectively. Furthermore, Tyr has detected 20 serious previously unknown vulnerabilities, all of which have been repaired by the corresponding maintainers.
