N:m sparsity has received increasing attention due to its remarkable performance and latency trade-off compared with structured and unstructured sparsity. How-ever, existing N:m sparsity methods do not differentiate the relative importance of weights among blocks and leave important weights underappreciated. Besides, they di-rectly apply N:m sparsity to the whole network, which will cause severe information loss. Thus, they are still sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective Multi-Axis Query methodology, dubbed as MaxQ, to rectify these problems. During the training, MaxQ employs a dynamic approach to generate soft N:m masks, considering the weight importance across multiple axes. This method enhances the weights with more importance and ensures more effective updates. Meanwhile, a spar-sity strategy that gradually increases the percentage of N:m weight blocks is applied, which allows the network to heal from the pruning-induced damage progressively. During the runtime, the N:m soft masks can be precom-puted as constants and folded into weights without causing any distortion to the sparse pattern and incurring ad-ditional computational overhead. Comprehensive experi-ments demonstrate that MaxQ achieves consistent improve-ments across diverse CNN architectures in various com-puter vision tasks, including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. For ResNet50 with 1:16 sparse pattern, MaxQ can achieve 74.6% top-1 ac-curacy on ImageNet and improve by over 2.8% over the state-of-the-art.
