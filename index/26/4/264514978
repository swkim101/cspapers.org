This project proposes a 4-frame manga drawing support system that assists users in creating drawings. The proposed system recognizes each frame of an unfinished manga drawn by a user and proposes successive frames, considering the content recognized till then, e.g., the storyline, frame composition, and punchline. The system updates the proposal as the manga drawing proceeds. The proposed system comprises four modules for 1) recognizing the user's drawings, 2) generating four sentences that describe the storyline, 3) generating images, each of which corresponds to a manga frame from the above sentences, and 4) choosing the user-preferred manga candidate from a number of potential choices. The proposed system does not require AI to generate the 4-frame manga; instead, the user draws the 4-frame manga with the help of the system. In other words, the user decides whether to accept or reject the AI's proposal.
