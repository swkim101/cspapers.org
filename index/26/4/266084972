The chiplet architecture is one of the emerging methodologies and is believed to be scalable and economical. However, most current multi-chiplet systems are based on one uniform die-to-die interface, which severely limits flexibility. First, any interface has specific applicable workloads/scales/scenarios; therefore, chiplets with a uniform interface cannot be freely reused in different systems. Second, since modern computing systems must deal with complex and mixed tasks, the uniform interface does not cope well with flexible workloads, especially for large-scale systems.To deal with these inflexibilities, we propose the idea of Heterogeneous Interface (Hetero-IF), which allows chiplets to use two different interfaces (parallel IF and serial IF) at the same time. Hetero-IF can combine the advantages of different interfaces and cover up the disadvantages of each, thus improving flexibility and performance. However, adopting hetero-IF-based multi-chiplet interconnection systems still faces many challenges. The microarchitecture, scheduling, interconnection, and routing issues have not been discussed so far.In this paper, we put forward two typical hetero-IF implementations: Hetero-PHY and Hetero-Channel. Based on these two implementations, detailed usages and scheduling methods are discussed. We also present the interconnection methods for hetero-IF-based multi-chiplet systems and show how to apply deadlock-free routing algorithms. Extensive evaluations, including simulation and circuit verification, are made on these systems. The experiment results show that hetero-IF provides more flexible interconnection and scheduling possibilities to achieve better performance and energy metrics under various workloads.CCS CONCEPTS• Networks → Physical links; Network architectures; • Computer systems organization → Architectures.
