A novel virtual reality (VR) ride consisting of a head-mounted display (HMD) and an electric wheelchair was developed for a virtual roller coaster experience. The VR ride was integrated with an electric wheeled ramp to amplify the perception of virtual ascent and descent. The ascending and descending motion on a slope was replicated continuously with varying curvatures. The system features an electric wheelchair and two motorized ramps with a fixed 10-degree angle, which the wheelchair can drive on and off to simulate ascending and descending in VR. Moreover, by adjusting the relative speed and position of the wheelchair and ramps, we can simulate pitch angle curvature in VR. We are investigating several methods for providing multiple ascent and descent experiences, and introduce one of them.
