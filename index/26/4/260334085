Accurate shape reconstruction of transparent ob-jects is a challenging task due to their non-Lambertian surfaces and yet necessary for robots for accurate pose perception and safe manipulation. As vision-based sensing can produce erroneous measurements for transparent objects, the tactile modality is not sensitive to object transparency and can be used for reconstructing the object's shape. We propose AC-TOR, a novel framework for ACtive tactile-based category-level Transparent Object Reconstruction. ACTOR leverages large datasets of synthetic object with our proposed self-supervised learning approach for object shape reconstruction as the collection of real-world tactile data is prohibitively expensive. ACTOR can be used during inference with tactile data from category-level unknown transparent objects for reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an active-tactile object exploration strategy as probing every part of the object surface can be sample inefficient. We also demonstrate tactile-based category-level object pose estimation task using ACTOR. We perform an extensive evaluation of our proposed methodology with real-world robotic experiments with comprehensive comparison studies with state-of-the-art approaches. Our proposed method outperforms these approaches in terms of tactile-based object reconstruction and object pose estimation.
