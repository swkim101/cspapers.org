 It is well understood that printing orientation plays a critical role in the quality of a final printed product and the total print time. In five-axis 3D printers, the added rotations can further reduce time and material, but initial orientation is still a significant factor. The build orientation is a critical factor in the printed partâ€™s surface quality and the need for additional material as support structures. In this research, we develop build orientation sampling techniques and evaluate them based on their computational cost and accuracy. The evaluation of a build orientation is based on three criteria: the volume of the added support structure, the surface quality, and the stability of the part while rotating and tilting on the printing platform. The creation of the support structure uses Boolean polygon operations to compute the amount of material required as support. The surface quality and stability of a part at a given orientation are also calculated. Our proposed optimization scheme was tested on seven 3D parts and was found to only require a small number of evaluations to achieve a Pareto-optimal set of build orientations. This method can be utilized as a first step in planning the fabrication of parts printed on five-axis printers.
