This paper describes exploration of uses of a computational storytelling environment on the Car- diology Unit of the ChildrenHospital in Boston, during the summer of 1997. Young cardiac patients ranging from age 7 to 16 used the SAGE environment to tell personal stories and cre- ate interactive characters, as a way of coping with cardiac illness, hospitalizations, and invasive medical procedures. This pilot study is part of a larger collaborative effort between Children Â´ Hospital and MERL - A Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory, to develop a web-based appli- cation, the Experience Journal, to assist patients and their families in dealing with serious medical illness. The focus of the paper is on young patientsof SAGE, on SAGEaffordances in the context of the hospital, and on design recommendations for the development of future computa- tional play kits for expressing and exchanging feelings and ideas. Preliminary analysis of young patientsindicates that children used different modes of interaction-direct, mediated, and differed-, depending upon what personae the narrator chooses to take on. These modes seem to vary with the mindset and health condition of the child.
