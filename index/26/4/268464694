In this work, we present the development of an automated extension tool that supports flexible extension policies. Students interact with a wide range of extension policies in similar ways; in particular, some students repeatedly request multi-day long extensions. When scaled to courses with hundreds or potentially thousands of students, course staff time is the limiting resource preventing adequate student support. We present a tool to help automate a range of extension processes. The use of this tool should reduce staff load while increasing individualized student support, through email communication and consequent recovery of student agency. Our early research questions are: Does the extension tool reduce barriers and stigma around asking for assistance? Does the tool lessen the wait time between requesting and receiving an extension, and how does the tool improve students' learning experience in the course? These questions will help inform us about how an automated tool for flexible extensions helps support growing course sizes and students who may not otherwise receive the support they need for their success and well-being in the course.
