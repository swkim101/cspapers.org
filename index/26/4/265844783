A method and apparatus for producing prestressed coil springs whereby the wire is fed about a rotating spindle and taken up or drawn in with a predetermined spacing from the front end of the coils and guided to a point ahead of the front end of the coils in the form of an expanded helix. A stop block is movable along the spindle, fixed against rotation and provided with a plurality of wire grooves at different angles of inclination so that the wire passes beneath the already formed coil as it passes through one of the grooves to produce the desired stress.
