Video-based surgical coaching involves mentors reviewing surgery footage with trainees. Although effective, its use is sporadic due to time constraints. We propose AI-augmented coaching through SketchSearch, allowing experts to create exercises with automated feedback in surgery videos for self-learning. Surgeons often seek specific scenes for teaching, relying on visual cues. SketchSearch simplifies this through a three-step process: key frame extraction, template reference maps creation via image segmentation, and fine-tuning for frame retrieval.
