In computer science undergraduate programs, the first course often focuses on elementary computer programming. However, students' backgrounds can be diverse, leading to challenges in understanding the course material. We discuss our initial steps to improve elementary programming instruction by using instructional videos. A team of three content creators developed a series of instructional videos, covering forty different programming skills. These videos span various topics, from creating and running basic Python programs to understanding and creating functions. To assist elementary programming students, we plan to integrate these videos with PLACEments, an adaptive assessment and remediation system designed to help students bridge knowledge gaps. If a student answers a question incorrectly, a relevant video is provided as support. The three content creators peer reviewed the others' instructional videos according to an educational video assessment framework. These results were also standardized through a z-score to account for any reviewer biases. The initial results from the peer review are promising. However, more information will be collected as the videos are deployed through PLACEments and tested by students currently taking an elementary programming course.
