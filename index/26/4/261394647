As the basic element of graph-structured data, node has been recognized as the main object of study in graph representation learning. A single node intuitively has multiple node-centered subgraphs from the whole graph (e.g., one person in a social network has multiple social circles based on his different relationships). We study this intuition under the framework of graph contrastive learning, and propose a multiple node-centered subgraphs contrastive representation learning method to learn node representation on graphs in a self-supervised way. Specifically, we carefully design a series of node-centered regional subgraphs of the central node. Then, the mutual information between different subgraphs of the same node is maximized by contrastive loss. Experiments on various real-world datasets and different downstream tasks demonstrate that our model has achieved state-of-the-art results.
