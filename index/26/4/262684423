Vicki L. Almstrum A key challenge that prevents many computing educators from attempting CSE research is isolation. Isolation can result from existing in an atmosphere where colleagues regularly convey the attitude that educational research is not real research. Isolation can come from uncertainty about where to begin digging into the literature from computer science education as well as from a wide variety of related and supporting fields. Isolation can be like a void into which ideas for research questions, designs, and analyses simply disappear without the benefit of collegial discussion and brainstorming. A sense of isolation can emerge from frustrating struggles while dealing with special situations, such as small sample sizes, the need for specialized methods, or difficulty in locating or creating appropriate instruments.
