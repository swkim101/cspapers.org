This paper introduces "Projectoroid," a mobile robot equipped with a projector that facilitates mobile spatial augmented reality (SAR) displays, and examines the potential of SAR deployment via a mobile robot by comparing and evaluating content display methods. Projectoroid converts its real-world position and orientation calculated by its internal sensors into the position and orientation of a camera in virtual space. Consequently, it can project the image captured within the virtual space onto the real-world floor. Thus, Projectoroid is capable of revealing a segment of an expansive virtual space into the real world based on its position and orientation. In this paper, we refer to the degree to which people recognize the correspondence between the virtual space and the real world from the projected image as the "sense of reveal." We believe that an increase in the sense of reveal would heighten peopleâ€™s interest in the content from the virtual world. The results of our user study show that the sense of reveal is amplified as the outline of the projected image becomes more circular.
