Extended Reality (XR) allows in-situ previewing of designs to be manufactured through Personal Fabrication (PF). These in-situ interactions exhibit advantages for PF, like incorporating the environment into the design process. However, design-for-fabrication in XR often happens through either highly complex 3D-modeling or is reduced to rudimentary adaptations of crowd-sourced models. We present pARam, a tool combining parametric designs (PDs) and XR, enabling in-situ configuration of artifacts for PF. In contrast to modeling- or search-focused approaches, pARam supports customization through embodied and practical inputs (e.g., gestures, recommendations) and evaluation (e.g., lighting estimation) without demanding complex 3D-modeling skills. We implemented pARam for HoloLens 2 and evaluated it (n = 20), comparing XR and desktop conditions. Users succeeded in choosing context-related parameters and took their environment into account for their configuration using pARam. We reflect on the prospects and challenges of PDs in XR to streamline complex design methods for PF while retaining suitable expressivity.
