Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated vulnerabilities to adversarial examples, which raises concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. While the majority of existing methods generate adversarial examples by making small modifications to the entire image, recent research has proposed a practical alternative known as adversarial patches. Adversarial patches have shown to be highly effective in causing DNNs to misclassify by distorting a localized area (patch) of the image. However, existing methods often produce clearly visible distortions since they do not consider the visibility of the patch. To address this, we propose a novel method for constructing adversarial patches that approximates the appearance of the area it covers. We achieve this by using a set of semi-transparent, RGB-valued circles, drawing inspiration from the computational art community. We utilize an evolutionary strategy to optimize the properties of each shape, and employ a simulated annealing approach to optimize the patchâ€™s location. Our approach achieves better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet DNN classifiers while achieving a lower l 2 distance from the original image. By minimizing the visibility of the patch, this work further highlights the vulnerabilities of DNNs to adversarial patches.
