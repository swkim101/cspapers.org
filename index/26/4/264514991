The web is now rich with information and functionality, allowing users to only use portions of webpages to complete their tasks. However, current desktop interfaces only allow us to manage entire windows, leading to inefficient use of screen space and suboptimal workflows. We present Masonview, a content-driven viewport management system that provides mechanisms to detach desired elements from their webpages as viewports and compose these views into UI mashups with viewplates. We demonstrate how these mechanisms enable more free-form organization and management of content.
