The pivotal role of white-box testing with respect to software quality assurance, necessitates dissemination of education materials related to white-box testing in the course curriculum. In this poster, we describe our experiences in conducting an authentic learning-based exercise related to white-box testing. From a conducted survey with 124 students, we observe the authentic learning-based exercise to be helpful for students to learn about white-box testing.
