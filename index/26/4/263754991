A fascinating and largely unheralded development accompanying the rise of computer science and computer technology has been the increasing applicability of the two most fervently “pure” branches of mathematics: number theory and mathematical logic. Unexpected mere decades ago are present opportunities for number theorists and logicians in this most applied of the mathematical sciences. Indeed, advertisements for both academic and industrial positions in the ACM Communications, for example, call for expertise in these fields. Martin Davis expresses the surprise at this new status of mathematical logic:
