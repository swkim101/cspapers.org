The equivalent kernel [1] is a way of understanding how Gaussian process regression works for large sample sizes based on a continuum limit. In this paper we show (1) how to approximate the equivalent kernel of the widely-used squared exponential (or Gaussian) kernel and related kernels, and (2) how analysis using the equivalent kernel helps to understand the learning curves for Gaussian processes.
