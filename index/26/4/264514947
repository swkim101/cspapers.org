We propose a novel interactive system for drawing cars in perspective. Our harmonious set of pen and touch interactions based on traditional tools and techniques can help car designers naturally transition from 2D sketching to 3D sketching and allow them to sketch cars in 3D intuitively and iteratively. The pilot test shows that our system is easy to learn and use.
