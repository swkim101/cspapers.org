PCB debugging can be tricky. For example, if we want to use an oscilloscope to measure signals of interest in the PCB, we need to locate them in the schematic and select the appropriate pad for each signal on the PCB layout on which to put the oscilloscope probes. This process hence requires frequent switching between the schematics and the PCB layouts. Moreover, our hands may not be precise and stable enough to accurately place the probes on the pads without causing short circuits with adjacent pins, which can lead to further issues. Additionally, if multiple signals need to be tested, two hands will not be enough. Probe hook clips can be used, but this often necessitates the use of extension wires that must be soldered onto the targeted pads. To streamline the debugging process, we introduce the PCBPT (PCB Probing Tester). This innovative solution seamlessly bridges from schematic to test equipment by using a robotic probe and actuated board holder. By selecting signals of interest directly from a GUI, users can instantly monitor the output on an oscilloscope, significantly improving the effectiveness of the debugging process.
