Decision trees are widely used for addressing learning tasks involving tabular data. Yet, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present Tree Test Time Simulation (TTTS), a novel inference-time methodology that incorporates Monte Carlo simulations into decision trees to enhance their robustness. TTTS introduces a probabilistic modification to the decision path, without altering the underlying tree structure. Our comprehensive empirical analysis of 50 datasets yields promising results. Without the presence of any attacks, TTTS has successfully improved model performance from an AUC of 0.714 to 0.773. Under the challenging conditions of white-box attacks, TTTS demonstrated its robustness by boosting performance from an AUC of 0.337 to 0.680. Even when subjected to black-box attacks, TTTS maintains high accuracy and enhances the model's performance from an AUC of 0.628 to 0.719. Compared to defenses such as Feature Squeezing, TTTS proves to be much more effective. We also found that TTTS exhibits similar robustness in decision forest settings across different attacks.
