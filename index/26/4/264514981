Recent web-based brainstorming tools utilize pre-trained language models to support ideation. However, body movements such as walking and arm motion, which are known to enhance creativity, are generally limited in web-based brainstorming. Thus, we propose “Augmented Post-it,” a novel augmented reality (AR) interaction system that enables body movements while brainstorming using a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT). With Augmented Post-it, ideas uttered by users are structured via GPT and extended into a spatial representation that encourages divergent thinking. This study contributes to future GPT-based AR brainstorming by extending the thinking ability of users in ways that engage their body movements to enhance creativity.
