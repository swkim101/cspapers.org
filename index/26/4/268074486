We consider the problem of planning with arithmetic

 theories, and focus on generating optimal 

 plans for numeric domains with constant and state-dependent action costs. 

 Solving these problems efficiently requires a seamless integration between

 propositional and numeric reasoning. We propose a novel approach that leverages Optimization 

 Modulo Theories (OMT) solvers to implement a domain-independent optimal 

 theory-planner. We present a new encoding

 for optimal planning in this setting and 

 we evaluate our approach using well-known, as well as new, numeric benchmarks.
