As a traditional Chinese theatrical performance, the Peking Opera is a world intangible cultural heritage. However, appreciating and understanding the traditional arts of Peking Opera requires rich life experience and knowledge about traditional Chinese culture, which has led to its lack of recognition and support from younger Chinese audiences. To expand the audience for the traditional Chinese cultural heritage of Peking Opera and stimulate young people’s interest in learning about this art form, we introduce “OperAR” as an augmented reality game system that teaches children about the history and culture of the Peking Opera and how to perform Peking Opera using a cartoon virtual agent and a set of physical cards based on Peking Opera costumes. The pilot study results show the potential benefits of OperAR in enhancing children’s interactive experiences in virtual scenarios in addition to stimulating their interest in learning about Peking Opera.
