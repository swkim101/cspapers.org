We propose SuperMagneShape, a method for creating interactive applications using MagneShape. MagneShape is a magnetically-actuated pin-based shape-changing display. It utilizes the forces produced by its magnetic components to control the levitation heights of passive magnetic pins, eliminating the need for an electric actuator for each pin. Although the MagneShape pin array is simple and inexpensive, rapid change of the magnetic pattern that drives the device is challenging. Proper display of shapes and characters requires appropriate magnetic patterns generated by a dedicated pattern generator and a time-consuming magnetization process. To minimize the complexity of the process, as well as the time taken between input and output, we designed a high-density pin array and a magnetic belt conveyor system. When the user handwrites a magnetic pattern in the shape of the letter "A" on a section of the magnetic belt, the imprinted magnetic pattern is conveyed under the high-density pin array and causes the pin array to display an "A" shape moving along it. We have also implemented games where the hand-drawn shape presents physical action as it is conveyed under the pin array.
