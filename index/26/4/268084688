Query suggestions help users refine their queries after they input an initial query. We consider the task of generating query suggestions that are personalized and diversified. We propose a personalized query suggestion diversification model (PQSD), where a user's long-term search behavior is injected into a basic greedy query suggestion diversification model (G-QSD) that considers a user's search context in their current session. Query aspects are identified through clicked documents based on the Open Directory Project (ODP). We quantify the improvement of PQSD over a state-of-the-art baseline using the AOL query log and show that it beats the baseline in terms of metrics used in query suggestion ranking and diversification. The experimental results show that PQSD achieves the best performance when only queries with clicked documents are taken as search context rather than all queries.
