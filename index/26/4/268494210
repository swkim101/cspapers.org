We have developed a visualization tool that displays the run-time memory state of an executing program in a fashion similar to Python Tutor as an extension to the popular VS Code IDE. Our approach combines the benefits of a diagrammatic visualization emphasizing the stack frame and heap memory model adopted by Python Tutor with a professional and extensible IDE that has made inroads into the educational community. Moreover, our tool leverages the Debug Adapter Protocol adopted by Visual Studio Code, allowing it to be used for any language supported by the IDE with minimal configuration. This open-source tool is developed under the MIT license and hosted at https://github.com/alt-cs-lab/pedagogical-vscode.
