In formal argumentation, a distinction can be made between extension-based semantics, where sets of

arguments are either (jointly) accepted or not, and ranking-based semantics, where grades of accept-

ability are assigned to arguments. Another important distinction is that between abstract approaches,

that abstract away from the content of arguments, and structured approaches, that specify a method

of constructing argument graphs on the basis of a knowledge base. While ranking-based semantics

have been extensively applied to abstract argumentation, few work has been done on ranking-based

semantics for structured argumentation. In this paper, we make a systematic investigation into the be-

haviour of ranking-based semantics applied to existing formalisms for structured argumentation. We

show that a wide class of ranking-based semantics gives rise to so-called culpability measures, and

are relatively robust to specific choices in argument construction methods.
