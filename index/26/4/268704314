The immense parameter space of Large Language Models (LLMs) endows them with superior knowledge retention capabilities, allowing them to excel in a variety of natural language processing tasks. However, it also instigates difficulties in consistently tuning LMs to incorporate the most recent knowledge, which may further lead LMs to produce inaccurate and fabricated content. 
To alleviate this issue, we propose a knowledge metabolism framework for LLMs. This framework proactively sustains the credibility of knowledge through an auxiliary external memory component and directly delivers pertinent knowledge for LM inference, thereby suppressing hallucinations caused by obsolete internal knowledge during the LM inference process.
Benchmark experiments demonstrate DynaMind's effectiveness in overcoming this challenge. The code and demo of DynaMind are available at: https://github.com/Elfsong/DynaMind.
