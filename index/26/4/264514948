LLMs have capabilities to understand natural language and code, which makes them a great candidate for user-driven customization of webpages. A process that focuses on natural language can be useful for those who are less technologically literate. In this paper, we explore the potential of using LLMs to modify webpages, and what kinds of opportunities and challenges that come with it. We observe that specific prompts referring to color or targeted components can succeed, vague requests and any complex website tend to perform poorly.
