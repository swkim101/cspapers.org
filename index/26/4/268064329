Decision trees are regarded for high interpretability arising from their hierarchical partitioning structure built on simple decision rules. However, in practice, this is not realized because axis-aligned partitioning of realistic data results in deep trees, and because ensemble methods are used to mitigate overfitting. Even then, model complexity and performance remain sensitive to transformation of the input, and extensive expert crafting of features from the raw data is common. We propose the first system to alternate sparse feature learning with differentiable decision tree construction to produce small, interpretable trees with good performance. It benchmarks favorably against conventional tree-based models and demonstrates several notions of interpretability of a model and its predictions
