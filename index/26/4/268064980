Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the storage density of NAND flash memory, making it a critical component in modern electronic devices. However, with the rise in storage capacity comes an increased likelihood of errors in data storage and retrieval. The growing number of errors poses ongoing challenges for system designers and engineers, in terms of the characterization, modeling, and optimization of NAND-based systems. We present a novel approach for modeling and preventing errors by utilizing the capabilities of generative and unsupervised machine learning methods. As part of our research, we constructed and trained a neural modulator that translates information bits into programming operations on each memory cell in NAND devices. Our modulator, tailored explicitly for flash memory channels, provides a smart writing scheme that reduces programming errors as well as compensates for data degradation over time. Specifically, the modulator is based on an auto-encoder architecture with an additional channel model embedded between the encoder and the decoder. A conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) was used to construct the channel model. Optimized for the end-of-life work-point, the learned memory system outperforms the prior art by up to 56% in raw bit error rate (RBER) and extends the lifetime of the flash memory block by up to 25% .
