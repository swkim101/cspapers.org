With recent advancements in visual synthesis, there is a growing risk of encountering images with detrimental effects, such as hate, discrimination, or privacy violations. The research on transforming harmful images into responsible ones remains unexplored. In this paper, we formulate a new task, responsible visual editing, which entails modifying specific concepts within an image to render it more responsible while minimizing changes. However, the concept that needs to be edited is often abstract, making it challenging to locate what needs to be modified and plan how to modify it. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Cognitive Editor (CoEditor) that harnesses the large multimodal model through a two-stage cognitive process: (1) a perceptual cognitive process to focus on what needs to be modified and (2) a behavioral cognitive process to strategize how to modify. To mitigate the negative implications of harmful images on research, we create a transparent and public dataset, AltBear, which expresses harmful information using teddy bears instead of humans. Experiments demonstrate that CoEditor can effectively comprehend abstract concepts within complex scenes and significantly surpass the performance of baseline models for responsible visual editing. We find that the AltBear dataset corresponds well to the harmful content found in real images, offering a consistent experimental evaluation, thereby providing a safer benchmark for future research. Moreover, CoEditor also shows great results in general editing. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/kodenii/Responsible-Visual-Editing.
