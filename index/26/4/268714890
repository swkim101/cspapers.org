Considering that the human brain is the most powerful, generalizable, and energy-efficient computer we know of, it makes the most sense to look to neuroscience for ideas regarding deep learning model improvements. I propose one such idea, augmenting a traditional Advantage-Actor-Critic (A2C) model with additional learning signals akin to those in the brain. Pursuing this direction of research should hopefully result in a new reinforcement learning (RL) control paradigm that can learn from fewer examples, train with greater stability, and possibly consume less energy.
