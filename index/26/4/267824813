Label enhancement (LE) is a procedure of recovering the label distributions from the logical labels in the multi-label data, the purpose of which is to better represent and mine the label ambiguity problem through the form of label distribution. Existing LE work mainly concentrates on how to leverage the topological information of the feature space and the correlation among the labels, and all are based on single view data. In view of the fact that there are many multi-view data in real-world applications, which can provide richer semantic information from different perspectives, this paper first presents a multi-view label enhancement problem and proposes a tensor-based multi-view label enhancement method, named TMV-LE. Firstly, we introduce the tensor factorization to get the common subspace which contains the high-order relationships among different views. Secondly, we use the common representation and multiple views to jointly mine a more comprehensive topological structure in the dataset. Finally, the topological structure of the feature space is migrated to the label space to get the label distributions. Extensive comparative studies validate that the performance of multi-view multi-label learning can be improved significantly with TMV-LE.
