Referring image segmentation is a task that aims to predict pixel-wise masks corresponding to objects in an image described by natu-ral language expressions. Previous methods for referring image segmentation employ a cascade framework to break down complex problems into multiple stages. However, its limitations are also apparent: existing methods within the cascade framework may encounter challenges in both maintaining a strong focus on the most relevant information during specific stages of the referring image segmentation process and rectifying errors propagated from early stages, which can ultimately result in sub-optimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose the Joint Mask Contex-tual Embedding Learning Network (JMCELN). JMCELN is designed to enhance the Cascade Framework by incorporating a Learnable Contextual Embedding and a Progressive Alignment Network (PAN). The Learnable Contex-tual Embedding module dynamically stores and utilizes reasoning information based on the current mask prediction results, enabling the network to adaptively capture and refine pertinent information for improved mask prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the Progressive Alignment Network (PAN) is introduced as an integral part of JMCELN. PAN leverages the output from the previous layer as a filter for the current output, effectively reducing inconsistencies be-tween predictions from different stages. By iteratively aligning the predictions, PAN guides the Learnable Contextual Embedding to incorporate more discriminative information for reasoning, leading to enhanced prediction quality and a reduction in error propagation. With these methods, we achieved state-of-the-art re-sults on three commonly used benchmarks, especially in more intricate datasets.
