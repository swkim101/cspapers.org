In recent years, there has been a significant focus on achieving low-latency and high-throughput convolutional neural network (CNN) inference. Integrated photonics offers the potential to substantially expedite neural networks due to its inherent low-latency properties. Recently, on-chip Fourier optics-based neural network accelerators have been demonstrated and achieved superior energy efficiency for CNN acceleration. By incorporating Fourier optics, computationally intensive convolution operations can be performed instantaneously through on-chip lenses at a significantly lower cost compared to other on-chip photonic neural network accelerators. This is thanks to the complexity reduction offered by the convolution theorem and the passive Fourier transforms computed by on-chip lenses. However, conversion overhead between optical and digital domains and memory access energy still hinder overall efficiency.We introduce ReFOCUS, a Joint Transform Correlator (JTC) based on-chip neural network accelerator that efficiently reuses light through optical buffers. By incorporating optical delay lines, wavelength-division multiplexing, dataflow, and memory hierarchy optimization, ReFOCUS minimizes both conversion overhead and memory access energy. As a result, ReFOCUS achieves 2× throughput, 2.2× energy efficiency, and 1.36× area efficiency compared to state-of-the-art photonic neural network accelerators.CCS CONCEPTS• Computer systems organization → Architectures; • Hardware → Emerging technologies; Emerging optical and photonic technologies; • Computing methodologies → Artificial intelligence; Machine learning.
