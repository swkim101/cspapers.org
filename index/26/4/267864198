Accurate yet simple methods for traac engineering are important for eecient management of resources in broadband networks. The goal of this paper is to apply and evaluate large deviation techniques for traac engineering. In particular, we employ the recently developed theory of eeective bandwidths, where the eeective bandwidth depends not only on the statistical characteristics of the traac stream, but also on a link's operating point through two parameters, the space and time parameters , which can be computed using the many sources asymptotic. We show that this eeective bandwidth deenition can accurately quantify resource usage. Furthermore , we estimate and interpret values of the space and time parameters for various mixes of real traac demonstrating how these values can be used to clarify the eeects on the link performance of the time scales of traac burstiness, of the link resources (capacity and buuer), and of traac control mechanisms such as traac shaping. Our experiments involve a large set of MPEG-1 compressed video and Internet Wide Area Network (WAN) traces, as well as modeled voice traac.
