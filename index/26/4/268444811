Introductory programming has evolved in many places to become a CS0 course, enabling students to get their feet wet with programming without completing significant math coursework. A scan of CS programs shows that a majority of CS1 programming courses that count towards an undergraduate CS degree continue to have a math or CS0 prerequisite. This experience report discusses the impact of removing the math prerequisite at an R2 university and a small liberal arts college. Having minimal prerequisites has beneficial effects in terms of diversifying the CS student body as well as enabling students to begin CS coursework early, often in the first semester, potentially impacting persistence, but also enabling students to decide, early, if CS is right for them. The high success rate of students of various backgrounds taking CS certificates and pursuing graduate school also shows that aggressive prerequisites in the past may have been functioning as barriers to entering CS programs. If we are serious about supporting diversity, we need to acknowledge the wide disparity in high school education nationwide and that prerequisites are perhaps functioning as a needless barrier. Where the CS0 course doesn't count towards a degree, or there isn't space for that requirement in the program, it is also worth considering whether the CS0 prerequisite is necessary.
