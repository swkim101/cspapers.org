In this paper, we describe a system used to link physical objects to online content implemented with commercially available pocket computers using bar code scanners, wireless networks, and web services. We describe sample applications built with the system for objects like books, music, packaged goods, and art works as well as a related web application that facilitates the creation of communities around objects scanned by the handhelds. Finally, we suggest several scenarios for uses of these kinds of devices and the possible sociological and commercial implications.
