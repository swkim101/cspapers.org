We present BEETLE II, a tutorial dialogue system designed to accept unrestricted language input and support experimentation with different tutorial planning and dialogue strategies. Our first system evaluation used two different tutorial policies and demonstrated that the system can be successfully used to study the impact of different approaches to tutoring. In the future, the system can also be used to experiment with a variety of natural language interpretation and generation techniques.
