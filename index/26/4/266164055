Topic Modelling is an established research area where the quality of a given topic is measured using coherence metrics. Often, we infer topics from Neural Topic Models (NTM) by interpreting their decoder weights, consisting of top-activated words projected from individual neurons. Transformer-based Language Models (TLM) similarly consist of decoder weights. However, due to its hypothesised superposition properties, the final logits originating from the residual path are considered un-interpretable. Therefore, we posit that we can interpret TLM as superposed NTM by proposing a novel weight-based, model-agnostic and corpus-agnostic approach to search and disentangle decoder-only TLM, potentially mapping individual neurons to multiple coherent topics. Our results show that it is empirically feasible to disentangle coherent topics from GPT-2 models using the Wikipedia corpus. We validate this approach for GPT-2 models using Zero-Shot Topic Modelling. Finally, we extend the proposed approach to disentangle and analyse LLaMA models.
