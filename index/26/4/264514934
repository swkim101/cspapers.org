Electro-actuated materials (EAMs) have received wide attention within material science and soft robotics for their ability to dynamically change physical properties, such as shape and stiffness, in response to electrical stimuli. While researchers have begun exploring the haptic characteristics of EAMs, their integration into Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) shows challenges, including limited commercial availability and a lack of interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. This workshop specifically focuses on electrostatic (ES), soft electrohydraulic (SEH), and electroosmotic (EO) actuators. By bringing together researchers in the field, we aim to facilitate the exchange of findings, techniques, fabrication practices, and tacit knowledge within the HCI community. The workshop combines interactive demos, focused discussions, and hands-on ideation, providing a platform to explore the haptic potential of EAMs, identify key challenges and opportunities, and envision how these programmable materials can unlock new haptic interactions and interfaces.
