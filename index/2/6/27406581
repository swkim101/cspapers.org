SQL3 is a new database language standard being developed by both ANSI X3H2 and 1S0 DBL committees for the last three years. SQL3 is upward compatible with SQL-92, the current ANSI/ISO database language standard, and is targeted for completion in 1997. SQL3 extends SQL-92 in many significant ways, one of the major extensions being the addition of an extensible, object-oriented type system. This talk will describe the current status of SQL3 type system.
