A theory of natural language can be evaluated on both extensional and intensional grounds. Systematic investigations of the extension of a theory may, for instance, lead to studies of the invariance properties of such theories. The intentional parameters that I wish to address include complexity, learnability, and monotonicity. The main results, on which my thesis builds, up to this point, include: (i) the universal recognition problem of model-theoretic feature-based grammar formalisms is complete for non-deterministic polynomial time, since such formalisms have the polysize model property, (ii) this result holds also for linearization-based extensions, (iii) the universal recognition problem of strongly monotonic, hybrid feature-based grammar formalisms is decidable in deterministic polynomial time, and (iv) there exists a strongly monotonic unification categorial grammar that is learnable in the limit from positive data. In addition, invariance studies have lead to the identification of a class of modal languages that define common feature-based grammar formalisms. The objective of my studies is to identify a tractable and learnable feature-based formalism.
