Bluetooth is one of the emerging technologies, which is capable of providing many services such as High data throughput, Adhoc networks, providing an excellent data transmission medium and many more other services and applications. To provide all these features and services power consumption is quite high in comparison with other mobile devices. Like keeping the device size small will result in less operation tine of device or degraded the throughput, so there is a strong need for a power optimized algorithm which keeps the data throughput higher using minimum power consumption. As Bluetooth defines a uniform structure for huge range of devices to communicate and transfer data with each other, with minimum user efforts, Bluetooth also offers wireless access to LANs, the mobile phone network and the internet for a host of many home appliances and portable handheld devices. As Bluetooth has to provide many services security issues have to satisfied like Bluetooth devices are part of peoples personal usage and will communicate and transfer their very personal information, confidential business information or other sensitive data. This must be protected from being spoofed or mutilated. Encryption facility is very excellent solution for security vulnerabilities occurs in Bluetooth communication. This paper presents the detailed comparison study of old and current algorithms and techniques used for power optimization and security issues in Bluetooth communication and an appropriate solution will be presented particularly for two major issues of Bluetooth power consumption, security and other issues related to both of them finally, an efficient scheme which will positively enable us to provide all the desired services and application but in an economical and secure way with respect to power consumption and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, this research also presents the discussion of how proposed scheme can be implemented in a straight-forward fashion.
