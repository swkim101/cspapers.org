A knowledge-driven system for locating missing Bridge honours in closed hands is described. The program is Intended to follow the development given in an expert-level book. Although It is Incomplete, being as yet confined largely to reasoning from the bidding and opening leads, Its performance to date is promising. In roughly the first half of the book, It is able to replicate the conclusions about card location in more than eighty percent of the cases studied. The paper describes the three principal sections of the current program which deal with the analysis of the bidding, understanding the opening lead, and the 'Inference engine' respectively.
