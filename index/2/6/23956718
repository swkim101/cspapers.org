This special session is for SIGCSE attendees who are interested in K-12 computing education, especially those who have or are planning to have a NSF CS 10K project. A major goal of CS 10K is broadening participation, which includes providing computing education to students with disabilities. This interactive session will introduce attendees to AccessCS10K, a project to help teachers include students with disabilities in their K-12 computing classes. Furthermore, attendees will have a hands-on experience with the Quorum language, a language designed for youth regardless of disability. It is expected that attendees to the special session will be better prepared to include a student with a disability in their computing classes or to help other teachers do the same.
