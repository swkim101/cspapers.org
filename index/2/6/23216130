In recent years, the research of sensor networks has advanced. They are anticipated for use in a wide variety of fields such as traceability systems of products, environmental morning, health care, etc. However, developers must develop applications to work in a sensor node and applications to make the sensor data visible. Therefore the knowledge that is necessary for development and the acquisition of the language will take time to develop. As described in this paper, we propose a development environment for sensor network application development. The environgment will be useful even by web programmers and a designers.
