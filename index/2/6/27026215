BACON.3 is a production system that discovers empirical laws. The program uses a few simple heuristics to solve a broad range of tasks. These rules detect constancies and trends in data, and lead to the formulation of hypotheses and the definition of theoretical terms. BACON.3 represents data at varying levels of description, where the lowest have been directly observed and the highest correspond to hypotheses that explain everything so far observed. The system can also run and relate multiple experiments, collapse hypotheses with identical conditions, ignore differences between similar concepts, and discover and ignore irrelevant variables. BACON.3 has shown its generality by rediscovering versions of the Ideal gas law, Kepler's third law, Coulomb's law, Ohm's law, and Galileo's laws for the pendulum and constant acceleration.
