Most of existing approaches are based on hand crafted low-level visual patters like edge segments and line segments, which do not capture high-level vision. To overcome shortcomings of the existing approaches, we propose a novel architecture based on deep convolutional neural network, namely Shape Regression Network(SReN), to detect storyboards within comic images. Firstly, we use Fast R-CNN to generate rectangle bounding boxes as storyboard proposals. Then we train a deep neural network to predict quadrangles for these propos- als. Unlike existing object detection methods which only output rectangle bounding boxes, SReN can produce more precise quadrangle bounding boxes. Experimental results, evaluating on 7382 comic pages, demonstrate that SReN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by more than 10% in terms of F1-score and page correction rate.
