Cluster computing is a disruptive force that has quickly reshaped the HPC market and rapidly gained acceptance as a solution to an ever-increasing number of business and research problems in the data center. To sustain, and accelerate the growth of grid and related fields, we need a set of reference architectures, implementations and technology standards that will enable interoperable components and an ubiquitous computing experience.This panel will debut the initiative to establish standards to discuss and implement grid systems. Industry and academic representatives will debate current challenges in grid computing, why we need standards, how we should talk about grid, what grid will mean to the industry for the next ten years, and how grid is a spring board for academics to take HPC, virtualization, and distributed computing to new heights. During the Q&A period, attendees will have an opportunity to voice their concerns or support of initiatives addressed.
