In the past few years sustainability and green computing have received tremendous interest across the world. Computing plays a critical role in our society, thus it has a special responsibility for sustainability and green movement. In this paper, we advocate sustainability integration into undergraduate computing education. We present three sustainability integration strategies, our efforts to develop a green computing course and learning modules, and course evaluation. We believe that sustainability integration will help prepare our graduates with computing competencies, multi-disciplinary knowledge, and computational thinking to create a sustainable future.
