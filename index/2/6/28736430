China and India represent two of the most rapidly evolving markets for IC design today. According to the CMP China IC Design Survey 2002, demand for IC design services in China is growing exponentially alongside 8- and 12-inch wafer fab construction. In India, multinationals and local companies continue to accelerate the development of complex IC's, matching the sophistication of design teams world wide. China and India are graduating the most EEs annually of any other countriess. This dynamic growth of IC design and its associated infrastructure in China & India is causing is causing all participants in the semiconductor value chain to carefully consider their business interactions in these countries. This panel will evaluate how IC design is changing in these emerging markets. Panelists will represent a variety of viewpoints, including multinationals, local government, local universities, and large local companies. The panel will also explore of this emerging market on the EDA industry.
