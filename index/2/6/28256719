We propose a hierarchic structuring principle for the formal specification of data base systems, called an algebraic specification scheme, which is based on algebraic specification techniques for data types. Syntax and semantics of an algebraic specification scheme are formally defined and illustrated by a nontrivial example, the specification of a data base system for an airportschedule. The construction of the schema is based on tuple- and table-connections of the components showing a close relationship to the relational data base model. Algebraic specification schemes allow the definition of integrity constraints like functional and interrelational dependencies. The mathematical precise formulation allows rigorous correctness proofs for their syntax and semantics. First results are given and applied to the airportschedule example.
