In this paper, we propose a QoS-aware class gated DBA algorithm in which the bandwidth is requested/granted on a service class basis. To avoid the monopoly on bandwidth by higher classes, the maximum bandwidth that is allocated to each service class is limited (fairness between service classes). In addition, to avoid the monopoly on bandwidth by particular users, each ONU runs a fairness bandwidth allocation algorithm within each service class. Through computer simulations, it is verified that the proposed algorithm achieves a good level of QoS, and at the same time maintains a good level of fairness between both service classes and users.
