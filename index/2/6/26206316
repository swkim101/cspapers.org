In this paper, we propose that design patterns be systematically analyzed and reformulated to exhibit a reasoning binding solutions to precisely stated problems, given a set of mechanisms. We show that these mechanisms can be described as program transformations and how an assistant tool could systematically explore the set of potential solutions induced by these transformations. This will both help the selection of the appropriate patterns and their instantiation in the context of the application under development.
