A large automatic system in manufacturing is usually composed of a set of subsystems sharing the usage of some resources. It is a major design issue to prove the liveness, boundedness and reversibility of the composite system. In this paper, the subsystems are modeled as augmented marked graphs. These augmented marked graphs are then composed into a composite system by merging those places representing the same sources. Conditions are provided under which siphons, traps, liveness, boundedness and reversibility of the subsystems are preserved in the composite system.
