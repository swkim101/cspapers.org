EGovernment promises efficient, effective and digital access to public services through a digital medium such as the Internet. However, with the passage of time it is realised that the Internet cannot be the only medium for electronic public service delivery for technologically less developed countries. A number of hybrid offline and online strategies are coming out of developing countries as an alternative to the use of the Internet. This paper presents an analysis of the Layne and Lee model of eGovernment and presents its critique for developing countries. By taking into account of the G2C eServices initiated by the Government of Pakistan, this paper also emphasises on conceptualising the hybrid model of eGovernment. With the help of a case study of kiosk machines and eSahulat, this paper discusses the importance of the hybrid model of eGovernment for the success of eGovernment in the developing countries.
