This thesis wi l l report investigations into an architecture for intelligent systems and associated knowledge representation scheme. Such a system is an object containing subobjects like itself, some actions which can be taken and a set of constraints which these must satisfy. The language for programming these systems is quite general, high level and declarative. Our implementation takes advantage of the naturally distributed architecture for concurrent computation. Any computing system is a kind of abstraction of some part of the real world. Computer scientists have traditionally worked on how to make abstractions f rom the world, how to encode an abstraction into a computer system and how to manipulate the abstraction inside the system for desired purposes. As a result, special features and micro-structures of many parts of the world are well understood, and many formalisms such as programming languages and knowledge representation schemes have been invented, while many manipulation strategies such as those of calculation and inference have been developed. However, the general features and the macrostructures of the real world have been less investigated and rarely used for abstractionâ€”that is, for the development of computing systems. This is the problem to be addressed in the thesis. We begin f rom a generic framework, which we develop by reflecting on generic aspects of the world and some theoretical and technical results in computer science. The following contributions should be made by the thesis:
