The balance of supply and demand in a microgrid is traditionally maintained by exploiting the reserves on generation side, which is capital intensive. However, approaches of on-line energy management including peak-load reduction and control energy provision by the demand side can support to reduce the demand during the situation of energy imbalance. This article discusses a new approach of modeling an intelligent and self-configurable microgrid system using automated demand side management, i.e. automated load management. In this system, microgrid central controller (MGCC) can communicate with the loads and directs them to isolate from the grid in real-time to reduce overall demand load on the system especially during peak-load hours. For this purpose, each load is coupled with a control node to become an intelligent load. Control node is a simple controlling circuitry, consisting of a communication node, power measuring device and a switch that can isolate the load from the grid under the management of central controller. MGCC takes decisions on the basis of control algorithms, which are implemented in it. Proposed system increases the reliability of consistent energy supply and considerably reduces the installation and maintenance costs of a microgrid.
