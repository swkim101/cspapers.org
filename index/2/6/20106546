Building a trustworthy cloud is critical for its practical use. Most current researches usually take integrity measurements using trusted computing to address trust issue, such as integrity measurement architecture (IMA) implemented in Linux kernel. However, some runtime attacks intrude the system while not tampering with the programs, which cannot be detected by integrity mechanism. We call them non-tampering attacks. This paper presents TraceVirt, a framework for detecting these non-tampering attacks, which combines the strong isolation and event-driven capacity to log runtime information. The logging data is processed by remote intrusion analysis cluster to analyze potential attacks. The experimental results show that TraceVirt can detect the real world non-tampering attacks and the performance overhead is acceptable.
