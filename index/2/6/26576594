To address the search problem over dynamic web pages, several domain-speci c information integration portal services have emerged, such as jango.excite.com and cnet.com. These integration services o er uniform access to heterogeneous collections of dynamic pages using wrapper technology. Common techniques used for constructing wrapper programs often require embedding programmers' understanding of the speci c presentation layout or speci c contents of the Web pages, often with the assistance of semi-automatic tools. However, even with partially automated tools, developing and maintaining wrappers turns out to be labor intensive and error-prone, especially for Web sites that are frequently changing their information presence on the Web. As a result, most information integration services are limited to a handful of sources and have a limited capability to e ectively incorporate additional or updated content providers into their existing integration access framework. The OminiSearch system demonstrates a method to incorporate new dynamic sources into an integration system in which useful data objects are extracted from dynamic Web pages without programmer intervention, and to maintain the capability to extract relevant information in the face of evolving structure in the Web sites.
