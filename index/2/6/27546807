Our project has developed and studied high instrumentation technologies for mine detection and mine disposal using measuring equipment mounted on a six-legged teleoperated walking robots. This robot is called COMET-1 which is a full-autonomous obstacle avoidance robot or a semi-autonomous obstacle avoidance robot that requires the operator's intervention. When detecting a mine, the robot will lower each leg onto the ground safely and stably without stepping on a mine. For the simulations and experiments in the present study, the authors created a simulation model by attaching an optical proximity sensor on the foot of each leg and designed a walking algorithm using compliance control. Also, they verified the efficiency by means of walking experiments.
