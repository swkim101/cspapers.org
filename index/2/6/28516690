The design and integration of ROBHAZ-DT2 is presented which is a newly developed mobile manipulator system. It is designed to carry out military and civilian missions in various hazardous environments. In developing the integrated ROBHAZ-DT2 system, we have focused on two issues: 1) novel mechanism design for mobility and manipulation and 2) intuitive user interface for teleoperation. In mechanism design, a double tracks connected by a passive joint has been designed to achieve high speed and rugged mobility on uneven terrain. In addition, a six-dof foldable manipulator suitable for the mobile manipulation has been designed. Secondly, a new compact 6-dof haptic device has been developed for teleoperation of the ROBHAZ-DT2. This haptic device is specially designed for simultaneous control both of the mobile base and the manipulator of ROBHAZ-DT2. As a result of integration of ROBHAZ-DT2 and the user interface unit including the haptic device, we could successfully demonstrate a typical EOD task requiring abilities of mobility and manipulation in outdoor environment.
