We introduce Ambient Surface, an interactive surrounded equipment for enhancing interface capabilities of mobile devices placed on an ordinary surface. Object information and a user's interaction are captured by 2D/3D cameras, and appropriate feedback images are projected on the surface. By the help of the ambient system, we may not only provide a wider screen for mobile devices with a limited screen size, but also allow analog objects to dynamically interact with users. We believe that this demo will help interaction designers to draw new inspiration of utilizing mobile objects with ambient environment.
