Big data and cloud computing (BDCloud) collectively offer a paradigm shift in the way businesses are now acquiring, using and managing information technology. With the fast growth of this paradigm, we argue that each and every CS and IT students should be equipped with foundation knowledge in this collective paradigm and should possess hand-on-experiences in managing big data applications in clouds to acquire skills that are necessary to meet current and future industry demands. This poster presents our research that proposes gradual and systematic integration of big data and cloud computing related topics into multiple core (required) courses of CS/IT curriculum. The poster, supported by a NSF grant, will be useful for CS/IT students and their instructors as it identifies big data and cloud computing related topics that are important to cover, finds a sequence of the prescribed topics that can be incorporated into existing core courses most effectively, and suggests specific core courses in which their coverage might find an appropriate context. The poster further identifies the major challenges this proposed intervention may encounter and provides a deeper analysis of them. Finally, the poster describes our experience of implementing one such course with proposed interventions during Fall of 2016 semester. The pre- post- test results that measure student opinion and understanding of big data and cloud computing topics are presented in the poster and demonstrate improved student interest and learning.
