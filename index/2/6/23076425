The integration of minimally invasive robotic assistance and image-guidance can have positive impact on joint fracture surgery, providing a better clinical outcome with respect to the current open procedure. In this paper, a new design of the RAFS surgical system is presented. The redesign of the robotic system and its integration with a novel 3D navigation system through a new clinical workflow, overcomes the drawbacks of the earlier prototype. This makes the RAFS surgical system more suitable to clinical scenarios in the operating theatre. System accuracy and effectiveness are successfully demonstrated through laboratory trials and preliminary cadaveric trials. The experimental results demonstrate that the system allows the surgeon to reduce a 2-fragment distal femur fracture in a cadaveric specimen, with a reduction accuracy of up to 0.85 mm and 2.2Â°. Preliminary cadaveric trials also provided a positive and favorable outcome pointing to the usability and safety of the RAFS system in the operating theatre, potentially enhancing the capacity of joint fracture surgeries.
