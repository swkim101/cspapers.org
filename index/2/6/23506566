This paper reports on a human factors project investigating the usability of videocommunications and multimedia services that will be developed for the emerging Integrated Broadband Communications (IBC) Networks of the future. The first three years of this four year project were spent conducting basic human factors research, for example, how would people like to control full motion video at the computer interface? What is the smallest image size at which facial gestures can be accurately determined on a high definition TV display? The final year of the project is to be spent in compiling various guidelines for the designers of IBC systems and services. This work has been conducted under the CEC RACE (Research and Development in Advanced Communications Technologies in Europe) programme.
