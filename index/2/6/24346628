In this tutorial we present an overview of Domain-specific visual languages (DSVLs), DSVL-based software engineering tools and meta-tools for constructing DSVL-based tools. We present a motivation for DSVL usage in software engineering; examine several DSVL exemplar tools; illustrate the design of DSVLs including meta-model, notation and view type design; and compare and contrast several tools to realizing DSVLs. Included are three short group exercises in DSVL design.
