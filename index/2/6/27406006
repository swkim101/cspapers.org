1. What is English Query? Microsoft English Query (EQ) lets users pose database queries in plain English. To do this, a developer need only define the database semantics, in effect building a conceptual model of the database. EQ provides an Authoring Tool that allows the developer to define the set of the entities and relationships in the database along with the database objects that the entities are associated with. Once this model is defined, the English Query Engine converts any English question posed in terms of the defined entities and relationships into a SQL statement. The application developer may use this engine, specifically itâ€™s a COM automation server, inside her Web, C++, Java, or Visual Basic application. This allows users to ask English questions of arbitrary complexity. These questions can be refined with as many follow-up questions as necessary) to find the information that is of interest.
