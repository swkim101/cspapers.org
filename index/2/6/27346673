Thenorvzegian electronics industry In terms of production volume the electronics industry accounts for a l i t t l e over one per cent of the nations GNP-or about 300 M $. The industry is made up of some 75 companies, of which only five employ more than fifteen hundred people, and only one of these five is exclusively engaged in electronics. The main product areas are: Consu:~er electronics, Telecommunication equipment, and Professional equipment, each area with an equal share of the total production value. In the Professional equipment category the main products are Small computers, terminals, peripherals Equipment and systems for numerical control Navigation equipment and equipment for control on board ships. Instruments for cartography, oceanography, marine biology. In spite of its modest size the electronics industry is considered to be of particular importance one reason for this being the great impact the technological advances in this f i e l d tend to have on other technologies and sciences and often on society as well. NTNF's main purpose is to stimulate research in the industry as well as in universities and institutes. Its most important functions are:-To evaluate the need for research and planning of research activities within its area of responsibility.-Make funds available for top p r i o r i t y research projects to be carried out in univer-s i t i e s , institutes or in the industry.-Long range build up of research know-how. In many cases NTNF has i n i t i a t e d the forming of a research institute which then stays a f f i l i a t e d with, and obtains some of its funds from, NTNF. (There are now 13 such institutes and three "project offices" af-f i l i a t e d with NTNF. The total number of employees in these institutes is approximately 2000). The institutes may act as consultants to the industry or to departments of the government.
