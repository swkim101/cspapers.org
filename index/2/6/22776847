In operating systems courses, students study the major algorithms used in operating systems to manage the various objects and resources in a computing system: processes, files, buffer space, processors, messages, main memory, semaphores, and disk storage. Various classical synchronization problems such as the dining philosophers, the readers and writers, and the producers and consumers with bounded buffer are also analyzed. Even though the computing systems being studied are getting more and more powerful, these algorithms and classical problems are usually analyzed using blackboard, chalk, pencil, and paper. This paper describes an X-windows based package called xtango that was used to animate some of the algorithms and classical problems studied in operating systems. One animation typical of those that have been developed is presented. Students can use these animations during study outside the classroom for a better understanding of the algorithms. Instructors can use the animations to facilitate the presentation of the algorithms in the classroom.
