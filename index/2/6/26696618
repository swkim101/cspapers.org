Existing techniques for programming robots are either limited or require expert programmers. This paper describes an implemented robot system, TL, which is taught using a new technique which is easy to use yet produces powerful high-level plans. In this technique the user provides an example of the plan by moving the manipulator through the desired assembly. TL observes the assembly and infers the underlying plan. This paper describes TL, presents an example of it learning to assemble a simple electric switch, and discusses future directions for development.
