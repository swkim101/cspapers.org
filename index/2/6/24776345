The Fulbright Scholar Program is the flagship academic exchange program of the U.S. Department of State that provides the opportunity for U.S. Scholars to teach and/or conduct research at institutions abroad. Every year, approximately 1100 American scholars travel to approximately 125 countries to lecture, conduct research, and participate in a wide variety of academic and professional activities for one or more academic terms, up to one year. The Fulbright Scholar program is open to US Citizens with a Ph.D. or equivalent professional or terminal degree and university teaching experience [1]. In this panel, three computer science professors who have completed a total of five Fulbright grants in the last 12 years offer their experiences, anecdotes, and insights of the Fulbright Scholar program. The goal of the panel is to promote and inform the CS Education community about benefits of the Fulbright Scholar program, address questions or misconceptions regarding the program, and present realistic expectations for both the application process and the program itself. Each of the three panelists will present a 15 minute overview of their Fulbright experiences, leaving ample time for an interactive question and answer period.
