The purpose of this paper is to describe a course concerned with both the protection of computer resources and the responsibilities of computer scientists and end-users of computers toward society . Technical as well as nontechnical aspects of privacy and security comprise the course material on protecting computer resources. Every new age demands of its people rules for getting along in a new environment. The age of computer dependency brings requirements for adapting rules of living. This course is an effort to expose both computer science majors and students not majoring in computing to discussions of how those rules and environments might look. Certainly the challenge facing those concerned about computer ethics is raising the consciousness of the public about computing and how computing impacts our lives. The course described is intended to serve both seniors majoring in computer science and non-computer science majors with previous programming experience. A catalog course description, course outline, course presentation, suggested programming assignments, suggested homework assignments, and student reactions to the course are described.
