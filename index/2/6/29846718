In flexible trajectory control of a mobile robot it is preferable to design a smooth trajectory which passes specified points with specified tangents in a two dimensional plane. A trajectory design method which satisfies the above condition is presented using a Bspline curve. In order to use the designed B-spline curve for a two-wheel-driven-type mobile mechanism the possibility of using curvature data is examined. Possible speed patterns for the minimum travel time along a curve specified by curvature data is demonstrated given hardware constraints. Trajectory control of experimental hardware demonstrates the feasibility of using the the designed B-spline curve to control the trajectory of a wheel-type mobile robot.
