The ICRA Robot Challenge is a new event being introduced at ICRA this year. The Challenge will consist of three individual events showcasing some of the latest research in the field of robotics, under the overall theme of “space robotics”. Our goal is to make the Challenge accessible to all members of the ICRA community, to integrate it tightly with the technical aspects of the conference, and to encourage as many participants as possible to bring their robots and to compete.
