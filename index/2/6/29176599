Throughout the five years, the symposia have retained their original informal atmosphere and their emphasis on new research results. But there have also been some gradual changes. The number of attendees has grown from approximately 40 to 200. The number of submitted papers and panel proposals has grown from 20 to 39, although the number of acceptances has remained fairly stable at 20-25. This has allowed the program committee to be more selective.
