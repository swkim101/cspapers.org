In early 20th century when technology evolve, the performance of systems suffered from the problems of complexity, increasing cost of maintenance and software of hardware failure caused by unpredictable behavior and poor manageability. This fostered researchers to discover new design and techniques that enable the systems to operate autonomously. In 2001, IBM introduces self-managing capabilities (self-organizing, self-healing, self-optimization and self-protection) with autonomous behavior. In this survey, the main concerns are self-healing autonomic computing. Self-healing is an autonomic computing system that detects and diagnoses errors without the need of human intervention. A number of concepts, techniques and functions have been developed in different application areas of self-healing. This survey gives an overview about some approaches and solutions of past and current research in self-healing classified to operating system, routing, security and web services. These proposed approaches and solutions were developed to solve the problems that arise in manual intervention system. To achieve the perfect of self-healing behaviors, its remains an open and significant challenge that can be accomplished through a combination of process changes, new technologies and architecture and open industry standards.
