This workshop introduces participants to the concepts and use of BRIDGES, a software infrastructure designed to facilitate hands-on experience for solving traditional problems in sophomore level computer science courses (data structures, algorithms) using data from real-world systems that are of interest to students, such as social networks (Twitter, Facebook), scientific or engineering datasets (USGIS Earthquake data), Google Maps, etc. BRIDGES provides easy access (typically function calls) to real-world data sets for use in routine data structures programming assignments, without requiring students to work with complex and varied APIs to acquire such data. BRIDGES also provides visualization capabilities, allowing the students to visualize the data structure they have created as part of their assignment. BRIDGES visualizations can be easily shared, via a web link, with peers, friends, and family. Workshop attendees will engage in hands-on experience with BRIDGES and multiple data sets, and will have the opportunity to discuss how BRIDGES can be used to support various introductory computer science courses. A laptop with internet connection is required to participate in hands-on activities.
