As the complexity of IC/LSI structures increase, verification of IC/LSI mask designs becomes extremely difficult and time-consuming. Also, verification of an IC/LSI mask pattern design requires much man-power as well. Further, the actual circuit realized onto IC/LSI chips may be quite different from that originally intended because of parasitic elements, including capacitors, resistors, and transistors. Computer support of mask pattern verification is considered very important and useful for IC/LSI design. This paper describes all functions of PANAMAP-B (Panasonic Mask Analysis Program for Bipolar IC). The main features are: one, no restriction about edge angles of polygonal mask patterns; and two, distributed constant circuit representation of interconnecting conductors and diffusion resistors.
