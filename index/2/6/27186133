Presentation: Modern mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets have become fully general computing systems with a rich third party application ecosystem and user experience. As such, the same security problems that have long plagued the personal computer (PC) industry are becoming increasingly evident on mobile devices. Addressing these threats effectively requires a secure foundation, including both hardware and software mechanisms. In this talk, Stephen will lay out a vision for secure mobile computing, including a discussion of the roles that virtualization, trusted computing, and secure operating systems play in an overall security architecture.
