A VHF monopole antenna unit, particularly adapted for operation in the 30-88 MHz frequency range, yet capable of embodiment in a compact structure only approximately 11/2 feet in height is described. Coarse tuning is accomplished in a number of switched bands, for each of which is provided a specially designed matching network comprised of inexpensive L-networks of inductors and capacitors. Tuning is accomplished through adjustment of inductor elements. The simple, inexpensive design of the matching circuits eliminates need for intricate mechanisms typically used for automatic impedance matching over a wide band and also for a broadband impedance matching transformer. The compactness made available by the unique top-load structure design is further made possible by provision of a specially designed dielectric filled vertical antenna element, accomplishing the same range and efficiency in an even more compact antenna.
