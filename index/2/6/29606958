As the theme of the conference indicates, computing is changing and so is its pedagogy. In the meantime, many computer science departments teach computer fluency service courses required by their universities, colleges, or other departments, in which the content of the course becomes highly challenged by institutional constraints (e.g. class size, university computer literacy requirement, etc.). This birds-of-a-feather is designed to gather educators who have been teaching fluency courses or may be teaching such courses in the future, so that they can share their experiences, learn from one another, and discuss the most effective ways of affecting change and delivering the content they deem most appropriate.
