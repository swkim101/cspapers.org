An ad hoc network is multi-hop wireless formed by mobile node with no infrastructure. Due to the mobility of nodes in mobile ad hoc networks, the topology of network changes frequently. In this environments, multicast protocols are faced with the challenge of producing multi-hop routes and limitation of bandwidth. We compare the performance of two multicast routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks - serial multiple disjoint tree multicast routing protocol (serial MDTMR) and adapted core multicast routing protocol (ACMRP). The simulator is implemented with GloMoSim.
