A current mirror (CM) is reconfigured based on self cascode (SC) arrangement, useful for low voltage (LV) analog and mixed mode circuits. The CM uses 4 MOSFETs, has high input and output swing, operating at plusmn0.5 V supply. Further, a novel CMOS CCII has been revisited and implemented using this CM for sourcing the mirrored current into a high impedance output node. P-spice simulations confirm the performance of CM and CCII. The CCII has voltage transfer bandwidth of 76 MHz and a current transfer bandwidth of 77 MHz respectively.
