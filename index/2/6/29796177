Two questions perpetually arising within Computer Science Departments are (1) whether or not the programming languages stressed in the academic programs are appropriate and (2) whether the correct emphasis is being placed on one language as opposed to another. In particular, one always wonders if any emerging and promising language is receiving enough attention. Attempts at answering such questions seem to provide quite suitable vehicles for student involvement in curriculum development and so recently at New Mexico State University a combined faculty-graduate student study was made for one important appropriate language, PL/I.
