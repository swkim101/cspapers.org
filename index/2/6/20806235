A multi-radio Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is a multi-hop network that consists of mesh routers and mesh clients, where mesh routers are equipped with multiple radio interfaces and form the backbone of the mesh network. To provide backbone support, it is necessary to reduce interference and balance load in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). We propose load-aware routing metric (LARM), which captures the difference in transmission rates, packet loss ratio, intra/inter-flow interference and traffic load in multi-radio mesh networks. The LARM metric helps finding paths that are better in terms of balancing load and reducing the inter-flow and intra-flow interference in multi-radio networks. Simulation results show that LARM metric significantly outperforms several existing routing metrics in multi-radio wireless mesh networks.
