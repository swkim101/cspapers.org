The production of an appropriate CODASYL Data Base Task Group (DBTG) Data Description Language (DDL) schema for a given data management application is a significant design problem. This research is devoted to the development of a methodology to automate and optimize the design of DBTG schema structures, using analytic modelling and optimization techniques.
 Given an implementation independent description of the data management requirements, it is possible to produce a schema configuration which is optimized with respect to logical record access rate, subject to storage and feasibility constraints, within a selected class of schemas. The storage/access rate trade off is expressable as an integer program, which can be mapped into a network traversal problem with a known dynamic programming solution.
