In this paper we propose a frequency domain equalization scheme for the cyclic prefix assisted (CPA) cyclic code shift keying (CCSK) system. In particular, the proposed scheme performs both correlation and decision in the frequency domain, which helps to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed system achieves the best bit error rate (BER) performance with the maximum ratio combining (MRC).
