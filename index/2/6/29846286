This demonstration presents Audition, an object-orientedlanguage and environment designed to allow the easy creation ofvisual and interactive programs.
It uses a metaphor of Performers and Stages, as first inspiredby the XEROX Pam Rehearsal World project. Performers are the maininteraction units. They are visible and mouse or message activated;sample types include DisplayPerformers, Turtles, Graphs, andGauges. Performers are grouped on Stages; stages maintain localname spaces so that Performers can be named and intercommunicateusing their local names. While Performers are members of a class,they may also be specialised through the addition ofinstance-specific behaviour and structure; this may also beinherited from other performers.
Just as inheritance models is-kind-of relationships, performerscollected on a stage visibly and logically model is-part-ofrelationships, in a more flexible way than instance variables. Anapplication is usually just a specialised stage and its specialisedperformers. The performer-stage paradigm gives rise to models thatare at once well factored across their participating performers andyet are fully encapsulated within a stage. Audition is a threadedinterpreted language implemented in itself. At present we are usingAudition to investigate planning aids and simulations forindustrial situations.
