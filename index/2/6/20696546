This paper presents a new definition for Plans The objects defined are called Plan Nets, and are similar in spirit to Sacerdoti's Procedural Nets (1975). It is argued that Plan Nets are more descriptive tham Procedural Nets, because they can easily describe iterative behaviour The Plan Net definition is motivated by providing an operational semantics for the Procedural Net, and noticing that all Procedural Net state spaces are "loop free" This is seen to restrict the behaviours that can be described by the Procedural Net to those which do not. include iteration It is suggested that Plan Net. state spaces can contain loops, and thus can describe iterative behaviour.
