in this paper an integrated approach that enables the management of Web service transactions. Compared to the existing Web management solutions, it targets to efficiently manage multi-tier Web transactions. It has one unique feature: While the monitoring of Web traffic is done at multiple levels: network, transport, application, and transaction layers, traffic associated with a multi-tier transaction can be correlated non- intrusively such that breakdown analysis can be realized from either service consumer or provider's perspective. A combination of sampling-based packet monitoring and packet probing is used to collect measurement data. A causal sampling protocol is designed to synchronize and correlate the capturing of the traffic associated with multi-tier Web transactions.
