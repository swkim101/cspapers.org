At the 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering,1 Edsger W. Dijkstra remarked that he found his position, as a teacher, analogous to that of a teacher of composition at a school of music. This paper wishes to pursue this analogy in greater detail. In particular, the role of style in computer science education is assessed in terms of the corresponding role it plays in music education.
