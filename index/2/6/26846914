High-performance computers require a highly capable file system. PVFS is an open source parallel file system and joint collaboration led by Argonne National Laboratory, Clemson University, and Ohio Supercomputing Center. PVFS has been delivering features and high-performance on today's top high-end computers, while remaining easy to deploy on clusters of any size. Our previous BOF sessions have been focused on new developments. While we are still actively working on new features, this session will highlight the large and vibrant PVFS user community and a variety of their applications. Several notable users will share with attendees their experiences with PVFS. As always, PVFS developers will be present for an open forum discussion. Users, researchers, or the merely curious are all encouraged to attend.
