Given a model of correct and faulty behaviors of a partially observable discrete event system, equipped with a set of elementary actions that do not intertwine with autonomous events, we search a diagnosability plan, i.e., a sequence of applicable actions that leads the system from an initial belief state (a set of potentially current states) to a diagnosable belief state, in which the system is then left to run freely. This helps in reducing the diagnosis interaction with running systems and can be applied, e.g., on the output of a repair plan, like in power networks. The two successive stages of this approach keep diagnosability planning, including diagnosability tests, in PSpace in comparison to the Exptime test for the more complex active diagnosability used usually in such cases. For this, we propose to construct incrementally the twin plant structure of the given system and to exploit its parts already constructed while testing the candidate plans and constructing its next parts. This helps in pruning the twin plant constructions and many non-diagnosability plan tests. We have created a special benchmark and tested three proposed methods, according to the recycling level of twin plants construction, with one cost function used for plan optimality and an optional heuristics.
