This paper describes a facility for communicating between a controlling device and one or more measurement devices distributed in an internet. The facility includes placement of a command file at each device that ia to participate in a monitoring event. The content of command files is deliberately unspecified to allow a user freedom to use the capabilities of each device to meet the current monitoring requirement. The facility provided by the Measurement Management Protocol includes coordination of interactions between a controlling device and an arbitrary set of measurement devices. Section 2 provides an overview of the environment in which the Measurement Management Protocol operates, and of the services it provides. The remainder of the paper is a detailed specification of the service provided by an implementation of the Measurement Management Protocol.
