This paper discusses about feasibility of common wireless communication services recognition concept for three different standards, i.e. Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) or Wideband Code division Multiple Access (WCDMA), and Long Term Evolution (LTE). They are in mobile telecommunication field also known well as 2G, 3G, and 3.9G respectively. In the term of cognitive system to recognize these three standard services, we investigate the initialization procedure and downlink signal structure as an important keys. As a result, there is big possibility to develop a common wireless communication services recognition for GSM, UMTS and LTE through a concept of synchronization channel detection
