This paper proposes a network middleware for flexible, easy and uniform utilization of sensors in a room. The middleware has three features; 1) concentrated network configuration, which consists of sensor services and a management server, achieves network transparency for flexible and uniform sensor utilization. 2) Abstraction of sensor information using XML description makes easy utilization and uniform access to multiple sensors. 3) Management of shapes as well as position information is introduced in the network enabling the search function based on the room information and management of spatial data. Not only the implementation for sensors and a management server but also an application software by the middleware show validation of the proposed network middleware.
