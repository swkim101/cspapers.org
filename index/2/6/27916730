Published research and anecdotal evidence suggest that women may be disadvantaged when seeking employment. This paper describes a one day seminar on handling job interviews, conducted for female computer science students at the beginning of the final year of their undergraduate degree. Initial evaluations completed by the participants at the time that they participated in the seminar and a survey some six months later have been extremely positive. It appears that, if women are prepared for the interview process, they approach their first interviews with greater confidence and consequently are better equipped to deal with one of the most vital series of interactions that will occur in their lifetimes.
