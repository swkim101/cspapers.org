Economists have investigated models of optimal search behavior that may be relevant to information retrieval. This talk will describe some of the reults of this research and speculate on how they might be useful in the IR context. Professor Varian has published numerous papers in economic theory, industrial organization, financial economics, econometrics and information economics. He is the author of two major economics textbooks which have been translated into 9 languages. His recent work has been concerned with the economics of information technology and the information economy. He recently co-authored Information Rules (with Carl Shapiro, Harvard Business School Press 1998), a book which distills the economic principles of information and networks into practical business strategies. Information Rules was named Editor's Choice as one of the best business books of the year at Amazon.com
