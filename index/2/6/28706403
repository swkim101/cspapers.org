Human beings are part of different communities. Communities can be analyzed to extract valuable information. Communities will be hold in some proper frame structure (ontology). Therefore, there is a need to develop community ontology. Analyzing different levels of ontology from meta-, domain to instance ontologies, from which a level needed to be selected. At the same time, one needs to have profile ontology for registering individuals in a community. As time passes, there will be need to add or delete (update) concepts (attributes) and relations in these ontologies, which will be done by maintaining the ontology. We will use community ontology in our on going research on community algorithm development.
