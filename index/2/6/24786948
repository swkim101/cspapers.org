 
 We propose a demonstration of myDIG (my Domain-specific Insight Graphs), a system that allows non-technical domain experts, including those with no programming experience, to construct a domain-specific search engine over a raw corpus of webpages. myDIG has been developed and refined over multiple years under the DARPA MEMEX program, and has undergone rigorous user testing with actual domain experts from investigative agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). All components of myDIG are open-source, and the product of fundamental research.
