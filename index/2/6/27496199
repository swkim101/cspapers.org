This poster surveys and classifies Participatory Design (PD) practices within a space defined by (a) the extent of direct user involvement in the design process, and (b) the temporal position of the practice in the development cycle or iteration. Surveyed practices include structured conferences, ethnographic methods, hands-on/mock-up techniques, various approaches to prototyping, and others. The poster is intended to be participatory: viewers are encouraged to use structured templates and blank areas of the poster to propose other PD practices for inclusion.
