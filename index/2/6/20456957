This poster will briefly show and describe the five year history of FOSS course offerings and projects in the School of Interactive Games and Media that led to the development of the minor and then diagram and describe the Minor's design and content. It will show how the Humanitarian focus of the student work, beginning with the development of educational games for the One Laptop per Child and Sugar communities built a foundation for the minor. It will then discuss the design of the minor, how the required courses leading to advanced electives also prepare students to become contributors and, potentially, project leaders within Free and Open Source Software and Free Culture communities within the students' own academic specializations. It will diagram the paths that both technical and non-technical students can take to succeed in completing the minor.
