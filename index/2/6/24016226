In this paper, we describe our CS0 course, 3D Modeling and Fabrication, that includes a service-learning CNC milling project as a high tech hook to interest students, both our own and middle school students, in computer science and engineering. Among the CS0 learning outcomes achieved through the design and fabrication projects are computer literacy, writing-across-the curriculum, and development of problem-solving skills such as quantitative reasoning and critical thinking.
 This course is situated in the Integrated Liberal Studies program at University of North Carolina at Asheville. It can be offered as part of any general education program to fulfill a computer literacy or writing-across-the-curriculum requirement. Taking an idea and nurturing it from a concept to a model, to a series of working drawings, and then to a three-dimensional prototype is exciting and fun, and leaves a tangible reminder of the creativity inherent in computer science.
