This paper discusses algorithmic improvements to mature astrophysics applications as part of an on-going collaboration with Astrophysicists. We present an efficient algorithm for a variation of the Inverse Nearest Neighbor problem which is a basic computation in an astrophysical N-body simulation. We obtain empirical results demonstrating the improvements, which our algorithm offers to large-scale astrophysical simulations.
