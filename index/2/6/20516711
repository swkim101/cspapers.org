High-precision time synchronization is critical for nowadays industrial Ethernet systems. Most existing time synchronization mechanisms are implemented based on packet communication. This interaction pattern, however, greatly limits their synchronizing frequency. In order to achieve microsecond-level synchronization precision, expensive high-quality oscillator is necessary for maintaining low clock skew under this long synchronization period (usually several seconds). Furthermore, packet processing introduces many nondeterministic variances (e.g. network stack overhead), which needs to be carefully eliminated. In this paper, we propose the brand-new Industrial Time Protocol (ITP). We deploy the entire ITP in the physical layer, so it eliminates most time uncertainties caused by network stack processing. Furthermore, ITP leverages the InterFrame Gap (IFG), which is the inherent interval between any two Ethernet frames, to carry the synchronization message. With this novel design, ITP can synchronize peer devices at very high frequency without degrading the goodput. The accuracy of ITP is bounded by 16ns for two adjacent devices with only intrinsic cheap oscillator. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis deduces that ITP guarantees 16N-nanosecond accuracy for N-hop network. We implement ITP design with NetFPGA. Experiments show that ITP can provide about 76-nanosecond accuracy for #hops=16 network under severe congestions. In addition, the design of ITP is scalable. It only consumes about 0.67% of logic cells in the low-end FPGA for supporting every ITP-aware port increase.
