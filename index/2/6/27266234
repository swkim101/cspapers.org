The WRAP (Wire Routing and Packaging) System is a 7094 programming system for the automatic packaging and wiring of Aerospace computers. WRAP, originally written to assist in the packaging of IBM's System/4 Pi family of computers, has been applied to a wide range of package configurations.
 Use of the WRAP System has greatly reduced the time required to design and manufacture a machine. The system operates from a logic design recording system (SLDA), performs automatic packaging and wiring, and from this data produces numerical control instructions for manufacturing. Self-checking built into WRAP guarantees that the MIB (Multilayer Interconnection Board) produced is error free and corresponds exactly to the design requested by the engineer.
 Tasks performed by WRAP may be grouped into four main categories: Packaging, Wiring, Manufacturing Interface, and Control Services.
 Examples throughout this paper will be taken from IBM's System/4 Pi family of computers. System/4 Pi uses 14 pin integrated circuit modules to implement the computer's logic design.
