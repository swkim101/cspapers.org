In this paper, we focus on blind identification of standards for Green Communications. The aim of Green Communications is to propose solutions to overcome the rapid increase in energy consumption in communication and networking devices. Cognitive Radio (CR) presents itself as a set of concepts which can help achieve the goals of Green Communications, since a CR device collects information from surroundings and improves its behavior accordingly. One way to achieve Green Communication is to select a standard for communication which requires less transmission power. Thus, the CR device must be capable of identifying all the standards in its surroundings in order to select one. In this paper, we implement a bandwidth shape detector and a pilot based detector. These detectors are the building blocks of the so called Blind Standard Recognition Sensor (BSRS) for a CR. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated both through simulations and experiments conducted using USRP n210 with Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results show that the proposed blind bandwidth identifier and pilot based detector work well at low SNR values. The experiments were realized under line-of-sight transmission conditions, however, the results show that the designed system is indeed able to discriminate several standard-like spectrums under real transmission conditions using their different bandwidth shapes.
