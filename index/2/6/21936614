Object code optimizers pay dividends but are usually ad hoc and machine-dependent. They would be easier to understand if, instead of performing many ad hoc optimizations, they performed a few general optimizations that give the same effect. They would be easier to implement if they were machine-independent and parametrized by symbolic machine descriptions. This paper describes such a compact, machine-independent peephole optimizer.
