In multi-class support vector machine (MSVM) for classiﬁcation, one core issue is to regularize the co-efﬁcient vectors to reduce overﬁtting. Various regu-larizers have been proposed such as ‘ 2 , ‘ 1 , and trace norm. In this paper, we introduce a new type of regularization approach – angular regularization, that encourages the coefﬁcient vectors to have larger angles such that class regions can be widen to ﬂexi-bly accommodate unseen samples. We propose a novel angular regularizer based on the singular values of the coefﬁcient matrix, where the uniformity of singular values reduces the correlation among different classes and drives the angles between co-efﬁcient vectors to increase. In generalization error analysis, we show that decreasing this regularizer effectively reduces generalization error bound. On various datasets, we demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the regularizer in reducing overﬁtting.
