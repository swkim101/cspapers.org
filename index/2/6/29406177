In this paper, an improved chroma interpolation method using 6-tap H.264/AVC[1]â€“[2] filter with high precision [3] is proposed for HEVC(High Efficiency Video Coding)[4]. Experimental results show that the average BD-rate improvements on chroma U and V components are 12.2% and 13.4%, respectively, in the low complexity case of random access structure, and 4.1% and 5.0%, respectively, in the high efficiency case of random access structure. The average BD-rate improvements on U and V components are 12.0% and 14.9%, respectively, in the low complexity case of low delay structure, and 2.0% and 2.4%, respectively, in the high efficiency case of low delay structure. The average BD-rate improvements on luma are 1.3% and 0.4%, respectively, in low complexity and high efficiency cases of low delay structure, 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively, in the low complexity and high efficiency cases of random access structure.
