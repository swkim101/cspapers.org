This paper describes an exercise which has been used in both CS1 and CS2 courses for the purpose of introducing the concepts of recursion and stacks, and for illustrating the benefits of procedural abstraction. The problem is to write a program which finds a path through a rectangular maze. The exercise is used in CS1 as part of an introduction to recursion. In CS2, it is used to illustrate and employ the abstract data type “stack.” In both exercises, the ideas are presented so as to reinforce the concepts of top-down design, and procedural and data abstraction.
