Inertial measurement units (IMUs) enable human motion measurement in any environment, which can be useful for human robot interaction, exoskeletons, and active prosthetics. This paper proposes an approach for estimating the orientation between a wearable IMU sensor and the body frame of the wearer using a simple and fast calibration procedure. The proposed approach uses the generalized Hebbian algorithm to incrementally estimate the axis aligned with gravity using acceleration measurements obtained during a static pose, and the axis perpendicular to the saggital plane using gyro measurements obtained during sagittal plane movements. An automated convergence criterion based on the sensor measurement variance is used. The proposed approach is tested in simulation and with human movement and demonstrates excellent and fast calibration performance.
