Manufacturing tolerances, installation errors and link oflsets cause deviations with respect to the nonrinal kinematic parameters of the platform. As a result, if the nonrinal values of these parameters are used within the pla florttr control sofhvare, the resulting pose of the pln Voriti will be inaccurale. In order to evnluate the eflects of the above factors on the platform accuracy, the inverse and forward kinematic problem of the actual plafloriii model need to be solved. This paper presents a iiuitiericnl method for the solution of both problenrs and denronstrates, through simulation, the eflect of the above factors on platform accuracy. The simulation results provide insight to the expected accuracy and indicate the rirnjor factors contributing to inaccuracies.
