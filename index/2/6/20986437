The computer, in its many shapes and sizes, is evolving rapidly and pervading our everyday lives like never before. Mobile computing devices have become much more than simply "mobile", increasingly serving as personal and "natural" extensions of us. Therein lies immense potential to reshape the way we think and interact, and especially in how we engage one another creatively, expressively, and socially. This talk explores interaction and social design for music through the computer, told through laptop orchestras, mobile phone orchestras, an audio programming language, designing the iPhone's Ocarina, ecosystems for crowd-sourcing musical creation, and an emerging social dimension where computer, music, and people interact.
