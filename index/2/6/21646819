Sustainability has been defined variously as the perpetual maintenance of diverse and productive environments upon which all life depends (Renewable Natural Resources Foundation); the responsible use of resources over an indefinite period of time (National Association of Biology Teachers); or "meet[ing] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (World Commission on Environment and Development)" A sustainable future depends on a workforce of professionals knowledgeable about creating practices, processes, and infrastructure to optimize resource management, and on a community informed about the ethics and influence of human activity on the integrated environmental, economic and social aspects of sustainability. For these reasons we believe that STEM education, which includes computing, is key to developing the knowledge, the technology, the skills, the motivation and the policies needed for a sustainable future. SIGCSE is one of eleven professional societies involved in the Sustainability Improves Student Learning (SISL) project, which seeks to engage those who teach computing in an effort to include sustainability ideas throughout the computing curriculum. This poster presents the current status and future plans of the SISL project, highlighting where and how computing plays a significant role (with special thanks to the ITiCSE sustainability-related working groups for the where and how information).
