In this paper, we propose a novel six degree-of-freedom positioning system. This device is a tripod structure with inextensible limbs actuated at the base by two dimensional linear stepper motors (although other types of actuators may be utilized). The kinematics (both the direct and the inverse kinematics) and dynamics are presented in detail. The dynamics of the actuators (Sawyer motors) are also included in the dynamic modeling. We also carry out a kinematic optimization of the system parameters to maximize the manipulator workspace. The proposed manipulator achieves large range of motion in all the six degrees of freedom. Furthermore, high resolution and high speed motion may be achieved in all axes.
