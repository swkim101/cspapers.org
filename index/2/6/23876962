Four research-supported teaching methods can make your computing courses more effective through improved student learning, comprehension, and motivation.
 This workshop introduces and provides experience with those four methods: 1. Collaborative learning, e.g., pair programming or peer led team learning; 2. Examples and exercises in contexts that appeal to a broad range of students; 3. Computing skills developed through practice; 4. Developing spatial rotation abilities.
 The presenters are among leading researchers and award-winning practitioners.
