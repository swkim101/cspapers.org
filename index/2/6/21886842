We present field experiment results of ocean plume surveys conducted with a robotic platform. In our experiments, Rhodamine dye was used to generate a chemical plume in a coastal environment, and an unmanned surface vessel equipped with fluorometer sensors was deployed to conduct plume surveys. We present plume front and cross sectional survey results, where the robot is driven along visible plume boundaries and plume cross sections, respectively. Datasets collected during the experiments are shown together with statistical parameters that quantify the fine-scale plume structure. Experimental evidence shows that the assumption of the existence of a continuous and fixed-value concentration curve used in existing theoretical work for plume front tracking appears too strong for real ocean plumes. The datasets provide characteristic parameters that can be used for further development and verification of simulation models of ocean pollution plumes.
