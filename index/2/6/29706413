Since the dynamics of a wheeled mobile robot is nonlinear, the feedback linearization technique is commonly used to linearize the input-output map. The input-output linearized system has a nonlinear internal dynamics. In this paper, the internal dynamics of the mobile robot under the look-ahead control is first characterized. The look-ahead control takes the coordinates of a reference point in front of the mobile robot as the output equation. Using a novel Lyapunov function, the stability of the internal dynamics is then analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the internal motion of the mobile robot is asymptotically stable when the reference point is commanded to move forward, whereas the internal motion is unstable when the reference point moves backward. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the analysis.
