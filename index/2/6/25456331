This is a personal opinion paper, loaded with obvious prejudices and unsupported charges and claims. As such, it is more fitting that it be presented at Union Square to a convention of rabble-rousers than as an argument to the SIGCSE.
 The positions may be personal and biased, but they are deeply and dearly held by the author (a very sensitive soul) and were acquired over many years of creating the ills he is now trying to dis-own. It is also important to note that these views are not shared throughout his department and certainly not throughout his university.
