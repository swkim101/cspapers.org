Service Oriented Computing is the new paradigm for Distributed computing and e-business processing that is changing the way software applications are designed, architected, delivered and consumed. Services are autonomous platform-independent computational elements that can be described, published, discovered, orchestrated and programmed using standard protocols for the purpose of building agile networks of collaborating business applications distributed within and across organizational boundaries. Engineering and modeling service-oriented architectures need extensions to existing modeling techniques and methodologies. In this paper, we propose a UML profile for service-oriented architectures.
