This paper describes new method of modeling radio communications systems by using MIMO antenna. The paper concentrates on studying, designing and manufacturing a dual band and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna. This antenna can work in WLAN bands of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies. Antenna is printed on FR-4 substrate with size of 40 mm Ã— 65 mm, thickness of 1.6 mm and relative permittivity of 4.4. The propose antenna is experimentally studied.
