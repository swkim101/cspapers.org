We introduce a simple and effective method to learn discourse-specific word embeddings (DSWE) for implicit discourse relation recognition. Specifically, DSWE is learned by performing connective classification on massive explicit discourse data, and capable of capturing discourse relationships between words. On the PDTB data set, using DSWE as features achieves significant improvements over baselines.
