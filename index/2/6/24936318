This paper proposes a novel lattice-reduction aided (LRA) detection in MIMO systems by improving the LRA-MMSE detection. The proposed detection scheme makes five transform matrices by iteratively reducing the columns of the channel matrix. Using the five transform matrices, five estimates of the transmitted signal are created, among which the most reliable estimate is chosen. The transmit signal energy is saved about 7dB at BER=10-5, and the BER slope became much steeper, which is almost the same as that with the ML detection in the 8times8 MIMO system.
