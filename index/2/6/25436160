Rapid increase of misinformation online has emerged as one of the biggest challenges in this post-truth era. This has given rise to many fact-checking websites that manually assess doubtful claims. However, the speed and scale at which misinformation spreads in online media inherently limits manual verification. Hence, the problem of automatic credibility assessment has attracted great attention. In this work, we present CredEye, a system for automatic credibility assessment. It takes a natural language claim as input from the user and automatically analyzes its credibility by considering relevant articles from the Web. Our system captures joint interaction between language style of articles, their stance towards a claim and the trustworthiness of the sources. In addition, extraction of supporting evidence in the form of enriched snippets makes the verdicts of CredEye transparent and interpretable.
