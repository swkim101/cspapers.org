The Design of an Object-Oriented Operating System: A Case Studyof ChoicesRoy H. Campbell & Nayeem Islam, University of IllinoisPeter W. Madany, SUN Microsystems
This tutorial describes the object-oriented design of a completeoperating system, written to be object-oriented, with a user andapplication interface that is object-oriented. The main objectiveis to illustrate object-oriented design trade-offs by studying alarge object-oriented system, the Choices operating system.
Choices is an object-oriented multiprocessor operating systemthat runs native on SPARC stations, Encore Multimaxes, and IBM PCs.The system is built from a number of frameworks that implement ageneral file system, persistent store for persistent objects,process switching, parallel processing, distributed processing,interrupt handling, virtual memory, networking, and interprocesscommunication.
If you bring an IBM/PC 386-based portable computer runningMS-DOS to the course then you may experiment by writing applicationprograms for PC-Choices. All participants will receive a copy ofPC-Choices on a floppy.
Participants should have experience with buildingobject-oriented systems and have a basic understanding of operatingsystems design. Reading knowledge of C++ is helpful, but notnecessary.
