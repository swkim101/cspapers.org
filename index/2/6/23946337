We compare the performance of three notable selective switch-based large-scale ROADM/OXC architectures that can make the best use of existing optical switch technologies for realizing bandwidth-abundant optical networks. We then analyze the tradeoff between node routing flexibility and hardware scale requirement in selective switch-based ROADM/OXC networks. The impact of WSS/WBSS degree on the network performance and the efficient WBSS cost bound are also evaluated.
