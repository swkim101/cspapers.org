The increasing complexity, distribution, and dynamism of many software-intensive systems impose self-managing capabilities as key requirements. These systems must be able to adapt themselves at runtime to cope with changes in operating environments, variability of resources, new user needs, intrusions, or faults. The goal is to preserve effective, secure, and safe operation and react to changes with no (or limited) human intervention. 
 
Solutions to complement software systems with self-managing and self-adaptive capabilities have been proposed by researchers in many different areas, including software architecture, fault-tolerant computing, robotics, control systems, programming languages, runtime program analysis and verification, and biologically-inspired computing. The SEAMS Symposium focuses on the software engineering aspects, including the methods, techniques, and tools that can be used to support self-adaptive, self-managing, self-healing, selfoptimizing, and self-configuring software systems. The objective of the SEAMS Symposium is to bring together researchers and practitioners from many diverse areas to investigate, discuss, and examine thoroughly the fundamental principles, state of the art, and critical challenges of self-adaptive and self-managing systems.
