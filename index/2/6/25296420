Object-oriented languages have been moving into the mainstream of the undergraduate curriculum at an accelerating rate. We have developed a one semester compilers course centered on object-oriented languages. In this paper we discuss some of the major topic changes and technical changes dictated by the shift to object orientation. In particular, we show how to apply object-oriented design and the Visitor design pattern to the problem of implementing a multipass compiler for an object-oriented language.
