Artificial intelligence has had notable success in building high-performance game-playing programs to compete against the best human players; Deep Blue is the obvious example, but there are many more. However, the availability of fast and plentiful machines with large memories and disks creates the possibility of solving a game. This has been done before for simple or relatively small games. Checkers is a popular game of skill with a search space of 5x1020 possible positions. Within a year, checkers will be solved; our program will never lose (assuming that perfect-play checkers is a draw, as seems likely). But getting from the idea of solving checkers to the final result, well, thereby hangs a tale.
