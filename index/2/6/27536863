Recently, along with the rapid growth of the Web, the preservation efforts have also increased. As a consequence, large amounts of past Web data are stored in Web archives. This historical data can be used for better understanding of long-term page topics and characteristics. In this paper, we propose an interactive visualization system called Page History Explorer for exploring page histories. It allows for roughly portraying evolution of pages and summarizing their content over time. We use a temporal term cloud as a structure for visualizing prevailing and active terms appearing on pages in the past.
