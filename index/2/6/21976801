Online product reviews are one of the important opinion sources on the Web. This paper studies the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive or negative) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. Most existing approaches use a set of opinion words for the purpose. However, the semantic orientations of many words are context dependent. In this paper, we propose to use some linguistic rules to deal with the problem together with a new opinion aggregation function. Extensive experiments show that these rules and the function are highly effective. A system, called Opinion Observer, has also been built.
