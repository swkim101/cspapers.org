In this work we present a novel market based resource allocation framework named Virtual Workspaces Market. Our approach is to integrate Virtual Workspaces and some Tycoon components while developing while developing a new hybrid resource allocation policy which combines the advantages of leasing and auctions based mechanisms. The rationale behind the hybrid allocation policy is to have an efficient and flexible resource sharing environment that fulfill the conflicting user/provider requirements by exploiting the clients demands heterogeneity. Our solution builds on current advances of Virtualization and Grid technologies (i.e. an integration and extension of Virtual Workspaces, Tycoon and Xen Hypervisor components). The main contributions are: (I) A market-based framework that combines advantages of leasing and auction resource allocation models. (II) An analysis of a hybrid market based resource allocation policy, where users can choose between paying more to have a low-risk resource reservation or paying less and controlling resource shares via bids.
