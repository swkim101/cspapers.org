Since 1968 the University of Iowa Computer Science Department has used a locally developed <underline>E</underline>asy <underline>A</underline>ssembler <underline>SY</underline>stem (EASY) to accomplish a better comprehension of the concepts taught in the segment of the introductory computing course which dealt with internal structure and organization.
 In the fall of 1973 my attention focused on EASY (with all of its problems) as a likely candidate for a computerized-interactive-tutorial segment of this course. Since the consistency of use and precision in presentation were important aspects of teaching the concepts related to EASY, such an approach seemed natural.
