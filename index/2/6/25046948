We propose a system for reminding a user of information obtained through a web browsing experience. The system extracts keywords from the content of the web page currently being viewed and retrieves the context of past web browsing related tothe keywords. We define the context as a sequence of web browsing when many web pages related to the keyword were viewed intensively because we assume that a lot of information connected to the current content was obtained in the sequence.The information is not only what pages you viewed but also how you found those pages and what knowledge you acquired from them. Specifically, when you browse web pages, this system automatically displays a list of the contexts judged to be important in relation to the current web page. If you select the context, details of the context are shown graphically with marksindicating characteristic activities.
