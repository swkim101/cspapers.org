A SpeechWeb is a collection of hyperlinked applications, which are accessed remotely by speech browsers running on end-user devices. Links are activated through spoken commands. Despite the fact that protocols and technologies for creating and deploying speech applications have been readily available for several years, we have not seen the development of a Public-Domain SpeechWeb. In this paper, we show how freely available software and commonly used communication protocols can be used to change this situation.
