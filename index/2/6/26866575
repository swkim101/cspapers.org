This paper focused on modeling and controlling of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The presented model is developed based on the basic flux linkage, voltage and torque equations. In order to control the DFIG's active power, a suitable method based on PSO algorithm has been proposed. The simulation results show that the presented method is a useful way to improve the output power of DFIG.
