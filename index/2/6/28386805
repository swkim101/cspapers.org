This paper focuses on resource sharing in hierarchical fixed priority pre-emptive systems where a number of separate applications, each with its own server, reside on a single processor. It defines the hierarchical stack resource policy, an appropriate global resource access policy that bounds priority inversion and also limits interference due to overruns during resource access. The paper provides detailed response time analysis enabling the schedulability of application servers and tasks to be determined for systems with local and global resource access. This analysis is applicable to real-world systems where server-based applications need mutually exclusive access to shared resources such as communications buffers, peripheral devices, operating system calls and data structures shared with interrupt handlers
