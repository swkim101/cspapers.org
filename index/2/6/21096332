In this paper, we describe a formula for calculating the teaching workload for students who are studying off campus both on and off-line. Initially the faculty of information technology developed a proposal for calculating academic workloads. This proposal reflected the rigid teacher centred learning structures of traditional on-campus delivery and made no allowance for the services required by off-campus students. In response, teachers of off-campus students developed a complementary proposal, based on actual time logs, which reflected their student centred approach to learning. Contrary to popular wisdom, off-campus teaching was found to be more time-consuming than on-campus.
