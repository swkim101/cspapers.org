In computer technology one of the most important developments in recent years is that of microprocessors. Thousands and thousands of microcomputers, which use microprocessors as their central processing units, have been marketed today.
 We will discuss the actual course implementation of microprocessor topics in a typical undergraduate computer science curriculum. At the beginning, we will discuss how a microcomputer system is used in various aspects of computer science education. Then we will discuss how the subject matter of microprocessors can be integrated into an existing curriculum. In addition, a separate course sequence is suggested to provide good training for computer science majors who are seriously interested in microprocessor applications.
