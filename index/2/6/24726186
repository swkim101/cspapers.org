Load balancing has been widely used on the field of Cloud Computing, which makes sure that none of the existing resources are idle while other physical machines are being utilized by Cloud Computing providers. However, VMs of tenants may be migrated to a physical machine with potential attacks which may use memory caches as side channels. So the security problem coexisting on the same physical machine is an important barrier for enterprise to adopt of cloud computing. We present a new security load balancing architecture--Load Balancing based on Multilateral Security (LBMS) which can migrate tenants' VMs automatically to the ideal security physical machine when reach peak-load by index and negotiation. We are implementing our prototype based on CloudSim, a Cloud computing simulation. Our architecture makes an effort to avoid potential attacks when VMs migrate to physical machine due to load balancing.
