This paper discusses the role of participatory teaching methods in the computer science classroom. The list of these methods includes brainstorming, directed dialogues, small discussion groups, role playing, games, debates, panel discussions, and Socratic dialogues. The author has used such methods in Computers and Society classes and to a limited degree in Compiler Design, Computer Architecture and Operating Systems classes and believes that such techniques have a place in the computer science classroom. It is the aim of this paper to provide an overview of participatory teaching methods and their use in computer science education.
