At the direction of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Education Board, the ACM Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges (CCECC), has undertaken a project to produce IT curricular guidance which defines core IT competencies accompanied by well-designed assessment measures. To that end, the ACM CCECC convened a task force of subject matter experts from both academe and industry to define core IT learning outcomes which should be common to all associate-degree IT programs. Assessment consultants worked alongside these subject matter experts to create easy-to-use evaluation rubrics. The session will include an overview of the findings from this project including mappings to other curriculum models, as well as a discussion concerning curriculum, assessment and pedagogy of IT courses and programs at associate-degree granting institutions.
