A translator-level view of the circuit design has become of paramount importance for successful designs, especially in the very demanding context of high-performance microprocessor design in the deep-submicron regime. In this tutorial, such a transistor-level view will be adopted. The VLSI custom design problem will be approached from the three perspectives of transistor-level static timing analysis, fast transistor-level simulation, and transistor-level optimization process. Specifically, the first part of this tutorial will deal with the techniques used in transistor-level static timing, highlighting the differences between gate and transistor level techniques. It will also focus on how delay calculation, false path elimination and timing checks are performed at the transistor level for both combinational and sequential circuits. A fundamental ingredient of transistor-level static timing analyzers is a fast, event-driven transistor-level circuit simulator. The second part of this tutorial will present an important class of such simulators that uses simplified yet accurate transistor models. Simulators using piece-wise constant and piece-wise linear models will be described and contrasted. Methods for computing circuit sensitivities using these simulators will be covered. Finally, the third part will present some of the very recent advances in transistor-level circuit optimization. In particular, the timing-driven custom design problem will be rigorously formalized as a constrained, nonlinear optimization problem with respect to both the geometric and timing variables of the circuit. Although the resulting problems are large-scale, it will be shown how formal optimization algorithms can solve them efficiently. The tradeoffs between circuit size, device model accuracy, and algorithmic efficiency will be discussed, and generalizations of these techniques to simultaneous device and wire sizing will be considered.
