As the elderly population increases, the elderly care using inexpensive technological means becomes critical. This paper proposes novel scheduling algorithms for real-time indoor tracking of elderly residents, which is essential to assist and secure their independent living. Our scheduling algorithms are designed by harmonizing both sensing and communication signals and leveraging location-awareness and mobility-consciousness, in order to improve the tracking accuracy while reducing the energy consumption. We performed extensive experiments through both simulation and actual implementation. Our experimental result says that our scheduling algorithms can provide real-time tracking of residents within 20 cm error bound in the typical range of human mobility
