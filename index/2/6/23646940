The Measurement-Based Probabilistic Timing Analysis (MBPTA) computes probabilistic Worst-Case Execution Time (pWCET) estimates with the Extreme Value Theory (EVT) from measurements of tasks execution time. In this work we approach the MBPTA open problems by proposing guidelines for a formal and correct EVT application. Statistical analyses of measurement of execution times, the EVT parameters selection, the pWCET reliability and the worst-case guarantees are investigated in order to provide the best possible MBPTA. The MBPTA enhancements proposed are validated with test cases from both artificially time randomized real-time systems and non-time randomized real-time systems.
