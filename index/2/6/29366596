In this paper the problem of selecting an appropriate programmable cell structure for FPGA architecture design is addressed. The cells studied here can be configured to the desired functionality by applying input permutation, negation, bridging or constant assignment, or output negation. A general methodology to determine logic description of such cells, which are capable of being configured to a given set of functions is described.
Experimental results suggest that the new cell behaves as well as the Actel 2 cell in terms of logic power but requires substantially less area and wiring overhead.
