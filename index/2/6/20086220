The Open MPI Project is a growing community surrounding an open source implementation of the Message Passing Interface, developed in a collaboration between research institutions, HPC vendors, and US national laboratories. Open MPI has evolved into a high performance, scalable MPI implementation, providing a highly modular architecture that not only adapts to a wide variety of environments, but also uniquely lends itself to HPC research.The meeting will consist of three parts:1. Members of the Open MPI core development team will be presenting the current status of Open MPI. 2. Discuss possible future directions for Open MPI, actively soliciting feedback from real-world MPI users and ISVs with MPI-based products. 3. Active discussion about how HPC researchers can leverage the Open MPI project for their own work, and how MPI users can obtain the best performance out of real-world applications.
