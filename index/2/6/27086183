Evaluating the scientific impact of scholars has been studied by researchers from various disciplines for a long time. However, very few efforts have been devoted to evaluate the future potential of researchers based on their performance at the initial stage of scientific careers. Academic rising stars represent junior researchers who may not be very outstanding among the peers at the initial stage of their careers, but tend to become influential scholars in the future. In this paper, we propose a novel method named CocaRank, which integrates our proposed new indicator called the collaboration caliber, the typical indicator citation counts and hybrid calculation results on heterogeneous academic networks, to find academic rising stars. In addition, we investigate the appropriate time interval for the prediction of rising stars. The experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that our method can find more top ranked rising stars with higher average citation counts than other state-of-art methods.
