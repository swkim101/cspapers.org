Any ordinary panel member on an ordinary panel can sit up front and spout the same old stuff. The panelists for this event must be agile in the strictest sense of the word. Why? Because they will be asked to take a random position in response to questions from both the moderators and the audience. They must present their arguments in a timed two-minute speech or present a rebuttal of the initial points in the same restricted two-minute interval. The assignment to the position will be made by the moderators. Don't miss this one.
