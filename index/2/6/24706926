The organization and outline for the Information Systems in the Computer Science program is shown. The interfaces between the course sequence for Information Systems and the courses in Computer Science are shown. How the sequence meets the ACM standards for Information Systems are also shown. The methods and approaches to teaching the five course sequence is also shown. The Information Systems option is very important in our university setting where almost all of our graduates at the two year level go directly to the work place and then continue their education on a part-time basis for their four-year degree.
