The ACL2 theorem prover---the current incarnation of "the" Boyer-Moore theorem prover---is a theorem prover for an extension of a first-order, applicative subset of Common Lisp. The ACL2 system provides a useful specification and modeling language as well as a useful mechanical theorem proving environment. ACL2 is in use at several major microprocessor manufacturers to verify functional correctness of important components of commercial designs. This talk explores the design of ACL2 and the tradeoffs that have turned out to be pivotal to its success.
