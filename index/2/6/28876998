Behavioural analysis has become an important method of today's malware research. Malicious software is executed inside a controlled environment where its runtime behaviour can be studied. Recently, we proposed the concept of not only observing individual executables but a computer system as a whole. The basic idea is to identify malware by detecting anomalies in the way a system behaves. In this paper we discuss our methodology for empirical malware research and highlight its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we explain the challenges we faced during our research and describe our lessons learned.
