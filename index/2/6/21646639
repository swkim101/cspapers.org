There has been much research on capturing and berthing damaged satellites in space, and such systems are categorized as reconfigurable multibody systems whose constraint conditions are time varying. On the other hand the theory for reconfigurable multibody dynamics is not well developed. There are many technical issues such as the dynamics algorithm with topological changes, contact dynamics, collision detection and computation of Jacobian matrices concerned with constraint conditions, and so on. We propose the algorithms to solve and implement some of these issues.
