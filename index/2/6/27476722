UTeach Computer Science Principles (CSP) is a classroom-ready curriculum designed in alignment with the CSP framework and endorsed by the College Board for Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles implementation. Piloted in dual enrollment format with 700 high school students, and refined iteratively from 2011--2015, UTeach CS Principles is now being offered in about 300 high schools, and preliminary data suggest great promise for broadening the participation of students from historically underrepresented groups in computing. Building on UTeach's foundation of teacher preparation and advocacy, UTeach CS Principles teachers receive intensive implementation training and support, including comprehensive teacher materials, regional summer workshops, regular remote micro-workshops during the school year, dedicated phone/email coaching, and access to an online professional learning community. The UTeach professional learning model encourages the participation of teachers with a variety of backgrounds and levels of experience, and leverages participating teachers' diverse areas of expertise to strengthen learning and support opportunities for all participants. By 2017, online professional learning modules will be available to rural teachers and others who are otherwise unable to attend a summer workshop. K-12 educators and school and district administrators should plan to attend this hands-on workshop. Presenters will engage participants in demonstration lessons and activities, and participants will leave with materials for immediate use in K-12 computer science classrooms. Opportunities for professional learning and support also will be discussed. Laptops are required.
