In recent years, the enforcement of safety features like seatbelt and reactive automotive technologies like lane assistance system etc. have enabled drivers to drive more safely and effectively. Better safety can be achieved by using proactive technologies to predict driver's intentions ahead of time and inform surrounding drivers of the course of the current action. This work introduces a novel system to predict driver's intention based on Electroencephalography (EEG).
