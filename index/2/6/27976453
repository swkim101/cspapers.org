The paper presents a two stages distributed algorithm for cooperative manipulating an unknown object rigidly grasped by mobile manipulators, in the absence of both a central unit and any explicit information exchange among robots. In the first stage, robots cooperatively estimate the object kinematic and dynamic parameters by properly moving the object or applying specific contact wrenches. In the second stage, the estimated parameters are used in a distributed cooperative algorithm aimed at controlling the object pose while limiting both the squeezing wrenches exerted by the manipulators and the wrench exerted by the environment on the object. Numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.
