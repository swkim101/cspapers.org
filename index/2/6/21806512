A man/computer input interface is described in this paper. This interface allows human control of the frequency, amplitude, spectral content and envelope of real-time sound production.
 The interface consists of a two-dimensional array of keys for entering data, latches and comparators to signal changes in key depression, hardware for scanning the keyboard and address generation logic. Both the fundamental frequency represented by each key column and the harmonics of each frequency—represented by each element in the column—are programmable. Amplitude and envelope are software controlled.
 Applications of the interface instrument range From music composition to clinical use in auditory testing. The interface is part of an electronic sound generation system presently being designed and constructed.
