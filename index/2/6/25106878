A working group, representing ACM, DPMA, and IEEE-CS, was formed to draft a set of guidelines, including criteria, for the accreditation of computer information systems' undergraduate programs. The guidelines and criteria are summarized below.
Faculty: Typically a minimum of 4 faculty, with 3 full time, are needed. Normally, 25% of a faculty member's time should be available for scholarly activity and development. Teaching loads should not exceed 12 hours and should not exceed 4 courses with 2 preparations.
Curriculum: Curricular assume a 120 semester hour, four year, baccalaureate program. The program should consist of approximately 30% computer information systems, 20% business, at least 40% in general education and up to 10% other.
Forty to 60 percent of the CIS portion should cover a broad core that includes a) computer concepts and software systems, b) program, data, and file structures, c) data management,
d) data and computer communications, and e) systems analysis and design. Students should be exposed to a variety of programming languages and be proficient in one structured language. The remaining courses should cover breadth and depth.
Resources: Appropriate computing facilities must exist for students and faculty. Adequate software and documentation must be available.
Students: Established standards and procedures must insure that graduates have the requisite qualifications to function as CIS professionals.
Institutional Support: Adequate support must be provided to support the faculty, department office administration, and library. Faculty support includes leave programs, reasonable teaching loads, competitive salaries, and travel support.
