This paper proposes an online identification of the MIMO ARX-Laguerre model by giving an analytical solution to optimize the Laguerre poles and using recursive identification of Fourier coefficients. Theses parameters characterizing MIMO ARX-Laguerre model are identified basing on the regularised square error. The Laguerre poles optimization and the Fourier coefficients identification procedures are realized on a sliding window in order to generate an online identification algorithm of the MIMO ARXâĂbŞLaguerre model. This algorithm is tested on a benchmark : the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR).
