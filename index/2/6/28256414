During the 1960â€™s, Margaret Mead commented in lectures that American universities were 500 years out of date. The invention of the printing press, she said, made lectures obsolete. Why should a student sit through a lecture when the same stodent can read the material at his or her own pace, freely rereading any unclear portions, while only skimming those that are already understood? That is, the textbook is a much better vehicle for presenting many forms of material than is the lecture. Continuing in this vein, we claim that for many materials, computer technology is a better presentation vehicle than textbooks that for these topics, textbooks are obsolete. Most courses teach in two stages: presenfafim of new material, usually via lectures or readings, and practice of that material, usually via labs or assigned exercises. Students are generally passive recipients of information in the presentation stage. We strongly believe that students should be active participants in both stages. Neither lecture nor text creates active learners.
