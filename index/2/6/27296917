With the double-digit rate of increase in the cost of energy, transportation and personnel and the double-digit rate of decrease in the cost of computing and communications, the demand to bring remote information to users via data networks for cost savings and convenience is overwhelming.
 Drs. Jackson and Roberts, both associated with operating public networks, will discuss the types of future network service to be offered to the public.
 Monsieur Pouzin and Dr. Uncapher will address user acceptance. Wide acceptance from the public of a network service requires easy access.
 LOUIS POUZIN'S REMARKS:
 Instead of guessing what future network services will be, I would rather present my expectations.
 A summary of my expectations could fit in a few key statements:
 1. Unobtrusive access to network services
 2. Responsible commercial organizations
 3. Human-oriented services
 Now, some developments might be useful.
