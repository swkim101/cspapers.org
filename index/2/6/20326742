One of main drawback of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) which causes non-linearity at power amplifier stage. In this paper a new technique for reducing PAPR of the OFDM signal is implemented. This method does not spread the OFDM signal bandwidth and no additional IFFT has to be performed thus has less computational complexity.
