A series of Japanese full-text retrieval experiments were conducted using an inference network document retrieval model. The retrieval performance of two major indexing methods, character-based and word-based, were evaluated. Using structured queries, the character-based indexing performed retrieval as well as, or slightly better, than the word-based system. This result has practical significance since the character-based indexing speed is considerably faster than the traditional word-based indexing. All the queries in this experiment were automatically formulated from natural language input.
