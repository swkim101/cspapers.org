Many colleges and universities offer an introductory computer science course based on a specific programming language. The Department of Computer Science at the University of Kansas has recently reorganized its introductory computer science course to include such topics as algorithms, top-down algorithmic design, elementary programming techniques, and introduction to time-sharing. Besides the discussion of this transition, the paper discusses a questionaire that was developed and utilized during this transition. It is hoped that others will benefit from our experiences.
