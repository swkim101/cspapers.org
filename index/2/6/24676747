In this paper, we study the reliability-security tradeoff for a secondary network in an underday cognitive radio (CR) environment. In the proposed protocol, a secondary transmitter (ST) transmits its data to a secondary receiver (SR) in presence of a secondary eavesdropper (SE) that tries to overhear the ST data. Moreover, a secondary jammer (SJ) that harvests energy from the radio frequency (RF) signals received from the ST is used to transmit jamming signals to the SE. For performance evaluation, we derive exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions of the outage probability (OP) at the SR and the intercept probability (IP) at the SE over Nakagami-m fading channels. Finally, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to verify the theoretical results.
