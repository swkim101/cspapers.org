Petascale computing infrastructures make petascale demands on information storage capacity, performance, concurrency, reliability, availability, and manageability. The last decade has shown that parallel file systems can barely keep pace with high performance computing along these dimensions; this poses a critical challenge when near-future petascale requirements are considered. This recurring workshop focuses on the data storage problems and emerging solutions found in petascale scientific computing environments, with special attention to issues in which community collaboration can be crucial, problem identification, workload capture, solution interoperability, standards with community buy-in, and shared tools. This one-day workshop is composed of six topic areas: Performance & Benchmarking Results & Tools; Failure Tolerance Problems & Proposals; API (POSIX, etc) Standards Problems & Proposals; Protocol Standards Problems & Proposals; New Projects Showcase (NSF HECURA etc); and New Funding Directions (HEC IWG Debrief etc).
