The introduction of specialized hardware platforms for connectionist modeling ("connectionist supercomputer") has created a number of research topics. Some of these issues are controversial, e.g. the efficient implementation of incremental learning techniques, the need for the dynamic reconfiguration of networks and possible programming environments for these machines.
