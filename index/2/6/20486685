Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems applying the Eigenbeam-Space Division Multiplexing (E-SDM) technique can be considered as optimal MIMO systems because of providing the highest channel capacity and good communications reliability. In the systems, orthogonal transmission beams are formed between transmit and receive sides; and also optimal transmit input data are adaptively allocated. In addition, a simple detection can be used at receiver to totally eliminate sub-stream interference. Therefore, MIMO E-SDM systems have been considered as a good potential technology for future high speed data transmission networks. Although there have been a lot of technical papers evaluated the systems based on theory analyses and/or computer-based simulation, just few ones have been considered the MIMO E-SDM systems based on hardware design. The main contribution of this paper is to present our own full design and implementation of 2×2 and 2×3 MIMO E-SDM systems on FPGA Altera Stratix DSP Development KIT using Verilog HDL, an important step before going to make integrated circuits. The biterror rate performance of these systems has shown that our design is successful. In the paper, we also show the consumption of FPGA elements for our design of the systems.
