Problem solving is a powerful teaching methodology for computer science -- giving students a real problem to solve instead of simply discussing abstract concepts can motivate them and give them a path to better understanding. However, it is challenging to create novel example problems that are meaningful and engaging yet can be easily understood by all students. In this workshop, we will introduce participants to the vibrant world of pencil puzzles and show how many different types of puzzles can be used for a variety of topics throughout the introductory CS curriculum. Pencil puzzles are those designed to be solved by hand with pencil and paper (such as Sudoku, but including dozens of new types!) that have clear rules and are made to be solved deductively. As such, they are explicitly designed to be easy to understand and intriguing and naturally inspire algorithmic thought. We will explore a variety of on-line resources, including our own curated repository, to see how assignments throughout the introductory CS curriculum can be easily kept fresh. Participants will also experience a sample problem-solving session and collaboratively develop a new assignment for a topic of the group's choice. This workshop is intended for all teachers (late secondary and post-secondary) of introductory programming courses. Laptops are recommended.
