This paper tackles the problem of providing differentiated material handling services in a highly automated environment of 300mm wafer foundry manufacturing. A preemptive dispatching policy is proposed and studied to expedite the movement of high priority products while keeping the incurred delays on regular ones being acceptable. Simulation experiments based on realistic data from a local 300mm foundry fab are conducted. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed policy is sound in reducing the transport delay of high priority products to the extreme. Some features of the policy are also explored.
