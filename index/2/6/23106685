This paper presents Storyfinder, an application which consists of a browser plugin and a web server backend with the goal to highlight and manage the information contained in web pages by combining techniques from natural language processing and visual analytics. Webpages are analyzed while visiting them by means of natural language processing components, and metadata in the form of named entities and keywords are extracted and stored for further reference. The extracted information is instantaneously highlighted in the web page and stored in a graph of entities and relations. The graph can be inspected and modified. The investigational scope can be set to a single web page, multiple web pages, or the complete set of analyzed web pages in a user's history. The graph view is designed to adhere to standards of visual analytics and information visualization. Storyfinder is available as an open source application. Its benefit for information access is evaluated in a small user study.
