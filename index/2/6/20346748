The objective of the 1st Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TWAW) is to provide a venue for researchers of all domains (IE/IR, Web mining etc.) where the temporal dimension opens up an entirely new range of challenges and possibilities. The workshop's ambition is to help shaping a community of interest on the research challenges and possibilities resulting from the introduction of the time dimension in Web analysis. The maturity of the Web, the emergence of large scale repositories of Web material, makes this very timely and a growing sets of research and services (recorded future1, truthy2 launched just in the last months) are emerging that have this focus in common. Having a dedicated workshop will help, we believe, to take a rich and cross-domain approach to this new research challenge with a strong focus on the temporal dimension.
