The approach taken to teach the first undergraduate course in computer science varies a great deal. The one that places major emphasis on the teaching of a programming language is still widely used. We find many drawbacks with this approach. In our opinion, the discussion of introductory computer concepts and problem-solving techniques should precede the coverage of the syntax of a programming language. It is also our belief that basic data structure concepts should be presented in the first course and discussed independently of any particular programming language considerations. Finally, we don't subscribe to the view that teaching of programming styles should be delayed until later courses. With these ideas in view, we present in this paper the outline of a one-year beginning course for the computer science undergraduate degree program.
