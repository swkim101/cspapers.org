A micron-sized arm which has large work space and uses reversible TiNi thin film is proposed. The transformation characteristics as analyzed by the DSC method shows that RTiNi can be controlled around 60/spl deg/C. The design method and fabrication process for the arm are described, and the arm was fabricated on silicon wafer. It was shown that micron sized arm using three RTiNi thin films could be fabricated based on the trial fabrication of simple micron sized arm using a RTiNi thin film.
