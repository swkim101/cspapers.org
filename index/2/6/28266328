The effect of touchscreen inclination and elbow support on arm fatigue was studied in a factorial design. Inclinations were 0°, 22.5°, 30° 45°, 60° and 90° from horizontal. The subjects could or could not rest the elbow on the desk. Results indicated that an inclination of 22.5° was least fatiguing. The inclination of 30° got the highest preference ratings, however, 90° was the poorest inclinations with respect to both fatigue and precision. For all inclinations elbow support reduced arm fatigue.
