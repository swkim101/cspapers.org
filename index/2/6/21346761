Despite being laden with elaborate features and time-saving gadgetry, modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) continue to be little more than turbocharged text editors with loosely integrated compilers. Years of incremental evolution of these environments have created a species of large, lumbering, often incomprehensible products with little direct support for the day-to-day tasks that developers actually find themselves doing.
 In our poster we outline a fresh tool platform - development of which is well under way - which defines a revolutionary new environment for software development. Program editing is considered first and foremost as a direct manipulation of a rich semantic model whose persistent representation as plain-text source code is somewhere between conveniently incidental and almost entirely irrelevant.
