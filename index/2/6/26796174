This video presents an application of geodesic computation on 3D meshes to surface remeshing. The connectivity of the resulting mesh is computed using a geodesic Delaunay triangulation of the sampling points. The user can provide a speed function to conform the remeshing to various contraints such as curvature variation or texture gradient. This remeshing method is fast thanks to the use of the fast marching algorithm. It is simple to implement, robust and can serve as a basis building block for further processing of the surface such as segmentation or flattening.
