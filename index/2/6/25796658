The author's state-space learning system has effectively optimized the coefficients of linear evaluation functions. The incremental approach uses statistical performance measures from completed solutions to bootstrap the heuristic, which estimates probability of task usefulness. These statistics are clustered in feature space, forming a mediating knowledge structure (region set) between the direct performance measures and the generalized evaluation function. The regions are data-determined, insensitive to noise, and allow management of interacting features through natural piecewise linearity. Early experiment with non linearity indicates stability, flexibility and improved task performance.
