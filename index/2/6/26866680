This paper discusses the need in a na tura l language understanding system fo r a model of the speaker and of the conversat ion process i t s e l f . Most current programs use models of the domain of discourse to supply the knowledge necessary to understand what is being ta lked about. (See, e . g . , Schank[1973] or Charmak[ 1972 J. ) For example, Schank's system might contain a res taurant " s c r i p t " , l i s t i n g a l l o f the act ions one normally does at a res taurant , from enter ing and being seated to paying the check and leav ing . Such systems appear to be based on the idea that na tu ra l language tex ts are mostly asser t ions about the domain of d iscourse, and can be mapped i n t o add i t ions to a data base invo l v ing t h i s domain. However, examination of rea l English tex ts suggests that much of it has other purposes.
