The game of Sprouts has intrigued mathematicians for nearly twenty years. This paper describes a representation scheme which simplifies much of the geometry of the game. Using this representation, we develop a Prolog program which will play Sprouts. It is hoped that the program will prove to be a useful research tool in finding the key to a winning strategy for Sprouts and that the representation will serve as a useful model for studying planar graphs.
