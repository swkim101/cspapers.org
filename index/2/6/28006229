Missing data is a severe problem for algorithms that operate over knowledge graphs (KGs). Most previous research in KG completion has focused on the problem of inferring missing entities and missing relation types between entities. However, in addition to these, many KGs also suffer from missing entity types (i.e. the category labels for entities, such as /music/artist). Entity types are a critical enabler for many NLP tasks that use KGs as a reference source, and inferring missing entity types remains an important outstanding obstacle in the field of KG completion. Inspired by recent work to build a contextual KG embedding model, we propose a novel approach to address the entity type prediction problem. We compare the performance of our method with several state-of-the-art KG embedding methods, and show that our approach gives higher prediction accuracy compared to baseline algorithms on two real-world datasets. Our approach also produces consistently high accuracy when inferring entities and relation types, as well as the primary task of inferring entity types. This is in contrast to many of the baseline methods that specialize in one prediction task or another. We achieve this while preserving linear scalability with the number of entity types.
