Advanced information technology has become a key enabler in modern media and entertainment. This comprises the production of animation or live action films, the design of next-generation toys and consumer products, or the creation of richer experiences in theme parks. At Disney Research Zurich, more than 200 researchers and scientists are working at the forefront of innovation in entertainment technology. Our research covers a wide spectrum of different fields, including graphics and animation, human computer interaction, wireless communication, computer vision, materials and design, robotics, and more. In this talk I will demonstrate how innovations in information technology and computational methods developed at Disney Research are serving as platforms for future content creation. I will emphasize the transformative power of 3D printing, digital fabrication, and our increasing ability to make the whole world responsive and interactive.
