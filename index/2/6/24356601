Flexibility, determinism, fault-tolerance and high-speed are features that make FlexRay networks one of the newest x-by wire communication systems. It offers reliable and real-time capable high-speed data transmission between components. In the same context, the real-time middleware, Data Distribution Service (DDS) is an appropriate alternative for the standard vehicular middleware. In the present paper, we have implemented a vehicle Simulink Blockset model, precisely the chassis domain. The proposed blockset corresponds to the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE benchmark model connected by the FlexRay Bus. We have chosen the Embedded Matlab tool for implementing this blockset. It permits us to generate C code for different blocks in order to validate the vehicle system design. In this paper, we have focused our interest on the Blockset Simulink implementation of the Active Frame Steering and Electronic Brake Control models. Then we have identified the DDS Data Readers and Data Writers adapted to this Blockset using the FlexRay Network.
