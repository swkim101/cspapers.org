This workshop follows a history of successful workshops at OOPSLA around topics in software engineering for pervasive systems. It is known to spawn fruitful and lively discussions from a variety of participants from industry and academia.Sensor networks and Pervasive Computing solutions offer the potential to significantly change business processes, across all industries. Computing and connectivity gets woven into everyday life. Technologies in this space are constantly changing. New wireless protocols, operating systems, and new applications are emerging. Architectures are very highly distributed and often influenced by physical characteristics. The embedded functionality needs to get complemented with corresponding back-end components and services. This workshop will bring together practitioners who have actively been involved in the development of sensor networks and pervasive computing solutions, researchers who have been working in this area, and professionals who have been involved in the definition of standards. The goals are (1) to identify recurring architecture themes and patterns, (2) to raise issues and identify gaps for implementation that need to be resolved; and (3) to discuss new ideas and changes to object technology to better support Sensor Networks and Pervasive Computing Topics of interest include but are not limited to the theory and practice of pervasive sensor networks, emerging standards, development methods, security and privacy, architecture, infrastructure, middleware, quality of service, energy efficiency, adaptability and learning, energy conservation, peer-to-peer systems, mobile agents, integration of heterogeneous components, application case studies, experience reports, adaptation and learning, alternative programming models such as Aspect- and and Ambient-Oriented Programming, modeling, simulation, verification and testing.
