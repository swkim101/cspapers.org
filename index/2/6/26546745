This paper presents a technique for determining the mission and location-dependent importance of accurate position knowledge for an autonomous mobile robot. We show how map data may be analyzed in the context of any given mission to yield a new map which indicates differences in the sensitivity of action choices to position errors. The identification of these differences provides a vnluable resource for focusing the attention of available localization pmesses.
