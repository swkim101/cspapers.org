In eukaryotic genomes, at least two adjacent duplicates of pattern nucleotides are considered as a tandem repeat. They are the major causes of several genetic diseases. Consequently, locating and characterizing them is of a crucial importance. Bioinformatics tools still very unsatisfactory in this domain, to use them, we need to have a preliminary knowledge about repetition which cannot always be available. Signal and image processing researchers turned towards different directions and looked up for more efficient methods to overcome bioinformatics tools inconvenience. In this paper we proceeded by using the S-Transform and tried several codings to sort the most convenient one for tandem repeats detection.
