It is unclear what triggers the behavior of active shooters, but their consequences are severe. There is opportunity to implement an automated response system capable of delivery guidance to evacuees' to aide people to safety. Optimizing guidance delivery is challenging because active shooter incidents evolve quickly and are unpredictable. In this paper, we develop a new problem formulation specific for active shooter events by utilizing the structure of each room. To effectively solve this problem, a divide-and-conquer approach is deployed to split evacuees into groups. The egress routes are decomposed and coordinated for each group are optimized using stochastic dynamic programming. Numerical testing and simulation show our solution with a safe room the solution fast relevant to shooting events and effectively.
