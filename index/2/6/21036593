We propose a 2.5D video editing system called DDMixer2.5D. 2.5D video contains not only color channels but also a depth channel, which can be recorded easily using recently available depth sensors, such as Microsoft Kinect. Our system employs this depth channel to allow a user to quickly and easily edit video objects by using simple drag-and-drop gestures. For example, a user can copy a video object of a dancing figure from video to video simply by dragging and dropping using finger on the touch screen of a mobile phone handset. In addition, the user can drag to adjust the 3D position in the new video so that contact between foot and floor is preserved and the size of the body is automatically adjusted according to the depth. DDMixer2.5D has other useful functions required for practical use, including object removal, editing 3D camera path, creating of anaglyph 3D video, as well as a timeline interface.
