A running system is presented which provides powerful support to the user while designing programs. 
 
This system automatically constructs program schemas by decomposition of the datas involved in the specification . Datas are specified with in a knowledge-base as data types having associated decomposition patterns. 
 
The user may combine different data - decomposition strategies with any of its decomposition patterns. So it is possible to build several program schemas for the same problem. 
 
Once a program schema is built the user can instantiate or adapt it by hand. He can also apply the system repetitively until he obtains primitive problems which can be solved directly.
