In recent years, several disaster events (e.g., earthquakes in Nepal-India and Italy, terror attacks in Paris and Brussels) have proven the crucial role of Online Social Media (OSM) in providing actionable situational information. However, in such media, the crucial information is typically obscured by a lot of insignificant information (e.g., personal opinions, prayers for victims). Moreover, when time is critical, owing to the rapid speed and huge volume of microblogs, it is infeasible for human subjects to go through all the tweets posted. Hence, automated IR methods are needed to extract the relevant information from the deluge of posts. Though several methodologies have been developed for tasks like classification, summarization, etc. of social media data posted during disasters [5], there are still several research challenges that need to be addressed for effectively utilising social media data (e.g., microblogs) for aiding disaster relief operations
