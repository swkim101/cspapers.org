In the ever expanding universe of database skills and knowledge we propose a framework that can be used to classify advanced database topics. We use the framework to present five advanced database modules that can be successfully incorporated in an advanced database course. These modules were built to illustrate advanced topics and were tested and refined in advanced database courses over several semesters. The skills demonstrated in the modules go beyond what is typically taught in an the introductory level database course but are important in todayâ€™s highly demanding business environment.
