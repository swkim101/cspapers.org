Within computing, the imaging field includes computer vision, image understanding, and image processing. While much research and teaching is done at the graduate level, the typical imaging educator at an undergraduate institution is the only specialist in his or her department. This BOF brings together educators who currently teach imaging courses or may be interested in expanding curricular offerings. We will emphasize sharing best practices, ideas, and resources as well as building a network for continued cooperation. Discussion topics may include course organization, assignments and projects, and lecture aids or other materials. Our network will include a mailing list for participants to ask questions and share ideas about imaging pedagogy and other means of sharing course materials.
