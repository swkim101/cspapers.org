Opinions from people can either be biased or reflect low participation due to legitimate concerns about privacy and anonymity. To alleviate those concerns, the identity of a message sender should be disassociated from the message while the contents of the actual message should be hidden from any relaying nodes. We propose a novel message routing scheme based on probabilistic forwarding that guarantees message privacy and sender anonymity through additively homomorphic public-key encryption. Our scheme is applicable to anonymous surveys and microblogging.
