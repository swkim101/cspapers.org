It used to be the case that very little industry research was presented at SIGIR. Now the balance has radically changed -- many accepted papers have industry authors and many rely on industry data sets -- To the extent that a leading academic member of the SIGIR community has light-heartedly proposed the creation of an Academic Track. Behind the levity lies the important question of how a researcher can make a meaningful contribution to the field, in the absence of petabyte-scale sets of documents and massive user-interaction logs. Theoretical contributions can revolutionize thinking, but have greatest impact when applicable in practice, and when empirically validated. In my years at Funnelback and more recently at Microsoft I have been very aware of high-impact but not-well-solved IR problems involving relatively tiny datasets. Many of them are characterized by sparsity of user interaction data and are hence not well-suited to simple machine learning approaches or to large scale A/B testing. My talk will illustrate and attempt to characterize these problems and to suggest fruitful areas for academic research. If time permits, I will mention some areas in which academic research has contributed to current large-scale industry practice.
