Wi-Fi Aware is a new technique which enables devices to communicate with each other in the same vicinity without the help of access points. In this approach, we leverage Wi-Fi Aware technique and take field trials on the power efficiency of Wi-Fi Aware communications. Based on the experiment results, we conclude that the Wi-Fi Aware devices are suggested to transmit data with the help of proximity nodes according to their link speed so as to save energy.
