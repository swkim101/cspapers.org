Vehicle tracking system is built for a container terminal. In the system, reference nodes are fixed at known locations. They provide reference locations to a mobile node, which is installed in a vehicle. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is measured, and the measured data is gathered in a backend server. The backend server analyzes the data, and estimates the location of the mobile node. Filters are added to handle transient fluctuation in RF environment. SonnoOne mote is made to be used as a mobile node. It contains MG2455 chip from RadioPulse, which combines 8051 MCU and IEEE 802.15.4 radio. We expect the cost will be below $20, and the low cost will enable a large number of mobile nodes to be deployed in a container terminal.
