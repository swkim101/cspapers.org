Computing an optimal solution is believed to be NP-hard, and there is extensive work on approximation algorithms. Classic approaches exploit the algebraic structure of the underlying matrix, while more recent approaches use randomization. An entirely different approach that uses the A* heuristic search algorithm to find an optimal solution was recently proposed. Not surprisingly it is limited to effectively selecting only a small number of features. We propose a similar approach related to the Weighted A* algorithm. This gives algorithms that are not guaranteed to find an optimal solution but run much faster than the A* approach, enabling effective selection of many features from large datasets. We demonstrate experimentally that these new algorithms are more accurate than the current state-of-the-art while still being practical. Furthermore, they come with an adjustable guarantee on how different their error may be from the smallest possible (optimal) error. Their accuracy can always be increased at the expense of a longer running time.
