A micro-manipulation method based on adhesion forces and dynamic effects has been proposed in our previous papers. A prototype manipulator, called [mu]MAD, has been constructed and successfully experimented. This paper describes the advanced capabilities of [mu]MAD, especially two new interesting applications: sorting of micro-objects and mechanical characterizations.
