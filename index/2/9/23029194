In this paper, we present an electromyography (EMG)-driven assistive hand exoskeleton for spinal-cord-injury (SCI) patients. We developed an active assistive orthosis, called Maestro, which is light, comfortable, compliant, and capable of providing various hand poses. The EMG signals are obtained from a subject's forearm, post-processed, and classified for operating Maestro. The performance of Maestro is evaluated by a standardized hand function test, called the Sollerman hand function test. The experimental results show that Maestro improved the hand function of the SCI patients.
