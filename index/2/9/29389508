Authors are invited to submit papers to the 19th Symposium on Operating System Principles (SOSP) reporting on original research related to the design, implementation, analysis, evaluation, and deployment of operating systems. We seek submissions of high quality that significantly further the knowledge and understanding of the systems community. In keeping with SOSP tradition, we will favor work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialog, or reflects on experience with practical applications of the communityâ€™s knowledge. Papers of particular merit will be forwarded to ACM Transactions on Computer Systems for possible publication in a special issue. The symposium attracts attendees with diverse backgrounds. We solicit papers in the traditional core of the OS field, as well as in the interfaces to areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, and databases. Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:
