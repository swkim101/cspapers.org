c. The problem of making a set of stabilizing control laws, i.e. obtaining all, or almost all, control laws (algorithms), which provide stability for the closed-loop system, if the solution to the first problem, from those listed above, is not the only one. As a rule, the methods used are based on the solutions to Diophantine equations and the subsequent parameterization (for instance, the Youla-Kuĉera parametrization).7,9–12
