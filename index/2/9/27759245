This contribution is concerned with natural language dialogue about scenes with moving objects. Two systems are connected, a natural language dialogue system originally conceived for static scenes and an emerging scene analysis system for real-world TV-frame sequences. The latter produces time dependent object descriptions which serve as a referential database for inquiries. The time intervals relevant for answering the questions are determined from domain specific parameters, the context of the dialogue, the tense of the verbs and time adverbials. For checking the correspondence between a verbally specified motion and a trajectory, predicates are evaluated which can be deduced from the verb's case-frame.
