Historically, commercial hand prosthesis have adopted a low level of innovation mainly due to the strict conditions such a system must undergo. The difficult feedback to the prosthesis user has limited the functional range of commercial systems. Nevertheless, the use of advanced sensors in combination with performing hand mechanisms and microcontrollers could lead to more natural and functional prototypes. The Oxford and Manus intelligent hand prostheses are examples of innovative approaches. This paper compares and contrasts the technological solutions implemented in both systems to address the design conditions.
