Much interesting text n the web consists largely of opinionated or evaluative text, as opposed to directly informative text. The new field of 'sentiment analysis' seeks to characterize such aspects of natural language text, as opposed to just the bare facts. We suggest that 'appraisal expression extraction' should be viewed as a fundamental task for sentiment analysis. We define an 'appraisal expression' to be a piece of text expressing some evaluative stance towards a particular object. The task is to find these elements and characterize the type and orientation (positive or negative) of the evaluative stance, as well as its target and possibly its source. Potential applications of these methods include new approaches to the now-traditional tasks of sentiment classification and pinion mining, as well as possibly for adversarial textual analysis and intention detection for intelligence applications.
