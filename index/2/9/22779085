In this paper - scoped for the panel discussion at ISSTA 2002 - we are discussing some techniques to ease the adoption of testing techniques by the developers, by extending the debugging activity. We also briefly discuss a longer term vision where the same paradigm applies but at model level, when coding will be achieved using visual notations such as UML.
