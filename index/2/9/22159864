Polymorphous Computing Architectures (PCA) represent a significant leap in the capabilities of computing systems, but also a dramatic increase in software complexity and fragility. We present our synthesis of technologies generated to date in the DARPA-funded Morphware Forum, to develop a stable and scalable software development platform for PCA devices.
