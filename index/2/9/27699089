A single feed circularly polarized antenna is proposed for the GPS application. A new shaped circularly polarized dielectric resonator antenna (CP DRA) is presented. The proposed antenna structure includes dielectric disc that is made from Rogers TMM 10i. The DR lies on top of a hybrid ring. The hybrid ring is used to generate two quadrature signals, which are fed to two vertical excitation strips stuck on the side wall of the cylindrical DRA. Two modes HE11Î´ of the cylindrical DRA are utilized to design the wide band circular polarization. The simulated results show that the antenna can cover all GPS bands (L1\L2\L3\L4\L5), which has good impedance matching characteristics in the (1.07-1.60) GHz band. The hybrid ring is designed on popular substrate FR4 with a dielectric constant of 4.4. The simulated results are shown and discussed.
