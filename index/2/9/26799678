Research1 on M y c i n l i k e 2 consu l ta t i on systems i nd i ca tes tha t a rule-based system achieves be t te r performance i f guided by models of " t y p i c a l " consu l ta t i on s i t u a t i o n s . One very powerful form of reasoning used by a human consul tant when he is presented wi th a new s i t u a t i o n is tha t of c l a s s i f y i n g and comparing the new s i t u a t i o n w i th s i t u a t i o n s he has encountered p rev ious l y . For example, an auto mechanic who is asked to f i x a car which won't s t a r t w i l l check the s t a r t e r , the b a t t e r y , and the supply of gas because he is guided by h is model of a "car won't s t a r t " s i t u a t i o n , and tnus has expectat ions about the cause of the problem. The auto mechanic is also able to check the consistency of h is in fo rmat ion p rec i se l y because he has a model of the t y p i c a l f i nd i ngs f o r t h i s s i t u a t i o n . S i m i l a r l y , in our consu l ta t ion system, we use models of t y p i c a l consu l ta t ion s i t u a t i o n s to guide the invoca t ion of our r u l e s , and to check f o r i ncons is ten t i n f o rma t i on . Our models are f ramel i ke3 s t ruc tu res con ta in ing both modelindependent pieces of in fo rmat ion ca l l ed elements, such as a name and a c e r t a i n t y measure, and models p e c i f i c pieces o f in format ion ca l l ed the components of the model. For example, the components in a model of acute c y s t i t i s inc lude the age, sex and therapy fo r the t y p i c a l acute c y s t i t i s p a t i e n t . I n a b i l i t y to f i t in fo rmat ion i n t o one o r more of these models may i nd i ca te tha t there are i ncons i s tenc ies . For example, f i n d i n g s i c k l e c e l l anemia in a Caucasion pat ient is not cons i s t en t . I t may also i nd i ca te tha t the s t r uc tu re of the model is incomplete, f o r ins tance , tha t a component is m iss ing , or tha t t h i s is an a t y p i c a l s i t u a t i o n tha t is not represented in any model. There e x i s t s a h ierarchy of models, beginning at the top wi th a model of a general
