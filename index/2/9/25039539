Instructional use of computers is now common at many secondary schools and in elementary schools. The computer is recognized as a new and important educational medium, as a source of change in existing curriculum, as a new curriculum area. Thus there is growing awareness that pre-service elementary and secondary school teachers need some computer education. What are colleges of education doing to meet this challenge? A panel of faculty from several colleges of education will present their views and insights. They will point out successes, both at their own schools and on a national scale. They will also point out what still remains to be done. There will be time for input from the audience.
