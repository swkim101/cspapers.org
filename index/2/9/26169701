Since the decline of Pascal as a “standard” introductory language in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s, faculty members have adopted (and, often, discarded) a variety of languages for the introductory course: C, C++, Java, Modula-2, Ada, Python, Ruby, and more. Different approaches and different opinions have led to a number of “language wars” in the SIGCSE community, wars that we hope to avoid in this panel.
