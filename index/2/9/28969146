Privacy preserving distributed data mining has become a promising research area. This paper addresses the problem of association rule mining where the global database is vertically partitioned. When transactions are distributed in different sites, scalar product is a feasible tool to discover frequent itemsets. We present a new protocol to compute scalar product between two parties with a permutation approach. We analyze the protocol in detail and demonstrate its effectiveness and high privacy properties, and compare it to other published protocols.
