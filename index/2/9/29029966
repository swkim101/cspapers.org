While programming has long been utilized as a recruitment path into computer science, data analysis as a recruitment path is relatively under-explored. Through a series of modular curriculum units developed in computational thinking, the potential impact of explorations in data analysis to impact teacher and student affect toward and interest in computer science is being investigated. Developed units include exercises such as statistically determining the author of selected text passages, modeling roller coaster simulations, solving crime mysteries and controlling zombie contagions. Computational thinking modules have been delivered in a CS Pilot course, as well as in K-12 outreach programs in non-computing courses (STEM and non-STEM, including classes in English literature, sociology, biology, physics and math). Initial results show significant and promising opportunities to utilize data analysis to create computing interest in a broadened population of students and teachers, extending the impact of computational thinking into a variety of subject domains.
