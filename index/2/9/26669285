We propose some techniques to improve the exploration method based on BVP and demonstrate that, at least, for exploration in two dimensional space, we can reduce enormously the computation cost of the harmonic function method for exploration without losing the important properties of the method. Switching between local and global potential calculation and using an adaptive activation window result in a computationally efficient and refined mapping process.
