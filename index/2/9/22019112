We consider the total weighted completion time scheduling problem for parallel identical machines and precedence constraints, P jprecj P wiCi. We describe a family of natural scheduling algorithms that optimally solve the single machine problem, and show that they can be used to achieve good performance for the multiple machine problem. These algorithms are e cient and nd schedules that are on average within 1:9% of optimal over a large synthetic benchmark. We then consider the class of linear programming relaxations that have recently been successfully used to produce approximation algorithms for scheduling problems. We describe a new linear programming relaxation for the multiple machine problem that nds schedules that are within 0:39% of optimal over our benchmark. This research represents the rst experimental evaluation of various algorithms for the general WCT problem, and represents an extension of the results in Savelsbergh(1998) to multiple machines and in-tree, chains, and empty precedence constraints.
