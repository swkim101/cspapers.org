Significant advances are required to make systems more adaptive to the growing range of impulses affecting them and to reduce their total cost of management. Progress seems to require significant innovation in adaptive techniques, systems architecture, software engineering, and standards. In this presentation, I will survey the space of the requirements and draw example problems from real systems. I'll then discuss the space of our research at IBM and highlight some of the more compelling research projects we are doing in the area. I'll conclude with a summary of some key challenges for the broader community as they relate to autonomic computing.
