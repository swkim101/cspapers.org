In this special session, attendees will learn about techniques for teaching concepts of concurrency with Alice 3's latest release of a Java IDE plugin. The new plugin makes use of Java 8's lambda expression to provide a Do together control structure with simpler syntax. Using this technique and Java 8 plugin, students in early-level programming courses can make use of Alice's Do together control structure to create concurrent threads in their Java code.
