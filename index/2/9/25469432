K-12 teachers have an important role to play in introducing children to computer science. However, most teachers lack explicit training in computer science. This project explored questions related to the experiences of pre-service teachers as they mentored K-12 children in computer science in an informal learning environment. Through a grant-funded project at a comprehensive public university in the Southeastern United States, five pre-education major undergraduate students in an introductory education course learned basic computer programming, interacted with a K-12 computer science teacher around strategies for introducing computer science to kids, and mentored children in exploring computer science in an informal setting. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the data suggest these experiences were effective in increasing student awareness of critical issues related to computer science education, increasing their knowledge and skills related to Scratch, increasing their self-perception as potential mentors in basic computer programming concepts, and increasing their attraction to STEM majors and endorsements.
