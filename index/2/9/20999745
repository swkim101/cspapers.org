In the paper we consider minimizing the lk-norms of flow time on a single machine offline using a preemptive scheduler for k â‰¥ 1. We show the first O(1)-approximation for the problem, improving upon the previous best O(log log P)-approximation by Bansal and Pruhs (FOCS 09 and SICOMP 14) where P is the ratio of the maximum job size to the minimum. Our main technical ingredient is a novel combination of quasi-uniform sampling and iterative rounding, which is of interest in its own right.
