In this paper, we show the achievement of a transformable aerial robot with internal communication system for multiple objects transportation. As it is not easy to make the flight endurance of an aerial robot longer, we study the problem to transport multiple objects at the same time to improve the efficiency of transportation. However, for conventional aerial robots, multiple objects transportation is difficult because the CoG position changes when the number of grasped objects changes, resulting in the instability of the flight. Therefore, to solve this problem, we focus on the multirotor with two-dimensional multilinks proposed in our previous work, which possesses the ability to modify the CoG position actively and can keep the flight stable. First, we introduce the hardware platform including the structure of link module and internal communication system to achieve the extensibility in terms of the link number. We then propose a method to find the optimal form for the multilinks based on the flight stability. Finally, we present experimental results which include aerial transformation and multiple objects transportation.
