One million device systems on a chip will be partitioned into manageable subsystem building blocks. These basic building blocks will be equivalent in complexity to the chips of today. Using programmable elements such as ROMs and PLAs, these building blocks can be configured to implement a wide variety of different systems.
 CAD systems will evolve from a loosely coupled collection of programs to a system oriented around a common data base. This data base will allow more automation and will provide the information to close the design loop. Layout techniques will improve through the use of sophisticated on-line design systems. These systems should also access the data base to provide feedback to the designer in the form of circuit and logic checks.
 CAD systems of today are moving in the right direction and will meet the challenge of the 80's.
