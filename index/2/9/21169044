Parallel computing is primarily about achieving greater performance than is possible without using parallelism. Especially for the high-end, where systems cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, making the best use of these valuable and scarce systems is important. Yet few applications really understand how well they are performing with respect to the achievable performance on the system. The Blue Waters system, currently being installed at the University of Illinois, will offer sustained performance in excess of 1 PetaFLOPS for many applications. However, achieving this level of performance requires careful attention to many details, as this system has many features that must be used to get the best performance. To address this problem, the Blue Waters project is exploring the use of performance models that provide enough information to guide the development and tuning of applications, ranging from improving the performance of small loops to identifying the need for new algorithms. Using Blue Waters as an example of an extreme scale system, this talk will describe some of the challenges faced by applications at this scale, the role that performance modeling can play in preparing applications for extreme scale, and some ways in which performance modeling has guided performance enhancements for those applications.
