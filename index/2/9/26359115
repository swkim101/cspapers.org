Manufacturing tolerances, installation errors and link oflsets contaminate the nominal values of the kinematic parameters used in the kinematic model of the platform. Since the platform controller determines the length of the actuators according to the nominal model, the resulting pose of the platform is inaccurate. To enhance the positioning accuracy of the plarfrm, there is a need to determine the actual values of these parameters and how to incorporate them into the inverse kineniatic procedure performed by the controller. This paper presents and demonstrates by simulation a method by which these parameters can be identifled using pose measurements.
