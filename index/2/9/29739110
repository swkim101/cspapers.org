Despite the fact that more and more electronic design is comprised of analog and mixed signal content, the design flows and methodologies in this area are lagging behind the pace of innovation in digital design. For sure, analog designers are in shorter supply, but this only makes the need for improvements and efficiency that much greater. Only of late have we seen production-worth attempts at functions such as analog synthesis and optimization reach the market. What is needed in today's analog design flow? What are the key technologies that are missing? How does the existing “food chain” need to work together to drive greater efficiencies?
