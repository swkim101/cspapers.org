This tutorial aims to provide a practical introduction to conducting large-scale information retrieval (IR) experiments, using Terrier (http://terrier.org) as an experimentation platform. Written in Java, Terrier provides an open-source, feature-rich, flexible, and robust environment for large-scale IR experimentation. This tutorial will cover the experimentation process end-to-end, from configuring Terrier to a particular experimental setting, to efficiently indexing a document corpus and retrieving from it, and to evaluating the outcome. Moreover, it will describe how to use and extend the platform to one's own needs, and will be illustrated by practical research-driven examples. As a half-day tutorial, it will be split into two major sessions, with each session comprising both background information and practical demonstrations. In the first session, we will provide an overview of several aspects of large-scale IR experimentation, spanning areas such as indexing, data structures, query languages, and advanced retrieval models, and how these are implemented within Terrier. In the second session, we will discuss how to extend Terrier to conduct one's own experiments in a large-scale setting, including how to facilitate the evaluation of non-standard IR tasks through crowdsourcing. The practical demonstrations will cover recent use cases identified from Terrier's online discussion forum, so as to provide attendees with concrete examples of what can be done within Terrier.
