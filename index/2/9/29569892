This workshop is for high school and college teachers of general-interest ("CS 0") computer science courses, especially the AP CS: Principles course. SNAP! (Build Your Own Blocks) is a free, browser-based, graphical, drag-and-drop language inspired by Scratch. The beauty of the Scratch programming environment, designed for 8-14 year olds, is that it makes abstract concepts more concrete and understandable to a broader audience. SNAP! extends Scratch to support older learners (14-20) with built-in named procedures (thus recursion), procedures as data (thus higher order functions), structured lists, and sprites as first class objects with inheritance. Participants will learn SNAP! hands-on. See http://snap.berkeley.edu for details. Network connected laptop required.
