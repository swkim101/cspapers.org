With the introduction of dynamic microprogrammer computers, it becomes practical to reconfigure the architecture of a computer to more efficiently represent programs. A number of methods have been proposed and investigated for reducing the redundancy of computer op codes, address and data items. The greatest gains have come from frequency based encoding. Wilner 9 reports 40 to 70 percent reduction of program size using frequency based encoding for instructions and addresses combined with tailored instruction sets. This paper examines the effect on program size of various architectural features assuming frequency based encoding. It is primarily oriented toward the reduction of program memory by selection of instructions and features to microcode, but applicable to the structure of the underlying micro machine and the compressed storage of any type of symbol string.
