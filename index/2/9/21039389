Globalization is flattening the world. As database researcher, we are proud that information technology is a critical enabler of globalization. At the same time, we are seeing that research and development of information technology is also being globalized.In recent years, many R&D labs were established in Asia, especially, in India and China, by global IT companies. Some of our colleagues have moved with globalization to establish new labs or to lead R&D in newly established labs. For those who have not moved physically, it is common to work with colleagues at remote labs with time difference.The objective of this panel is to invite pioneers leading R&D globalization and to share their vision and challenges, and to discuss how globalization impacts the future of database and information management research, education, and industry.
