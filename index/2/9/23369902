This paper addresses the problem of multi-robots object transportation by using the concept of object closure. Once object closure is achieved, the robots can cooperatively drag or flow the trapped object to the desired goal. In this paper, we address the concept CC-closure object used for efficient testing of object closure. Properties of the CC-closure object and testing algorithm are described. Finally, an example of object closure constructed from both bodies and hands of mobile-manipulators is discussed and an experiment is presented for illustrating the proposed concept.
