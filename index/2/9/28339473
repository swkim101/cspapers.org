In widely-used actor-based programming languages, such as Erlang, sequential execution performance is as important as scalability of concurrency. We are developing a virtual machine called Pyrlang for the Erlang BEAM bytecode with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. By using RPython’s tracing JIT compiler, our preliminary evaluation showed approximately twice speedup over the standard Erlang interpreter. In this poster, we overview the design of Pyrlang and the tech- niques to apply RPython’s tracing JIT compiler to BEAM bytecode programs written in the Erlang’s functional style of programming.
