With the advance of XML, DTD's, XML-Schema, X-Path, X-Link, XML-Query, XML-Protocol, RDF, Semantic WEB and other information description tools and mechanisms the WEB develops more and more into a huge structured information and data network that becomes computer processable via "semi"-automatic "intelligent" means.However, most of these multimedia information resources are kept in hierarchical file-type systems or relatively unstructured relational systems with none or very little of what is commonly known as "database functionality" for the various information types represented. Do we still need transaction properties, interoperability, security, reliability, scalability and others?If yes, then why are these concepts not really taken into the WEB-world?Are the database people too far away to be able to adopt their existing solutions?Are the information system people too process-oriented to care about data?Are the knowledge handlers too occupied with semantic representations and ontology discussions?Does the document community even see the problem?And do the WEB people care whether human resources are wasted through attempts to achieve database functionality through careful "behaviour"?The panel will offer opinions about these aspects but will also want to raise these issues with the audience.
