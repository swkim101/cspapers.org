The inverted classroom is a pedagogical technique in which passive knowledge acquisitions activities (e.g. lecture, readings) are assigned as homework and hands-on knowledge assimilation tasks (e.g. problem solving, lab, creative work) replace traditional lecture during classroom contact hours. Recent initiatives like the Kahn Academy [1] have raised the visibility of the inverted classroom and it is being adopted in disciplines across the curriculum from Economics [2] to Biology [3]. In this experience report we present successful inverted classroom pilots in linear algebra and introductory programming classes. In particular, this pilot focused on combining the inverted classroom philosophy with other proven pedagogical techniques (e.g. inquiry based learning) there was also a focus on creating free materials that could replace traditional, expensive textbooks when using the inverted classroom. We explain how the inverted classroom pedagogy is well aligned with the hands-on practice required in both math and computer science and discuss our plans to continue our experiment and to expand it beyond the original two classes.
