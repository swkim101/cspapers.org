It is crucial to evaluate the credibility of information and detect the rumors on social media automatically. In this work, we establish a Network Information Credibility Evaluation (NICE) platform, which collects a database of rumors that have been verified on Sina Weibo and automatically evaluates the information generated by users on social media but has not been verified. Users can use a query to search related information. If the according information appears in our database, users can identify it is a rumor immediately. Otherwise, NICE will show users with real-time results crawled automatically from social media and can calculate credibility of a specific result with our algorithm. Our algorithm learns dynamic representations for information on social media based on behavior information, dynamic information, user information and comment information. Then, we use an ordinary logistic regression to classify information into rumors and non-rumors. Based on our algorithm, NICE system achieves satisfactory performance on evaluating information credibility and detecting rumors on social media.
