This paper proposes a detection ordering method for vertical Bell Labs layered space-time (V-BLAST) systems with multiple hybrid automatic repeat request (H-ARQ) processes. The proposed method uses the H-ARQ combining gain at each recursion stage of V-BLAST for deciding V-BLAST detection ordering. Using the proposed method, we can fully exploit the H-ARQ combining gain. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves bit error rate (BER) and throughput performance.
