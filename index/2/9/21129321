This demo presents Social Glass, a novel web-based platform that supports the analysis, valorisation, integration, and visualisation of large-scale and heterogeneous urban data in the domains of city planning and decision-making. The platform systematically combines publicly available social datasets from municipalities together with social media streams (e.g. Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare) and resources from knowledge repositories. It further enables the mapping of demographic information, human movement patterns, place popularity, traffic conditions, as well as citizens' and visitors' opinions and preferences with regard to specific venues in the city. Social Glass will be demonstrated through several real-world case studies, that exemplify the framework's conceptual properties, and its potential value as a solution for urban analytics and city-scale event monitoring and assessment.
