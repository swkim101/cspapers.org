Side-channel attacks are among the most powerful and cost-effective attacks on cryptographic systems. Simulators that are developed for side-channel analysis are very useful for preliminary analysis of new schemes, in depth analysis of existing schemes as well as for analysis of products on early stages of development. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. We present a first survey of existing simulators that were build for side-channel analysis. We present a new open-source simulator SAVRASCA that can generate simulated power traces based on compiled binary files for many popular AVR microcontrollers. We show how to use our simulator on the example of DPA Contest 4 and we find a new vulnerability that allows an attacker to mount a differential power analysis (or even simple electro-magnetic analysis) attack on the scheme. Our simulator can be used during development of new products in order to test their resistance against side-channel analysis. We also focus the attention of readers on questions of why and how simulators are useful in this domain and try to highlight main issues related to simulators that were developed by the community.
