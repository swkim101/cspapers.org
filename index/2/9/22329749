Water accounts for about 60% of the human body, and when the body loses it (e.g., through urine, sweat, etc.) in higher rate than its intake rate (through drinking), dehydration symptoms occur. The dehydration causes many severe health problems like organ and cognitive impairment. Therefore, it is critical for the human to drink water in a sustained manner to avoid dehydration. To prevent humans from dehydration, continuous day-scale tracking of the water intake is needed. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive method to recognize the drinking activity as well as estimate the water intake amount in milliliter scale by leveraging smartwatches. Our basic idea is to track the arm motion and discriminate the drinking activities from the similar hand-based motions like food intake, phone calls, etc. Thereafter, we estimate the water intake amount from the drinking duration.
