After a short overview of a monitoring and navigation system for mobile vehicles (called MONAMOVE) consisting of multiple carriers of different size and an environment monitoring system, the navigation principle using one global navigator for gross motion planning and several local ones for fine motion planning is described. The coordination of multiple vehicles with their individual trajectories computed by the local navigators is managed by the global navigator using automatically computed crossings lying on a regular grid. This fine motion planning approach fulfills constraints like right orientation and continuous curvature along the paths; it bases on the computation of right oriented points which lie inside a driving channel (DC). These points are connected to the best right oriented line sequence without being a stupid following of the right border of the DC. Various extensions of this work are proposed.
