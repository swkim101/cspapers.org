A popular approach to training classifiers of new image classes is to use lower levels of a pre-trained feed-forward neural network and retrain only the top. Thus, most layers simply serve as highly nonlinear feature extractors. While these features were found useful for classifying a variety of scenes and objects, previous work also demonstrated unusual levels of sensitivity to the input especially for images which are veering too far away from the training distribution. This can lead to surprising results as an imperceptible change in an image can be enough to completely change the predicted class. This occurs in particular in applications involving personal data, typically acquired with wearable cameras (e.g., visual lifelogs), where the problem is also made more complex by the dearth of new labeled training data that make supervised learning with deep models difficult. To alleviate these problems, in this paper we propose a new generative model that captures the feature distribution in new data. Its latent space then becomes more representative of the new data, while still retaining the generalization properties. In particular, we use constrained Markov walks over a counting grid for modeling image sequences, which not only yield good latent representations, but allow for excellent classification with only a handful of labeled training examples of the new scenes or objects, a scenario typical in lifelogging applications.
