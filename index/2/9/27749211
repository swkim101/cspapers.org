This paper studies the problem of image-based leader-follower formation control for mobile robots, where the controller is designed independently of the leader's motion. An adaptive control scheme, which is suitable for both omnidirectional and perspective cameras, is proposed. The proposed approach avoids the need for accurate calibration of the extrinsic parameters of the omnidirectional camera as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of perspective camera. Additionally, the coefficients of the plane where the feature point moves relative to the camera frame can be uncertain. These uncertain constant parameters are estimated using an adaptive estimator. Uniform Semi-global Practical Asymptotic Stability (USPAS) of the system is shown using the Lyapunov approach. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
