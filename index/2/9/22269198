Many new curricula and tools have been developed recently to promote the exciting opportunities available in computer science. However, curriculum and supporting tools alone do not drive engagement -- the most interesting and innovative curriculum can still be taught in a disengaged manner, leading to lost opportunities for broadening the appeal and interest in computing across a diverse student population. The learning science literature on Cooperative Learning (CL) has been shown to increase class participation and student learning, while also promoting diversity in a manner that supports the differentiated instruction needed to engage students who have mixed abilities. This workshop will demonstrate how the best practices of CL can be applied in early CS courses (e.g., AP CS Principles AP CS A, or CS1). Workshop participants will be introduced to the CL structures that have been used in many different disciplines across multiple age/grade levels. These structures will be used to demonstrate specific applications toward computer science concepts. The workshop itself will be taught in a cooperative learning style so that participants can understand the dynamics and structure of a CL classroom. This workshop is intended for two types of educators: 1) K-12 teachers currently teaching AP CS A, CS Principles (CSP), or other introductory programming courses and 2) university faculty currently teaching CS 1 or other introductory computer science courses.
