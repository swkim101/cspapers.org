Measurements of threshold contrast required for various resolution tasks at various background light levels are reported. The predictions of a simple statistical model based on photon-noise limited detection are compared with the empirical observations. Correspondence is encouraging provided care is taken to account for the variation of all important parameters such as spatial and temporal integration, pupil area, etc.
