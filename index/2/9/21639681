This paper investigates the performance of spatial channel coding technique: a space-frequency block coding (SFBC) on the multi input multi output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (MIMO-OFDMA) system in correlation stochastic model. The channel model is based on the spatial channel model (SCM) approach, proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization. The symbol error rate (SER) of MIMO systems in multipath propagation environment depends on the spatial correlation function of the channel particularly, dependent on antenna element distance in base station (BS) and mobile station (MS) sides. Based on an algorithm of Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space Time (V-BLAST), a successive cancellation method applied to the receiver, we obtain the high signal-noise rate (SNR) in correlation channel. The number of users when using SFBC with VBLAST is also calculated in the system, the more of the users the lower of the SERs. Our results are simulated on the SCM in three environments such as suburban-macro, urban-macro and urban-micro cell based on long term evolution (LTE) down link standard for 2Ã—2 MIMO OFDMA system. The simulation results show that the combined SFBC code scheme with VBLAST-ZF has better performance than that obtained by using only detection when the same distance of antenna elements (correlation ratio) is used.
