What issues are on the minds of industrial performance analysts? Four representatives of world-class product organizations will describe their work at the front lines of measurement, modeling, and performance tuning. Topics will include performance engineering of middleware at IBM, tools for detecting false sharing in large-scale multiprocessors at Hewlett-Packard, kernel thread-scheduling performance in multiprocessors at Microsoft, and low-overhead instrumentation for profiling large-scale services at Google. Plenty of time will be available to ask questions about how to direct our research to have the greatest impact on industrial practice.
