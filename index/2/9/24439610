In this paper, we highlight the use of multimedia technology in generating intrinsic summaries of tourism related information. The system utilizes an automated process to gather, filter and classify information on various tourist spots on the Web. The end result present to the user is a personalized multimedia summary generated with respect to users queries filled with text, image, video and real-time news made retrievable for mobile devices. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the superiority of our presentation scheme to traditional methods.
