Information retrieval systems in operation today for applications ranging from Digital Libraries to Web Search make very little use of two major dimensions of the data being searched: location and time. For many applications these dimensions can provide an intuitive and understandable visualization of search constraints and results. However, current metadata representations of geographic characteristics and the uses of these metadata are problematic. Most retrieval and database, even those tailored to geographic information, provide only nascent approaches to the technologically and conceptually difficult challenges of Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR). Much of the problem is rooted in the geospatial metadata used by these systems to index and access geographic data. The primary issues are:
