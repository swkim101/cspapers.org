This paper discusses some of the issues involved in incorporating ethics material into programming courses. Incorporating ethics into such courses raises particular challenges because of the time-intensive nature of the courses and because of the difficulty of finding material that is both relevant to the course and comprehensible to the students. The paper presents four case studies that we have used successfully when incorporating ethics material into our own programming courses.
