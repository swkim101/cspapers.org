We use the co-occurrence pattern in a term-document matrix to extract latent variables (or factors). Latent variables may be regarded as the coordinate axes of a multidimensional "knowledge" space. These axes structure the classification so that the farther a document is from the origin along the positive direction of an axis, the more related it is to that latent variable. In this sense, such variables embody concepts. For example, a document, having a high positive numerical value on an axis identified with the concept of history in a database in the humanities, is likely to be more related to history than another document with a lower score on the same axis. In this reduced space Euclidean distances reflect vector space dissimilarities.
