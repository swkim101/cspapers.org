The emergence of social reading services has enabled readers to participate actively in reading activities by means of sharing and feedback. Readers can state their opinion on a book by providing feedback. However, because current e-books are published with fixed, unchangeable content, it is difficult to reflect the reader's feedback on them. In this paper, we propose a system for an adaptive e-book that dynamically updates itself on user participation. To achieve this, we designed a Feedback Block Model and a Feedback Engine. In the Feedback Block Model, at the time of publication, the author defines the type of feedback expected from readers. After publication, the Feedback Engine collects and aggregates the readers? feedback. The Feedback Engine can be configured with drag-and-drop block programming, and hence, even authors inexperienced in programming can create an adaptive e-book.
