This paper discusses a non-traditional course in computer networking. The course is a laboratory course with substantial hands-on experiences, which can help to prepare students for jobs in industry as soon as they graduate from an undergraduate institution. This course is not meant to replace the traditional network course but to supplement it by teaching how computer networks work in practice and by exploring new topics such as internetworking, high speed networking, client/server computing and security.
