We study the computational complexity of languages which have interactive proofs of logarithmic knowledge complexity. We show that all such languages can be recognized in ${\cal BPP}^{\cal NP}$. Prior to this work, for languages with greater-than-zero knowledge complexity only trivial computational complexity bounds were known. In the course of our proof, we relate statistical knowledge complexity to perfect knowledge complexity; specifically, we show that, for the honest verifier, these hierarchies coincide up to a logarithmic additive term.
