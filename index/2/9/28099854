Random walk is an important tool in many graph mining applications including estimating graph parameters, sampling portions of the graph, and extracting dense communities. In this paper we consider the problem of sampling nodes from a large graph according to a prescribed distribution by using random walk as the basic primitive. Our goal is to obtain algorithms that make a small number of queries to the graph but output a node that is sampled according to the prescribed distribution. Focusing on the uniform distribution case, we study the query complexity of three algorithms and show a near-tight bound expressed in terms of the parameters of the graph such as average degree and the mixing time. Both theoretically and empirically, we show that some algorithms are preferable in practice than the others. We also extend our study to the problem of sampling nodes according to some polynomial function of their degrees; this has implications for designing efficient algorithms for applications such as triangle counting.
