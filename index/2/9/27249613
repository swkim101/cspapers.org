llbstract This paper proposes schemes for fast page transfer between transaction system Instances In a shared disks (SD) environment where all the sharing Instances can read and modify the same data Fast page transfer improves transaction response time and concurrency because one or more disk I/OS are avoided while transferring a page from a system which modified it to another system which needs it. The proposed methods work with the steal and no-force buffer management policies, and fine-granularity (e.g., record) locking For each of the page-transfer schemes, we present both recovery and coherency-control protocols Updates can be made to a page by several systems before the page is written to disk. Many subtleties Involved in correctly recovering such a page in the face of single system or complex-wide failures are also discussed. Assuming that each system maintains its own log, some methods require a merged log for restart recovery while others donâ€™t Our proposals should also apply to dlstrihuted. recoverable file systems and distributed virtual memory in the SD environment, and to the currently oopular client-server object-oriented DBMS environments where the clients cache data.
