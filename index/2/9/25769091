Many software projects fail. The main reason they fail is that people don't understand them well enough to make them succeed. The Project/Process Evaluation and Development Framework (PEDF) allows both customers and developers to understand their project and its process. It allows them to understand what they're doing, why it's supposed to work (or why it won't work), and how to modify it to make it more successful.
