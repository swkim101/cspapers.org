This paper proposes a robust adaptive sliding mode control for the trajectory tracking of a nonholonomic wheeled mobile manipulator in task space coordinate. The proposed algorithm is robust adaptive control strategy where parametric uncertainties and disturbances are compensated by adaptive update technique. The adaptive law is designed based on the Lyapunov method. Simulations results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust adaptive based controller in comparison with a robust sliding mode based controller.
