The enhancement of image watermarking algorithm robust against particular attack by using genetic algorithm is presented here. There is a trade-off between imperceptibility and robustness in image watermarking. To preserve both of these characteristics in digital image watermarking in a logical value, the genetic algorithm is used. Some factors were introduced for providing robustness of image watermarking against cropping attack such as the Centre of Interest Proximity Factor (CIPF), the Complexity Factor (CF) and the Priority Coefficient (PC).
