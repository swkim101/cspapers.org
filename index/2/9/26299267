The basic statement in this paper is appealing, that is, that the various methodologies labeled OOA do not fulfill the obligations appropriate to an analysis methodology, and to a large extent do not sufficiently capture the information needed for a smooth transition to design. I will not debate the conclusion, indeed I agree with it as should be obvious since the authors have referenced my own writing as saying as much. There are two issues I will raise. The first is whether we are to understand from the authors that the problems they cite are inherent in the notion of using object modeling as the language for analysis. The authors appear to use strong language that could lead the reader to this conclusion. This could unfortunately lead a reader to ignore OOA in areas where it is both appropriate and beneficial. I believe it would be useful for the authors (an d others) to provide a much more concise characterization of what is meant by an OOA, and then formally determine the implications as to what domains are appropriate for use of the object techniques.
