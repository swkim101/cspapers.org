1. SUMMARY While online educational resources have existed for decades, the past year has seen a tremendous acceleration in the adoption and potential disruption afforded by recent online education initiatives. In the Fall of 2011 the concept of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) more broadly entered the public consciousness with a group of three Stanford CS courses collectively enrolling over 200,000 students, and gaining national press coverage from the New York Times [2] and other outlets. Since that time, a number of new platforms have emerged for online course delivery, including Udacity and Coursera (two for-profit companies started by Stanford faculty, the latter of which partners with over 30 elite universities), EdX (a not-for-profit consortium, composed of MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley, and the University of Texas system), and the Minerva Project (a for-profit online university with $25 million in funding).
