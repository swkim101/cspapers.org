We have developed a graphically oriented, general purpose simulation system to facilitate the modeling of neural networks. The simulator is implemented under UNIX and X-windows and is designed to support simulations at many levels of detail. Specifically, it is intended for use in both applied network modeling and in the simulation of detailed, realistic, biologically-based models. Examples of current models developed under this system include mammalian olfactory bulb and cortex, invertebrate central pattern generators, as well as more abstract connectionist simulations.
