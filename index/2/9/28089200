Many people feel that recent ACM statements on computing do not match well with the traditions and standards of most liberal arts colleges. During the Fall of 1984, representatives from nine liberal arts colleges participated in a workshop sponsored by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation which was aimed at developing an undergraduate computer science concentration suitable for liberal arts colleges. At this session, the panelists will present a proposed curriculum which grew out of this meeting. Copies of the draft curriculum will be made available to attendees in order to solicit additional input to the curriculum design process before finalizing it in the Summer of 1985.
