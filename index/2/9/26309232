This paper presents a hardware design of smart grid home gateway that integrates smart home network to be compatible for smart grid integration. In this network, a Smart Grid Home Gateway can control the electrical appliances based on the programming schedule or data received from control center. Moreover, some low cost wireless transceivers for Smart Grid are investigated and a simple wireless network topology based on star routing protocol for Smart Grid Home Network is also proposed. Final, demonstration results display an actual SGHG prototype to verify the system.
