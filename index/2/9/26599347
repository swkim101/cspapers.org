Children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) have difficulties in expressing their feelings and needs, their teachers have to be very familiar with them to adjust teaching contents in related training lessons. In this paper, we present an adaptive training system with EEG (Electroencephalogram) devices for autistic children. We designed an EEG helmet to monitor children's attention levels, and a video chat system with virtual cartoon faces covered on teacher's face. Cartoon faces are synchronized with the performer's facial movements to help trainers express themselves in an exaggerated way. When the attention reduction is detected by the EEG helmet, cartoon face will adjust automatically, and try to draw their attention back through changing cartoon types, colors, brightness, etc. Each change and feedback from children will be traced by the helmet and analyzed for improvements. By continuous iterative learning, the system will become smarter in avoiding children's physical exhaustion. The system was introduced in the form of a specific training lesson to an ASD school, and preliminary experiment has indicated an encouraging result.
