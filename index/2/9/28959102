The quality of empirical studies is critical for the success of the Software Engineering (SE) discipline. More and more SE researchers are conducting empirical studies involving the software industry. While there are established empirical procedures, relatively little is known about the dynamics of conducting empirical studies in the complex industrial environments. What are the impediments and how to best handle them? This was the primary driver for organising CESI 2013. The goals of this workshop include having a dialogue amongst the participating practitioners and academics on the theme of this workshop with the aim to produce tangible output that will be summarised in a post-workshop report.
