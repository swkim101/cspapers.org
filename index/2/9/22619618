It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 12th edition of MobiCom, the premier Conference on mobile computing and communications. We are happy to have this event back on the beautiful West Coast of the United States, after a very successful edition last year in Cologne, Germany. It has been my honor to serve as General Chair.We have an outstanding technical program, starting with three tutorials on three very timely topics (mobility models, delay tolerant routing and RFIDs). The main conference technical sessions feature competitively selected papers in a broad range of mobile computing topics - from sensor networks to urban meshes, cellular services and wireless foundations and models. Two internationally renowned authorities in the wireless and mobile computing fields will deliver invited speeches. Dr Andrew Viterbi, Viterbi Foundation, will be the Keynote speaker. Dr. Deborah Estrin, Professor, Computer Science Dept, UCLA, and Director of the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS) at UCLA will be the Athena Lecturer, delivering a talk on "Wireless Sensing Systems: From ecosystems to human systems". Jointly with the conference, there will be eight outstanding Workshops that deal with more specialized topics in various areas of mobile, wireless networking and computing: VANET, WISE, WMASH, WINTECH, MOBISHARE, CRAWDED, DIWANS, WUWNET. To complete the picture, there will be a Poster session, and a Student Competition session. The main theme that emerges from these diverse contributions, and the main message to our attendees, is the coming together of very different wireless technologies, from low power sensor radios to ad hoc networks, mesh and cellular networks to enable integrated, pervasive mobile computing. The synergy of these networks will provide the structure that can support and integrate emerging mobile applications ranging from mobile sensor platforms to vehicular networks and broadband mobile Internet services.
