Described here is a method for navigating multiple mobile robots which estimate locations and motions of unknown moving objects. Each robot with conic projection image sensor COPIS can observe an omnidirectional view around the robot in real-time with use of a conic mirror. First, each robot communicates and exchanges information of sensory data. Then, unknown moving objects and a reciprocating robot are discriminated, and motions and locations of unknown moving objects are estimated by cooperative observation of azimuth changes between the two reciprocating robots.<<ETX>>
