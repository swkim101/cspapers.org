IBM rarely builds two machines that are exactly alike. Two machines of the same model, for example, will almost always differ because one has an engineering change, feature (i.e., a design variation) etc., not on the other. Therefore, the ability to record and select the proper data for any combination of design variations is an important part of a design automation system. This process is sometimes called configuration control.
 This paper describes a method of recording such design variations. Arbitrary relationships among the design variations are permitted, allowing them to be combined as necessary. The history of each design variation, as it changes through time, can also be recorded.
