Depth sensors open up possibilities of dealing with the human action recognition problem by providing 3D human skeleton data and depth images of the scene. Analysis of human actions based on 3D skeleton data has become popular recently, due to its robustness and view-invariant representation. However, the skeleton alone is insufficient to distinguish actions which involve human-object interactions. In this paper, we propose a deep model which efficiently models human-object interactions and intra-class variations under viewpoint changes. First, a human body-part model is introduced to transfer the depth appearances of body-parts to a shared view-invariant space. Second, an end-to-end learning framework is proposed which is able to effectively combine the view-invariant body-part representation from skeletal and depth images, and learn the relations between the human body-parts and the environmental objects, the interactions between different human body-parts, and the temporal structure of human actions. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed model against 15 existing techniques on two large benchmark human action recognition datasets including NTU RGB+D and UWA3DII. The Experimental results show that our technique provides a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
