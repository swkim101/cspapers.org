Sandia National Laboratories is owned by the Department of Energy (DOE) and operated under contract by Western Electric. The basic charter of the laboratory includes the development of systems for military, satellite and energy programs for DOE, DOD, and NASA.
 To support the development of modern electronic systems, a custom integrated circuit design and fabrication facility has been developed. This capability was initially established to fill a void in the availability of custom radiation-hardened integrated circuit designs and fabrication services as a result of scarce and/or unavailable commercial resources during the mid 1970s and has evolved to support in-house design and production of custom, high reliability, radiation-hardened circuits.
 The Sandia design and fabrication resources are utilized by a number of government agencies and have recently been designated by the Department of Energy as the Center for Radiation-hardened Microelectronics (CRM).
 The successful development of the CAD system will meet the CRM objectives in establishing a basic LSI/VLSI design system which can be replicated at other government laboratories or contractors.
