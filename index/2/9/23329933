This paper presents a proposed ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna for wireless applications in UHF range. The proposed antenna has a broad bandwidth with a relative small antenna size compared to conventional antennas. It is a 2-arm log-periodic saw-toothed planar microstrip antenna. This antenna has a simple structure with two arms located on the FR4 dielectric substrate. The simulation and implementation results have shown that the proposed antenna is directional and stable radiation patterns in the ultra wide operation bandwidth from 300 MHz to 1.1 GHz. This antenna can be used in UWB systems such as ground penetrating radar systems.
