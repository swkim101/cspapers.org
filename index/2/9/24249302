In the past two decades we have experienced a growth in computer power by a factor of ten per decade at no increase in cost; or conversely, the cost of computers for the same performance and functionality is dropping respectively. This to a large extent has fueled the computer revolution. Advances in some of the associated technologies are contributing to this trend: Particularly the cost of semiconductors for a given function dropped 40% per year, mass storage about 30% per year. The cost per Watt of power supply remained constant. Software development costs showed minor improvements, while communication (lines/paper) increased. Thus, it becomes apparent that computer engineering has to focus on rebalancing of the technologies: Capitalize on the decreasing cost of computer logic, apply computing power to improved communications, find a way to cope with the evergrowing need for software.
 Where does this industry go from here? Distributed Processing may be a way: We must make use of multiple interconnected computer systems to permit computing to be done where the work is, to permit resource sharing of software, and to ease the communication (documentatio~bottlenecks. The next series of figures graphically demonstrate this trend.
 How will this impact computer engineering? System complexities will increase with the added burden of much greater reliability than today. Time to market will be shorter as well as a critical design parameter. All this at no increase in product cost. To meet these needs the engineering strategies will have to be more system oriented, integrating manufacturing and field service requirements in a top down, full hierarchial process.
