During a disaster, appropriate information must be collected. For example, victims and survivors require information about shelter locations and dangerous points or advice about protecting themselves. Rescuers need information about the details of volunteer activities and supplies, especially potential shortages. However, collecting such localized information is difficult from such mass media as TV and newspapers because they generally focus on information aimed at the general public. On the other hand, social media can attract more attention than mass media under these circumstances since they can provide such localized information. In this paper, we focus on Twitter, one of the most influential social media, as a source of local information. By assuming that users who retweet the same tweet are interested in the same topic, we can classify tweets that are required by users with similar interests based on retweets. Thus, we propose a novel tweet classification method that focuses on retweets without text mining. We linked tweets based on retweets to make a retweet network that connects similar tweets and extracted clusters that contain similar tweets from the constructed network by our clustering method. We also subjectively verified the validity of our proposed classification method. Our experiment verified that the ratio of the clusters whose tweets are mutually similar in the cluster to all clusters is very high and the similarities in each cluster are obvious. Finally, we calculated the linguistic similarities of the results to clarify our proposed method's features. Our method classified topic-similar tweets, even if they are not linguistically similar.
