As CS education moves toward a more rigorous approach to pedagogical research, there is a growing push to adhere to standard practices that are used in other social science fields. A critical aspect of this change is a growing awareness that CS education researchers need to follow standard ethical practices and to perform their research with appropriate institutional review board (IRB) oversight. U.S. federal regulations for conducting human subjects research (which includes pedagogical research) can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46 (45 CFR 46) [1], also known as the “Common Rule.” While the Common Rule defines federal policy, interpretation of the policy can vary from one institution to another. For this reason, it is important for researchers to understand both federal requirements and their institution’s policies and interpretations. In this panel session, we will provide an overview of the Common Rule and present four perspectives on best practices for gaining IRB approval. The panel members include an officer from a federal funding agency, an IRB member, and two experienced researchers who can describe both successful and failed attempts to gain IRB approval for a variety
