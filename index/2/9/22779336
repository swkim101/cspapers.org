The use of FPGAs for general-purpose supercomputing is being investigated by several projects worldwide. The FPGA High Performance Computing Alliance (FHPCA) is developing HPC solutions for real-world applications using FPGAs. It has built a 64-FPGA supercomputer located in Scotland.The widespread take-up of FPGAs will only occur when they are more easily programmed. Ease of programming is the major challenge faced by this technology. This BoF will focus on reporting the experience gained in porting three real-world industrial applications to the FHPCA system and discussing the developments needed to overcome the programmability barrier. Panellists will come from the FHPCA and other organisations active in this area. There will be a strong emphasis on moderated discussion.The FHPCA involves EPCC, Alpha Data Ltd, Nallatech Ltd, Xilinx Corporation, Algotronix Ltd, ISLI and Scottish Enterprise.
