This demonstration will provide an overview of OpenRefactory/C, an infrastructure for developing source-level program transformations for C programs. OpenRefactory/C is platform independent; however, the demonstration will be on the Eclipse platform. We will highlight the features of the infrastructure, outline the problems it solves, show the program analyses support that we have built for this infrastructure, and show traditional refactorings as well as advanced security-oriented program transformations that cannot be developed in any other C IDEs.
