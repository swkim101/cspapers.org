Document image analysis is the field of converting paper documents into an editable electronic representation by performing optical character recognition (OCR). In recent years, there has been a tremendous amount of progress in the development of open source OCR systems. OCRopus is one of the leading open source document analysis system with a modular and pluggable architecture. This paper presents an overview of different steps involved in a document image analysis system and illustrates them with examples from OCRopus.
