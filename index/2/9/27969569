The Inspection Method is a quality-control for written material. It is used on large projects and takes 3 to 8 persons for correct use. This excludes small projects with less than three persons from proper inspection. This paper shows how the personnel restriction may be circumvented in small projects. An example of inspection in a small project (writing a report) is given.
