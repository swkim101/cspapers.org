Analog circuits lack perfect accuracy; noise, PVT-Variations, non-linearities, crosstalk and many other effects cause unforeseen deviations that we also call “uncertainties”. In the paper we classify various causes of uncertainties and describe a simple, generic, mathematical model of uncertain signals and systems that is applicable from circuit level up to system level. We show in particular how to use affne arithmetic forms to document uncertainties of different kind in an uncertainty table, from its causes in circuits up to properties at system-level.
