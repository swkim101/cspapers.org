The ACM/IEEE-CS 2001/2008 computer science curricular guidelines are in the process of being updated and the strawman version of CS2013 will be unveiled at SIGCSE 2012. Inclusion of the ethical, societal and professional responsibility issues dates back to Computing Curricula 1991. This poster session will present the revised Social and Professional issues knowledge area and provide a means for any SIGCSE community member to provide feedback directly to SIGCAS and the CS2013 steering committee. Specific core and elective knowledge units, topics and learning outcomes will be delineated. The current state of the discipline and the profession were examined to provide contemporary guidance for the education of ethical behavior, professional practice and societal impact for computer science majors.
