All instruction, no matter how technical, has goals beyond its basic cognitive context. Attitudes and other traits are often as important as technical knowledge. The student needs a positive attitude to deal effectively with complex computer applications and should have a balanced view of the opportunities and dangers presented by the use of computers.

The procedure described involves an attitude measuring instrument which was used to design specific instructional activities with well defined goals.
