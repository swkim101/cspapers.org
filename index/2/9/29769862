What happens if the buildings and urban environments around us can respond to the dynamic changes of the environment and the occupancy patterns? How can a building express its excitement when it gets crowded with people? What happens if the built environment can express its "sick building syndrome", which is caused by poor air quality? If the urban space can feel the changes in the wind conditions, can the space respond and adapt to the passing occupants? How to design responsive and adaptive environments that are expressive, informative, and performative? This research aims to hypothetically visualize how buildings and urban environments can respond to crowd-sensed data, such as movement, air quality, temperature, light, and wind, through a kinetic organic interface embedded in the building or urban fabric.
