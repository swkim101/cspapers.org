Federated geographically-distributed computing platforms such as PlanetLab [1] and the Grid [2, 3] have recently become popular for evaluating and deploying network services and scientific computations. As the size, reach, and user population of such infrastructures grow, resource discovery and resource selection become increasingly important. Although a number of resource discovery and allocation services have been built, there is little data on the utilization of the distributed computing platforms they target. Yet the design and efficacy of such services depends on the characteristics of the target platform.
