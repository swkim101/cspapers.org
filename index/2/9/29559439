The USEWOD2011 workshop investigates combinations of usage data with semantics and the web of data. The analysis of usage data may be enhanced using semantic information. Now that more and more explicit knowledge is represented on the Web, the question arises how these semantics can be used to aid large scale web usage analysis and mining. Conversely, usage data analysis can enhance semantic resources as well as Semantic Web applications. Traces of users can be used to evaluate, adapt or personalize Semantic Web applications. Also, new ways of accessing information enabled by the Web of Data imply the need to develop or adapt algorithms, methods, and techniques to analyze and interpret the usage of Web data instead of Web pages. The USEWOD2011 program includes a challenge to the workshop participants: three months before the workshop two datasets consisting of server log files of Linked Open Data sources were released. Participants are invited to come up with interesting analyses, applications, alignments, etc. for these datasets.
