"Digital media" is one of those unfortunate terms that means different things in different contexts. This difficulty of definition -- along with its association with art, communication, architecture, and film -- puts digital media on the margins of traditional computer science curricula. This paper reviews the types of digital media programs current in higher education; proposes a curriculum model for digital media instruction that is firmly grounded in computer science at the same time that it interfaces easily with digital art; and describes specially-designed course material that serves the interdisciplinary need while preserving the rigor of the computer science discipline.
