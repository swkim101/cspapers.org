The Caret-HM framework allows Android developers to record and replay user sessions and convert them into heatmaps. One advantage of our framework over existing solutions is that it allows developers to control the environment while simplifying the recording process by giving users access to their applications via a web browser. The heatmap generation using Android user sessions and clustering UI states is a unique feature of our framework. Heat maps allow developers to identify the usage of application features for testing and guiding business decisions. We provide a qualitative comparison to the existing solutions.
