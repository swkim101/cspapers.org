With the advent of 10MIPS workstations, and 50MIPS workstations promised in two years, what will the next generation engineering computing environment look like, five years from now?
Will all the workstations use the same architecture? SPARC? MIPS? AMD? VAX? Does it matter? Will all CAD tools run on a 10MIPS, $1,000 Personal Computer? Will the term 'mainframe' become obsolete? What operating systems will be used? What languages will tools be written in? C++? Smalltalk? Common Loops? What is the role of software standards? UNIX? X-Windows? PostScript? Will 'C' ever be standardized? What about software development environments - what will they look like?
How much will parallel, general-purpose computing be used? How much performance will be available from parallel computers? Is 'massively parallel' computing the answer or will 'conventional' multiprocessors provide better price-performance? What will be the role of hardware accelerators; will they be needed at all? How will high-speed networks figure in this system and how fast do they have to be? Will the Ethernet cables just installed be sufficient or will they need to be replaced again?
