Internet-scale Distributed Networks (IDNs) are large distributed systems that comprise hundreds of thousands of servers located around the world. IDNs consume significant amounts of energy to power their deployed server infrastructure, and nearly as much energy to cool that infrastructure. We study the potential benefits of using renewable open air cooling (OAC) in an IDN. Our results show that by using OAC, a global IDN can extract 51% cooling energy reducing during summers and a 92% reduction in the winter.
