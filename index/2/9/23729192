Mobile connected devices, and smartphones in particular, are rapidly emerging as a dominant computing and sensing platform. This poses several unique opportunities for data collection and analysis, as well as new challenges. In this tutorial, we survey the state-of-the-art in terms of mining data from mobile devices across different application areas such as ads, healthcare, geosocial, public policy, etc. Our tutorial has three parts. In part one, we summarize data collection in terms of various sensing modalities. In part two, we present cross-cutting challenges such as real-time analysis, security, and we outline cross cutting methods for mobile data mining such as network inference, streaming algorithms, etc. In the last part, we specifically overview emerging and fast-growing application areas, such as noted above. Concluding, we briefly highlight the opportunities for joint design of new data collection techniques and analysis methods, suggesting additional directions for future research.
