A method to automatically generate functional self-test programs for arbitrary processor systems including microprogrammable and custom designed special purpose types is presented. Only commonly available user information is needed, but gate-level details can be utilized as well. The generated self-test programs perform user guided tests for memory function and register decoding, functional or gate-level derived tests for combinational modules, and a machine status check to detect undesired side-effects. The programs are given in the micro- or machine code of the target system, ready for execution. First applications have shown promising results.
