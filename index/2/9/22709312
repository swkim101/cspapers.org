The syntactical analysis of pictures derived by a context-free graph-grammar is a rather complicated algorithm. Analogously to the development for Chomsky-grammars ten years ago we define the precedence-graph-grammars as a subclass of the context-free graph-grammars allowing for easier parsing algorithms. By table-lookup we can decide locally if an edge or a node is part of a handle and if it isn't in which direction to proceed to reach one.
