In this paper, we introduce a control strategy aimed at generating a stable walking pattern for a humanoid pushing a heavy load on a cart. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on force/torque sensors to measure the interaction between the robot and the pushed object, we present a simple model-based controller that can be implemented on most robots due to its computationally efficient design. Every aspect of the controller design is covered, from the formulation and validation of the dynamic model, to the implementation and validation on an actual humanoid robot. The experimental results show that the controller can efficiently make a NAO humanoid transport, in a stable way, the equivalent of its own weight on a rolling cart.
