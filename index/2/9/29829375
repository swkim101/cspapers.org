This paper presents how carrier frequency differences among transmitters affect concurrent transmission in wireless sensor networks. The carrier frequency differences cause two problems: reverse phase rotation and signal level fluctuations. The effects of these problems depend on modulation schemes. The demonstration shows these problems with moving images of superposed baseband signal and constellation transmitted from 1-6 nodes concurrently.
