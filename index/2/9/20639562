We introduce Bayesian Global Optimization as an efficient way to optimize a system's parameters, when evaluating parameters is time-consuming or expensive. The adaptive sequential experimentation techniques described can be used to help tackle a myriad of problems including optimizing a system's click-through or conversion rate via online A/B testing, tuning parameters of a machine learning prediction method or expensive batch job, designing an engineering system or finding the optimal parameters of a real-world physical experiment. We explore different tools available for performing these tasks, including Yelp's MOE and SigOpt. We will present the motivation, implementation, and background of these tools. Applications and examples from industry and best practices for using the techniques will be provided.
