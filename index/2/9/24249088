We present the dispersion compensation scheme using optical phase conjugation (OPC) for long-haul transmission systems. The OPC is realized by four-wave mixing process in a dispersion engineered chalcogenide waveguide. Performance of the 1600-km transmission system using different modulation formats at 40 Gbaud has been investigated. Simulated results also indicate that this method is more efficient for the PSK formats. The influence of the pump power and the length mismatch between two sections of the fiber link is also investigated via simulation.
