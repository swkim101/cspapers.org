This paper presents an adjustable knee mechanism for walking assistance devices for the elderly to provide physical gait assistance. The adjustable knee mechanism can assist in flexion/extension motions of the knee joint and compensate for the transitional movements of the knee in the sagittal plane as well as aligning the frontal plane. In order to compensate for the center of rotation, the proposed adjustable knee mechanism is implemented by connecting several rolling cams with unique and precisely calculated contact geometries. The key idea of the proposed mechanism is to realize linear motion and accurate torque transmission by a pulley method using the rolling joint in which the distance of the center between the rolling cams is changed. The proposed articulated joint can effectively deliver the torque required for assistance while adapting to the joint motion of the wearer. This paper describes the mechanical design of this knee mechanism and its implementation on a wearable robot and in preliminary experiments. The performance of the proposed mechanism was verified by simulations and experiments.
