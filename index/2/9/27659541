In t h i s paper we present a process model of the reasoning under ly ing arguments of persuasion and i t s embodiment in a computer program, the PERSUAOER, which gives counsel fo r the r e s o l u t i o n of impasses in c o l l e c t i v e ba rga in ing . We show how goal t rees can be searched to produce arguments i nvo l v ing economic q u a n t i t i e s . I ARGUMENTATION STRATEGIES Arguments of persuasion are those used by the p a r t i c i p a n t s in cooperat ive problem s o l v i n g . While others have worked on argumentat ion, none so fa r has worked on persuasive arguments. The work of Flowers, et a l . (1982) was concerned w i t h adversary arguments and Spohrer and Riesbeck (1984) have inves t iga ted understanding causal r e l a t i o n s h i p s among economic q u a n t i t i e s based on arguments g iven in newspaper a r t i c l e s . "Conv inc ing" someone to accept a p ropos i t i on can be e f f ec ted by two s t r a t e g i e s : 1) showing tha t the p ropos i t i on f u r t h e r s the person's goa ls , or 2) i n d i c a t i n g how re fus ing the p r o p o s i t i o n threatens h is goa ls . In labour n e g o t i a t i o n s , the second s t ra tegy is c r u c i a l . This paper presents a procedure fo r cons t ruc t i ng th rea ten ing arguments dur ing labour med ia t i on . C o l l e c t i v e barga in ing is the process through which a company and a union a r r i v e at a c o n t r a c t . Argumentation is used to persuade the opposing par ty to grant concessions, to support one's own demands, and to thwart at tempts by the oppos i t i on to gain concessions from one's own s i d e . A mediator , c a l l e d in to help the two sides reach an agreement, t r i e s to convince each par ty to accept the necessary concessions. The f i n a l agreement incorporates the t r adeo f f s tha t each par ty found acceptab le . By the t ime the mediator appears, most secondary issues have been s e t t l e d . The med ia to r ' s j o b is to convince the p a r t i e s to accept compromises on the l as t important issues. Events 1 and 2 below i l l u s t r a t e how a mediator uses th rea ten ing arguments to do t h i s . EVENT 1. The company refuses to accept a p a r t i c u l a r wage se t t l emen t . The mediator argues tha t i n e f f i c i e n t p lan t opera t ion w i l l occur from the r e s u l t i n g employee d i s s a t i s f a c t i o n . *Th is work was supported by NSF Grant No. IST-8317711 and by ARO Grant No. DAAG 29-85-K-0023. EVENT 2. The union refuses to accept a wage se t t l ement . The mediator argues tha t i f the company grants higher wages, i t w i l l become noncompet i t ive and w i l l be forced to l a , o f f workers. I I REPRESENTING THE PARTIES' GOALS To generate an appropr ia te argument, the arguer must know the goals of the p a r t i e s in ques t i on . We represent these goals in goal t r e e s . In the subsequent two f i g u r e s , we dep ic t p a r t i a l goal t rees of a union and a company. Figure 2 COMPANY GOAL-TREE K. Sycara-Cyranski 295 Searching goal t rees in order to understand and/or p red i c t the behaviour of var ious actors has been inves t iga ted by Carbonel l , (1979), Spohrer and Riesbeck, (1984), and Wilensky, (1983). The r e l a t i o n s h i p s among goals are adapted from Spohrer and Riesbeck, ( I98A). A (+) s ign corresponds to the goal of increasing the p a r t i c u l a r quan t i t y to which i t r e fe r s wh i le a (-) s ign corresponds to decreasing the q u a n t i t y . For example, PROF ITS (+) means tha t the company's highest level goal is to increase p r o f i t s . A goal is v i o l a t e d by an ac t ion when the ac t i on opposes i t s s i g n . For example, a reduct ion in employment, EMPLOYMENT ( ) , v i o l a t e s the un ion 's goal EMPLOYMENT (+). The c h i l d r e n of a node, connected to it through support l i n k s , denote the subgoals through which the supergoal is s a t i s f i e d . For example, in the company's goal t r e e , diminished labour costs can be achieved e i t he r by decreasing the economic concessions granted to the union, ECONOMIC(-), or by decreasing the number of employees, EMPLOYMENT ( ) . Thus, a path X to Y in a goal t ree cons t i t u t es a causal chain tha t produces an exp lanat ion of the change in Y in terms of the change in X, assuming no other change has occured in the res t of the t r e e . A c o n f l i c t i n g goal h goal t ree and a (-) s ign in th one p a r t y ' s goal t r e e , the more than one place w i t h i n te rna l c o n f l i c t ex i s t s f o company has an in te rna l conf l increase economic concession order to increase e f f i c i e n t pl s imul taneously i t wants to concessions, ECONOMIC(-), in labour cos t s . as a (+) s ign in one e o the r . When, in same goal ex i s t s in opposi te s igns , an r t h i s pa r t y . The i c t : i t wants t o s, ECONOMIC(+), in ant ope ra t i on , wh i le decrease economic order to reduce i t s The above represen ta t ion , wh i le a l low ing the arguer to do some q u a l i t a t i v e reasoning (de Kleer and Brown, 1982) regarding the p a r t i e s ' goa ls , is c l e a r l y a crude approximation of r e a l i t y . Not only the d i r e c t i o n , but a lso the amount by which a quan t i t y is being changed, is important fo r determining the a c c e p t a b i l i t y of a proposed se t t lement . To s i m p l i f y our exp lana t ion , we w i l l assume that a mediator has a means of generat ing a reasonable value for each demand, and tha t her task is to generate convincing arguments fo r t h e i r acceptance. I l l GENERATING THREATENING ARGUMENTS Argument generat ion is guided by the goals of the p a r t i e s . In a d d i t i o n , the processing depends on which par ty must be convinced. To convince the un ion, the s t ra tegy is to discover a company ac t i on which threatens one of the un ion 's important goa ls . To convince the company, the s t ra tegy is to discover whether the company's re fusa l w i l l r e s u l t in a v i o l a t i o n of an important company g o a l . Since the company con t ro ls the h l r i i . g s , f i r i n g s and concessions, both of these s t r a t e g i e s requ i re a goal d i rec ted search of the company's goal t r e e . The union goal t ree is used to f i n d the threatened union goals and t h e i r importance. The process assumes that the other par ty has agreed to the proposed set t lement . Creat ing an argument to convince the union regard ing issue X and change of quan t i t y ( * ) , (where (*) is e i the r (+) or (-)) , is as f o l l o w s : (1) Find out which company goals are v i o l a t e d by the un ion 's r e f u s a l . This is done by f o l l ow ing the support l i n k s s t a r t i n g w i th X (NOT*) in the company's goal t r ee i . e . , t r ac ing the consequences for the company of the negation of i t s goa l . The e f f e c t s of negat ing X are propagated by changing the signs of X's ancestor goals along the pa th . (2) Find out what compensating act ions the company might carry out to o f f s e t the e f f e c t s of negating i t s goal X. This is done by consider ing the c h i l d r e n Z l , . . . Z n of each goal Y found in step 1. To q u a l i f y as a threatening argument, a p o t e n t i a l compensating ac t ion Zi has to s a t i s f y three cond i t i ons : 1) it must be c o n t r o l l a b l e by the company, 2) it must v i o l a t e a union goal and 3) the importance for the union of t h i s v i o l a t e d goal must be greater than the importance of the demand under d iscuss ion . I f the t h i r d cond i t i on is not s a t i s f i e d by Z i , i t s ch i l d ren are checked to see whether they s a t i s f y cond i t ions 1) to 3) ; o therwise, the subtree of Zi is pruned, and the s i b l i n g s of Zi are considered in the same way. If some Zk proves s u i t a b l e , a po ten t i a l argument is saved. Whether or not an argument has been generated, steps 1 and 2 are repeated s t a r t i n g from Y. Thus, the whole set of arguments is generated. Consider, for example, the generat ion of the argument used in Event 2. At issue was a decrease in wages. The process s t a r t s by f o l l ow ing WAGES (+), a negation of company's goal WAGES (-) up the t r e e . Figure 3 shows the fragment of the company t ree a f t e r propagation of WAGES (+)
