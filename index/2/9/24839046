We are interested in combinational circuits synthesized from <underline>and</underline>-gates and <underline>or</underline>-gates. We first show that n<supscrpt>3</supscrpt> distinct <underline>and</underline>-gate inputs are needed to form the product of two Boolean matrices, and hence O(n<supscrpt>3</supscrpt>) two-input <underline>and</underline>-gates are needed to compute the transitive closure of a Boolean matrix. While this result has the flavor of Kerr's (achievable)lower bound [Kerr 1970] of n<supscrpt>3</supscrpt>+-gates for computing the min/+ product of integer-valued matrices using only <underline>min</underline>-gates and +-gates, the problem turns out on closer inspection to be considerably more subtle, and in fact we have been able to come only to within a factor of two of the best known upper bound of n<supscrpt>3</supscrpt><underline>and</underline>-gates.
 Secondly we use this result to study the effect on combinational circuts of not using <underline>not</underline>-gates inverters).
