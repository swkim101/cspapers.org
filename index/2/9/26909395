We have developed an interface for browsing content that uses the metaphor of turning the pages of a book. Using our "Bookisheet" interface, which consists of two thin plastic sheets and bend sensors, a user can easily scroll digital content such as photos by bending one side of the sheet or the other. This action provides the tangible and pleasant sense of turning pages in a book. Bookisheet can be used not only as an interface for conventional information terminals but also as one for flexible displays.
