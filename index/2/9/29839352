Cyber-crime is becoming alarmingly common through the use of anonymous e-mails. Author attribution helps digital forensics investigators filter through a large set of possible authors and focus traditional investigative techniques on the most probable culprits. A recent promising technique is to construct a write-print for each known author, and compare it to the write-print extracted from the anonymous message(s). A write-print is a unique digital fingerprint created by mining frequent patterns from a particular author's writing style. However, the process for generating a write-print is very slow, making it a poor choice for author attribution situations of a time-sensitive nature such as anonymous threats of attack, exposure, or ongoing harassment. We develop the Parallel Author Verification of E-mail (PAVE) algorithm for determining author write-prints. Our goal is to create a parallel approach that enables the analysis of large collections of e-mail. PAVE employs the Phoenix++ MapReduce framework hybridized with MPI, allowing us to exploit multiple nodes and cores. Our approach is significant because it drastically reduces the run-time complexity required to produce write-prints, and may expedite the process of author identification in time-sensitive situations. Our preliminary results suggest that our algorithm will enable the fast analysis of larger e-mail datasets and may be a potential asset to future investigations.
