an integrated narrowband low noise amplifier in cascode topology has been developed for WLAN applications. Using WIN's 0.15Âµm pHEMT technology, the impedance matching, voltage gain, noise figure and 1dB compression point of the circuit are analyzed and optimized under specified power consumption. Results from the simulation under advanced design system(ADS) software and momentum show that the maximum forward gain of the circuit is 20dB, noise figure is 0.93dB, OP1dB is 10dBm at the center frequency of 2.4GHz, while comsuming 42mA current from a 3.3V power supply.
