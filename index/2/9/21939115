The number of REU programs funded in Computer & Information Science and Engineering has increased from 6--12 per year prior to 2007 to a current level of 12--20 per year [www.nsf.gov]. Participation in research broadens students' experience base, increases their readiness for graduate school and the workforce, and develops their critical problem solving and communication skills. Research experiences are particularly effective at increasing the retention and success of women and minorities in computing fields [Cuny & Aspray, SIGCSE Bulletin 2002; Russell et al., Science 2007]. Despite the importance and prevalence of undergraduate research, many faculty are expected to involve undergraduates in research without having any direct experience or mentoring. Meanwhile, a growing interest in experiential learning at many institutions has led to a recent development of institutional environments in which undergraduate research is strongly supported. In many disciplines, such an environment naturally supports basic research programs that are inclusive of both under- and upperclassmen. However, computer science research at the undergraduate level presents a major challenge: most students who have the requisite knowledge to complete a novel research project are already close to graduation, which can make it difficult to involve undergraduates in longer-term research projects. In this bof, we hope to gather both experienced and novice research advisers to discuss strategies for running a continuous research effort across several graduating classes.
