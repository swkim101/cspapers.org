With massive amounts of data being generated and stored ubiquitously in every discipline and every aspect of our daily life, how to handle such big data poses many challenging issues to researchers in data and information systems. The participants of CIKM 2013 are active researchers on large scale data, information and knowledge management, from multiple disciplines, including database systems, data mining, information retrieval, human-computer interaction, and knowledge or information management. As a group of experienced researchers in academia and industry, we will present at this panel our visions on what should be the challenging research issues in this promising research frontier and hope to attract heated discussions and debates from the audience. We expect panelists with diverse backgrounds raise different challenging research problems and exchange their views with each other and with the audience. A heated discussion may help young researchers understand the need for research in both industry and academia and invest their efforts on more important research issues and make impacts to the development of new principles, methodologies, and technologies.
