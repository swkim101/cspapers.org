In this poster, we present Control-Alt-Hack": White Hat Hacking for Fun and Profit--a card game for computer security outreach and education. A general lack of awareness about computer security contributes to the insecurity of new consumer technologies. We seek to increase people's prioritization of computer security and their understanding of the variety of attacks and technologies that can be vulnerable to compromise. We work towards this goal via a recreational tabletop card game where people play as white hat hackers, using their characters' skills to perform a variety of hacking Missions. We licensed a game mechanic from a hobbyist game company, worked with graphic designers and illustrators, and rewrote card text to make the game about working as a computer security professional.
