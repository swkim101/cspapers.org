As the population-aging problem is increasingly pressing on society, and the associated healthcare costs are taking up an incremental percentage of the GNP, various inexpensive support systems for elderly people staying alone at home are becoming very demanding. Fortunately, as the Internet continues to expand exponentially and accesses to the Internet become more prevalent in our daily life, home healthcare systems based on teleoperated mobile robot platform via the Internet become feasible. In this paper, we describe a feasibility study and a basic platform design of a teleoperated home healthcare system via the Internet, which include a literature review of the state of the art in research on this topic, discussions on some open problems and challenges facing researchers in this area and a basic platform design of a home healthcare system via the Internet current under implementation in our research lab.
