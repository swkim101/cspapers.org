CHI Systems Incorporated was formed in 1985 to provide high quality research and development services and products related to Computer-Human Interaction (CHI). We focus on specialized or expert domains â€” environments where the typical user is highly expert in the application task being performed. Within these domains, we emphasize:cognitive analysis of the task and the expertise it requires,
allocation of functions between computer and human, and
design of interfaces and intelligent support tools for domain-expert system users.

We design and apply advanced methodologies and design/analysis tools for each of these steps. The primary domains in which we work are aerospace, command and control, and biotechnology.
CHI Systems functions as both an applied and basic research laboratory. In applied research, we develop innovative solutions to real-world problems in CHI posed by our clients. In basic research, we investigate basic problems involved in the design and analysis of interfaces for domain-expert end-users. We also emphasize formal and/or theory-based approaches. We have developed tools for:formal specification of object-oriented interfaces,
simulation-based function allocation and task analysis of new interface systems,
cognitive analysis and functional design of decision support systems, and
cognitive task analysis of CHI in real-time multitasking environments
