One recent change in software development is developers starting to take responsibility for the quality of their work by writing and executing automated tests. As with any new activity, there is a wide range of ways to perform this task. DevCreek helps illuminate the testing process and present a visual representation of the underlying rhythms.
 This film presents nine months of testing and development activity on the DevCreek tool itself in an animated form. We attempt to reveal, warts and all, the effort expended running tests, the test methods exercised, and the added test methods.
