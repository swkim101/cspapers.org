Soft miniaturized untethered grippers can be used to manipulate and transport biological material in unstructured and tortuous environments. Previous studies on control of soft miniaturized grippers employed cameras and optical images as a feedback modality. However, the use of cameras might be unsuitable for localizing miniaturized agents that navigate within the human body. In this paper, we demonstrate the wireless magnetic motion control and planning of soft untethered grippers using feedback extracted from B-mode ultrasound images. Results show that our system employing ultrasound images can be used to control the miniaturized grippers with an average tracking error of 0.4±0.13 mm without payload and 0.36±0.05 mm when the agent performs a transportation task with a payload. The proposed ultrasound feedback magnetic control system demonstrates the ability to control miniaturized grippers in situations where visual feedback cannot be provided via cameras.
