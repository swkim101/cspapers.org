Intel Mote 2 is based on the PXA271 microprocessor featuring the Intel XScaleÂ® core. This multi-die package includes a high performance processor, 32 MB of flash and 32 MB of SDRAM. The processor integrates a DSP coprocessor, a security coprocessor and an expanded set of I/O interfaces (including UART, I2C, SPI, USB, CIF, I2S, and AC97) to ease sensor integration. The platform also provides an on-board 802.15.4 radio and the option to add other wireless interfaces via an SDIO interface. We have ported the TinyOS and Linux operating systems to this platform.
