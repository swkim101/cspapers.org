We present a method for solving Programming by Example (PBE) problems that tightly integrates a neural network with a constraint logic programming system called miniKanren. Internally, miniKanren searches for a program that satisfies the recursive constraints imposed by the provided examples. Our Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model uses these constraints as input to score candidate programs. We show evidence that using our method to guide miniKanrenâ€™s search is a promising approach to solving PBE problems.
