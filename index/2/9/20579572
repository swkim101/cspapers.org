Background. In this work, we discuss the multi agent system, AgentTeam, from a software engineering perspective. AgentTeam is a framework for agent-based flexible management of distributed relational data; as stored in heterogeneous databases. In order to fit the inherently distributed application environment of the Internet, it is designed in an object-oriented fashion. It consists of domain-dependent system concepts and partially domain-independent software design concepts. In this contribution the domain-independent software design concepts are evaluated with respect to re-useability and scalability, and discussed in detail on the prototype, CourseMan. Re-useability means that a concept can be used in the design of systems in different application domains. Scalability means that a concept can be used multiple times inside a specific design, where concepts can be any design abstraction or implementation unit.
