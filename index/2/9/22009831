This paper presents the characteristics of a vertical L-shaped folded monopole antenna (VLFMA), which is mounted perpendicularly on a rectangular ground plane (GP) for taking into account space-saving design. By deploying the antenna element vertically to the GP, we show that it is possible to reduce the physical antenna area on GP significantly to about 21% compared to that of a conventional design, with good antenna characteristics being maintained.
