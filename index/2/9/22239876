We propose the use of a new design-first approach called Problem Stereotypes and Solution Frameworks, for teaching CS1 and CS2. A problem stereotype is a category of problems that can be solved using similar techniques. A solution framework is a typical solution to a problem, parts of which can be reused to solve other problems of this stereotype. Students are introduced to a stereotype through a selection of related problems, and common features among these are identified. Homework problems are selected from the same stereotype, with students expected to follow the "recipe" provided by the given examples to generate their own solutions. Using this approach reduces the stress level for beginner students, and prevents them falling prey to the "CS is HARD" myth. We present the results of our experience with this approach in two introductory classes and an upper-division Artificial Intelligence (AI) class at SUNY Brockport.
