In this poster, we describe an experiment exploring the effectiveness of a pen based text input device for use in query construction. Standard TREC queries were written, recognised, and subsequently retrieved upon. Comparisons between retrieval effectiveness based on the recognised writing and a typed text baseline were made. On average, effectiveness was 75% of the baseline. Other statistics on the quality and nature of recognition are also reported. .
