Computer and network security are important topics for computer professionals in US companies today. An adequate education in these topics would probably involve several classes at the undergraduate level but many computer science curricula do not have room to have numerous required courses. In addition, most computer science faculty members have not taken classes covering these topics and have never worked as professionals dealing with these areas. Dealing with these difficult issues can be a challenge, especially in a small college environment. In this paper, we present our experiences teaching computer security topics in both a system administration course and a computer security course.
