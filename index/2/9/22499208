This paper discussed the current status of the work of the ISO/TC97/SC5/WG3 data base management systems working group. In existence for over five years, this working group has devoted it energies to the elaboration and extension of the notion of a "conceptual schema" as initially defined by the ANSI/X3/SPARC/DBMS Study Group. The focus of the ISO work has been the construction of a report on conceptual schema concepts, identification of various methodologies for their construction and the application of such methodologies to an example "world" in such a fashion that comparisons can be made between the different approaches. 
 
Underlying the work of this group has been the identification of fundamental philosophical differences in the various methodologies; specifically that some assume the conceptual schema models the real world and others assume the conceptual schema models the data in the information base that holds information about the real world. This difference leads to considerable confusion in discussion when it is not explicitly recognized and one of the principal objectives of the ISO/TC97/SC5/WG3 report is to expurgate that difference.
