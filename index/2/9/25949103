Ohio State's school year is divided into four quarters, each ten weeks long. It is possible to schedule classes to meet three, four, or five hours per week. (The latter with 50 class meetings is similar to a three semester hour course.) Most students attend classes for three of the four quarters. Because the amount of material covered in a programming class is proportional to the number and quality of programs completed, we have chosen a two quarter sequence, each course meeting three days a week. The students receive four quarter hours credit (one hour of laboratory credit) for each course. The students in this sequence are mostly computer and information science majors, but there are also many mathematics and some science and engineering majors. There are other courses for administrative science, engineering and other non-technical students. All the introductory courses are taught by graduate students under the supervision of a faculty member.
