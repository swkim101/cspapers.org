Carl Jung said, 'Collective unconscious' i.e. we are all connected to each other in some way or the other via our DNA. In frequent cases there are four bases in a DNA. They are a (Adenine), c (Cytosine), g (Guanine) and t (Thymine). Each of these bases can be represented by two bits as 2 powers 2 =4 i.e. a - 00, c - 01, g - 11 and t - 10 respectively, although this choice is random. So redundancy within a sequence is more likely to exist. That's why in this paper we have explored different types of repeat to compress DNA. These are direct repeats, palindrome or reverse direct repeat, inverted exact repeats or complementary palindrome or exact reverse complement, inverted approximate repeats or approximate complementary palindrome or approximate reverse complement, interspersed or dispersed repeats, flanking repeats or terminal repeats etc. Better compression gives better network speed and save storage space.
