The workshop on "attacks and solutions in hardware security" (ASHES) deals with all aspects of hardware security, including any recent attacks and solutions in the area. Besides mainstream research in hardware security, it also covers new, alternative or emerging application scenarios, such as the internet of things, nuclear weapons inspections, satellite security, or consumer and supply chain security. It also puts some focus on special purpose hardware and novel methodological solutions, such as particularly lightweight, small, low-cost, and energy-efficient devices, or even non-electronic security systems. Finally, ASHES welcomes any theoretical works that systematize and structure the area, and so-called "Wild-and-Crazy" papers that describe and distribute seminal ideas at an early conceptual stage to the community.
