This paper presents a symbolic reasoning algorithm for use in the construction of mixed-initiative interfaces; that is, interfaces allowing several human or machine agents to share collectively the control of an ongoing, real-time activity. The algorithm, called Incremental Inference, is based on propositional logic and is related in structure to the Truth Maintenance System; however, the notion of justifications in the Truth Maintenance System is replaced with a simpler notion of recency. Basic properties of the Incremental Inference mechanism are described and compared with those of the Truth Maintenance System, and an example is provided drawn from the domain of SPECTRUM, a knowledge-based system for the geological interpretation of imaging spectrometer data.
