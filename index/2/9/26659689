Help provided as traditional text descriptions has become incompatible with graphical interfaces. Animation suggests a better association between help and a graphical interface. This paper describes a prototype system implemented to demonstrate the use of dynamic scenarios as help. A scenario animates the execution of a task as a sequence of steps in the actual interface and work context. Each scenario is dynamically generated depending on the current work context of the user. The system reasons from the user's request for help as well as from the context what and how much to animate.
In addition to the animation driving mechanism, construction of animated help requires knowledge about application semantics, user interface semantics, user interface syntax and application context. The application semantics determines the steps needed to satisfy the help request. The user interface semantics determines whether the current state of the graphical interface will support the appropriate animated help scenarios. The user interface syntax gives detailed information on how each step will actually be performed. Preconditions are used in both application and user interface semantics for reasoning in help construction. The restoring of context is performed using help session history data to return to the original work context after an animation session.
The implemented example uses a directory tree program where the graphical interface is kept simple. In future research the concept will be applied to more complicated applications.
