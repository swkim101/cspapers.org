As a pioneering work, we show what & how existing NLP techniques, data resources, and crowdsourcing can be leveraged to build such task-oriented dialogue systems for E-commerce usage. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we integrate our system into a mobile online shopping app. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an AI bot in Chinese is practically used in online shopping scenario with millions of real consumers. Interesting and insightful observations are shown in the experimental part, based on the analysis of human-bot conversation log. Several current challenges are also pointed out as our future directions.
