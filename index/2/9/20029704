Augmented Reality (AR) applications benefit from accurate detection of the objects that are within a person's view. Typically, it is not only desirable to identify what is currently within view, but also to navigate the users view to the item of interest - for example, finding a misplaced object. In this paper we demonstrate a low-power hybrid radio-optical beaconing system, where objects of interest are tagged with battery-powered RFID-like tags equipped with infrared light emitting diodes (LED) that emit periodic infrared beacons. These beacons are used for accurately estimating the angle and distance from the object to the receiver so as to locate it. The beacons are synchronized using the radio link that is also used to convey the object's unique ID.
