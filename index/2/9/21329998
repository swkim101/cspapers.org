The aim of this panel is to discuss the use of the Access Grid, and other video technologies, to broaden participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in High Performance Computing (HPC). Those groups include: people with disabilities, women and minorities. This panel will explain and demonstrate its expanded and enhanced panel model which uses the Access Grid, and recorded Access Grid sessions converted into Windows media video (*.WMV files) and other video formats to expand the panel audience and increase participation.We have developed a panel series model that discusses an overarching topic with sessions conducted bi-weekly by a single panelist located at a remote access grid site. Every other week a different panelist will present their area of expertise to the audience. There will be a total of four panel sessions with the fifth session bringing all of the panelist together via AG.
