Mass Collaboration is a new "P2P"-style approach to large-scale knowledge sharing, with applications in customer support, focused community development, and capturing knowledge distributed within large organizations. Effectively supporting this paradigm raises many technical challenges, and offers intriguing opportunities for mining massive amounts of data captured continually from user interactions. Data mining offers the promise of increased business intelligence, and also improved user experiences, leading to increased participation and greater quality in the knowledge that is captured, both of which are central objectives in Mass Collaboration. In this talk, I will introduce Mass Collaboration and discuss some important data mining related issues.
