A new association rule algorithm is discussed. It is based on the weighted association rule algorithms of minwal(0) and minwal(w).The new algorithm can effectively mine the association rules which define some attributes as antecedent partial, while others as consequent partial. The new algorithm also can effectively mine the association rules with lower support and high confidence, and these association rules are greater significant in some applications.
