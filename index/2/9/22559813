We present an overview of a tutorial on model management---an approach to solving data integration problems, such as data warehousing, e-commerce, object-to-relational mapping, schema evolution and enterprise information integration. Model management defines a small set of operations for manipulating schemas and mappings, such as Match, Compose, Inverse, and Merge. The long-term goal is to build generic implementations of the operations that can be applied to a wide variety of data integration problems.
