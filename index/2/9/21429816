The new CS curricular recommendations call for a heightened emphasis on parallel and distributed computing (PDC), in response to the explosive growth of multicore processors and "cloud" distributed computing. How can an educator incorporate this urgent priority into undergraduate CS courses? This panel describes four approaches: exploring GPU architecture and programming in a Computer Organization course; incorporating shared memory parallelism into several core courses; adding the PDC notion of reduction to multiple CS courses; and inserting short PDC modules into many courses at multiple curricular levels. We will illustrate how these contrasting approaches all respond to PDC recommendations within the feasibility constraint of incrementally modifying individual courses.
