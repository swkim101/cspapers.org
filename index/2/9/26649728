The objective of the ACSEE Scholarship program is to increase the pool of professionals in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from under-represented groups (Women, African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Physically Challenged). In 1989, ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (SIGDA) began providing the program. Beginning in 1993, the Design Automation Conference provides the funds for the scholarship and SIGDA continues to administer the program for DAC. DAC funds two $4000 scholarships renewable up to 5 years to graduating high school seniors. The former International Daisy User Group funds one $1000 one-time-only scholarship.
