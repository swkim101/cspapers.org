This paper describes a simplified student environment for lightweight processes (threads) under SunOs or compatible systems. The environment is built on top of the SunOs lwp package. A range of concurrency facilities are provided including critical sections, events and signals, and monitors. A hidden scheduler enhances the effects of the nondeterminacy, even for small student programs. A sample assignment is shown using the package.
