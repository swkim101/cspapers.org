Many community colleges are looking at Competency-Based Education (CBE) as a way to increase student recruitment, engagement, completion, and transfer to baccalaureate programs. In addition, colleges are looking at CBE as a way to reduce costs as well as provide students with clear, marketable skills for employment. CBE is particularly suited to computer science due to the nature of the discipline where well-defined, measurable outcomes can be designed and implemented. Is your college exploring a curricular redesign using CBE? Do you want to know what CBE is and how to implement a CBE curriculum in computer science? This BoF will host a discussion on planning, implementation, and scale-up of CBE programs. Besides learning about CBE, this BoF will provide attendees with a chance to connect with others trying to implement CBE programs so that they can share knowledge, share resources, and form future collaborations. The recent CS2013 curricular guidance will also be discussed as an important resource for developing CBE in CS.
