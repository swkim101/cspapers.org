A joint task force of the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society is meeting regularly to discuss issues relating to accreditation or approval in the computing sciences. In addition to considering various mechanisms to implement the important qualitative review and certification, the Joint Committee is developing a preliminary set of Computer Science Program requirements.
 Increasing requests are being made to the professional societies to provide guidance in computer science programs. While certain guidance and evaluation mechanisms exists, and agencies to administer them, these tend to be directed to specialized programs and the field is so broad that a wider view must be taken. It is estimated that as many as 500 programs not presently served by existing mechanisms and agencies would benefit from such guidance.
 This panel will discuss some of the issues relating to implementation of accreditation/approval as well as quantitative criteria for computer science programs that provide competency in the profession. Audience participation and discussion will be encouraged.
