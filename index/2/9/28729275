A lot of situations from daily life have found their counterpart in the internet. Buying or selling goods, discovering information or making social connections have been very successful in the virtual world and make the Web the central working place.
 Until now the purpose of a Web site has been defined at the time of creation. Extension of the available functionality or transfer of the functionality onto another site has only been possible with considerable additional effort. With useKit, we present a software platform that allows users to add individual selected functionalities to any Web site without installing software.
 useKit offers a new approach towards a collaborative, personalized and individually compiled view of the Web. useKit focuses on personalized applications and services that can be applied to any Web site. In analogy to file system permissions, this can be seen as an instance of the" "executable Web"" or Web 3.0 if Web 1.0 was ""read-only"", and Web 2.0 was "read-write"". User contributed code will morph online applications into omnipresent functional platforms with a single interface.
