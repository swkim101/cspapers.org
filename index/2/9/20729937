The computer science department at Cornell is a graduate department. Approximately sixty degree candidates are formally enrolled in the computer science degree program, nearly all of them as Ph.D. candidates. There is no formal undergraduate major in computer science, although it is possible for really tenacious undergraduates in the College of Arts and Sciences, and in Engineering to obtain an undergraduate degree in computer science by special petition.
