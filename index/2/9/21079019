We present Feeling Fireworks, a tactile firework show. Feeling Fireworks is aimed at making fireworks more inclusive for blind and visually impaired users in a novel experience that is open to all. Tactile effects are created using directable water jets that spray onto the rear of a flexible screen, with different nozzles for different firework effects. Our approach is low-cost and scales well, and allows for dynamic tactile effects to be rendered with high spatial resolution. A user study demonstrates that the tactile effects are meaningful analogs to the visual fireworks that they represent. Beyond the specific application, the technology represents a novel and cost-effective approach for making large scalable tactile displays.
