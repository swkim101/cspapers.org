We introduce an information theoretic model predictive control (MPC) algorithm capable of handling complex cost criteria and general nonlinear dynamics. The generality of the approach makes it possible to use multi-layer neural networks as dynamics models, which we incorporate into our MPC algorithm in order to solve model-based reinforcement learning tasks. We test the algorithm in simulation on a cart-pole swing up and quadrotor navigation task, as well as on actual hardware in an aggressive driving task. Empirical results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of achieving a high level of performance and does so only utilizing data collected from the system.
