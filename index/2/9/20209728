There is growing awareness that calculators could/should play an integral role in elementary school and secondary school education. But most current precollege level teachers have received little training about calculators and computers. Most teacher training institutions have given relatively little thought to these issues. This paper lists several possible courses that might be offered to elementary school or secondary school teachers. A questionnaire about these courses was mailed to 363 people interested in the field of computers in education. This paper analyzes and discusses the results of the 188 questionnaires that were returned.
