Data Base Management Systems (DBMS's) can be divided in three main categories according to the basic data organization offered to their users. The three approaches are: hierarchical, network and relational. In future DBMS's all views may have to be offered to please a diverse population of users. Acknowledging this requirement a common facility has often been proposed under the name of a conceptual schema. The conceptual schema comprises a common denominator for all three DBMS approaches.
