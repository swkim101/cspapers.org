While many curriculum recommendations have been proposed, (1,3,4,5,9), there remain gaps in the specification of 4-year programs, one being in the area of the applied B.S. degree. This paper presents one attempt to fill this gap with a program whose goal is to produce competent computer professionals, not candidates for graduate schools. Within the constraints of a limited faculty, the quarter calendar, and an applied orientation, it still incorporates much of the thrust and content of the more theoretically oriented recommendations. We believe that this effort may serve as a model for other schools who share our charge to train applications oriented professionals, and that the curriculum design process which we illustrate may be useful in even broader contexts.
