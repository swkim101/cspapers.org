Peer-reviewing is a community-driven activity where volunteer researchers assess the work of other researchers. Peer-reviewing is an important and time-consuming activity that has very little recognition. This lack of incentive may lead to poor-quality reviews and frustration from researchers. In this paper, we envision ScienceMiles, a Blockchain-based platform to manage the incentivization of peer-reviewers through a crypto-currency.
