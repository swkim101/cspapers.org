This paper concentrates on studying, designing and manufacturing a dual - band and high - bandwidth antenna applied for 3G and 4G mobile handsets. This antenna can work in UMTS bands of 1900 MHz frequencies, also work in 4G-LTE of 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz and 2600MHz frequencies. Antenna is printed on FR4 substrate with size of 50 mm Ã— 50 mm, thickness of 1.6 mm and relative permittivity of 4.4. The propose antenna is experimentally studied.
