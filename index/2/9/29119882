My catholic interests include biomimetic robotics, evolutionary robotics, connectionist computing, computer vision, and electronic sensors and hardware. A mathematician by training, I have many years experience of electronic systems design, both academic and commercial, and familiarity with engineering language and methods. I enjoy travel and working in other countries.
