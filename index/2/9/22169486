A Subcommittee on Small College Programs, was appointed by the Committee on Curriculum in Computer Science, of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1969. This group was charged with responsibility of making recommendations for the development of programs in computer science in smaller colleges and universities.
 The report will consider course structure, to be offered with the constraints of limited faculty, and with a wide variety of objectives. Outlines of the key courses will be included, as well as recommendations for independent study courses.
 Another significant factor involved in these considerations, is the relationship of computer science to the computer center, and to the college as a whole. In particular, the service nature of the department and the center, and the development of meaningful computer use within the schools will be considered.
 Finally, recommendations will be given regarding faculty acquisition and development.
