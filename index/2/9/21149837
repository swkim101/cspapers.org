GPUs lack fundamental support for data-dependent parallelism and synchronization. While CUDA Dynamic Parallelism signals progress in this direction, many limitations and challenges still remain. This paper introduces Wireframe, a hardware-software solution that enables generalized support for data-dependent parallelism and synchronization. Wireframe enables applications to naturally express execution dependencies across different thread blocks through a dependency graph abstraction at run-time, which is sent to the GPU hardware at kernel launch. At run-time, the hardware enforces the dependencies specified in the dependency graph through a dependency-aware thread block scheduler. Overall, Wireframe is able to improve total execution time up to 65.20% with an average of 45.07%.
