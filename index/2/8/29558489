Contextual Motor Feedback (CMF). For user-system interaction, most existing equipment uses mechanical input devices and visual and auditory output devices. Contextual motor feedback employs other modalities to provide feedback about the state of the system: the human motor system. Users can detect changes in the mechanical behaviour of a system by their tactile and kinesthetic senses. Contextual motor feedback lets user and system communicate over the same physical parameters: position, speed and force.
