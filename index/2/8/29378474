In this submission, we describe the Linked Services Infrastructure (LSI). It uses Semantic Web Service technology to map individual concepts (identified by Linked Data URIs) to sets of online media content aggegrated from heterogeneous Web APIs. It exposes this mapping service in a RESTful API and returns RDF based responses for further processing if desired. The LSI can be used as a general purpose tool for user agents to retrieve different online media resources to illustrate a concept to a user.
