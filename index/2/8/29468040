This paper describes our experience in using Ada as a vehicle for teaching Software Engineering concepts in a course for first year undergraduate students at the University of Montreal.
We first review the curriculum at our university and then give an idea of the hardware and software at our disposition. We describe the goals we had in mind in using Ada as a teaching language and then we detail the topics and the assignments chosen in our course. We conclude by describing a few lessons learned from that experience. All in all, we are very satisfied with this experiment and we intend to carry on next year.
