In this paper, in order to decouple the design parameters of power bipolar junction transistors during their extraction, our work focuses on the study of the variation effect of the design parameters on the static and dynamic characteristics of the power BJT. Indeed, an attempt is made to assign a specific characteristic to each design parameter, which has a significant influence while taking into account the importance of each parameter variation effect on different characteristics of the transistor. This will eventually facilitate the development of an algorithm with a certain estimation order leading to an accurate estimation of the power BJTs design parameters. This algorithm will be the basis of a non-destructive estimation procedure of the design parameters of power BJTs, kept confidential by the device designers.
