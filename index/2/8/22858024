The Laboratory for Collaborative Diagnostics works in the field of Collaborative Diagnostics. A definition of Collaborative Diagnostics is found at www.lcd.utoronto.ca. The Malaria TV project is an application of our Collaborative Digital Microscope project described in greater detail at the link (www.lcd.utoronto.ca/collaborativedigitalmicroscope.html).The Malaria TV project will give participants a sense on how public health tools can be designed, developed and delivered using: 1)collaboration technologies like Access Grid; 2)commodity or cheap computation gear and 3)generic public health lab microscopes and CCD cameras.To demonstrate the tool's effectiveness the participants will be able to interact with a real live parasitologist who will interpret and explanation biological samples. We will also be attempting to link in labs from other parts of Canada and Africa.The session will give participants a sense on how collaboration technology can be used to address very real problems.
