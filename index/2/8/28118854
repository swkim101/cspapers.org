This paper provides an overview of efforts to create an informatics infrastructure for the biodiversity community. A vast amount of biodiversity information exists, but no comprehensive infrastructure is in place to provide easy assess and effective use of this information. The advent of modern information technologies provides a foundation for a remedy. Biodiversity informatics infrastructures are being called for at national, regional, and global levels, and plans are in place to coordinate these efforts to ensure interoperability. The paper reviews some essential requirements and some challenges related to building this infrastructure.
