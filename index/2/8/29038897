Spreadsheet data is widely used today by many different people and across industries. However, writing, maintaining and identifying good formulae for spreadsheets can be time consuming and error-prone. To address this issue we have introduced the TaCLe system (Tabular Constraint Learner). The system tackles an inverse learning problem: given a plain comma separated file, it reconstructs the spreadsheet formulae that hold in the tables. Two important considerations are the number of cells and constraints to check, and how to deal with multiple formulae for the same cell. Our system reasons over entire rows and columns and has an intuitive user interface for interacting with the learned constraints and data. It can be seen as an intelligent assistance tool for discovering formulae from data. As a result, the user obtains a spreadsheet that can automatically recompute dependent cells when updating or adding data.
