Relaying transmission enables the high performance of wireless communication systems. Therefore, many researches have investigated this technique. However, most of the studies supposed the ideal-hardware and ignored the co-channel interference. For accuracy design, it highly motivates to account for hardware impairment and interference in analyzing relaying systems. In this paper, we model the multi-hop relaying channel, considering both hardware impairment and co-channel interference. We then analyze the performance of the system in terms of outage probability and ergodic capacity. Specially, the exact and asymptotic (at high signal-to-noise and interference ratio) closedform expressions of outage probability and ergodic capacity are both given over Rayleigh fading channels.
