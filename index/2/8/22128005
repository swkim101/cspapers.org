In this paper, we present a precise robot-aided single-cell surgery system to perform single-cell biopsy for cells <25 Î¼m in diameter. A microfluidic chip is designed to arrange upto 100 individual cells in an array. A micropipette mounted onto a 3-DOF micromanipulator and a computer mouse-operated high-precision XY stage is developed to perform high-precision and high-throughput single-cell biopsy. The system is evaluated experimentally by extracting two organelles from adherent cells patterned in a microfluidic chip. The fluorescent-labeled nucleus and mitochondria of human foreskin fibroblast cells are biopsied to demonstrate the capability of the proposed system. The survival rate of the semi-automated biopsy is 73% and 45% for mitochondrial and nucleus biopsies, respectively.
