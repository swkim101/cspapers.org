Regrasping, given initial and final pose of the target object, is a construction of sequential transition of object poses that are compatible with two poses in the point of grasp configuration. This paper presents a novel approach for solving the regrasp problem. The approach consists of a preprocessing and planning stages. Preprocessing, which is done only once for a given robot, generates a look-up table which has information of kinematically feasible task space of end-effector through all the workspace. Then, using the table, planning automatically determines possible intermediate location, pose and regrasp sequence leading from the pick-up to put-down grasp. Experiments show that the approach presented is complete in the total workspace. The regrasp planner was combined with the existing path.
