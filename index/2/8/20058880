Recently there is a growing interest of incorporating cellular architecture (with wired base stations and last-hop wireless connections) into fieldbuses to support mobile real-time applications. A promising trend is that such cellular fieldbuses will go multichannel multiradio, due to the wide availability of cheap multichannel commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless nodes, and the rise of 4G and future cellular technologies. For multichannel multiradio cellular fieldbuses, per-flow real-time schedulability guarantee in the inter-cell level has not yet been well studied. Particularly, unlike 3G cellular networks, which use static FDMA/CDMA to isolate cells, the multichannel multiradio feature allows neighboring cells to use the same radio frequency channel at different time-slots, or the same time-slot at different radio frequency channels. How to carry out channel time-slot scheduling is therefore the focus of this paper. To address this issue, we propose a greedy scheduling algorithm, together with a polynomial time closed-form schedulability test. The relationship between the schedulability test result, greedy scheduling schedulability, and schedulability is explored. We prove the equivalence of the three for chained cellular fieldbus topology, a typical topology with broad applications. This also implies the optimality of greedy scheduling, and the sufficiency and necessity of the schedulability test in the context of chained topology. To demonstrate and validate these schedulability theories, we carry out a case study on a classic admission planning problem. The schedulability test not only serves as a planning constraint, but also guides us to propose an approximation algorithm to solve the NP-hard admission planning problem. Comparisons to exhaustive search corroborate the validity of our schedulability theories.
