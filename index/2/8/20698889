We propose to demonstrate SummIt -- a tool for extractive summarization, discovery and analysis. The main goal of SummIt is to provide consumable summaries that are driven by users' information intents. To this end, SummIt discovers and analyzes potential intents that can be used for summarization. Given an intent, SummIt generates a summary based on a novel unsupervised, query-focused, extractive, multi-document summarization approach. Using visualization aids, SummIt further allows to analyze a given summary and explore both its narrow and broader context.
