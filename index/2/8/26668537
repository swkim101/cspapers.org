SRFS on Ether adds an ethernet interface to the Shared Rapid File System (SRFS) that is currently used as a distributed file system between nodes by the HPC-system. It can be used like NFS and has solved the problem of data coherency in the high-speed transmission of data in a broadband environment, which NFS has not. Moreover, adjustment of the TCP/IP parameters in the OS to improve speed is unnecessary, and special hardware is not needed, unlike with the SAN construction by iFCP and others. For additional speed, it stripes data streams automatically (default MAX 8 streams), switches protocols between TCP and UDP based on IOsize.In this bandwidth challenge, we demonstrate security using a host-to-host IPSec connection between Tampa and Tokyo. To show performance, we used a hardware IPSec accelerator and tuned TCP/IP with SRFS on Ether's.
