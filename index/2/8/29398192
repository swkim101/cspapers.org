The ACM and IEEE-CS have endorsed the idea that computing curricula should consider problems created by malfunctioning and misapplied computer systems [22]. Key ACM and IEEE-CS publications, however, have devoted scant attention to problems created by occupational hazards in computing. This paperâ€™s authors believe that a responsible computing curriculum should discuss at least one computer-related occupational hazard: a potentially crippling and increasingly common disorder known as repetitive strain injury (RSI). RSI is a soft-tissue disorder that results from the repetitive use of some part of the body. Among computer users, RSI is typically caused by the excessive or improper use of keyboards and mice [17, p. 25ffJ. If allowed to progress, RSI can eventually produce chronic numbness, weakness, pain, and even paralysis in affhcted muscles [17, p. 611. One reason for focusing on RSI is that anyone who uses a computer for more than 2 to 4 hours daily is at risk for RSI [17, p. 403. A second is that a little information regarding the recognition, prevention, and treatment of RSI will reduce this risk. In an hour, an instructor can convey the basic information that a computer user needs to know about RSI. This knowledge is important for three reasons:
