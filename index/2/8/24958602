This paper proposes to use multichannel speech presence probability (MC-SPP) to modify and improve the noise reduction quality of the power level difference (PLD) algorithm for dual microphone case. Firstly, a modified Wiener filter is proposed with a varying scaling factor depending on MC-SPP, which helps solve the speech distortion problem usually encountered in noise reduction algorithms. Secondly, an improved PLD noise estimation is proposed with a varying updating factor, also depending on the MC-SPP, which reduces noise and increase output SINR a lot while suffer only a little in speech distortion. These algorithms are simulated, compared and verified for various noise and SINR scenarios.
