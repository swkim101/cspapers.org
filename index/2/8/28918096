In this paper, we design a pluggable data management solution for modern mobile platforms (e.g., Android). Our goal is to allow data management mechanisms and policies to be implemented independently of core app logic. Our design allows a user to install data management solutions as apps, install multiple such solutions on a single device, and choose a suitable solution each for one or more apps. It allows app developers to focus their effort on app logic and helps the developers of data management solutions to achieve wider deployability. It also gives increased control of data management to end users and allows them to use different solutions for different apps. We present a prototype implementation of our design called BlueMountain, and implement several data management solutions for file and database management to demonstrate the utility and ease of using our design. We perform detailed microbenchmarks as well as end-to-end measurements for files and databases to demonstrate the performance overhead incurred by our implementation.
