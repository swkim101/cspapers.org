In the paper we present and demonstrate the modular prototyping platform designed for trialing the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The new devices are constructed by stacking together the various hardware modules encapsulating power sources, processing units, wired and wireless transceivers, sensors and actuators, or sets of those. The main processing unit automatically identifies all the attached modules and adjusts own operation accordingly. The demo will showcase how the platform can be used for building up multi-radio technology enabled wireless devices which will automatically form a heterogeneous wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN). The possible use case scenarios and the ongoing research activities around the platform will be highlighted as well.
