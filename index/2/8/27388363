A model of learning in a highly active and competitive environment is presented here. This paper posits that learning, under these conditions, can be characterized as accommodating examples produced by the Constrained Example Generation (CEG) process. The role of the "CEG process in the LRCEG system is demonstrated by a typical learning scenario.
