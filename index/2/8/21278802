This paper presents the design and performance of an on-chip antenna for UWB communications systems. The antenna is a miniaturized monopole planar antenna that designed to radiate directly from the silicon die with compact dimensions of (2.6×1.3×0.7)mm3. The antenna is designed for cointegration with CMOS impulse radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) pulse generator (6-10GHz) which is designed using 130nm CMOS technology. The designed antenna supports communication between 8.4-10.4GHz with |S11|<;-10dB and gain of -14dB. The results have proved the viability of planar antennas on silicon and can lead to the fabrication of highly efficient RF circuits.
