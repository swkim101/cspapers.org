Automation of the design of electronic circuits in general is a challenging task. Work in the Electronics Engineering Department at Lawrence Radiation Laboratory is no exceptionâ€”projects range from infrared telemetry and solid state devices to oscilloscopes, lasers, computers and nuclear instruments. Most of the design automation activity thus far can perhaps be more properly described as simply computer-aided or computeroriented design with the aim of letting the computer perform those tasks in which it exhibits some competence. Toward this goal, there are at present several large CAD programs which are in use at the Laboratory. Figure 1 provides a glimpse at some of those which are installed or are pending. Several of the analysis programs being used (POTTLE, CIRCUIT, PREDICT, SCEPTRE, etc.) are described and compared in (1). Supplementing these are versions of a program under development at the Laboratory that is intended primarily for the design and layout of printed circuits.
 This paper reviews some of the general features of the basic program, which is called PUZZLE by its originators and designers, Ronald Zane and Deanna Wilber, of the Laboratory in Berkeley (6), and covers some of the special problems and solutions which become evident in a time-shared remote console version of the program.
