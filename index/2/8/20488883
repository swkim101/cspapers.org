Direct kinematics (DK) of cable-driven parallel robots (CDPR) based only on cable lengths measurements is a complex issue even with ideal cables and consequently even harder for more realistic cable models such as sagging cable. A natural way to simplify the DK solving is to add sensors. We consider here sensors that give a partial or complete measurement of the cable direction at the anchor points and/or measure the orientation of the platform of CDPR with 2 or 3 cables and we assume that the measurements are exact. We provide a solving procedure and maximal number of DK solutions for an extensive combination of sensors for CDPR with sagging cables. We show that at least two measurements are necessary for the planar 2 cables case while six are necessary for the spatial 3 cables case. For spatial CDPR with n cables we prove that at least 2n additional sensors will be required to get a closed-form solution of the DK.
