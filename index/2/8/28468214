In this poster we present a set of hands-on labs for a mini-course on mobile application development that can be used as a lab component of any Computing course. The labs revolve around a single theme whereby students experiment with designing and developing the user interface, interaction model, and inter-connectivity of a mobile application for Google Scholar; the developed application can be deployed on a variety of mobile platforms, including BlackBerry, Android, and iPhone devices (smartphones and tablets). Students learn about mobile programming models and cross-platform development and appreciate the unique opportunities such devices offer, but also become aware of the development challenges they present.
