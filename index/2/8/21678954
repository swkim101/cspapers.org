Neural machine translation requires large amount of parallel training text to learn a reasonable quality translation model. This is particularly inconvenient for language pairs for which enough parallel text is not available. In this paper, we use monolingual linguistic resources in the source side to address this challenging problem based on a multi-task learning approach. More specifically, we scaffold the machine translation task on auxiliary tasks including semantic parsing, syntactic parsing, and named-entity recognition. This effectively injects semantic and/or syntactic knowledge into the translation model, which would otherwise require a large amount of training bitext to learn from. We empirically analyze and show the effectiveness of our multitask learning approach on three translation tasks: English-to-French, English-to-Farsi, and English-to-Vietnamese.
