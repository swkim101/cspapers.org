Existing MEMS products boast more than a mill ion electri cal and mechanical components on a single chip. With several bil l ion dollars in sales in 1997 and exponential growth i t is clear that MEMS fabrication technology has leveraged decades of IC expertise to great advantage. As a result , the fabrication capabili t ies far outstrip the design capabili t ies in both industry and university environments. MEMS CAD tools are only now beginning to leverage corresponding decades of IC CAD expertise to address the exciting and unique electro-mechanical codesign problems from the physical through system level design. Perspectives represented in this panel include the industry needs at the system and device levels, tool developers at all levels, and the government research vision.
