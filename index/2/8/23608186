Code magnet labs are 5-10 minute activities where students are asked to construct a method, function or rule to complete a specific task. The programming languages Java, C/C++, Python and Prolog are supported. In a code magnet lab the student is presented with a sequence of possible code magnets that can be arranged using drag-and-drop to create the desired method. Magnets for control statements can nest other magnets, including nested control statements. The completed method is compiled and subject to unit testing. Test results guide students towards a correct solution; multiple submissions are allowed. Since there is no keyboard entry when using code magnet labs, the labs can be completed using laptops, desktops, tablets and other mobile devices. This workshop is a shorter version of the half-day workshop presented with support from three NSF grants. Participants will experience using existing labs and learn to build their own code magnet lab for Java, Python, C or Prolog (participant's choice). Significant stipends averaging about $1000 will be available for after-workshop activities where the participant develops and tests multiple code magnet labs for his/her own courses in the 2014-2015 academic year. All participants will need a laptop to complete lab activities; teams will only require one laptop per team.
