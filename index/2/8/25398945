In this paper, we consider code tracking biases of the delay lock loops with a single and a double early-minus-late discriminators for a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and a binary offset carrier (BOC) signals, denoted by the SEML and the DEML, in a static multipath environments. Based on the mathematical analysis of the code tracking bias when the SEML tracks the code phase of the received BPSK signal, we derive the code tracking biases when both schemes track the each signal. And the maximum code tracking bias for the generalized BOC signal is also presented.
