The micro:bit (http://www.microbit.org) is a pocket-sized, programmable computing device, designed to engage people with computing technology. The micro:bit is visually appealing, fun, easy to code and inexpensive. It is widely available at schools in the United Kingdom and is now being rolled out world-wide. Key features of the micro:bit that make it a great device for physical computing include a display of 25 LEDs, two programmable input buttons, a USB connector, an edge connector, built-in sensors (e.g. accelerometer, compass and temperature sensor), Bluetooth and a battery pack connector. With these physical attributes, the micro:bit can be used to interact with the world in engaging ways such as a watch, a guitar or a moisture sensor. Multi-person games and apps are possible since micro:bits can communicate with each other. Programming the micro:bit can take place on almost any device (laptop, tablet, desktop) that has a modern browser and a USB connection. The micro:bit platform supports programming in a block-based language or a safe version of JavaScript, which provides a progression for learners of different ages and experience levels. This demo will appeal to computer education researchers specializing in K-12 as well as to instructors wanting a new way to introduce computing in CS101 with a "maker" flavor. In the demo we will show the platform and the hardware. Attendees will have the chance to create apps on real micro:bits. It will be helpful to bring a device with a browser.
