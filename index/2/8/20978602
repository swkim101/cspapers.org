Computer and video games have grown to be a major industry but, until recently, have largely been ignored by academia. The last couple of years, however, have seen the emergence of new academic programs, conferences, and journals dedicated to games studies. This panel discusses a variety of ways, and whys, for introducing games into computer science curricula. Panelists discuss their experiences in designing a broad range of courses including a games course for women, a software development course that uses games as projects, an introductory games programming course in Java, and an advanced graphics course that focuses on games.
