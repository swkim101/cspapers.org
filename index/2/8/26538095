Different mining approaches have been proposed in literature for the automatic generation of temporal assertions from execution traces of digital systems. However, in most cases, existing tools can only mine assertions compliant with a limited set of pre-defined templates. Furthermore, they tend to generate a huge amount of assertions, while they still lack an effective way to measure their coverage in terms of design behaviours. To fill in the gap, this paper presents A-TEAM, a tool for the automatic extraction of temporal assertions starting from a set of user-defined assertion templates. Our method involves a combination of data mining and coverage analysis for mining a compact and expressive set of LTL formulas.
