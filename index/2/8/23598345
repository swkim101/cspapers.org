A number of new modularization techniques are emerging to cope with the challenges of contemporary software engineering, such as aspect-oriented software development (AOSD), feature-oriented programming (FOP), and the like. The effective assessment of such emerging modularization technologies plays a pivotal role on: (i) a better understanding of their real benefits and drawbacks when compared to conventional development techniques, and (ii) their effective transfer to mainstream software development. The ACoM workshop is the first initiative to put together researchers and practitioners with different backgrounds in order to discuss the multi-faceted issues that emerge in the assessment and/or comparison of new modularization techniques. The workshop is strongly focused on discussions around short presentations and theme-specific groups.
