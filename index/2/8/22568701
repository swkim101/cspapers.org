Users who wish to leave an online forum often do not have the freedom to erase their data completely from the service providers' (SP) system. The primary reason behind this is that analytics on such user data form a core component of many online providers' business models. On the other hand, if the profiles reside in the SP's system in an unchanged form, major privacy violations may occur if the infrastructure is compromised, or the SP is acquired by another organization. In this work, we investigate an alternative solution to standard profile removal, where posts of different users are split and merged into synthetic mediator profiles. The goal of our framework is to preserve the SP's data mining utility as far as possible, while minimizing users' privacy risks. We present several mechanisms of assigning user posts to such mediator accounts and show the effectiveness of our framework using data from StackExchange and various health forums.
