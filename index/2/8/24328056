In this paper, we propose a method for down-sized decoding of H.264/AVC with low decoding complexity. The method extracts the DC values of blocks in reconstructed pictures without full decoding. The DC values are divided by 4 to make the down-sized pictures of reconstructed frames. For intra-coded blocks, the intra prediction mode of a block and DC values of neighboring blocks are used to obtain DC value of the block. The motion compensation (MC) is modified to obtain DC value of an inter-coded block by referring to DC values of reference pictures. Experimental results show that the decoding complexity can be reduced up to 77% while maintaining the acceptable subjective quality for down-sized images.
