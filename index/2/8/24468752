Panelists will describe their schools' approaches to outcomes assessment for computer science students. Both successful and failed approaches will be discussed. Approaches to assessment start with the identification of program goals and selection of appropriate measures. Measurable results include student performance on standardized and locally developed tests, placement statistics, alumni interviews, employer perceptions, and other skills assessment. Pitfalls will be discussed. Results of outcomes assessment at each institution will be presented, including the management of collected data, interpretation of results, and integration of the results into the curriculum development process.
