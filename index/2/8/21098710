Self-similarity is a property that is found in natural geometry. By using this recursive nature of geometrical objects we can generate them. Similarly, we can store these geometrical objects in encoded form. Iterated functions system (IFS) is a way of expressing geometrical objects, containing this property, mathematically. We call such objects Fractals. Considering that most of the images are merely collection of such natural geometrical objects we can find an IFS for them using reverse engineering. This paper is a study of some approaches for image coding and compression using IFS.
