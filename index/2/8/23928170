The rapidly improving capabilities of large scale integrated circuit (LSI) manufacturing technology provide the opportunity for dramatic advances in digital system economy, capacity and flexibility for those who are prepared to modify their design philosophy and procedures to take full advantage of it. This involves much more than the simple first step of replacing core memory with standard LSI memory arrays.
 With an effective computer-aided design system it is possible to combine logic, memory, shift registers, and other digital system circuitry on the same chip in a custom LSI design at a total design, test and initial production lot cost competitive with the design, development, packaging and initial production and test cost for equipment of comparable complexity using discrete components and standard integrated circuits. The resulting LSI custom unit would cost much less than its conventional counterpart in subsequent production as well as being smaller, more reliable, and consuming less power.
