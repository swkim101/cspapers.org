Most existing hashing methods resort to binary codes for similarity search, owing to the high efficiency of computation and storage. However, binary codes lack enough capability in similarity preservation, resulting in less desirable performance. To address this issue, we propose an asymmetric multi-valued hashing method supported by two different non-binary embeddings. (1) A real-valued embedding is used for representing the newly-coming query. (2) A multi-integer-embedding is employed for compressing the whole database, which is modeled by binary sparse representation with fixed sparsity. With these two non-binary embeddings, the similarities between data points can be preserved precisely. To perform meaningful asymmetric similarity computation for efficient semantic search, these embeddings are jointly learnt by preserving the label-based similarity. Technically, this results in a mixed integer programming problem, which is efficiently solved by alternative optimization. Extensive experiments on three multilabel datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms the existing binary hashing methods in search accuracy, but also retains their query and storage efficiency.
