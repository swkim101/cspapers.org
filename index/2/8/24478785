Post-silicon validation is a necessary step in a design's verification process. Pre-silicon techniques such as simulation and emulation are limited in scope and volume as compared to what can be achieved on the silicon itself. Some parts of the verification, such as full-system functional verification, cannot be practically covered with current pre-silicon technologies. This panel brings together experts from industry, academia, and EDA to review the differences and similarities between pre- and post-silicon, discuss how the fundamental aspects of verification are affected by these differences, and explore how the gaps between the two worlds can be bridged.
