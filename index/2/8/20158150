We define straightness and convexity of regions in a digital picture. Then it is shown that a few important properties satisfied by convex (Euclidean) regions are also satisfied by convex digital regions. We extend the definition of digital convexity of regions to digital solids. Efficient algorithms are presented that determine whether or not a digital region is convex, a digital arc is a digital straight line segment and a digital solid is convex.
