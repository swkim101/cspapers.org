We present a novel method to track 3D models in color and depth data. To this end, we introduce approximations that accelerate the state-of-the-art in region-based tracking by an order of magnitude while retaining similar accuracy. Furthermore, we show how the method can be made more robust in the presence of depth data and consequently formulate a new joint contour and ICP tracking energy. We present better results than the state-of-the-art while being much faster then most other methods and achieving all of the above on a single CPU core.
