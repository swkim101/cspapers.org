BlueJ is a beginner's IDE for Java which has been in popular use for over ten years. But it continues to improve and evolve: BlueJ 4.0.0 was recently released with several new features. Git support has been added in a user-friendly way, and the support for writing JavaFX GUI applications has been improved. BlueJ 4 also includes the frame-based Stride editor (previously seen in Greenfoot), which allows for block-like programming. BlueJ 4 also retains all its existing functionality such as interactive object creation and method invocation, a "REPL"-like code pad, a debugger and testing support. This workshop, run by the developers of BlueJ, will take the participants, whether new to BlueJ and Java or long-time users, through the new features while also providing an introduction/refresher on the existing capabilities of the software. Participants will learn how to share BlueJ projects via Github, create a new JavaFX application, dabble with Stride and get a tour of the existing BlueJ functionality. A laptop with BlueJ 4.0 installed is required.
