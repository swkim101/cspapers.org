In this paper, we propose a simple theoretical model to compute the maximum spatial reuse feasible in a VANET. We focus on the ad hoc mode of the IEEE 802.11p standard. Our model offers simple and closed formulae on the maximum number of simultaneous transmitters, and on the distribution of the distance between them. It leads to an accurate upper bound on the maximum capacity. In order to validate our approach, we performed a set of experimentations of the IEEE 802.11p standard allowing us to consider realistic radio models. Analytical models have been compared to simulations performed with the network simulator NS-3 (http://www.nsnam.org) where we have implemented the obtained radio models.
