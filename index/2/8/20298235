To deal with such problem, a method called Label Distribution Learning (LDL) was proposed to utilize the neighboring ages while learning a particular age. Later, an adaptive version of LDL called ALDL was proposed to generate a proper label distribution for each age. However, the adaptation process requires more training data, which creates a dilemma between the performance of ALDL and the training data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Semi-supervised Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SALDL) to solve the dilemma and improve the performance using unlabeled data for facial age estimation. On the one hand, the utilization of unlabeled data helps to improve the adaptation process. On the other hand, the adapted label distributions conversely reinforce the semi-supervised process. As a result, they can promote each other to get better performance. Experimental results show that SALDL performs remarkably better than state-of-the-art algorithms when there are only limited accurately labeled data available.
