In this demonstration we will present technologies that enable learners to engage in spoken conversations in foreign languages, integrating intelligent tutoring and serious game capabilities into a package that helps learners quickly acquire communication skills. Conversational AI technologies based on the SAIBA framework for dialog modeling are realized in this 3-D game environment. Participants will be introduced to tools for authoring dialogs in this framework, and will have an opportunity to experience learning with Alelo products, including the Operational Language and Culture Training System (OLCTS).
