This paper introduces a new concept of building soft pneumatic structures by assembling modular units of fabric-based rotary actuators (FRAs) and beams. Upon pressurization, the inner folds of FRA would expand, which causes the FRA module to unfold, generating angular displacement. Hence, FRAs would enable mobility function of the structure and its range of motion. The modular nature of the actuator units enables customized configuration of pneumatic structures, which can be modified and scaled by selecting the appropriate modules. FRAs are also designed to be bladder-less, that is, they are made without an additional layer of inner bladder. Thus, a simple fabrication process can be used to prepare the actuators. In this paper, we studied how the performance of the FRA modules changes with their dimensions and demonstrated how a soft gripper can be constructed using these modules. The kinematic response of the actuator segments of the gripper was analyzed and a pressure control algorithm was developed to regulate the pneumatic pressure of the actuator. The modular based soft robotic gripper alone weighs about 140g. Yet, based on the grip tests, it is able to lift heavier objects (up to 2.4kg), achieving a high payload-to-weight ratio of about 1714%, which is higher than the value reported by previously developed soft pneumatic grippers using elastomeric materials. Lastly, we also demonstrated that the gripper is capable of performing two essential grasping modes, which are power grasping and fingertip grasping, for objects of various shapes.
