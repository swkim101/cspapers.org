The Concern Manipulation Environment (CME) aims to provide a set of open, extensible components and a set of tools that promote aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) throughout the software lifecycle. It has two main goals:
 To provide an open, integrated development environment (IDE) to enable software engineers to use AOSD techniques throughout the software lifecycle, and to allow them to use different AOSD approaches in an integrated manner.
 To promote the rapid development of new tools supporting AOSD at any stage of the software lifecycle, and to serve as an integrating platform for such tools, facilitating development and experimentation with new AOSD approaches.
 This demonstration will highlight a number of tools and components that are useful to software developers and to AOSD tool providers and researchers. Tools for software developers include ones that allow developers to identify, model and visualize concerns, aspects and relationships in their software, covering software artifacts of any type, including both code and non-code artifacts, and including latent concerns or aspects that were not separated in the artifacts; that enable flexible queries over software; and that compose/integrate aspects and other concerns. For AOSD tool providers and researchers, the demonstration will describe some of the CME's support for integration of tools and approaches within the environment, highlighting the integration of Java, AspectJ and Ant artifacts within the CME, and how to use the CME's extensible components to create new AOSD tools or prototypes rapidly.
