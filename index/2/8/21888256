The MST program at Illinois Institute of Technology evolved as a result of Computer Science emerging as a separate discipline at the secondary school level. The State of Illinois and the Chicago Board of Education have both been investigating certification for Computer Science teachers, but at present only two states, Wisconsin and Minnesota, have certification programs for teachers of Computer Science. In the not too far distant future there will be certification programs in many states and the IIT MST program in Computer Science is designed to meet those requirements.
 It is important to realize before discussing the program itself that the MST program is not designed to teach people how to teach. Before entering the program, a teacher must have at least three years of superior teaching experience as well as recommendations from his principal attesting to his quality as a teacher. Of the 32 semester hours required for the MST degree, a maximum of 12 semester hours are in Computer Pedagogy, with the norm being nine. In addition, students in the program study on a part-time basis to encourage use of the principles studied at IIT in their own classrooms.
