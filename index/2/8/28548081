Recently, technologies for fabricating real-world objects and products that can be designed and built directly by the end-user have decreased in costs and are increasingly common. These technologies are expected to have a great impact on society and the personal fabrication concept has been described as the "new or third industrial revolution". However, there is a great need to explore many novel research challenges and issues before the idea of personal fabrication becomes truly pervasive and applicable to the wider public. PerFab is a workshop for providing a forum to bring together researchers from various disciplines working in this area. We intend to identify, explore and contribute to the research challenges that will allow personal fabrication to be pervasive. We will invite paper submissions to our workshop, review the submissions with a peer review process, and include the accepted papers in the ACM Digital Library. The long-term goal is to gather a community of researchers and establish this workshop as a leading forum for research dissemination in the area.
