The proposed system provides a mechanism of detecting the stealing of valuables, and integrates wireless sensor networks with a location service to trace stolen valuables through deployed cameras in an indoor environment. Compared with traditional surveillance systems, it is able to actively notify the security manager that monitored valuables are stole and show the current positions, and real-time images of those stolen valuables when theft cases occur.
