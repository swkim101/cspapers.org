Designing a database application is a complex process that becomes more difficult when the application is being designed for a multilevel secure (MLS) database management system (DBMS). In order to simplify this difficult task, it is necessary to look at the application at an abstract level. By doing so, the database application designer gains a greater understanding of the application and, therefore, lessens the chance of an insecure design or implementation of the application.
