The partitioned computing system, operating several tasks concurrently, is an effective tool for computer-aided design. Such a system offers a high-performance man-machine interface and at the same time operates the low-speed graphic devices (such as plotters) continuously with small drain upon the system. The concept of queueing tasks for devices, instead of queueing users for the system, improves user-access and maintains a reasonably constant load upon the system's hardware. Strong resident support eases programming and extends the computing power by efficiently utilizing the resources of the small computer. The communications connection to a larger computer greatly expands the system's capability.
