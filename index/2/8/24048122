Out work focuses on improving the interaction between people at a distance by providing them with shared electronic props. The Conversation Board is a prototype multi-person drawing tool intended as a medium for the introduction and manipulation of props during conversation. Props such as sketches, digitized photographs, editable text, and sound clips can be placed onto the shared canvas, moved around, modified, and annotated with colored marker tools. We envision it being used in situations such as informal office meetings, distance education and training, and medical consulting.Our design was motivated by conducting an informal study of how people used their office whiteboards for communication. We asked people to explain the contents of their whiteboards and the conversations that led to them. We found that their drawings often represented objects, such as text and block diagrams, which have specific semantic properties that we attempt to support in our electronic tool.The Conversation Board was built in the RENDEZVOUSâ„¢ system, an experimental toolkit designed at Bellcore to support multi-user applications. This poster also briefly describes the capabilities of our toolkit and the applications we've built with it.
