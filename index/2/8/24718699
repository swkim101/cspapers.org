There are many factors that play a part in how a student performs during a course. Some of these factors can be looked at in hindsight to help suggest why a student may or may not have done well in class. This poster assesses the potential of predicting student performance in an introductory computer science class using information about students' preparation, attitudes and study habits. An expert system has been utilized for this purpose. The expert system accepts data related to seven different categories of preparation, belief and attitude and, through the partial activation of multiple rules, predicts an outcome for each student on the post-test (which should correlate with and is used as a surrogate for the student's final course grade). This poster presents our findings and correlation between certain factors relevant to students' success. It shows how these factors can be used to predict a student's grade and discusses the significance of being able to do so. Thus far, the results from the first sample of data appear promising. The work has shown that certain groups of self-assessment questions have clearly out performed other groups in predicting final test grades. The use of expert system techniques to predict student grades can provide an insight on different factors that affect student performance. Knowledge of characteristics that may lead to poor performance allows instructors to potentially identify students who may be at risk of a low grade and need supplemental instruction, tutoring or other support at the outset of the semester.
