This paper models the effects of different contact formations and compliant motion on haptic rendering, taking into account friction and gravity. When a held rigid object interacts with another rigid object (in a task such as assembly), the force and moment felt by the operator at any instant depend not only on the contact region but also on the type of the contact state and the type of motion of the held object prior to reaching the current contact configuration, especially in the presence of friction and gravity. We address the modeling of such haptic effects by extending our study for the case of two interacting convex polyhedral rigid bodies to the more general case of interacting non-convex polyhedral objects involving more complex contact formations and compliant motion.
