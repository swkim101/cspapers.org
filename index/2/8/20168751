The importance of security and privacy in software engineering is now a pressing concern. Over the last decade, many programmers have recognized the importance of including security and privacy requirements at project start. This has led to efforts in secure/security engineering and privacy engineering, which focus on guidelines and best practices that can be used at the design stage to create safer code. Unfortunately, these disciplines are not pervasive and still in their infancy. The goal of this workshop is to make security and privacy first class citizens in programming and programming languages. This forum aims to gather research and industry to further the discussion on how to 1) codify the principles from secure and privacy engineering into programming language constructs and or tools, 2) create programming languages that have security and privacy as foundational tenets, and 3) create/codify constructs or tools that enables secure and privacy-preserving (business) operations.
