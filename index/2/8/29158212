To improve the generalization performance, in this paper, we propose Doubly Regularized Multi-Label learning (DRML) by exploiting feature network and label network regularization simultaneously. In more details, the proposed algorithm first constructs a feature network and a label network with marginalized linear denoising autoencoder in data feature set and label set, respectively, and then learns a robust predictor with the feature network and the label network regularization simultaneously. While DRML is a general method for multi-label learning, in the evaluations we focus on the specific application of multi-label text tagging. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that DRML outstands with a superior performance in comparison with some existing multi-label learning methods.
