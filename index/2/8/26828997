Data impulses, congestion, packet loss, and component failure are likely to undermine the performance of sensor networks, if left unchecked. In the Armstrong Project [4], we are developing a set of transport control algorithms that make sensor networks more resilient to these effects. We demonstrate how a mote sensor network running a number of applications can be made resilient by deploying a set of resilient transport algorithms that include congestion control (CODA [2]), a reliable transport (PSFQ [1]), and virtual sinks [3]. PSFQ (Pump Slowly, Fetch Quickly) is an energyefficient reliable transport protocol that supports reliable multicast between a sink and groups of sensors. CODA (COngestion Detection and Avoidance) comprises a set of congestion avoidance mechanisms that support an energyefficient congestion detection component, and open-loop and closed-loop congestion control mechanisms. The final component of our resilient transport system relies on the availability of dual-radio virtual sinks, which are capable of steering overload or impulse traffic away from congested regions in the sensor field toward one or more physical sinks.
