The next generation of computing will involve vast numbers of devices and humans interacting to achieve organizational, enterprise, and any number of other personal objectives. The explosive growth of the web and the emergence of a new generation of personal gizmos are two extreme examples: the web is a universal publishing platform and the PalmPilotTM is a hand-held database of contact and scheduling information. In the emerging networked world, data will reside not on a few data servers but on millions of servers and devices distributed worldwide in connected and disconnected modes. Conventional database concepts, tools, and techniques apply in the abstract but the networked world will present several discontinuities. Some fundamental database assumptions will no longer apply. What are the data management requirements in the future networked world? What are the current and future requirements and challenges for networked data management? In this industrial session, three industry leaders with major commitments to networked data management will present their views and will respond to questions.
