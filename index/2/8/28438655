Learning interventions based on modules are common in computer science education. Traditional learning modules that present a large amount of content in a linear format can induce cognitive overload in learners. We present theoretical support for increasing the effectiveness of learning modules, describe a system that implements these principles, and discuss the results of a pilot study across two sections of CS0. Using the Security Injections @Towson cybersecurity modules that target key secure coding concepts including integer error, buffer overflow, input validation, for CS0, CS1, and CS2, we enhanced select modules by incorporating the e-learning design principles of segmentation and interactivity. The pilot study compares student engagement and knowledge of software security and secure coding between the current (1.0) modules and the enhanced (2.0) modules. The use of the enhanced 2.0 modules significantly increased both secure coding and software security knowledge. In addition, student engagement increased and feedback from instructors indicates higher student and instructor interest. This project is partially supported by NSF through grant DUE-1241738
