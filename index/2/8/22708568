As teacher professional development efforts continue to scale to meet the growing demand for computer science educators, more individuals with little formal preparation in the discipline are seeking training. For this reason, it is important to understand the kinds of questions that these teachers, along with administrators and IT staff, are asking professional development providers. This research examines questions received by Scalable Game Design (SGD), a project that engages students in computing through game and simulation design activities. SGD has provided training for more than 300 teachers since 2009. We have found several dimensions of interest in the question pool. The major categories of questions received are pedagogical, technical, and procedural, and we present a generalizable taxonomy of question types plus specific examples. In addition, question content and questioner roles fluctuate throughout the professional development and classroom implementation cycle, from initial inquiries to requests regarding next steps. Knowledge of these factors can lead to adjustments in training content to reduce questions later on and potentially increase teacher confidence; moreover, this information can inform planning for support resources, an especially important activity when project growth is forecast. We also discuss how our support structures have changed over the life of the project and compare them to two other curriculum initiatives that rely on unique software environments. Our future work will investigate the characteristics of teachers who are asking particular kinds of questions, including their disciplinary backgrounds, experience in the classroom, familiarity with SGD, and instructional environments.
