From it's beginnings as a framework for building web crawlers for small-scale search engines to being one of the most promising technologies for building datacenter-scale distributed computing and storage platforms, Apache Hadoop has come far in the last seven years. In this talk I will reminisce about the early days of Hadoop, and will give an overview of the current state of the Hadoop ecosystem, and some real-world use cases of this open source platform. I will conclude with some crystal gazing in the future of Hadoop and associated technologies.
