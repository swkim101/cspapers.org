We describe how to transform certain flowchart programs into equivalent explicit primitive recursive programs. The input/output correctness conditions for the transformed programs are more amenable to proof than the verification conditions for the corresponding flowchart programs. In particular, the transformed correctness conditions can often be verified automatically by the theorem prover developed by Boyer and Moore [1].
