This paper describes the enhancement of Pascal to specify synchronization between concurrent processes by Path Expressions. The extended language is being used to gain experience in the design and construction of practical real time systems and operating systems. An encapsulation mechanism is included to synchronize all accesses to encapsulated data. A network message transfer system is presented as an extended example of the use of Path Expressions.
