More than one-half of all students choose to initiate their studies at two-year colleges. These graduates are increasingly the “incoming class” at four-year colleges. Articulation between two-year and four-year degree programs is a very important issue for everyone; students deserve it and faculty need to know more albout it. Recognizing this need, ACM supported the development of computing curriculum guidelines for associate-degree programs.
