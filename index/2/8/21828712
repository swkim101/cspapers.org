In this article an active voltage mode RC filter circuit is presented which uses only one current inversion type negative impedance converter (I-NIC). The number of passive elements used in the circuit is minimum (two capacitors and two resistors). Two floating and two grounded passive components are used in the designed topology. The designed filter circuit is capable of realizing high-pass, band-pass and low-pass responses with the choice of component matching. The realized transfer function is independent of any active parameter and therefore does not exhibit active sensitivity. Highly stable responses are obtained. To confirm the presented theory, the simulation results of PSPICE (Oread 10.0) are included.
