The University of Alabama in Huntsville, College of Engineering, in collaboration with the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Administrative Sciences, has for the last several years offered an annual senior level student design class using the Integrated Product Team approach. This year the participation in the class was expanded to include Engineering students from ESTACA in Paris, France. A small, but highly regarded, high school computer class in Linden, Alabama also participated in portions of the design effort as an experiment. Several new Internet based audiovisual communication tools were used in innovative approaches to successfully complete the class goals. The class has a dedicated Website which contains all pertinent class information, including lectures. This Web site and all of its material was prepared by UAH students as part of the class. Dr. Frederick initiated the IPT class concept earlier at UAH and was the lead instructor for this class. Mr. Middleton coordinated all Website and Internet efforts and Dr. Rose Norman taught the editing class and led the editing team. The information in this paper primarily addresses the Internet Communication Tools used in the class, and information on the educational aspects of the class is being prepared for presentation in a different forum.
