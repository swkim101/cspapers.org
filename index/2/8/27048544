Although some proposals have been developed to alleviate such a fundamental challenge for semi-supervised classification, the efforts on semi-supervised regression (SSR) remain to be limited. In this work we consider the learning of a safe prediction from multiple semi-supervised regressors, which is not worse than a direct supervised learner with only labeled data. We cast it as a geometric projection issue with an efficient algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the proposal is provably safe and has already achieved the maximal performance gain, if the ground-truth label assignment is realized by a convex linear combination of base regressors. This provides insight to help understand safe SSR. Experimental results on a broad range of datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposal.
