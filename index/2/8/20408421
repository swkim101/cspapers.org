In this paper we investigate the application potential of three known algorithms, namely the ESPRIT, SAGE and INLSA, to properly emulate the statistical properties of the mobile fading channel. The performance comparisons of those methods will be carried out with respect to their fitting accuracy to the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the reference model. The methods' accuracy will be assessed in the synthetic reference channel model, which is based on the sum-of-cisoids (SOC) principle. In our reference model, we consider the scenarios with equal gains and Rayleigh distributed gains. The obtained results indicate that in both scenarios the INLSA method is more preferable than the ESPRIT and the SAGE algorithms when emulating the correlation properties of the mobile fading channel. An excellent performance and the simplicity of the INLSA make the method a powerful tool for designing realistic channel simulators.
