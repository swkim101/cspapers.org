In this paper, we propose two multisignature schemes with distinguished signing authorities. The two schemes are based on the discrete logarithm problem and based on the difficulty of finding the kth roots modulo a large prime p. Our schemes provide individual evidence to prevent confusion over authority due to malice and provide generation of the multisignature possessing internal integrity. Moreover, the difference between our schemes and Hwang et al.'s scheme is the method of exchange of data during the multisignature generation process. Comparisons show that the new schemes allow reducing computation and communication costs, so they can be used widely in E-applications.
