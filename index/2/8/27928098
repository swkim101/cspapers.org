We propose repair pipelining , a technique that speeds up the repair performance in general erasure-coded storage. By pipelining the repair of failed data in small-size units across storage nodes, repair pipelining reduces the repair time to approximately the same as the normal read time to the same amount of data in homogeneous environments. We further extend repair pipelining for heterogeneous environments. We implement a repair pipelining prototype called ECPipe and integrate it as a middleware system into two open-source distributed storage systems HDFS and QFS. Experiments on a local testbed and Amazon EC2 show that repair pipelining signiÔ¨Å-cantly improves the performance of both degraded reads and full-node recovery over existing repair techniques.
