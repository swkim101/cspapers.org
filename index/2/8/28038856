We propose a novel omnidirectional stereo camera setup that is formed by two ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV) fisheye cameras. The proposed configuration is formed by two 245-degree FOV fisheye cameras, facing opposite directions, that are rigidly mounted on two sides of a rod. The overlapping view in the two fisheye images forms a ring-shaped spatial stereo setup. Our system provides stereo observations with full 360-degree FOV in horizontal directions and 65-degree FOV in the vertical direction. In addition, the two fisheye cameras altogether also provide full spherical monocular coverage of the surrounding environment. We address challenges in camera modeling, fisheye intrinsic calibration, stereo self-calibration, and depth estimation. We develop a lens-specific fisheye camera calibration method that uses manufacturer data for the optical lens to assist with the intrinsic calibration and develop an online self-calibration approach for estimating stereo extrinsic parameters. The overlapping camera views are rectified into stereo image pairs, from which a spatial stereo matching pipeline is developed for depth estimation in all horizontal directions. We show both qualitative and quantitative analysis to validate our approach.
