In this paper, we introduce a novel multipath mitigation technique for binary offset carrier signals in global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The proposed technique is based on nonlinear operator called Teager - Kaiser Operator, which initially has been used to obtain energy of physical process. Moreover, the proposed multipath mitigation technique tries to reduce or remove the error caused by multipath signals. The technique was implemented in GNSS software receiver and improves the accuracy of code tracking loop in short -delayed multipath.
