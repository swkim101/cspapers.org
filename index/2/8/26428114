men this paper was submitted to SIGCSE in August, the “Case of the Killer Robot” was a 100 page computer ethics scenario. Now, in December, it is nearly 200 pages and at least four more articles are planned. The expanded version has broader coverage of software engineering, ethics, professional issues and societal impact of computers. Consequently, the new version greatly expands the scope and intent of the first. I will describe the 100 page version in some detail and the new materials in lesser detail since the original reviewers of this paper did not know of the new materials.]
