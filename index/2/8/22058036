A dual-band omni-directional antenna for smart mobile phones, ordered by a manufacturer of mobile phones in Vietnam, has been designed and tested. The results from the designed model, which fits the housing required by the manufacturer, have been compared with data from literature. A sample of the designed model has been fabricated and measured. Good agreement of simulated and measured data has been obtained.
