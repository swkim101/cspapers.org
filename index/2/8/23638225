Scheduling is one of the activities which have a great impact on the communication performance of optical burst switching networks. There have been many scheduling algorithms proposed but most of them are online. Recently, several algorithms of group scheduling have been published, but they have the complexity of NP-complete. Moreover, the timeslot of group scheduling is predetermined and fixed without considering the dependence on the rate of arriving data. This article proposes a new algorithm of group scheduling which has the linear complexity and has the timeslot of group scheduling that could be changeable and adapt to the rate of arriving data. The analyses and evaluations of the effectiveness based on the simulation results will confirm the advantages of our algorithm.
