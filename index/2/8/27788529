This paper reports a new technique of control combining the concepts of sliding mode control and the multimodel approach. Baptized Integral Pseudo Sliding Mode Control, this control strategy, reduces the library of models whose number can block the establishment of the multi model control strategy in real time. It also allows, on the one hand, having a robust behavior compared to certain classes of uncertainties, and, on the other hand eliminating completely the chattering phenomenon.
