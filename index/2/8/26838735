Introduction This panel is a forum to discuss some issues relating to using large projects in a course or as part of a curriculum. The issues vary a great deal as to the scope and topic. Some institutions have no large projects as part of their program, whereas others have projects that require teams in most of their courses starting as Sophomores. Should a curriculum specifically include projects? Should projects be part of some or most classes? Are students better served by 1 large project or several smaller projects? These issues and the various ways they can be addressed are useful information for any educator who wants to use projects in a course. The diversity of the panelists will create some interesting discussions. The panelists come from a variety of academic programs, e.g. programs that do not include large projects at all to programs that have a year-long Design Studio. The diversity also includes relatively new educators as well as some who are very experienced. The panelists will present their own views of what they consider the key issues and topics along with their opinions on these. The topics r a n g e from high-level, such as "What is a large project?", to lowlevel issues, such as "Is it necessary to have an outside sponsor who runs he project?" Time will be reserved for audience questions as well as their own insights.
