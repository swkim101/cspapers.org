When teaching computer networking courses, over the years, the author has used Java applets and other software tools for illustrating standards, protocols, and networking concepts. Although these Java applets and software tools do perform what they are designed to do, they have their limitations. For example, the Java applets that the author used can only illustrate a fixed set of scenarios, and software tools such as Wireshark need devices to generate traces, posing a problem when the teaching resource is limited. In recent years, our school has joined the Cisco Networking Academy and taught computer networking courses offered through the Academy. Cisco Networking Academy provides a networking software program, Packet Tracer, which allows the users to setup and configure various networks which involve routers, switches, and end devices using various wired and wireless cables and protocols in local area networks or wide area networks. There are several nice features about the Packet Tracer. For example, an instructor can use the Packet Tracer to illustrate networking concepts. A student can use the Packet Tracer to iron out networking design issues by first implementing the network using Packet Tracer before implementing it in a physical lab. Additionally, students can closely examine the header information in each layer of the protocol stack as a packet steps from layer to layer and node to node. In this lightning talk, the author will share the experience of using Packet Trace in teaching computer networking courses.
