In the hierarchically organized multiprocessor system EGPA, which has the structure of a pyramid, the performance of concurrent programs is studied. These studies are assisted by a hardware monitor (ZÄHLMONITOR III), which measures not only the activity and idle states of CPU and channels, but records the complete history of processes in the CPU and interleaved I/O activities. The applied method is distinguished from usual hardware measurements for two reasons: it puts together the a priori independent event-streams coming from the different processors to a well ordered single event stream and it records not only hardware but also software events. Most useful have been traces of software events, which give the programmer insight into the dynamic cooperation of distributed subtasks of his program. This paper describes the measurement method and its application to the analysis of the behaviour of a highly asynchronous parallel algorithm: the projection of contour lines from a given point of view and the elimination of hidden lines.
