A critical question to be answered to improve robotic rehabilitation is what is the optimal rehabilitation environment for a subject that will facilitate maximum recovery during therapy? Studies suggest that task variability, nature and degree of assistance or error-augmentation and type of feedback play a critical role in motor (re)-learning. In this work, we present a framework for robot-assisted motor (re)-learning that provides subject-specific training by allowing for simultaneous adaptation of task, assistance and feedback based on the performance of the subject on the task. We model a continuous and coordinated multi-joint task using a learning-from-demonstration approach, which allows the task to be modeled in a generative manner such that the challenge-level of the task could be modulated in an online manner. To train the subjects for dexterous manipulation, we present a torque-based task that requires the subject to dynamically regulate their joint torques. Finally, we carry out a pilot study with healthy human subjects using our previously developed hand exoskeleton to test a hypothesis and the results suggest that training under simultaneous adaptation of task, assistance and feedback positively affects motor learning.
