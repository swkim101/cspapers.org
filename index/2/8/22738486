Recently, deep neural networks have been widely applied to recommender systems. A representative work is to utilize deep learning for modeling complex user-item interactions. However, similar to traditional latent factor models by factorizing user-item interactions, they tend to be ineffective to capture localized information. Localized information, such as neighborhood, is important to recommender systems in complementing the user-item interaction data. Based on this consideration, we propose a novel Neighborhood-based Neural Collaborative Filtering model (NNCF). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the neighborhood information is integrated into the neural collaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for the implicit recommendation task.
