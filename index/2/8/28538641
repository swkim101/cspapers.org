Our goal is to complement an entity ranking with human-readable explanations of how those retrieved entities are connected to the information need. Relation extraction technology should aid in finding such support passages, especially in combination with entities and query terms. This work explores how the current state of the art in unsupervised relation extraction (OpenIE) contributes to a solution for the task, assessing potential, limitations, and avenues for further investigation.
