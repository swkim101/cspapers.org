App Lab (https://code.org/applab) is Code.org's rapid-prototyping environment for creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-powered web applications. It was created as part of a rich set of instructional resources designed for teachers of the new AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course. Yet, App Lab far exceeds the needs of CSP, and would be an appropriate learning environment for students in any CS0/CS1 class, even at the university level. App Lab gives novice programmers access to capabilities previously reserved for courses that require sophisticated tech setup and knowledge of both front and backend web development, server-side scripting, databases, etc. Rather than focusing on curriculum, this workshop will focus on how App Lab works as a programming tool in its own right, and how it was designed to aid and motivate student learning. Participants will get hands-on time with some of App Lab's more advanced features guided by a Code.org product manager, while working with the education team to help understand the educational philosophy that went into its development. Participants will come away with exemplars that highlight App Lab's possibilities, practice with some of its richer features, and do a hackathon to create something to share with each other (and the world)! Finally, we will end with a discussion about how best to integrate App Lab into existing courses. App Lab was developed as part of collaboration between Code.org and David Bau (Google), creator of PencilCode.net. A laptop is required for this session. All other materials will be provided.
