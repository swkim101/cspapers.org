Tweets summarization aims to find a group of representative tweets for a specific topic. In recent times, there have been several research efforts toward devising a variety of techniques to summarize tweets in Twitter. However, these techniques are either not personal (i.e., consider only tweets in the timeline of a specific user) or are too expensive to be realized on a mobile device. Given that 80% of active Twitter users access the site on mobile devices, in this demonstration we present a lightweight, personalized, on-demand, topic modeling-based tweets summarization engine called TOTEM, designed for such devices. Specifically, TOTEM summarizes most recent tweets on a user's timeline and enables her to visualize and navigate representative topics and associated tweets in a user-friendly tap-and-swipe manner.
