In this paper our focus is on the performance of two new transport protocols DCCP and SCTP; the emphasis is to determine which protocol can better meet the Quality of Service (QoS) for MPEG4 video over wireless local area network. Based on results obtained in this analysis it is observed that both SCTP and DCCP achieved better throughput than UDP. For video traffic load of 4 Mbps, throughput achieved by both SCTP and DCCP is almost 100% without expressing any packet loss. With the increase of video traffic load of 5 Mbps and beyond DCCP maintains its throughput and it shows minimum packet loss but SCTP losses its performance. Delay behavior of DCCP also indicates that its performance is better than SCTP. According to our experimental results DCCP better satisfies the quality of service than SCTP for transport of multimedia (video) traffic.
