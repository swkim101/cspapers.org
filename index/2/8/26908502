Recent studies (Donoser and Bischof 2013) have experimentally demonstrated that diffusion process on the tensor product graph yields better retrieval performances than that on the original affinity graph. However, the principle behind this kind of diffusion process remains unclear, i.e., what kind of manifold structure is captured and how it is reflected. In this paper, we propose a new variant o diffusion process, which also operates on a tensor product graph. It is defined in three equivalent formulations (regularization framework, iterative framework and limit framework, respectively). Based on our study, three insightful conclusions are drawn which theoretically explain how this kind of diffusion process can better reveal the intrinsic relationship between objects. Besides, extensive experimental results on various retrieval tasks testify the validity of the proposed method.
