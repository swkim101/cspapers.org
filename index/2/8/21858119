We describe a pursuit-evasion scheme involving multiple coordinated vehicle teams in which each vehicle is modeled as a class of hybrid intelligent agents. This is the hybrid intelligent control agent (HICA), a control-oriented enhancement to the intelligent agent paradigm which conceptually wraps an agent around a hybrid control system core. The problem is formulated as two supervisory teams of HICA to synthesize relevant control/coordination logic. Simulations demonstrate the results of such an approach.
