Knowledge is the key factor to economic success. While more and more knowledge is explicitly written down and freely available to anybody, there is still a lot of knowledge and expertise available only implicitly in the form of experts that can be consulted. In practice, however, a common problem is that for a given topic, these experts are unknown. Companies have been trying to solve this problem for years by running in-house expert finder tools, yellow pages systems and several other knowledge management tools. However, especially in smaller companies, the required knowledge often is simply not available in-house due to missing human resources and thus the required experts cannot be found using the mentioned approaches. To widen the search space and thus the number of potential experts that can be found, we developed the Expert Search Engine EXPOSE [1] that supports users in finding experts for arbitrary topics on the web. Our approach utilizes the fact that with the WWW, a huge data resource is available that can be searched for information about people or companies that are likely to have expertise on the topic in question. However, in contrast to enterprise knowledge management systems, a web based expert finder tool cannot rely on information about content structures as typically available in intranet scenarios. Instead, it has to cope with unstructured information resources. The definition of heuristics how to access this unstructured data and extract structured information as well as to decide to what extent a person matches the given search criteria are major issues in this context.
