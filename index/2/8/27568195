This poster will briefly describe the components of the Humanitarian Free/Open Source Software Development (HFOSS) course offered by the Department of Interactive Games and Media at Rochester Institute of Technology in Upstate NY. It will depict this model of an "Open" Course (i.e. Open Courseware, Open Curriculum, Open Classroom, and Open Code) informed both by academic theory, and industry best practice. It will show the results of designers, developers, and project leaders, working in tandem with professors, staffers, and administrators to offer students a chance to apply research, and put theory into practice. It will discuss strategies of engagement, metrics of success and failure, and what resources are available for others to do the same.
