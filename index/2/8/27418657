Case studies provide examples of good style, the use of language constructs, fundamental data structures, algorithms and applications. Moreover, case studies provide an economical way to deal with large programs. Large programs give the student practice in the management of complexity and motivate the use of certain programming practices, such as procedural decomposition, intermodule communication through parameter passing, data abstraction, and selection of data structures tailored to the needs of the problem.
