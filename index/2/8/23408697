We present SoundCraft, a smartwatch prototype embedded with a microphone array, that localizes angularly, in azimuth and elevation, acoustic signatures: non-vocal acoustics that are produced using our hands. Acoustic signatures are common in our daily lives, such as when snapping or rubbing our fingers, tapping on objects or even when using an auxiliary object to generate the sound. We demonstrate that we can capture and leverage the spatial location of such naturally occurring acoustics using our prototype. We describe our algorithm, which we adopt from the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) technique [31], that enables robust localization and classification of the acoustics when the microphones are required to be placed at close proximity. SoundCraft enables a rich set of spatial interaction techniques, including quick access to smartwatch content, rapid command invocation, in-situ sketching, and also multi-user around device interaction. Via a series of user studies, we validate SoundCraft's localization and classification capabilities in non-noisy and noisy environments.
