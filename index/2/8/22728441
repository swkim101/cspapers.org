The pace of technology for use in computing education is staggering. In the last few years, the following technologies have completely transformed our teaching: Piazza, GradeScope, Google Docs, YouTube, Doodle and whenisgood.net, Skype and Google Hangout, and Khan Academy among others. Hardware has also played a part -- we love our Zoom digital voice recorder (for recording CD-quality lecture audio), Blue Yeti USB mic (for audio), and iClickers (for engaging students in class). This panel is an outgrowth of a Technology that Educators of Computing Hail (TECH) Birds of a Feather session that we've held at SIGCSE for seven years, and the panel from SIGCSE 2015 [1] that served as a springboard for a regular column in ACM Inroads [2]. It will provide a chance for seasoned high school and university educators to show you the technologies that have "bubbled to the top" for them, and what key problems they solve. Like concert musicians, they will give live demonstrations and reveal the particular configuration options required to make their technology "sing". We hope this forum will allow the presenters to dive deeply into the common use cases of these technologies, highlight why they are invaluable, share any "gotchas" they've uncovered, and explain how others can adopt them at their institutions. The highlight of the panel is when the audience, inspired by the presentations, is invited to share their favorite "can't live without" technologies as well.
