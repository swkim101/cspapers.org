Compliant mechanisms are particularly well to applications with small range of motions such as in microsystems. This paper focuses on the design of compliant mechanisms based on a compliant beam network for mechanical transmission problems. The aim is to define an set of mechanical structures subject to technological constraints, by integrating fabrication process particularities which here lead to bending efforts and preload. Here a method is described to determine by an optimization process adapted structures to mechanical tasks such as rigidification tasks or motion transmission. Basic examples illustrate this method.
