We have proposed a decentralized control method based on passive velocity field control (PVFC) in previous works (1997, 1998). However, the feedback was localized and the desired velocity field was given by a central controller. The geometry cooperative multiple mobile robot system whose subsystem is under nonholonomic constraints and which conveys a common rigid object in a horizontal plain was proposed. In this paper, we propose a method to generate the desired velocity field for cooperative mobile robots with decentralized PVFC. The proposed control method for cooperative mobile robots is constructed by extending the PVFC and ensures the stability and boundedness using projection algorithm. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is examined by computer simulations for cooperative tasks with two manipulators.
