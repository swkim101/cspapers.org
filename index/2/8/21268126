Detection of normal and anomalous events from sensor signal is a key necessity in today's smart world. Here, we propose a novel mechanism to classify normal and anomalous phenomena by using self-learning of signal, i.e., by discovering its pattern. This is the first step in the long drawn out analysis of signals. We demonstrate a prototype of our proposed method by using a real field quasi-periodic photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal with (or without) motion artifacts, which has an immense impact on cardiac health monitoring, stress, blood pressure, and SPO2 measurement. We have achieved more than 90% accuracy to detect anomalous phenomena in the signal.
