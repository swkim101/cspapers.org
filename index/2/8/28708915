In this demonstration, we present interoperable and personalized search services for the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD). Using standard protocols and software, including those specified by the Open Archives Initiative (OAI), distributed sites can share metadata easily. On top of these harvesting protocols, we implement a union collection of theses managed by the MARIAN digital library system. Our demonstration covers aspects of NDLTD, OAI, and MARIAN.
