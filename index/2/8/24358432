In the past decade many two-year colleges have developed and implemented various curricula in Data Processing and/or Computer Science. These programs grew out of existing vocational needs for computer operators, data prepares, EAM equipment operators and application programmers. Since very few four-year institutions offered a bachelor's program in Computer Science, the two-year schools generally did not develop a sequence of courses geared to the needs of the transfer student. These students were usually advised to concentrate in either mathematics or business administration - a situation which persists in many colleges today.
 This paper will offer a discussion of several factors which have affected the needs of both the terminal and the transfer student of two-year colleges and which consequently warrant a revision of the existing two-year Computer Science curricula. A curriculum and description of revised course content will be suggested as one possible alternative.
