I have spent much of the last fifteen years trying to build bridges between the two solitudes of computing: academic researchers on the one side, and working developers on the other. These efforts have largely failed, but have done so in interesting ways. This talk will explore why the wide gulf between research and practice persists, and outline a new plan for trying to narrow it based on scurvy, smoking, and statistics.
