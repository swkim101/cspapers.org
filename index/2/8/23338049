In line with global trends, historical records are increasingly available in forms that computer can process. These ever expanding records (such as scanned books, large-scale corpora, academic papers, maps, photos, audios, videos)---either digitally born or reconstructed through digitization pipelines---are too big to be read or viewed manually. Historians, like other humanities researchers, have a keen interest in computational approaches to process and study digitized historical information for research, writing, and dissemination of historical knowledge. In Computer Science, experimental tools and methods are challenged to be validated regarding their relevance for real-world questions and applications. The HistoInformatics workshop series is focused on the challenges and opportunities of data-driven humanities and brings together scientists and scholars at the forefront of this emerging field, at the interface between History, Anthropology, Archaeology, Computer Science and associated disciplines as well as the cultural heritage sector. The 4th HistoInformatics Workshop was a half day workshop co-located with the 26th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2017) in Singapore.
