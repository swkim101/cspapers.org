Computing has supplied mathematics with a new vocabulary of algorithms and is holding out the promise that mathematics can be implemented. Algorithms and proofs can now be seen as the same type of object. This new vision of mathematics as a very high level programming language suggests that mathematics may be transformed so that it is more in harmony with the spirit of computing, and has profound implications for the way in which mathematics is taught. Such harmony would be particularly beneficial for students of computing, who often find little of relevance in their mathematics courses.
