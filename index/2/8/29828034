Truth functional connectives which attempt to maintain consistency in the network. The use of context layers in addition to dependencies allows more accurate world-modelling than previous dependency-based modelling schemes. Focus of attention in deductive search and planning is accomplished by the propagation of control information through the network in addition to normal truth values.
