The EvALL online evaluation service aims to provide a unified evaluation framework for Information Access systems that makes results completely comparable and publicly available for the whole research community. For researchers working on a given test collection, the framework allows to: (i) evaluate results in a way compliant with measurement theory and with state-of-the-art evaluation practices in the field; (ii) quantitatively and qualitatively compare their results with the state of the art; (iii) provide their results as reusable data to the scientific community; (iv) automatically generate evaluation figures and (low-level) interpretation of the results, both as a pdf report and as a latex source. For researchers running a challenge (a comparative evaluation campaign on shared data), the framework helps them to manage, store and evaluate submissions, and to preserve ground truth and system output data for future use by the research community.
