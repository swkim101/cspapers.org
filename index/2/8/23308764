Tele-Radiology network is a network for remote radiology diagnosis. If Tele-Radiology can operate on the Internet, it will enhance imaging diagnostic of remote health clinics. Due to very large input data for Tele-Radiology network (CT 64 slice: 1500MB/case, MRI 1.5 Tesla: 600MB/case), it requires a load balancing mechanism to avoid traffic jam on the network. In order to deploy Tele-Radiology through the Internet without interfering Layer 1,2,3 of TCP/IP scheme, it requires a logical topology on the underlying physical TCP/IP. There isn't any research on applying de Bruijn graph as a logical topology for Tele-Radiology network yet. The MHC(d, k) (Logical network based on de Bruijn graph for Tele-Radiology) proposed in this article can be used for load balancing in Tele-Radiology and Tele-Medicine.
