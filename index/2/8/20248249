In robot vision the detection of edges of an image serves to simplify the data, in the early stages, into a form which is more easily processed. But because of noise or due to the inherent weaknesses of the chosen edge detector, gaps or interruptions in the edges may occur. These gaps must be filled or linked to form a more continuous edge. A new method of edge linking is proposed that makes use of a weighting system based on edge segment position, direction, and magnitude in deciding the optimal choice of which edge segments to link. Edge pixels are labeled and formed into edge segments, and the edge segments are then linked based on the decision of the weighting system. As a result of the unique way in which the gaps between edge segments are filled, distortion of the edge image is kept minimal, the proposed edge linker can be combined with different edge detection schemes. Comparisons with a method previously proposed by the authors shows an improvement in the quality of the linked edge map produced as well as a savings in computational time.
