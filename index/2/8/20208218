A research study measuring perceptions of computing held by Hispanic high school students has been conducted using two visual programming interfaces. Undergraduates conducted regular weekend classes using both Alice and App Inventor lessons to provide computing instruction to the students enrolled in an enrichment program. The goal of this research was to identify and measure high school student perceptions of computing after being introduced computing using drag-drop programming interfaces. The results of this work demonstrates how student interest in computing increases once exposed to computing, but the interest increment is not enough for them to major in a computing area, highlighting the importance of ongoing engagement in computing throughout the high school years.
