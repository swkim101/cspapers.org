This paper presents a theory of AFFECT processing in the context of BORIS [Dyer, 1982] [Dyer, 1981a], a computer program designed to read and answer questions about complex narratives. Here, "complex" entails the coordination, application and search of many distinct sources of knowledge during both comprehension and question answering. This paper concentrates only on those structures and processes which interact with affect situations. The affect component in BORIS is not a separate module, but rather a series of structures and processes which arise as various lexical items are encountered during narrative comprehension and question answering [Dyer, 1981b].
