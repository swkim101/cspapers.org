Traditional CF-based methods employ the user-item matrix which encodes the individual preferences of users for items for learning to make recommendation. In real applications, the rating matrix is usually very sparse, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in recommendation performance. In this case, some improved CF methods utilize the increasing amount of side information to address the data sparsity problem as well as the cold start problem. However, the learned latent factors may not be effective due to the sparse nature of the user-item matrix and the side information. To address this problem, we utilize advances of learning effective representations in deep learning, and propose a hybrid model which jointly performs deep users and itemsâ€™ latent factors learning from side information and collaborative filtering from the rating matrix. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our hybrid model outperforms other methods in effectively utilizing side information and achieves performance improvement.
