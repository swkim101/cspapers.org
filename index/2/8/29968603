There has been significant interest recently in ethical issues that arises in the context of doing computer science. The two major problems for the computer science professor who is interested in discussing ethics are how and were to include discussions of these issues. The panelists will focus on: 1) Reasons for including discussions of ethics in the Computer Science Curriculum. 2) Ways to introduce the ethical issues into the curriculum. a. Distribute the discussion across the curriculum. b. Give a single technically sound course. 3) Pedagogical concerns. a. What are the definable skills that we want to teach in a study of computer ethics? b. How can the subject matter be effectively organized? C. What ethical theory is required to teach this material? 4) Reactions from industry about including ethics in the CS curriculum. These subjects are important to discuss because of current efforts by the ACM/IEEE-CS Task Force to include ethics as a REQUIRED element in the computer science curriculum.
