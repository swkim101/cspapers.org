In order to reach optimal drill penetration using a rotary hammer, it is necessary to control the two variables, rotational speed and strike rate, of the rotary hammer in such a way that by applying minimal guidance and recoil power, a maximum drill penetration rate can be achieved in the rock. An optimal drill penetration rate is attained through using a given combination of rotational speed and strike rate. Changes in the drill diameter and/or material hardness lead to a false adjustment of the system which has to be re-optimized by an intelligent re-adjustment of the two servo-controlled drives. To achieve a flexible and automatic adaptation of rotational speed and strike rate of the rotary hammer to different material and tool types, an adaptive multi-sensor drive control based on a self-learning neuro-fuzzy component has been developed by IITB in cooperation with an industrial partner.
