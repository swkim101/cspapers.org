l Types that allow extension are distinct from those that don’t. Types that allow extension are called fagged types, because their instances carry a run-time tag that identities their “creation” type. l Each specific type has an associated class-wide type. Operations on operands of a specific type do no run-time dispatching (i.e. are statically bound). Run-time dispatching only occurs when applying a primitive operation to an instance of a tagged class-wide type. Explicit conversions to specific or class-wide types are used to control when and if “redispatching” occurs when one primitive operation is implemented in terms of another.
