This workshop introduces participants to CORGIS, a technology developed under the auspices of an NSF-funded project at Virginia Tech. The CORGIS Datasets Project comprises a software architecture framework and carefully engineered client libraries through which students can access either large datasets or those generated by real-time web services from domains, including weather reports, stocks, earthquakes, and news updates. The CORGIS technical scaffolding gradually introduces students to some of the most vexing complexities of distributed computing. To support the diverse needs of computing educators when teaching introductory CS classes, each CORGIS dataset is available in Python, Java, and Racket, with compatibility on key platforms. The dataset libraries are available through an online curated gallery, designed to be easily adapted to instructors' specific academic needs, including the ability to rapidly prototype new CORGIS libraries. With CORGIS, computing educators can introduce important big data or real-time distributed computing concepts without overwhelming students with the low-level details that working with such data typically requires. This workshop introduces CORGIS via a hands-on approach, familiarizing participants with the core functionality of our architectural framework and client libraries. We will proceed in three parts: (1) present CORGIS by working through a case study of creating a programming project in a typical CS 2 course; (2) demonstrate how the framework can be used to rapidly prototype a new library of the participants' choice; and (3) critically discuss the technology in small and large groups. This presentation improves on our offering from SIGCSE 2014. Further information is at: http://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis.
