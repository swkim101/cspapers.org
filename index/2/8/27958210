An approach to building an open ended interactive structural design system for use from a remote time-sharing console is presented. The system is modular and hence may be modified by adding or deleting modules or adjusting various modules to reflect building code changes or the availability of new materials.
 The connectivity of the system is determined largely by the designer who provides the interface. As the designer becomes more familiar with a particular aspect of a design he may wish to take short cuts and have the system evaluate how successful he has been. Relative cost analysis of workable designs provides a basis for judging his success and in this sense the system could be used as a design game in design education.
 One of the greatest advantages of this system is the ability to retain current information that in the future may be needed to make modification to a particular design. The logging module may be used to retain a log of the current status of design results that have been retained in active files.
 A simplified example problem is presented to illustrate the use of the system in the design office.
