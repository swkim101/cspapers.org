What constitutes cheating on programming assignments? What methods can be used to detect cheating? What should be done with offenders? How can cheating be eliminated in programming courses? These are all pertinent questions, but they are directed more towards treating symptoms rather than towards correcting some very fundamental problems.
 How can student interest in computer programming be stimulated? What can be done to reduce the frustrations inherent in writing and debugging code? What should be expected (and what should not be expected) of students taking introductory programming courses? How can individual performance and achievement be measured effectively for grading purposes?
 With critical problems of computer fraud and software theft increasing all the time, making Computer Science students aware of the ethics of the computer industry seems not only appropriate but necessary.
