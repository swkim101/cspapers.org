Video games can provide a secure and motivating active learning environment with practical scenarios. This video game project simulates a security competition where the player has to protect the system and keep the services running by reacting to injections that occur at random. The game has several modules (content areas) and levels. Modules have at least two levels. The first level requires installing and configuring hardware/software. For the second level players needs to respond to random events.
 In the Network module, players install and configure network components such as a firewall/router, a WPA2 WIFI, a web filter/proxy, a spam filter and antivirus software. In the Database Module, players install Apache Web Server, the Data Management System (DBMS) and Database Applications. Players need to install the database and the web-server in a port different than their default port, disable default passwords and test for SQL injection before installing the database. In the Encryption Module, players will be given several scenarios and need to choose the best encrypting method perform the actions to ensure that the data is encrypted. The last module integrates content areas from all other modules.
