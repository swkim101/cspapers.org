The last two decades have seen an increasing interest in the task of question answering (QA). Earlier approaches focused on automated retrieval and extraction models. Recent developments have more focus on community driven QA. This work addresses this task through cross-platform question routing. We study question types as well as the answers that can be gathered from different platforms. After developing new evaluation measures, we optimize for various constraints of the user needs. We consider models that work for the general public, before adapting them to some special demographics (Arab journalists).
