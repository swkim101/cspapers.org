Beside the output-input hysteresis, the longitudinally loaded cables of medical robotics such as RAVEN II exhibit asymmetric saturated strain-load hysteresis loops. This study investigates modeling the hysteresis nonlinearities of these cables using a stop-operator based Prandtl-Ishlinskii (SPI) model that is integrated with a memoryless function. The stop-operator based model is employed to account for the hysteresis nonlinearities, while the memoryless function is introduced to characterize saturation and asymmetric effects. A numerical example is presented to compare the properties of the proposed model with the classic SPI model. The response of the suggested model was evaluated on the hysteresis properties of two different cables subjected to triangular harmonic input of 0 to 0.001 with 6.25 × 10−-5 strain/s. The characterization error of the thick cable was found as 1.55 %, while the error was calculated as 1.25 % for the thin cable. The relative significance of the proposed model was further examined by comparing the measured data with the classic SPI model. The results showed that the classic model yields substantial characterization errors when the asymmetry and saturation effects of the strain-load hysteresis loops are ignored.
