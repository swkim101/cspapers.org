Convolutional neural networks showed the ability in stereo matching cost learning. Recent approaches learned parameters from public datasets that have ground truth disparity maps. Due to the difficulty of labeling ground truth depth, usable data for system training is rather limited, making it difficult to apply the system to real applications. In this paper, we present a framework for learning stereo matching costs without human supervision. Our method updates network parameters in an iterative manner. It starts with a randomly initialized network. Left-right check is adopted to guide the training. Suitable matching is then picked and used as training data in following iterations. Our system finally converges to a stable state and performs even comparably with other supervised methods.
