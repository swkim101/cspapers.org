This workshop focuses on the NSF proposal review process. Via close examination of the review process, participants gain an understanding of how to write good reviews and how to improve their own proposal writing. The workshop covers the following topic areas: the proposal review process from submission of a proposal to award or decline; elements of a good review; NSF merit criteria (intellectual merit and broader impacts); elements of a good proposal; and how to volunteer to review proposals. The workshop uses a structured guided-interactive methodology to lead participants through each topic by introducing related issues, engaging participants in group exercises designed to explore and share their understanding of the issues, and then providing some expert opinion on these issues. Good and bad examples and a Top Ten List of Do's and Don't's will be provided. The intended audience is faculty members at two-year and four year colleges and universities who wish to better understand the NSF review process and/or those who are seeking NSF funding in support of undergraduate education. Participants will include people with little or no proposal reviewing experience, novice proposal writers, and those with more experience who seek to improve their proposal writing and/or reviewing skills. Laptop optional.
