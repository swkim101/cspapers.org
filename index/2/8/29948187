We argue that there are at least two significant issues for interaction designers to consider when creating the next generation of human interfaces for civic and urban engagement: (1) The disconnect between citizens participating in either digital or physical realms has resulted in a neglect of the hybrid role that public place and situated technology can play in contributing to civic innovation. (2) Under the veneer of many social media tools, hardly any meaningful strategies or approaches are found that go beyond awareness raising and allow citizens to do more than clicking a "Like" button. We call for an agenda to design the next generation of "digital soapboxes" that contributes towards a new form of polity helping citizens not only to have a voice but also to appropriate their city in order to take action for change.
