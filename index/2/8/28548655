The Need for a Reexamination The book, Computing the Future: A Broader Agenda for Computer Science and Engineering by the National Research Council [HL92]l starts its Excvutivc Summary as follows: . . . both the intellectual focus of academic CS&E [computer science and engineering] and the environment in which the field is embedded arc today in the midst of significant change. . . . Further into the Executive Summary, the committee outlines its recommendations and priorities including: . . . given the pressing economic and social needs of the nation and the changing environment for industry and academia, the commit tee believes that academic CS&E must broaden its self-concept or risk becoming increasingly irrelevant to computing practice. In addition, the Association of Computing Machinery report on ‘The Scope and Directions of Computer Science: Compu tin& Applications, and Computational Science” [A911 advised: A close interaction between computer rcscarchcrs and others is essential so that the questions under investigation remain connected to real concerns. Otherwise computing research can drift into
