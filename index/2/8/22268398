The increasing energy consumption within the industrial sector causes great concerns among numerous countries. Accordingly, an extensive reorientation towards an energy-efficient facility and processes design is essential for innovative production systems. In terms of automated object manipulation, energy efficiency significantly is affected by the physical design as well as by the dynamic characteristics of the manipulator. Since the influence on physical design parameters often is limited, a great impact on energy-efficiency of innovative manufacturing systems may result from an intelligent task management and suitable motion strategies. This contribution identifies energy-efficiency potentials for industrial manipulators in terms of motion design and redundant actuator configurations. In this context, an efficient trajectory planning algorithm is proposed, estimating the energy demand of object manipulation tasks in consideration of dynamic motion parameters as well as redundant actuator configurations. For this purpose, the geometric path as well as the motion law of given trajectories are optimized by a spatial displacement of predefined nodes and by an adjustment of corresponding time intervals. In order to verify its generality, the presented method is applied to the spatial n-PRPaR manipulator exhibiting actuation redundancy. According results show a significant energy reduction, establishing high potentials for an increased efficiency of industrial robots.
