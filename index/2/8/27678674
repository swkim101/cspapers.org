A motion/force/impedance controller of a robot arm is designed for the task of pushing a plate along a wall without any rotation. The control scheme has been proposed and applied to a robot task. This paper concerns how a robot arm can exert a given force on a moving object. It is shown by simulations that the designed controller works well for this task and is robust to significant uncertainties in the environment.
