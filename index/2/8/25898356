Computer-based systems that help two or more people work together are called groupware. While many programs are useful to people as they go about work on a common task, most systems specifically designed as groupware are not widely used, This panel will examine the limited impact of groupware and try to discribe how these systems can be made more practical. Panelists will identify the characteristic properties of widely used aids for cooperative work. We will also describe what properties work environments must possess to encourage effective use of computer-based tools in group activities. Finally, the panelâ€™s discussion should yield some constructive methods for building and effectively usingnew groupware.
