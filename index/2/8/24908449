With hundreds of thousands of users, RapidMiner is the most frequently used visual workflow platform for machine learning. It covers the full spectrum of analytics from data preparation to machine learning and model validation. In this presentation, I will take you on a tour of machine learning which spans the last 15 years of research and industry applications and share key insights with you about how data scientists perform their daily analysis tasks. These patterns are extracted from mining millions of analytical workflows that have been created with RapidMiner over the past years. This talk will address important questions around the data mining process such as: What are the most frequently used solutions for typical data quality problems? How often are analysts using decision trees or neural networks? And does this behavior change over time or depend on the users experience level?
