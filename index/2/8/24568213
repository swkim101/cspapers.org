A great deal of interest has developed in structured programming [Dahl, Dijkstra, and Hoare, 1972] during the past few years. This paper is concerned with some experiences obtained in the use of a structured programming language in the computer science curriculum at the University of Maryland. The language used was SIMPL-X [Basili, 1973], a language designed and implemented at the University of Maryland.
 SIMPL-X was designed to be a transportable, extendable, compiler-writing language that was to be the base language for a family of programming languages. It is, in fact, being used for that purpose as the SIMPL-X compiler [Basili and Turner, 1973] is written in SIMPL-X, and a compiler for the graph algorithmic language GRAAL [Rheinboldt, Basili, and Mesztenyi, 1972] is presently being designed as an extension of the SIMPL-X compiler.
