Human decision makers in many domains can make use of predictions made by machine learning models in their decision making process, but the usability of these predictions is limited if the human is unable to justify his or her trust in the prediction. We propose a novel approach to producing justifications that is geared towards users without machine learning expertise, focusing on domain knowledge and on human reasoning, and utilizing natural language generation. Through a task-based experiment, we show that our approach significantly helps humans to correctly decide whether or not predictions are accurate, and significantly increases their satisfaction with the justification.
