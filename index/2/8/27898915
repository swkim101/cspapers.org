In this hands-on special session, attendees will learn about and use a Game of Life cellular automata framework (Java) to assist with outreach activities. Using the framework, students with no prior programming experience can create interesting behaviors within thirty minutes. The special session leaders have successfully used this approach for thirteen years in a one-week summer workshop for disabled high school students. The SIGCSE special session will include an introduction to the framework and keys to its success as an outreach activity, followed by participants solving, programming, and proposing specific problems. Attendees will be equipped to guide Game of Life outreach activities at their own outreach events.
