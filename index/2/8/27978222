KGs maintain both numerical and non-numerical facts, with the support of an underlying schema. These facts are usually accompanied by a confidence score that witnesses how likely is for them to hold. Despite their popularity, most of existing KGs focus on static data thus impeding the availabilityof timewise knowledge. What is missing is a comprehensive solution for the management of uncertain and temporal data in KGs . The goal of this paper is to fill this gap. We rely on two main ingredients. The first is a numerical extension of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) that provide the necessary underpinning to formalize the syntax and semantics of uncertain temporal KGs . The second is a set of Datalog constraints with inequalities that extend the underlying schema of the KGs and help to detect inconsistencies. From a theoretical point of view, we discuss the complexity of two important classes of queries for uncertain temporal KGs: maximuma-posteriori and conditional probability inference. Due to the hardness of these problems and the fact that MLN solvers do not scale well, we also explore the usage of Probabilistic Soft Logics (PSL) as a practical tool to support our reasoning tasks. We report on an experimental evaluation comparing the MLN and PSL approaches.
