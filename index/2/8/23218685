One of the most important developments in the 70's has been the introduction of microcomputers. The impact of these systems presents a major challenge for computer educators today and in the foreseeable future.
 Though educators have tried to adapt to this rapid change in technology, only recently have articles appeared describing experiences in integrating micro-systems in Computer Science curricula (5,6). Though each paper covers different topics in varying degrees of depth, almost all the authors agree that having a micro-lab facility provides students with exposure to concepts and problems such as:
 - actual hardware
 - computer operation
 - operating systems
 - backup procedures
 - time dependent coding
 - program size problems
 - inter-computer communications
 - scheduling
 - maintenance
 - computer management.
 These are the types of problems students will encounter after graduation and this laboratory provides them with actual experience that previously was not available.
