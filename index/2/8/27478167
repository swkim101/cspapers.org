Automatic trajectory generation for spray painting is highly desirable for today's automotive manufacturing. Generating a trajectory for a surface with only one patch is widely studied to satisfy the paint thickness constraints. However, a complex surface has to be divided into several patches to satisfy the paint thickness and paint gun orientation constraints. Trajectory generation for a surface with multiple patches has not been addressed yet. In this paper, optimization processes are developed to optimize the paint thickness on a surface which consists of several patches. Optimization results are presented. Simulations are performed to verify the optimized parameters. Verification results is consistent with the optimization results.
