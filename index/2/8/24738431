Models are an important tool in conquering the increasing complexity of modern software systems. Key industries are strategically directing their development environments towards more extensive use of modeling techniques. This workshop sought to understand, through critical analysis, the current and future uses of models in the engineering of software-intensive systems. The MISE-workshop series has proven to be an effective forum for discussing modeling techniques from the MDD and the software engineering perspectives. An important goal of this workshop was to foster exchange between these two communities. The 2013 Modeling in Software Engineering (MiSE) workshop was held at ICSE 2013 in San Francisco, California, during May 18â€“19, 2013. The focus this year was analysis of successful applications of modeling techniques in specific application domains to determine how experiences can be carried over to other domains.
