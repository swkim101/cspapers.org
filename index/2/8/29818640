Clashroom is a web-based fantasy game that was created to enhance the motivation and learning of a traditional classroom. It was created to address several drawbacks of other educational games by being broadly applicable to any course, requiring no class time, and allowing for optional rather than mandatory game play. Each player in the game is a dragon trainer, hoping to train a champion pet dragon. To gain skills and magical items for the dragon to use, players complete educational quests set up by the teacher. Players compete in weekly tournaments, where the quest rewards are vital to success. Because the gameplay and the learning material are decoupled, the game can be used for any subject at any level. After initial testing, students report that the game is fun and that the intrinsic rewards of a fun game are motivation enough for extra learning.
