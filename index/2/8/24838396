We delineate a fine-grained approach to the development of embedded computing systems, including such which exhibit real-time properties - that is: reactive systems. The "approach" is a postulate - it has not yet been widely tested. And the "dogmas" of the paper are rather idealistic - but indicative of current, we believe, leading research directions that is already being transferred into industry. The essence of the approach is twofold: (i) An increased emphasis on requirements development, a phase prior to software development, but not just the development of software requirements, as so restricted in [28], but requirements to and assumptions about the computing systems environment; and (ii) that both requirements and software development be so organised as to allow calculation of system properties. The approach arose out of the ESPRIT Basic Research Action project: ProCoS - and we also review the larger facets of this project. The paper provides an overview sketch: technical & scientific evidence is given in the referenced literature. The paper also outlines an initial research emphasis of the UNIIIST: The United Nations University's International Institute for Software Technology, a research and post- graduate training center for the developing world, which commenced operation in Macau 1. April, 1992.
