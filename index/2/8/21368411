The establishment of accreditation and certification standards for secondary computer science teachers has been taking place over the past 5 years. The ACM has taken the lead in developing certification standards for adoption by states and the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has taken the lead in developing national accreditation standards for teacher preparation programs through affiliation with NCATE, the accrediting body for professional education units in the USA. The impact of institutionalizing these new standards is discussed, and the role that university computer science departments should now take in the teacher preparation process is described.
