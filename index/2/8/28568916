Cache poisoning is a serious threat to today's DNS, and Kaminsky cache poisoning is proposed as the most effective. We develop a maximum-efficiency attack model of Kaminsky cache poisoning, which is built on persistent poisoning attempts optimized for more than one windows of opportunity. Using the model, we illustrate the effects of Kaminsky cache poisoning and the optimal number of outstanding queries in terms of probability of compromise.
