Most of the users in developing countries use 2G (GPRS/ EDGE) connection which has very limited bandwidth and can not be used for large content transfers. As a result, content exchange happens through local communication technologies i.e. Bluetooth or manually swapping flash cards. Users typically search content by asking their friends and fix a meeting place to exchange that content. This model of content sharing is not scalable when number of users or shared items increase. Current research literature in mobile phone based delay tolerant networks (DTNs) are restricted to designing routing protocols or designing distributed content search and sharing evaluated using simulations. DTNs employs multi-hop routing which is not feasible in real-world due to resource constrained mobile devices, trust issues, and interfaces such as Bluetooth requiring human intervention for device pairing. Due to above described limitations, there is lack of a real system that can enhance pair-wise content sharing using local interfaces such as Bluetooth. Here, we propose a mobile-cloud based system i.e MobiShare which uses a hybrid architecture to facilitate pairwise content transfers. It uses two different communication channels, control channel facilitates content search and sharing with the help of Cloud whereas actual content transfer happens through local interfaces such as Bluetooth. The information routed through control channel is small in size compared to data channel and hence, can use a low bandwidth communication such as 2G. Notification mechanism of MobiShare allows mobile application to automatically switch ON the interface (Bluetooth or WiFi) whenever a content exchange opportunity arises to save energy. 2.
