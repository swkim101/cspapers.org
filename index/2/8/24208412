The field which studies human-machine interaction is usually called human factors or human engineering. The DARCOM Directorate of Management Information (DMIS) requested the US Army Human Engineering Laboratory (HEL) to investigate human factors aspects of current MIS systems and provide guidelines for use by system designers.
 The study involved the use of semi-structured interviews and observations at seven DARCOM installations covering a wide variety of MIS applications to obtain a composite picture of DARCOM MIS users, positive human engineering aspects of current systems, and problems in human-computer interaction. MIS users, for this study, were defined broadly as those who design and program systems, those who are involved in the preparation or input of data into a computer, those who receive or obtain information from a computer system, and those who manage computer systems.
