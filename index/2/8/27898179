Common strategies to liberate an organization's information assets for situational awareness frequently rely on infrastructure components such as data integration, enterprise search, federation, data warehousing, and so on. And while these traditional platforms enable analysts to get better and faster answers to their queries, the next big advance will change this paradigm. Users cannot be expected to formulate and ask every smart question every day. And to escape this impractical and un-scalable model, the new paradigm will involve technologies where "the data finds the data" and "relevance finds the user." Perpetual Analytics describes a class of application whereby enterprise context is assembled, in real-time, on data streams as fast as operational systems record observations. Context construction is a "data finds the data" activity which enables events of interest to be streamed to subscribers. In this talk, I will talk at some depth about the dynamics of such systems including scalability and sustainability.
