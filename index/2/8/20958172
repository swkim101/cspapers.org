The AP CS Principles (APCSP) course begins as an AP course in 2016, fully realized after eight years with several presentations as part of SIGCSE conferences[1-3]. APCSP was designed to broaden participation in computer science in high school and beyond, and to be accessible to teachers who might be new to computer science, in some cases with limited previous experience in teaching courses in the area. The APCSP project has been grounded in an inclusive, community-driven approach to building a new course that is nearly unprecedented. Initially funded by the College Board and NSF, as this community of educators nears the official launch of APCSP the project has become more of a public/private partnership, garnering significant interest in building programs with NSF, non-profit, and industry support.
