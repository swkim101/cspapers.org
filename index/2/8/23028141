The network reduction systen of RAPT, an offline object level language for programming robot assembly tasks is described in this paper. The task description is converted into a relational network with the positions of bodies as nodes, and relationships between positions as links. Rewrite rules based on the intersection and conposition of relations are used to simplify the network.
