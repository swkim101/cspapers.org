There are several challenges in down-sizing robots for transportation deployment, diversification of locomotion capabilities tuned for various terrains, and rapid and on-demand manufacturing. In this paper we propose an origami-inspired method of addressing these key issues by designing and manufacturing a foldable, deployable, and self-righting version of the origami robot Tribot. Our latest Tribot prototype can jump as high as 215 mm, five times its height, and roll consecutively on any of its edges with an average step size of 55 mm. The 4 g robot self-deploys nine times of its size when released. A compliant roll cage ensures that the robot self-rights onto two legs after jumping or being deployed and also protects the robot from impacts. A description of our prototype and its design, locomotion modes, and fabrication is followed by demonstrations of its key features.
