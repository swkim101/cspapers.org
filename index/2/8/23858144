Function and capabil i ty is increasing by leaps and bounds but at times this increase in function seems to be done for sake of marketing only. For example; Applicon released IMAGE which is an RSXIIM based system that allows for simultaneous 2-D and 3-D operations. My site was one of the original BETA test sites for this system, and provided Applicon with documented problems and enhancement suggestions, as did the other sites. Response to this was negligible and the package was released on the date planned even though BETA test had uncovered weakness in the system. My site s t i l l has not instal led the IMAGE product in a production environment due to the fact that the supposed increase in function is not worth the risk of running the system.
