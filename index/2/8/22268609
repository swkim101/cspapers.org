Software engineering literature lists many benefits of requirements traceability (RT) and strongly suggests that it should be practiced for software projects. However, available literature concentrates on the development of complex and large systems that have thousands of requirements. Companies that develop small software systems, with only approximately a hundred requirements, have limited budgets and they face the challenge to define what traceability information to document and how. Goals of this paper are to find problems of RT faced in small projects and to offer guidelines for documenting traceability information for such projects.
