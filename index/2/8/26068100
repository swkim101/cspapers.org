In this paper a new on-demand routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks is presented based on link/route stability estimation. AODV decreases maintenance overhead in ad hoc networks, but some path breaks can significantly cause overhead. Reverse AODV (RAODV) routing algorithm is one of the AODV versions which reduces overhead of routing. Here, we applied link/route stability in RAODV for decrease overhead of discovery and maintenance of routing, a new protocol then was created. Our protocol also increased the packet delivery ratio in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET's). When an active route fails, the source node with the awareness of stabilities of routes, can select the best route in set of available routes. We proposed a stability estimation method and applied that in an optimized version of ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing algorithm by doing some modification at RAODV algorithm. In our algorithm namely Modified Reverse Ad Hoc On-demand Vector (MRAODV), the route request packet didn't change and it is like as AODV, but rout reply packet must be changed for route stability estimation purpose. Computer simulation using ns-2 simulator was performed to compare with other methods and effectiveness of the proposed method was quantitatively validated.
