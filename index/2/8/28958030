New algorithms for the decomposition and the composition of a relational data base are proposed in this paper. Given a data base specified by a set of attributes and a set of functional dependencies, the decomposition algorithm removes redundancy and abnormalities to generate a nondecomposable schema and a D-tree. After the data base is constructed following this schema, the D-tree is used by the composition algorithm to construct the simplest relational expression that specifies a desired subrelation over an arbitrary set of attributes given as a query by a user.
