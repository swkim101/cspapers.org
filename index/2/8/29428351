A historical cycle has been observed where the use of graphical tools becomes critical to software development but these tools eventually fall from use as the underlying cause of complexity is removed through a new programming paradigm. This workshop attempts to take a unified view of UML-related ideas which span from high level software design (UML and MDD) to technical details of implementing reusable associations. It also identifies gaps in the existing programming languages addressed by UML class diagrams. The discussion is not language specific and applies to both C++ and Java.
