R a i n b o w S y s t e m . We have developed an XML repository management system, called Rainbow, designed to exploit relational database technology to manage XML da ta based on a flexible mapping strategy [2].As shown in Figure 1, the Rainbow system is composed of three sub-systems, e.g., a loading manager, a mapping manager, and an XML query engine build on top of a relational database. Rainbow first loads an XML Schema into the relational database via the loading query provided by the loading manager. Loading queries are expressed in XQuery. Then the mapping manager provides an extraction view query genera ted from the loading query. The XML query engine accepts an XML query or an XML update request from the user in an extended XQuery syntax. I t then combines the user's request with the extraction view, pushes down as much computat ion as possible to the underlying relational database, and returns the XML results back to the user or executes the update request.
