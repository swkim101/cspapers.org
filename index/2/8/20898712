The Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS) concept entails capabilities where application simulations can dynamically accept and respond to field-data and measurements, and/or can control such measurements. This synergistic and symbiotic feedback control-loop between simulations and measurements goes beyond the traditional control systems approaches, and advances applications and measurement approaches, beneficially impacting science and engineering fields, as well as manufacturing, commerce, transportation, hazard prediction/management, medicine, etc. DDDAS environments extend the current computational grids. The multi-agency DDDAS Program Solicitation (www.cise.nsf.gov/dddas) fosters systematically the relevant research areas. NSF, NOAA and NIH, the NSF/OISE and SBIR Offices, and the EU-IST and e-Sciences Programs are cooperating sponsors. This session will consist of a panel of experts, including awardees of DDDAS projects and representatives from funding agencies, and will provide a forum to engage the broader community in open discussion for expanding the opportunities and impact of DDDAS.
