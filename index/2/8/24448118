This communication presents an analysis of the design and fabrication of power-efficient, low cost VCSEL-based optical transceiver proposed for emerging fiber data distributed interface (FDDI) and fiber channel local-area network (FCLANpsilas). This transceiver has been designed to meet the increasing amount of information transmitted through communication networks. The proposed optical transceiver consists of Tx that contains VCSEL driver and power control units and Rx that contains trans-impedance amplifier, limiting amplifier as well as automatic gain control. The most important reason to lower the power consumption of optical transceivers is to alleviate the increasing heat dissipation associated with denser opto-electronic (OE) devices. VCSEL devices operating at low temperature display decrease jitter, increase output power and enhance lifetime. Also, temperature gradient on large opto-electronic (OE) device arrays generates performance non-uniformities and lowers the bit-error-rate (BER) of the optical links. In addition, lowering the power consumption of optical transceivers contribute to the overall reduction of the system power budget.
