Computer systems offering windowing environments have been readily embraced by the computer user community. These capabilities have become so popular in recent years, that even the more traditional command-line systems such as IBM PCs are offering windowing environments. The question arises as to whether or not a windowing environment is appropriate for any and all user environments. This question has particular importance for computer systems that control complex processes and hazardous environments, such as Nuclear Power Plants or Space Station Freedom. Both of these examples represent multitasking environments where there is a large cognitive load on the user. It has been argued that the task of window management poses additional processing loads on the user. In fact, during the early definition of the Space Station Freedom human-computer interface, NASA's astronaut office strongly opposed a windowing environment, partially for "safety" reasons. It was felt that the windowing capabilities were dangerous in an environment where critical information could be accidently hidden, "lost", etc. It was also felt that managing the display of information was an unnecessary additional task.
