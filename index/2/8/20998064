Good methodology and good statistics are clearly important. Nevertheless, we have conducted numerous empirical studies in the laboratory and in the field and weâ€™ve never done a perfect study! In every case some factor such as cost considerations, development schedules, or subject availability forced us to deviate from the ideal design. Still we claim that our studies are credible. That is their results have validity, are repeatable, and strive to show causality.
