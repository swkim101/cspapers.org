This paper deals with the sequential inverse kinematics for the high speed tracking of flexible robots. As a continuation of the implicit expansion method in, the explicit version of the sequential inverse kinematics is presented which is easier to be understood conceptually. The accuracy and stability of the two algorithms are compared and proved. Numerical study verifies the validity of the theoretical results.
