This work presents a rapidly deployable system for automated precision weeding with minimal human labeling time. This overcomes a limiting factor in robotic precision weeding related to the use of vision-based classification systems trained for species that may not be relevant to specific farms. We present a novel approach to overcome this problem by employing unsupervised weed scouting, weed-group labeling, and finally, weed classification that is trained on the labeled scouting data. This work demonstrates a novel labeling approach designed to maximize labeling accuracy whilst needing to label as few images as possible. The labeling approach is able to provide the best classification results of any of the examined exemplar-based labeling approaches whilst needing to label over seven times fewer images than full data labeling.
