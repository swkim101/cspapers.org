In this paper, we propose to improve time management in the enterprise by providing users interactive visualizations of how they are spending their time. Through an interview study (n=21) in a multi-national corporation, we were able to determine the data available for visualizations and the value of a number of general visualizations of employees' calendar data. We develop implications for design in improving personal time management.
