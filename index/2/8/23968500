Cloud computing has today become a widespread practice for the provisioning of IT services. Cloud infrastructures provide the means to lease computational resources on demand, typically on a pay per use or subscription model and without the need for significant capital investment into hardware. With enterprises seeking to migrate their services to the cloud to save on deployment costs, cater for rapid growth or generally relieve themselves from the responsibility of maintaining their own computing infrastructures, a diverse range of services is required to help fulfil business processes. In this talk, we discuss some of the challenges involved in deploying and managing an ecosystem of loosely coupled cloud services that may be accessed through and integrate with a wide range of devices and third party applications. In particular, we focus on how projects such as OpenStack are accelerating the evolution towards a federated cloud service ecosystem. We also examine how the portfolio of existing and emerging standards such as OAuth and the Simple Cloud Identity Management framework can be exploited to seamlessly incorporate cloud services into business processes and solve the problem of identity and access management when dealing with applications exploiting services across organisational boundaries.
