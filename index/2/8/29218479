The next generation of IT professionals will be drawn from the upcoming generations of IT students. The future of this field, including its potential to transform society, will be shaped by these students. Thus, it is critical to attract and promote students who will be future leaders and visionaries and bring diverse perspectives to the table. The theme of our proposed session is: increasing the pool of women students in graduate CS/IT programs and positioning them to become future university CS/IT faculty and leaders in the field.
