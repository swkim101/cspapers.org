We describe an application of an indirect boundary element method in the large scale simulation of suspensions in distributed environment with Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM). The method involves re-casting the governing (Stokes or Navier) equations in an integral form which is suitable for iterative solution. Parallelization is achieved by domain decomposition, in which the calculations on a group of particles are farmed out to a workstation in a distributed system. The actual throughput of the distributed farm, consisting of 28 DEC AlphaStations 500/266, based on a wall clock measurement and an actual floating point operation count for the serial version of the program, is 4.69 Gflops/s. This results in a price performance of 65 USD per Mflops/s.
