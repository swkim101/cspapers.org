HEMI is an experimental instrumentation system being developed for use with the CYBER 70 and 170 Series computers in order to ascertain the extent to which an integrated approach to instrumentation is economically and technologically viable for performance measurement and evaluation purposes.
 HEMI takes advantage of the distributed CYBER computer architecture. This consists of a pool of Peripheral Processors (PPs) - (mainly dedicated to I/O and system tasks) while the CPU capabilities are reserved mostly for computation; Central Memory constitutes the communications link.
 HEMI uses one of the PPs as its major processor. A hardware data acquisition front end is interfaced to one of the I/O channels and driven by the PP. Hardware probes sample events at suitable testpoints, while the PP has software access to Central Memory (Operating System tables and parameters), Status Registers, I/O Channel Flags, etc.
 A data reduction package is used to produce a variety of reports from the data collected. A limited on-line data reduction and display capability is also provided.
 This paper will describe the current status of the project as well as anticipated applications of HEMI.
