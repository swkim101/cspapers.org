While a number of Internet applications determine the optimal service tailored for a client based on its identifier, the client's identifier, if explicitly leaked to the Internet applications, raises critical privacy concerns. To address the privacy problem for those sender-sensitive systems, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving service of pseudonymizing Internet client. Replacing real identifier with pseudonymizing identifier in talking to Internet applications preserves the client's privacy. Delegating sender-sensitive optimization tasks to a trustworthy third party ensures the performance of Internet applications. The usage of pseudonymizing-client service in CDN is presented to improve CDN performance as well as privacy on client's IP address.
