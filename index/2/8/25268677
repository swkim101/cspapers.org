Continuing education is a major concern for most professional societies. This is especially true for ones like ACM, whose members are working at the leading edge of technology - both in research and within numerous application areas. ACM, through its Education Board, sponsors several different activities to assist members in their quest to keep abreast of the latest technical developments. This panel has several purposes. On the one hand it will serve as a means for disseminating more widely information on our current projects. In addition it will allow us to receive feedback from the membership with respect to how they perceive theses activities, what changes they might like to see, and what new projects we should be considering. Among the topics that will be discussed are Self Assessment Procedures, Professional Development Seminars, Tutorial Weeks, and accreditation efforts, and Institute for Certification of Computer Professionals (ICCP) activities. After these activities are briefly described, the remainder of the session will be devoted to answering questions and soliciting ideas from the audience.
