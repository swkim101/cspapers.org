The performance of a Monte Carlo program used for the computation of thermodynamic properties from sophisticated intermolecular potential functions is tested on a CYBER 205 vectorcomputer and a T800 transputer network. Carefully vectorization and optimization of the scalar code gives a mean speed-up factor of 20 on the CYBER 205. For parallel execution the time-consuming parts of the program were equally distributed among all processors of the network. The mean efficiency of this parallelization on a system with 16 processors is about 80 per cent with a mean speed ratio of 7 between the maximum performance of the CYBER 205 and the transputer network.
