Current user-interaction with optical gesture tracking technologies suffer from occlusions, limiting the functionality to direct line-of-sight. We introduce RFlow, a compact, medium-range interface based on Radio Frequency (RF) that enables camera-free tracking of the position of a moving hand through drywall and other occluders. Our system uses Time of Flight (TOF) RF sensors and speed-based segmentation to localize the hand of a single user with 5cm accuracy (as measured to the closest ground-truth point), enabling an interface which is not restricted to a training set.
