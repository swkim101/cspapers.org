Solving the nuclear many-body problem engenders significant theoretical and computational challenges. I will briefly discuss the science that goes into and comes out of the nuclear problem, and then turn to the numerical implementations of coupled-cluster theory for the problem. Specific to the nuclear problem is the presence of real three-body forces which are computationally represented by six-dimensional tensors. Both memory and communications become issues as one begins to scale up the underlying coupled-cluster algorithms to thousands of processors. Another interesting feature of the nuclear problem is weak binding that occurs in very unstable nuclei. When the single-particle continuum is present, the nuclear Hamiltonian becomes complex. I also will describe our attempts to solve the complex coupled-cluster problem in the presence of complex interactions. Efficient parallelism requires spreading the interaction matrices globally and the coupled-cluster amplitudes in a more local fashion.
