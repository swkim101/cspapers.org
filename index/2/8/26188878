In this paper, we focus on the features of a lexicon for Japanese syntactic analysis in Japanese-to-English translation. Japanese word order is almost unrestricted and Kakuio-shi (postpositional case particle) is an important device which acts as the case label (case marker) in Japanese sentences. Therefore case grammar is the most effective grammar for Japanese syntactic analysis.The case frame governed by Yougen and having surface case (Kakuio-shi) , deep case (case label) and semantic markers for nouns is analyzed here to illustrate how we apply case grammar to Japanese syntactic analysis in our system.The parts of speech are classified into 56 sub-categories.We analyze semantic features for nouns and pronouns classified into sub-categories and we present a system for semantic markers. Lexicon formats for syntactic and semantic features are composed of different features classified by part of speech.As this system uses LISP as the programming language, the lexicons are written as S-expression in LISP, punched onto tapes, and stored as files in the computer.
