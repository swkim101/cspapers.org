This paper presents a localization algorithm to reduce the fluctuation of mobile node which using wireless sensor networks based on chirp spread spectrum (CSS). This localization algorithm shows faster and more precise location information for tracking of mobile node than existing method. We propose the method for the attenuation of fluctuation for mobile node based on CSS which can provide high accurate ranging functionality to a sensor node with a distance based on time-of-flight (TOF) of RF signal. By using the proposed method, this paper shows improved chirp spread spectrum (CSS) based indoor localization and tracking system for multi-cell environment which runs on IEEE 802.15.4a wireless sensor network technology. To improve the calculated position in real implementations, this paper shows equations of Kalman filter algorithm to minimize the dynamic fluctuation of radio signal and our ranging protocol, location calculation server.
