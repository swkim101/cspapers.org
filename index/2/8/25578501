Outlook. We present multiple XQuery optimization based on materialized XML view technology in the Rainbow system. In this demo we in particular show: (1) Rainbowâ€™s support for defining and incrementally maintaining materialized XQuery views, (2) XQuery optimization by query rewriting to use materialized views, (3) Performing multiple query optimization by merging multiple XML queries (XATs) into one global access plan to decide upon materialization of intermediate results as views, and (4) Query processing of updates issued on XML views that wrap relational data by decomposing the updates into SQL update statements and consistency checks on the relational base data. The Rainbow System. We have extended Rainbow [1], our existing XML data management system, as shown in Figure 1. Rainbow accepts an XQuery query or an update request in an extended XQuery syntax from the user. The XQuery is parsed into an algebraic representation, called XML Algebra Tree (XAT) [3]. The XAT is then optimized by the global query optimizer using algebraic rewrite rules [2]. We have introduced a separate phase of XAT cleanup [2] which includes the XAT table schema cleanup and cutting of unnecessary XML operators. This optimization often significantly improves the query performance. The optimized XAT is then executed by the query manager.
