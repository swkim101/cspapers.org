This paper surveys the growing field of program visualization or visual programming, the ability to visualize the execution of a computer program or the effects of a computer program on its data structures on a display device. Additionally, a library of dynamic Pascal examples, APEX1, designed for use in a second Pascal (data structures) course is introduced. Finally, the characteristics that an optimal program visualization system should possess are discussed.
