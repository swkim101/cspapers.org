K-means algorithm has been widely used in machine learning and data mining due to its simplicity and good performance. However, the standard k-means algorithm would be quite slow for clustering millions of data into thousands of or even tens of thousands of clusters. In this paper, we propose a fast k-means algorithm named multi-stage k-means (MKM) which uses a multi-stage filtering approach. The multi-stage filtering approach greatly accelerates the k-means algorithm via a coarse-to-fine search strategy. To further speed up the algorithm, hashing is introduced to accelerate the assignment step which is the most time-consuming part in k-means. Extensive experiments on several massive datasets show that the proposed algorithm can obtain up to 600X speed-up over the k-means algorithm with comparable accuracy.
