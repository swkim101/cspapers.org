Beginning in 1989 an ad-hoc collection of senior DBMS researchers has gathered periodically to perform a " group grope " ; i.e. an assessment of the state of the art in DBMS research as well as a prediction concerning what problems and problem areas deserve additional focus. The fifth ad-hoc meeting was held May 4-6, 2003 in Lowell, Ma. A report on the meeting is in preparation, and this panel discussion will summarize the upcoming document and discuss its conclusions.
