During recent years, a variety of new database applications has been developed which substantially differ from conventional database applications. For example, new database applications such as data warehousing produce very large relations which require a multidimensional view on the data, and in areas such as multimedia and CAD a content-based search is essential which is often implemented using some kind of feature vectors. All the new applications have in common that the underlying database system has to support the processing of queries on large amounts of high-dimensional data. Now, we may ask what the difference is between processing lowand high-dimensional data. A result of recent research activities is that basically none of the querying and indexing techniques which provide good results on low-dimensional data also performs sufficiently well on higher-dimensional data. The problem of dealing with high-dimensional spaces has therefore been addressed in a variety of recent database research projects. The goal of the tutorial is to spread the knowledge about high-dimensional spaces and the proposed techniques to a large community of both, researchers and practitioners researchers who are interested in querying and indexing techniques for high-dimensional data, and practitioners who are interested in the state-of-the-art of database support for their applications.
