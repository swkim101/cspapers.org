We present new data structures for quasistrict higher categories, in which associativity and unit laws hold strictly. Our approach has low axiomatic complexity compared to traditional algebraic approaches, and gives a practical method for performing calculations in quasistrict 4-categories. It is amenable to computer implementation, and we exploit this to give a machine-verified algebraic proof that every adjunction of 1-cells in a quasistrict 4-category can be promoted to a coherent adjunction satisfying the butterfly equations.
