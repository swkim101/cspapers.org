In 1992, the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) adopted guidelines for computer science education teacher preparation programs. The endorsement signaled the emergence of computer science education as a distinct discipline and computer science as a formal secondary subject area. The guidelines were developed through an intense program of research and review by the International Society for Technology and Education (ISTE). Since the passage of the standards, numerous computer science and education professionals have been involved in the process of preparing program folios for review and developing the actual review process. This real experience with the standards helped to identify issues and problems that are common to most programs and that need examination in the current five year review. In this paper, an overview of the guidelines is presented, the review process is described, issues and problems are discussed, and future initiatives are identified.
