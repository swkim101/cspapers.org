Packet Switched Networks are well accepted and provide cost-effective data communications for a wide range of applications. This paper will examine the growth of packet switching by profiling Telecom Canada's Packet Switched Network, Datapac. It will focus on the following:the emergence of applications by new users of data communications,
development of new applications by existing users,
migration to packet switching networks from dedicated leased line networks,
the development and introduction of new service features to continue the phenomenal growth rates achieved in earlier years.
