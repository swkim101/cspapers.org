Efficient homomorphic encryption enables the construction of an encrypted computer system. Previous work has shown how this can be achieved using only arithmetic representations of simple demultiplexer circuits. This poster extends the results by introducing a caching mechanism for oblivious memory access, by far the most time-consuming building block of a recently proposed sample machine architecture. The construction allows to significantly accelerate homomorphically encrypted machine operation while still preserving obliviousness of memory access, control unit operation and functional components.
