Gamut is a new tool for building interactive, graphical software like games, simulations, and educational software. A developer can build entire applications in Gamutâ€™s domain using only programming-by-demonstration (PBD) and never has to look at or modify code to build any behavior. To accomplish this, we have developed a simple, streamlined interaction for demonstrating so that developers can create new examples quickly and can specify negative examples without confusion. Also, Gamut allows the developer to give hints to point out objects in a relationship that would be too time consuming to find by searching. Gamut automatically revises generated code using an efficient algorithm that recursively scans for the differences between a new example and the previous behavior. To correct the discovered differences, Gamut couples heuristic search with a decision tree leamittg algorithm allowing it to build more complicated behaviors than it could using heuristic search alone.
