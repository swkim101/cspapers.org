An important area of computer-assisted instruction is the development of intelligent instructional systems. These systems can be distinguished from more conventional approaches by the automation of instructional interaction and choice of strategy. They promise both to reduce the costs of instructional materials preparation and to increase the adaptability and individualization of the instruction delivered. An appropriately intelligent instructional system should create a reactive environment in which a student can test his own hypotheses concerning the subject matter, probe for information at different levels of difficulty and abstraction, acquire wide experience in minimum time, obtain instructional material generated for his unique abilities and needs, receive instructional aids for partially completed solutions, and receive critiques for completed problem solutions.
 The panel is composed of investigators who are actively engaged in the design, development, and evaluation of intelligent instructional systems. Each member of the panel will briefly outline an aspect of his current work that illustrates a problem or issue appropriate for general discussion. An attempt will be made to assess the state-of-the-art of intelligent instructional systems and to indicate reasonable next steps for their development. Attendees are encouraged to arrive bearing questions, comments, and information.
