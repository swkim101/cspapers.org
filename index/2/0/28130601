Nanotechnology is an exciting field with many potential applications. Its impact is already being felt in materials, engineering, electronics, medicine, and other disciplines. Current research in nanotechnology requires multi-disciplinary knowledge, not only in sciences and engineering but also in high performance computing (HPC) technology. Many nano-science explorations rely on mature, efficient HPC and computational algorithms, practical and reliable numerical methods, and large-scale computing systems. This workshop offers academic researchers, developers, and practitioners an opportunity to discuss various aspects of HPC-related computational methods and problem solving techniques for nano-science and technology research.
