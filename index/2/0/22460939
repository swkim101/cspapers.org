Teaching the evolving subject of software engineering has only recently been explored in the literature within the last five years. In a university-level, evening school environment, problems in the area of software engineering education arise due to 1) the quantity and approach of introducing software engineering concepts and 2) the background and motivation of the students. Working adults can be introduced to the components of the software life-cycle by a careful selection of reading assignments, lectures, discussion, and a team programming project. This paper addresses the problems associated with software engineering in adult education and presents a working solution.
