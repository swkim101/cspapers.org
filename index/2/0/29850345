What is the best way for novice users to interact with computers? Three alternatives that are generally offered are: menu selection, query languages, and natural language. In menu selection, the user chooses from a set of preprogrammed options by entering an associated key. This technique has the advantage of placing a minimal parsing burden on the computer. However, for certain applications, such as conversational interaction, menu systems are inadequate because they severely limit the strategies available to the user.
 Query languages are special sets of designed specifically for interaction with the computer. They place a greater parsing burden on the computer, and are somewhat less limiting to the user. However, they suffer from human factors problems in that they are often very difficult for the user to learn (Reisner, 1981).
