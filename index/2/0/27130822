ORGANIZATION The Institute for Perception Research, in Dutch abbreviated to IPO, is the result of a unique partnership between industry and government, Philips Research Laboratories Eindhoven and Eindhoven University of Technology have collaborated closely, on a 50/50 basis, in this joint venture since IPO’S foundation in 1957, 35 years ago. The University provides accommodation at its premises, and Philips provides all the necessary equipment and computers for doing research. This has created an excellent technological research environment. IPO is structured in a matrix organization, consisting of three basic research groups or disciplines Hearing& Speech; Vision; Cognition and Communication, and two applied research or project groups: Information Ergonomics and Communication Resources for handicapped users. IPO recently founded a graduate school, ‘Perception and Technology’. It is located in the Institute and conducts a Ph.D. program in English to facilitate international participation, both by students and teachers, who maybe visiting research fellows. Collaboration is actively sought for interdisciplinary research in areas outside IPO’S basic strengths, thus widening scope and impact beyond the core areasof IPO research.European research projects in which IPO is involved include the ESPRIT project Polyglot, which is concerned with speech recognition and synthesis, the TIDE project ‘Visa’, which deals with universal accessto WIMP software for partially sighted and blind users, and the EUREKA project on high-definition television.
