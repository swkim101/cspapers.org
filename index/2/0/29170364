In this paper we propose a new, non-uniform, way of analyzing the data-complexity of OMQ answering with datatypes. Instead of restricting the ontology language we aim at a classification of the patterns of datatype atoms in OMQs into those that can occur in non-tractable OMQs and those that only occur in tractable OMQs. To this end we establish a close link between OMQ answering with datatypes and constraint satisfaction problems over the datatypes. In a case study we apply this link to prove a P/coNP-dichotomy for OMQs over DL-Lite extended with the datatype (Q,<=). The proof employs a recent dichotomy result by Bodirsky and KÃ¡ra for temporal constraint satisfaction problems.
