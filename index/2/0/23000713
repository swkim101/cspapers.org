The ability to solve probability word problems such as those found in introductory discrete mathematics textbooks, is an important cognitive and intellectual skill. In this paper, we develop a two-step endto-end fully automated approach for solving such questions that is able to automatically provide answers to exercises about probability formulated in natural language. In the first step, a question formulated in natural language is analysed and transformed into a highlevel model specified in a declarative language. In the second step, a solution to the high-level model is computed using a probabilistic programming system. On a dataset of 2160 probability problems, our solver is able to correctly answer 97.5% of the questions given a correct model. On the end-toend evaluation, we are able to answer 12.5% of the questions (or 31.1% if we exclude examples not supported by design).
