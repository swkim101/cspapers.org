This paper discusses the problem of assigning manufacturing tolerances in the development of a tolerance chart. A quantitative model is constructed so as to consider both the tolerance capability of the various processes used in the manufacture of a part, as well as the most effective way to combine tolerances in order to establish an overall tolerance. The variations of this model are discussed along with the manual trial and error method. It appears that significant reductions in manufacturing costs can be achieved by applying the automation methods presented in this paper.
