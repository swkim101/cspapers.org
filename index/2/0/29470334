Presents a new approach to communication in an autonomous distributed system, focusing on the cellular robotic system (CEBOT). The CEBOT is a self-organizing robotic system composed of a large number of robotic units (cells) with a simple function. In order for cellular robots to implement a task efficiently, cooperation and coordination among cells are of great importance and require efficient communication. Since communication takes place in the process of task execution, it is likely to be intensive and biased by the small number of cells related to the task. This could decrease communication efficiency. To deal with these problems of robot communication, the authors propose demand-based intensive communication (DBIC), and show its effectiveness with simulation and experimental results for the prototype CEBOT Mark IV.
