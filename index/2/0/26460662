We present faster FPTAS’s for generalized versions of the maximum flow, multicommodity flow, minimum cost flow, and miniium cost multicommodity flow problems in lossy networks. We dominate the previous best known complexity bounds for all of these problems, some by as much as a factor of n2. Our generalized multicommodity FPTAS’s are now as fast as the best non-generalized _ones. We give a 0(m2) time FPTAS for the generalized maximum flow problem. This is faster than the previous best strongly-polynomial bound by a factor of n. We are also able to reduce the dependency on the error parameter from cm2 to log(l/r) in this case.
