This paper describes a second database course whose emphasis is on the design and implementation of a computer system using relational database methods with Ingres. This particular course was unique in several ways. Although the team concept was utilized each member of a team was assigned a specific part of the overall project to complete. Furthermore, each team member’s part was integrated with other parts of the project so that it was necessary for the members of a team to coordinate their efforts in order to produce a workable system. No two teams did exactly the same project. A student’s grade was determined, in part, by the level of sophistication of the work produced by the student and, in part, by the success of the entire team project. COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAMS AT IPFW Baccalaureate Degree programs in the Computer Science Department at Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne follow two tracks: The Computer Science Option and the Information Systems Option. Students electing the Information Systems Option are required to take two junior-senior level courses in database. Students electing the Computer Science Option may take these courses as electives. DATABASE COURSES IN THE IPFW CURRtCULA The first database course (CS364) covers database architecture, hierarchic systems, network systems, inverted list systems, relational systems, relational algebra, relational calculus, normalization, survey of several relational DBMS’s and assorted additional database topics.
