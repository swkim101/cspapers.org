Detailed description Non-volatile Memory Based on Magnetic Tunnel Junction is presented. A dynamic Verilog-A behavioral model and a Spice macro-model of a single memory cell was developed. The advantages of the proposed models demonstrated on a next generation revolutionary Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) which we offer to implement on an integrated circuit (IC) based on CMOS technology. The MRAM cell is inherently radiation resistant, however, to implement a complete radhard memory device, we propose to implement a radiation hardened architecture of the MRAM module and peripheral circuits: write drivers, high-sensitivity switched-current read sense amplifier, bit line multiplexer, address decoder and a memory timing controller.
