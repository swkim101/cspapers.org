Traditional programming language namespaces evolved from filesystem structures. We describe different scenarios where this rigid code organization becomes a limiting factor. After that, we propose a more flexible code organization using tags. We then illustrate it on Python, including how we can convert existing code structures to the new tag-based one. Finally, we discuss our plans how to extend this work to statically typed languages in the future.
