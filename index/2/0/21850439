A general software package was built to access individual data records stored on an IBM-1360 photo-digital mass storage device with a current on-line capacity of 50 billion characters (bytes) and an infinitely extensible off-line capacity. An existing data base management system was used to maintain the pointers to the data on the mass storage device and to store the controls for the data driven interactive code. Existing data dictionaries used for sequentially processing the data bases mere stored in the DBMS and used to display individual data items within the retrieved records.
 Data retrieved from the mass storage device is displayed interactively or sent for further processing to various report generation and statistics packages. The system provides dial-up terminal retrieval capability for exceedingly large socio-economic and demographic data bases used by national and regional planning agencies of the federal government. It was developed with three man-months of effort.
