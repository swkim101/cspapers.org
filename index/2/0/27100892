The paper starts with a theoretical consideration of the requirements for a computerised information retrieval system to aid open learning within an educational establishment. The requirements for such a system include consideration of the need to fulfill information retrieval objectives and also educational objectives. These requirements are then considered in the context of the theoretical information retrieval work which has been carried out by Belkin and others and takes into account the representation of the user's anomalous state of knowledge. The paper then considers the practical problems of trying to implement such a system. Attention is focussed on the use of current and developing information technology to fulfill both information retrieval and educational objectives. It is shown that current systems as exemplified by PRESTEL, DIALOG, BROWSE and STAF individually will not fulfill the requirements of this system. However, in combination these types of systems should be quite suitable. Another solution is the use of an expert system. The paper also considers the use of an expert system to "replace" the traditional teacher.
