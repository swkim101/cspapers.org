Psychiatry is an area of medicine that strongly bases its diagnoses on the psychiatrists subjective appreciation. The task of diagnosis loosely resembles the common pipelines used in supervised learning schema. Therefore, we propose to augment the psychiatrists diagnosis toolbox with an artiﬁcial intelligence system based on natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. This approach has been validated in many works in which the performance of the diagnosis has been increased with the use of automatic classi-ﬁcation.
