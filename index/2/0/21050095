At a local level, networks mediate the interactions between pairs of individuals; and when these pairwise interactions are linked together across multiple steps in the network, larger patterns of cascading behavior can develop. Depending on the context, such cascades can represent desirable outcomes for the system -- such as the spread of a product or social movement that is promoted by word-of-mouth effects -- or they can represent destructive outcomes -- such as the outbreak of a disease or a financial crisis. Here we consider a range of models for cascading behavior, focusing in particular on these phenomena in social and information networks. Our discussion will draw on several themes in the study of cascading behavior, including the following issues.
