With the rapid development of advanced data acquisition techniques such as high-throughput biological experiments and wireless sensor networks, large amount of graph-structured data, graph data for short, have been collected in a wide range of applications. Discovering knowledge from graph data has witnessed a number of applications and received a lot of research attentions. Recently, it is observed that uncertainties are inherent in the structures of some graph data. For example, protein-protein interaction (PPI) data can be represented as a graph, where vertices represent proteins, and edges represent PPI's. Due to the limits of PPI detection methods, it is uncertain that a detected PPI exist in practice. Other examples of uncertain graph data include topologies of wireless sensor networks, social networks and so on. Managing and mining such large-scale uncertain graph data is of both theoretical and practical significance. Many solid works have been conducted on uncertain graph mining from the aspects of models, semantics, methodology and algorithms in last few years. A number of research papers on managing and mining uncertain graph data have been published in the database and data mining conferences such as VLDB, ICDE, KDD, CIKM and EDBT. This talk focuses on the data model, semantics, computational complexity and algorithms of uncertain graph mining. In the talk, some typical research work in the field of uncertain graph mining will also be introduced, including frequent subgraph pattern mining, dense subgraph detection, reliable subgraph discovery, and clustering on uncertain graph data.
