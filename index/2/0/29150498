Thanks to this powerful parameter tuning technique, the proximal gradient step can be performed with a much larger stepsize in the algorithm implementation compared with the prior PA-APG method, which is the core to enable significant improvements in practical performance. Moreover, by choosing the approximation parameter adaptively, the proposed method is shown to enjoy the O(1/k) iteration complexity theoretically without needing any extra computational cost, while the PA-APG method incurs much more iterations for convergence. The preliminary experimental results on overlapping group Lasso and graph-guided fused Lasso problems confirm our theoretic claim well, and indicate that the proposed method is almost five times faster than the state-of-the-art PA-APG method and therefore suitable for higher-precision required optimization.
