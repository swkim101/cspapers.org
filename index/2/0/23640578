Recently, a number of continuous sensing applications have been actively proposed in research communities and commercially released in the market. However, due to their unique power characteristics, user behavior-dependent battery drain, they bring new challenges for users' power management on these applications. In this demonstration, we present a comprehensive approach to support users' power management for continuous sensing applications. First, at pre-installation time, we provide an instant, personalized power estimation of a continuous sensing application. Without exhaustive trial and error, users can decide judiciously to install a certain application or not. Second, at runtime, we provide mobility-aware battery information. With this information, users can better estimate the phone's remaining battery life based on their imminent mobility conditions and take necessary actions in advance such as carrying an additional battery or minimizing the use of applications.
