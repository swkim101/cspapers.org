Because people's knowledge is often partial and/or faulty, it is inevitable that misconceptions will be revealed in the course of a conversation. If recognized, the other person may say something to correct the misconception, and the conversation continues. Just as this is the case when people interact with each other, so must it be when users interact with a computer system. For example, in interacting with an expert system, a user may reveal misconceptions about objects modelled by the system. By failing to correct such misconceptions, the system may not only confirm the original misconception, but may cause the user to develop further misconceptions. It must therefore be up to the system to recognize and respond to misconceptions in an effective way. In this paper the space of possible object misconceptions is characterized according to the kind of incorrect information involved. It has been found that this characterization is often useful in determining how the user arrived at the misconception, and therefore the kind of information to include in the response. Using such a characterization, a system will be able to effectively correct object misconceptions in a domain independent way. Factors which affect the amount of information included in a correction (such as discourse and situational context) are also examined.
