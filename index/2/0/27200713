For sub-100nm processes, predictions are putting initial process yields in the single digits. At the same time, at 130nm, we saw that two chips designed with the same methodology and same design rules could deliver completely different manufacturing yields.This panel will discuss the reasons for these phenomena and talk about future trends in DFM that will need to be addressed for success below 100nm.
