SDR-4X is the latest prototype model, which remains a small humanoid type robot and is expanding its capabilities for the adaptability in home environment. Some of the new key technologies have been developed for SDR-4X. The first is newly developed small robot actuators named ISA-4, the second is real-time integrated adaptive motion control. The third is a motion creating software system, which allows us to create SDR's attractive motion performances. The fourth technology is real-time real-world space perception, and the fifth is multi-modal human robot interaction. These five technologies enable to realize a capable robot that can be adopted with human in home environment. In addition, we have explored and developed entertainment applications using these technologies. A cappella chorus performance and a high-tempo dance performance are introduced as the attractive applications.
