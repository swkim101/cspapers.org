The goal of the ACE project is to demystify and make explicit the art of knowledge engineering. It is an attempt to formulate the knowledge that knowledge engineers use in constructing knowledge-based programs and put it at the disposal of others in the form of a software laboratory. To achieve this goal, the task for ACE is divided into two main sub-tasks: (1) isolating techniques used in knowledge-based systems and programming those that are general and useful (2) building an intelligent agent to guide in the use of these techniques. Currently AGE has a facility to build programs using the Blackboard Model [8,13]
