Transmission of compressed image data over Gaussian wireless channel using OFDM scheme is addressed. A wavelet thresholding technique based on automatic image quality assessment of image, which was proved to be highly conformed with the human visual evaluation, is utilized to obtain an optimum trade-off between the compression ratio and image quality.
