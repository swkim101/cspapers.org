Robotic camera systems have recently drawn attention in minimally invasive surgeries(MIS). Control and manipulation of these systems during traversing abdominal cavity is associated with camera-tissue interaction. This paper demonstrates a theoretical and experimental analysis of a wireless laparoscopic camera's interaction with abdominal wall during MIS. A mechanical model is developed to represent the behavior of abdominal wall bulk tissue by considering skin, fat, muscle and connective tissues layers which predicts behavior of the tissue during interaction with laparoscopic camera. The model was implemented in ABAQUS to analyze the camera-tissue interaction and find interaction forces generated during contact and motion with different linear and rotational speeds. Simulations were validated by experiments on porcine tissue which can be used for proper control of insertable camera. A noninvasive method is proposed to measure the mechanical properties of each patient's abdominal wall tissue at start of MIS in order to tune the control system to optimize the interaction depth and opposite forces. This method features preventing overload damage and camera fall during MIS.
