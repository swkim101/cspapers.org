We describe the variety of materials made available by IBM, as well as the nature of the competition and the datasets that are at the heart of it. We detail how, where and in what form we integrated the materials into our course. We describe assignments that are based on the materials from the competition as well as additional materials we incorporated into our course. We finish by evaluating our experience in teaching with the materials as well as summarize relevant student feedback. We make recommendations for those who wish to adopt the materials.
