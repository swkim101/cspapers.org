During the past four years, the CHASE has made expanding use of its centralized CHASE Message Switch (CMX)located at the Operations Center in New York.
 The CMX, positioned as the center of a worldwide “star” network was first put into production in October of 1976 to automate the collection of funds transfer and administrative messages from CHASE's overseas branches in the Far East, Mid-East, Europe, South America, and the Caribbean. Interfaces to the Cable & Wireless Switches in Hong Kong and Brussels were used to establish efficient communications links where feasible. Dedicated point-to-point and multi-point low speed leased lines were used elsewhere.
 The CMX was, within the constraints of its functions as a message switch, uniquely suited to supporting the staged development and implementation of CHASE's worldwide communications network. Its use as part of the large centralized telegraphic utility, has enabled CHASE to provide stable and efficient funds transfer services to its various customer bases. Several important factors, however, make it reasonable to examine the desirability of designing and implementing a new message switching facility for the CHASE.
