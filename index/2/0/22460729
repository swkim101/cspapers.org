The problem of having to maintain and update many drawings of the same type, as well as having to reproduce them quickly without having to completely redraw them manually is a concern throughout the industry. The solution presented here is that of establishing a standardized symbology to describe the simularities between the drawings, and using these symbols and a digital computer to generate and/or maintain these drawings. The drawings are converted into digitized symbol sets organized into files, and these files are then processed into the appropriate commands to drive a mechanical plotter to recreate the required drawings in every drafting detail, including Leroy lettering. These drawings are then maintained on an exception basis by using the updating capabilities of the system.
 No matter what type of drawing is to be processed, it can be thought of as a particular arrangement of some predetermined building block symbols. In using MADS, the designer need only create a library tape of these symbols, and then use it to generate any drawing needed.
