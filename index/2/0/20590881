Modern digital hearing aids require and offer a great level of personalization. Today, 
this personalization is not performed based directly on what the user actually 
perceives, but on a hearing-care professionalâ€™s interpretation of what the user explains 
about what is perceived. In this paper, an interactive personalization system 
based on Gaussian process regression and active learning is proposed, which personalize 
the hearing aids based directly on what the user perceives. Preliminary 
results demonstrate a significant difference between a truly personalized setting 
obtained with the proposed system and a setting obtained by the current practice.
