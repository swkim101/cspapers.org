This presentation describes the Design Automation System (DAS-2) used in designing FACOM 230-series computers (such as FACOM 230-60, one of Japan's largest computers).
 Greatly assisting designers, DAS-2 lightens their workload in logic design, packaging design, and wiring design. It also provides manufacturing data required for automatic production and inspection.
 This Design Automation System consists primarily of FACOM 230-50 programs, and contains some FACOM 230-60 and 270-20 programs.
 This presentation deals chiefly with automatic logic diagram printing, automatic packaging design, wiring design, logic card function tests.
