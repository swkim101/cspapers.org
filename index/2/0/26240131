This paper presents a mechatronics setup based on a reaction wheel inverted pendulum (RWIP). The novelty of this setup is the use of visual feedback (VF) to control a RWIP while the use of a low-cost camera to achieve control was the main motivating factor. The physical parameters that affect the bandwidth were identified from a mathematical model. In turn, relationships between the system bandwidth and the frames per second (FPS), image resolution, static and dynamic position accuracy and velocity estimation accuracy were then developed. These relationships were tested on the physical setup after a thorough parameter estimation exercise and the FPS and resolution that matched best the mechanical bandwidth were selected. Control parameters were optimized on the simulation model and transferred to the real physical system. A good level of control was achieved both during swing-up and stabilization at the inverted position. The development of the relationship between the limitations of the VF sensor and the mechanical parameters which influence the bandwidth is the main contribution of this paper. The total cost of the hardware was kept low by using off-the-shelf parts.
