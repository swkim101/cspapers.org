The Ant World system facilitates collaborative information retrieval on the Internet, i.e. to make it easier to find useful information on the Internet. It asks usersâ€™ opinion on whether the documents they view are useful for their goals, and uses this feedback to guide other users in their searches. Our approach [Z] is conceptually motivated by two important concepts from the domain of biology: neuronal networks and communication via pheromones. At the global level we enable the network to update its search information dynamically like a vast neuronal network, while at the local level the acquisition and deposition of link information is akin to pheromonic marking of sites and trails by insects. With this analogy in mind we will refer to the information about the value of links as Digital Information Pheromones (DIP). The resulting network is continuously adaptive.
