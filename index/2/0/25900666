This paper describes a control method for a stable biped walking on uneven terrain. The walking control consists of a position control and a compliance control. In order to realize dynamic walking on a human living environment, a biped locomotor is controlled by the position control based on a compensatory motion. Also, in this research, to reduce the magnitude of impact forces and to guarantee a stable landing on the ground, the position-based virtual compliance control is introduced. Several walking experiments on uneven terrain are conducted using WL-15 (Waseda Leg-15) and the effectiveness of the control method is confirmed.
