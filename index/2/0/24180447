In the early 70's, the number of computers installed in Brazil was growing at a rate of 30% per year, which was higher than in European countries, the U. S. and Japan, placing Brazil among the eight top world users of computers.1 By that time, only few Brazilian Universities were offering courses in data processing. The lack of a formal education structure resulted in data processing positions being mainly filled with people trained by manufacturers.
 The high demand for data processing professionals, mainly in the top levels of the career, became one of the Brazilian government's concerns.
 Since Brazil is a developing nation, resources had to be efficiently used and foreign reserves could not be spent on equipments which were not used to their full potential. Therefore, highly qualified professional were needed.
 In view of these facts, the Federal Government decided to support and encourage the creation of professional data processing programs, mainly at the Universities. The role of the University in education is extremely important, since it makes possible to improve the qualification of the labor power and also to improve the education professionals themselves.
 In 1973 and 1974, with the support of the Federal Government, about 15 programs for graduation of technicians in systems programming, analysis and design have been created. Those programs, with the duration of two years, were intended to be a short term solution, providing a highly qualified labor force.
 Besides the programs created directly by the Government, several courses have been implemented at Universities that assumed the task of preparing qualified data processing man power, accomplishing their social role. With this purpose, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, in 1974, implemented an undergraduate' program in Information Systems Analysis. The pioneering aspect rises from the area involved, that of Information Systems.
