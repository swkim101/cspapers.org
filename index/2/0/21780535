In the design of a controller for mobile robot, there are only few results on the problem of integrating the nonholonomic kinematic controller and the dynamic controller for mobile robots. Also there are only few literatures on the robustness of the controller in the presence of uncertainties or external disturbances in the dynamical model of mobile robot. In this paper, a robust adaptive controller which can achieve velocity tracking while considering not only kinematic model but also dynamic model of mobile robot is proposed. The proposed controller can overcome model uncertainty or external disturbances by the robust adaptive technique. The stability of the dynamic system is shown through the Lyapunov method.
