Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are self- organizing multi-hop wireless networks where all nodes play an important role in packet forwarding. High mobility of nodes is a complex phenomenon that frequently changes network topology as active routes fail and re-route discoveries are performed. The purpose of this paper is to improve performance of AODV by introducing direction awareness into nodes. It is based on weighted measurement of direction and distance for a best node. In this mechanism routes are sustained for a longer period of time, resulting in high throughput and less delays.
