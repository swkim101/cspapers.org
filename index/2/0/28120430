This paper presents a new approach for error robust assembly sequence planning which uses haptic rendering models (HRMs) for the representation of assemblies. Our assembly planning system uses HRMs for collision test along mating vectors, which are generated by stereographic projection. The planner stores the vectors in 2 1/2D distance maps providing fast and efficient access for the later evaluation while AND/OR-graphs contain possible sequences. Haptic rendering models facilitate the processing compared to faulty triangle meshes providing fast and geometry independent collision tests as colliding parts can easily be identified and handled accordingly. In addition, part and material related properties can be annotated. We present a fast and simple approach handling approximation inconsistencies, which occur due to discretization errors, based only on the properties of the haptic rendering models. The paper concludes with feasible results for various assemblies and detailed calculation times underlining the effectiveness of our approach.
