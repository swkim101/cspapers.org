In future performance improvement of the basic building block of supercomputers has to come through increased integration enabled by 3D (vertical) and 2.5D (horizontal) die-stacking. But to take advantage of this integration we need an interconnection network between the memory and compute die that not only can provide an order of magnitude higher bandwidth but also consume an order of magnitude less power than today's state of the art electronic interconnects. Weshow how Arrayed Waveguide Grating Router-based photonic interconnects implemented on the silicon interposer can be used to realize a 16 Ã— 16 photonic Network-on-Chip (NoC) with a bisection bandwidth of 16 Tb/s. We propose a baseline network, which consumes 2.57 pJ/bit assuming 100% utilization. We show that the power is dominated by the electro-optical interface of the transmitter, which can be reduced by a more aggressive design that improves the energy per bit to 0.454 pJ/bit at 100% utilization. Compared to recently proposed interposer-based electrical NoC's we show an average performance improvement of 25% on the PARSEC benchmark suite on a 64-core system using the Gem5 simulation framework.
