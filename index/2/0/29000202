A family of resource-bounded paraconsistent inference relations is introduced. These relations are based on S -- 3 entailment, an inference relation logically weaker than classical entailment and parametrized by a set S of variables. Their properties are investigated, especially from the computational complexity point of view. Among the strong features of our framework is the fact that tractability is ensured each time |S| is bounded and that binary connectives behave in a classical manner. Moreover, our family is large enough to include both S -- 3 inference, the standard inference relations based on the selection of consistent subbases and some additional forms of paraconsistent reasoning as specific cases.
