We propose a decentralized control algorithm of multiple mobile robots transporting a single object in coordination. In this algorithm, each robot is controlled as if it has a caster-like mechanism and transportation of a single object by multiple mobile robots is realized without using the geometric relations among robots. The proposed control algorithm is experimentally applied to two mobile robots. Experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed control algorithm.
