A variety of end-user devices involving keypoint-based mapping systems are about to hit the market e.g. as part of smartphones, cars, robotic platforms, or virtual and augmented reality applications. Thus, the generated map data requires automated evaluation procedures that do not require experienced personnel or ground truth knowledge of the underlying environment. A particularly important question enabling commercial applications is whether a given map is of sufficient quality for localization. This paper proposes a framework for predicting localization performance in the context of visual landmark-based mapping. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for predicting performance of vision-based localization systems from different poses within the map. To achieve this, a metric is defined that assigns a score to a given query pose based on the underlying map structure. The algorithm is evaluated on two challenging datasets involving indoor data generated using a handheld device and outdoor data from an autonomous fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Using these, we are able to show that the score provided by our method is highly correlated to the true localization performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the predicted map quality can be used within a belief based path planning framework in order to provide reliable trajectories through high-quality areas of the map.
