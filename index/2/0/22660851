These roles are too coarse to represent verbs' semantics. In this paper, we introduce verb patterns to represent verbs' semantics, such that each pattern corresponds to a single semantic of the verb. First we analyze the principles for verb patterns: generality and specificity. Then we propose a nonparametric model based on description length. Experimental results prove the high effectiveness of verb patterns. We further apply verb patterns to context-aware conceptualization, to show that verb patterns are helpful in semantic-related tasks.
