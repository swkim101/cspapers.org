This paper describes experiences gained during the course of a fairly large, multi-site project in which an integrated, computer-based electronic message and document preparation system was employed as the principal coordinating mechanism for the project. Approximately 60 individuals had direct access to this system and used it as their primary means of communication for the duration of the project.
