Carnegie Mellon's West Coast Campus offers an MS in Software Engineering, with technical and development management tracks, targeted at working software professionals in Silicon Valley. We believe the program to be unique in that it is entirely team-based and project-centered. Students learn by doing as they are coached just in time by faculty in the context of authentic projects, and they are evaluated based on what they produce. Student satisfaction is high: 92% believe that the program has given them a competitive advantage with respect to their professional peers, and their promotion and salary histories bear out this belief.
