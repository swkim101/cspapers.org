The paper presents a formal tool of modelling of constructional design, where the cardinal issue is knowledge representation. It is shown that the structures of classical mathematical logic, such as t-type many-sorted models, can be applied almost directly to represent the world of a certain designing task. Using the PROLOG programming system, the logical representation of the task yields, at the same time, its automated solution. The most important moment of modelling a task of this kind is fixing the appropriate type of the structures. A PROLOG program for designing many-storied buildings is taken as an example.
