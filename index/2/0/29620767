Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a key stepping stone on the road to truly autonomous robots. SLAM is of particular importance to robots with large motion estimation problems, such as robots operating on the surface of aquatic GPS-denied environments where a paucity of local landmarks complicates SLAM and accurate navigation. Visual sensors have proven to be an effective tool for SLAM generally and have wide applicability, but is vision enough to solve SLAM in this environment, and how important are other sensors including a compass and water column depth to solve SLAM for an aquatic surface vehicle? Here we show that more sensors are almost always helpful in terms of improving SLAM performance in such a situation but that a compass is a particularly useful sensor for SLAM for autonomous surface vehicles; suggesting that a compass is a worthwhile investment for such a robot, and that compass alternatives should be considered when operating an autonomous vehicle in environments that are both GPS and compass-denied.
