It is well-known that females are underrepresented in STEM fields -- especially in the computing sciences. Bias, stereotypes, and negative experiences can be realized early in a girl's life. Research suggests that early intervention is necessary to encourage female participation in the computing sciences as a possible educational and career choice. While there are many catalysts that attribute to low interest and participation of females in computing, this research addresses five known causes: a lack of exposure to computing at a young age, a shortage of positive role models in the field, negative stereotypes, unappealing approaches to learning computing, and uncomfortable learning environments. In this research, Pre-K girls, as early as four years of age, were introduced to eight computer-related games and activities. The girls learned about algorithms, computer programming, circuits, and robots in a hands-on, exploratory environment. Age-appropriate surveys were conducted to compare the girls' affinity towards the computer-related activities before and after the study. The results of the study are encouraging as the girls demonstrated increased positive attitudes towards computer-based activities after participating in the study. In addition, the results of the study also demonstrated that the participating girls were able to successfully learn computing concepts at a young age. The presentation of the study will be accompanied by a hand-out including descriptions of the activities and associated equipment for those who would like to explore the topics independently. The presenters will also demonstrate a few of the more portable activities used in the study.
