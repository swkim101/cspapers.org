Advances in device technology have led to an era where entire systems can be implemented on a single component, commonly referred to as system-on-chip. With shrinking product life cycles placing severe time to market demands on manufacturers, coupled with their need to quickly change a product's feature set to address evolving customer requirements, programmability will emerge as a corner-stone for all chips implemented in the future. The Internet, communications, consumer electronics, and computing markets are first to take advantage of system-on-chip technology. What are the benefits of programmability to these and other markets and are there potential pitfalls? What architectures and programmability (or reconfigurability) are going to be the likely winners and at what cost? Are these architectures likely to converge or diverge? The panelists will debate the merits of their existing approaches and how they are likely to be shaped in the future.
