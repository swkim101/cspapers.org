This paper contains an in-depth study of a particular problem in order to evaluate several approaches to the solving of discrete combinatorial problems. We take a warehouse location problem as a case study and present solutions to it by using Integer Programming, a specialized program based on A* and the constraint logic programming CHIP. The merits of each approach are discussed and compared in the light of the problem. Finally, we conclude by arguing that CHIP provides a valuable addition to the current set of tools for solving discrete combinatorial problems.
