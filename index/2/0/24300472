Till recently, for civil users worldwide, GPS was the only Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for positioning purposes. However, the return of GLONASS as well as the appearance of Galileo and Beidou has brought many modern and advanced positioning services to the world. More importantly, the combinations of these systems in common multi-GNSS solutions promise much improvement in accuracy, availability and reliability of the positioning. This paper presents research works on development of multi-GNSS positioning solutions working with real signals collected from the recently launched satellites of the new Galileo and Beidou systems. The result analyses prove not only the readiness of the developed multi-GNSS solutions but also their real advantages over the stand-alone solutions.
