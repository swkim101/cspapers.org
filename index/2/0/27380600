This article presents a study about a mobility aid system, which integrates adaptive control interface for a robotic walker. The objective is to give to the patient more flexibility in the choice of a technical aid. The specificity of our system is based on an auto-adaptive interface, which improves the configuration choice of the patient's driving commands. The results obtained from experimentations show the capabilities of our method for a technical aid. The learning process is applied on line to a neural network controller. The experiment is focused on sensors configuration and command of a powered walker interface.
