Smart cities have attracted an extensive and increasing interest from both science and industry with an increasing number of international examples emerging from across the world. However, despite the significant role that smart cities can play to deal with recent urban challenges, the concept has been criticized for being influenced by vendor hype. There are various attempts to conceptualize smart cities and various benchmarking methods have been developed to evaluate their impact. In this paper the modelling and benchmarking approaches are systematically compared. There are six common dimensions among the approaches, namely people, government, economy, mobility, environment and living. This paper utilizes existing smart city analysis models in order to review three representative smart city cases and useful outcomes are extrapolated from this comparison.
