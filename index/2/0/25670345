Recent advances in distributional semantics combined with the availability of large-scale diachronic corpora offer new research avenues for the Digital Humanities. JESEME, the Jena Semantic Explorer, renders assistance to a non-technical audience to investigate diachronic semantic topics. JESEME runs as a website with query options and interactive visualizations of results, as well as a REST API for access to the underlying diachronic data sets.
