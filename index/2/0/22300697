HEX-programs enrich the well-known Answer Set Programming (ASP) paradigm. In HEX, problems are solved using nonmonotonic logic programs with bidirectional access to external sources. ASP evaluation is traditionally based on grounding the input program first, but recent advances in lazy-grounding make the latter also interesting for HEX, as the grounding bottleneck of ASP may be avoided. We explore this issue and present a new evaluation algorithm for HEX-programs based on lazy-grounding solving for ASP. Nonmonotonic dependencies and value invention (i.e., import of new constants) from external sources make an efficient solution nontrivial. However, illustrative benchmarks show a clear advantage of the new algorithm for grounding-intense programs, which is a new perspective to make HEX more suitable for real-world application needs.
