LittleFe buildout events are training and infrastructure opportunities for teams of accepted faculty and students from educational institutions across the United States to assemble LittleFe educational appliances (http://littlefe.net) and learn to use them in the classroom to teach parallel programming, cluster computing, and computational/data enabled science & engineering (CDESE). The buildout consists of participants assembling their LittleFe unit from a kit; installing the Bootable Cluster CD (BCCD, http://bccd.net) software on it; learning about the curriculum modules available for teaching parallel programming, High Performance Computing (HPC) and CDESE; and learning how to develop new curriculum modules for the LittleFe/BCCD platform.
