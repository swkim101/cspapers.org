This paper describes the building of a remotely-controlled prosthetic hand. The project has five elements: 1. 3D modeling and printing the hand parts and the casings for the entire system; 2. assembling the joints with strings attached to servomotors; 3. two Arduino boards programmed such that the prosthetic hand mirrors the finger motions of a sensor-equipped glove worn by a human; 4. Bluetooth communication between the sensors on the glove and the Arduino board, which moves the fingers of the prosthetic hand by pulling strings attached to the servomotors; and 6. experiments on the completed hand to refine the relationship between the Arduino commands and the precise motions of the finger joints. Future work is also described involving electro-sensors on upper muscles with the intention of controlling the prosthetic hand based on the detected electrical signals in the muscles.
