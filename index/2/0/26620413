Cassel (Moderator) At SIGCSE 2010, program officers from the National Science Foundation presented a panel on "Interdisciplinary Computing Education for the Challenges of the Future."[1]. An outcome was a funded project â€œToward a Climate for Interdisciplinary Computing" (OCI-1058623); PIs Lillian Cassel and Ursula Wolz led four national meetings with a mix of computing and noncomputing professionals. Over the ensuing three years an amazing diversity of people described successful experiences and brainstormed methods to overcome roadblocks. The overall conclusion is that Interdisciplinary Computing is alive and well and looking to broaden its impact. This intentionally large panel represents the diversity of the meetings. Very short presentations allow for over half the session to be spirited interaction with the audience, thus illustrating the high energy dynamic of this exciting and inspiring project.
