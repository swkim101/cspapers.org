An information structure (IS) that is regarded as a formal description of a domain of discourse is proposed. This IS is aimed at increasing the cffectivcness of an information retrieval system. It is shown bow the retrieval algorithm can take into account the term dcpendencics that are provided by the IS. Morcovcr, these term depcndencies can bc used by an automatic indexing procedure in order to interpret polyscmic terms. The thcorctical framework of our IS has some favorable properties. As a consequence, the construction and mtintenance of such au IS is simpler than that of a thesaurus.
