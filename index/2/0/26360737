This communication introduces measurement results of Radar Cross Section (RCS) of UHF passive tags. The RCS theory and its relationship with the reading range of tags are explained. We studied the influence of tag support, particularly those made of wood. Finally, we found that RCS is a good parameter to determine homogeneity of multiple tags of the same industrial mass production.
