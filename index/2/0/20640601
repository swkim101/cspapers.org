Construction of a programming language interpreter has many beneficial aspects as a project for an intermediate level course. It provides a taste of the compilation process and an understanding of many issues involved in the structure and analysis of programming languages, all in a framework of an interesting, moderately large programming project. Over the past several years I have developed a workable interpreter, demanding a month or less, which successfully exhibits many important concepts. I hope that the presentation of this specific formulation, in detail, will prove of value to others.
 This project provides an interpreter for a simple, statement-oriented language.
