This work deals with a specific walking pattern in biped robot locomotion $an ability to turn. This ability, which is an essential part of a free walk on a 2D surface, is indispensable for a walk among obstacles. Only the turning operation property is considered. Using local information about its surroundings obtained from the robot sensors, and depending-on the shape and location of an obstacle on its way, the turning strategy is applied to negotiate the obstacle and resume stable motion. One difficulty is in maintaining robot stability during turning. The control strategy is based on the zero moment point. Motion stability is ensured by adjusting the swing leg center of mass and hip position trajectories in a trial and error fashion. The procedure is fast enough for real-time implementation. Simulation experiments demonstrate the stability of motion when negotiating various obstacles.
