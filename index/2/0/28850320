While today's IT students may have a theoretical knowledge of all the phases in the systems development lifecycle, they often have little exposure to software development core practices. Few are able to build a new system from scratch. This paper examines a pedagogical approach to modern software engineering based on "doing" systems development from day one. Course materials were produced by Agile methodology expert, Alistair Cockburn. Early results from an implementation of the experimental approach to the systems analysis and design course are examined.
