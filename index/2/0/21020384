Graph clustering has recently attracted much attention as a technique to extract community structures from various kinds of graph data. Since available graph data becomes increasingly large, the acceleration of graph clustering is an important issue for handling large-scale graphs. To this end, this paper proposes a fast graph clustering method using GPUs. The proposed method is based on parallelization of label propagation, one of the fastest graph clustering algorithms. Our method has the following three characteristics: (1) efficient parallelization: the algorithm of label propagation is transformed into a sequence of data-parallel primitives; (2) load balance: the method takes into account load balancing by adopting the primitives that make the load among threads and blocks well balanced; and (3) out-of-core processing: we also develop algorithms to efficiently deal with large-scale datasets that do not fit into GPU memory. Moreover, this GPU out-of-core algorithm is extended to simultaneously exploit both CPUs and GPUs for further performance gain. Extensive experiments with real-world and synthetic datasets show that our proposed method outperforms an existing parallel CPU implementation by a factor of up to 14.3 without sacrificing accuracy.
