This special session will present a preliminary report on the latest recommendations for a model liberal arts computer curriculum as formulated by the Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium. This group provided earlier recommendations for model curricula for liberal arts degrees in computer science in 1986 [3] and 1996 [4]. The new curriculum takes into account advances in the discipline and the recommendations of Computing Curricula 2001 [2], but places them in the context of a liberal arts curriculum where students are expected to take courses in a variety of disciplines. Overall, a computer science program in a liberal arts setting typically requires no more than 40-45% of a studentâ€™s undergraduate program (including math and other science). While this balance places severe limits on the number of
