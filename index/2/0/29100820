Innovative University/Industry interactions are examined in this open event with the aim of providing inputs to an international project that is being funded through the United Kingdom's Teaching Fellowship Scheme. These inputs will support the first stage of the project which is concerned with gaining knowledge of industrial Software Engineering practices and the development of a framework that can be used in the classification and evaluation of such practices.
