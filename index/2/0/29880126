The term "Technical Debt" was coined over 20 years ago by Ward Cunningham in a 1992 OOPSLA experience report. Ward used "Technical debt" to describe the trade-offs be-tween delivering the most appropriate - albeit likely immature - product, in the shortest time possible. Since then, the repercussions of 'technical debt' have become more visible, though not necessarily more widely understood. This SPLASH panel will bring together practitioners to discuss and debate "Technical Debt".
