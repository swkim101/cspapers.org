Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the foundational data model of the Semantic Web, and is essentially designed for integration of heterogeneous data from varying sources. However, lack of security features for managing sensitive RDF data while sharing may result in privacy breaches, which in turn, result in loss of user trust. Therefore, it is imperative to provide an infrastructure to secure RDF data. We present a set of graph sanitization operations that are built as an extension to SPARQL. These operations allow one to sanitize sensitive parts of an RDF graph and further enable one to build more sophisticated security and privacy features, thus allowing RDF data to be shared securely.
