Service-oriented computing (SOC) strives for applications having services as the fundamental element of design, and Web services acting as the enabling technology. Web services use open, XML-based standards and are becoming the most important technology for communications between disparate applications in different enterprises. In this paper, the authors study end-to-end response time for synchronous and asynchronous composite Web services invoked over the Internet. The main aim is to study the queuing time and execution time for various classes of clients present in a system. the authors present a formal model based on queuing network to simulate the execution time for composite Web services, which require different blend of services and need different set of resources to execute.
