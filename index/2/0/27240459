Disaster rescue is one of the most serious social issues which involves very large numbers of heterogenous agents in the hostile environment. The intention of the RoboCup Rescue project is to promote research and development in this socially significant domain by creating a standard simulator and forum for researchers and practitioners. While the rescue domain is intuitively appealing as a large scale multi-agent domain, it has not yet been given thorough analysis of its domain characteristics. We present detailed analysis of the task domain, challenges, and outline benchmark evaluations.
