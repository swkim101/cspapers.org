A three-layered neural network model was used to explore the organization of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The dynamic model was trained using recurrent back-propagation to produce compensatory, long duration eye muscle motoneuron outputs in response to short duration vestibular afferent head velocity inputs. The network learned to produce this response prolongation, known as velocity storage, by developing complex, lateral inhibitory interactions among the interneurons. These had the low baseline, long time constant, rectified and skewed responses that are characteristic of real VOR interneurons. The model suggests that all of these features are interrelated and result from lateral inhibition.
