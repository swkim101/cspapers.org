A wideband circularly polarized antenna operating at 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific and medical band (ISM band) is presented in this paper. The proposed antenna consists of a truncated rectangular shape as the main patch, and two parasite U-shape patches. The antenna is fed by a single coaxial probe. The measurement and simulation results show that the proposed antenna achieves the broad impedance bandwidth of 10% and the 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth up to 13%. The results indicate that the proposed antenna is a good candidate for applications using 2.4 GHz ISM band.
