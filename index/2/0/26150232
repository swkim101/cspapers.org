In this paper we examine a perceptron learning task. The task is realizable since it is provided by another perceptron with identical architecture. Both perceptrons have nonlinear sigmoid output functions. The gain of the output function determines the level of nonlinearity of the learning task. It is observed that a high level of nonlinearity leads to overfitting. We give an explanation for this rather surprising observation and develop a method to avoid the overfitting. This method has two possible interpretations, one is learning with noise, the other cross-validated early stopping.
