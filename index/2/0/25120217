We experimentally demonstrated the operation of a cost-effective colorless dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) metropolitan network based on self-seeded reflective-semiconductor-optical-amplifiers (RSOAs). All the RSOAs used in our experiments are packaged in commercial small form-factor-pluggable (SFP) modules. The proposal architecture is simple and symmetric thanks to utilization of two cyclic array-waveguide-gratings (AWGs). Downstream link functions in C-band wavelength range and upstream link in L-band wavelength range. By using erbium-doped-fiber-amplifiers (EDFAs) to extend the reach, an error-free transmission over 90 km for 16 channels at 2.5 Gb/s was demonstrated for both directions and an optical budget over 35 dB was obtained.
