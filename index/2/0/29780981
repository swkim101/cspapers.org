Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) is an important NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with many applications andMaxSAT solving has attracted much interest. This work proposes a new incomplete approach toMaxSAT.We propose a novel decimation algorithm for MaxSAT, and then combine it with a local search algorithm. Our approach works by interleaving between the decimation algorithm and the local search algorithm, with useful information passed between them. Experiments show that our solver DeciLS achieves state of the art performance on all unweighted benchmarks from the MaxSAT Evaluation 2016. Moreover, compared to SAT-based MaxSAT solvers which dominate industrial benchmarks for years, it performs better on industrial benchmarks and significantly better on application formulas from SAT Competition. We also extend this approach to (Weighted) Partial MaxSAT, and the resulting solvers significantly improve local search solvers on crafted and industrial benchmarks, and are complementary (better on WPMS crafted benchmarks) to SAT-based solvers.
