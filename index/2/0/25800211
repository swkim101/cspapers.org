OpenMP is an industry-standard, platform-independent parallel programming library built into all modern C and C++ compilers. Unlike complex parallel platforms, OpenMP is designed to make it relatively easy to add parallelism to existing sequential programs, as well as write new parallel programs from scratch. In this fun, interactive, hands-on workshop, participants will use OpenMP to learn about a variety of parallel programming concepts, including single program multiple data (SPMD) execution, fork-join threading, parallel loops, parallel blocks, atomic execution, mutual exclusion, and others. Participants will explore 15 short programs designed to help students understand specific parallel concepts, plus several longer programs in which OpenMP is used to solve significant problems. The workshop includes: (i) an introduction to OpenMP, (ii) self-paced hands-on experimentation with the OpenMP programs, and (iii) a discussion of how OpenMP may be used to achieve parallel computing objectives in CS 2013. Participants will also view visual examples that let students see parallelism happening in real time. Participants will need a laptop with an SSH client (e.g., BitVise, PuTTY), or a laptop with a compiler that supports OpenMP (e.g., gcc 4.2 or later, Visual Studio 2008 or later); Linux, Mac, and Windows laptops will be supported. Knowledge of a C-family language (e.g., C, C++, Java, ...) may be helpful but is not required to benefit from the workshop. All materials from this workshop will be freely available from csinparallel.org.
