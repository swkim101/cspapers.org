A new Stereo Vision system using Deconvolution technique is proposed. This system is composed of the upper and the lower camera. By Deconvolution the upper image with the lower one, the system constructing horizontal section image. After the automobiles are separated from the other things in this horizontal section image, the distances and relative velocity are measured. This segmentation is realised by the thresholding procedure which utilizes the relation between the distance and the breadth of the automobile. The experimental results are peresented. It is also shown that the deconvolution technique is able to construct a finer and higher resolutional horizontal section image compared with a correlation technique. Although the SN ratio of the horizontal section image is inconsistant with range resolution, the possibility of the adjustment between the SN ratio and the resolution is presented.
