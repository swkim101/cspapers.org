Although the use of computers in secondary schools is rapidly increasing, there still remain many schools (particularly the smaller rural schools) which have no computer access suitable for classroom instruction. Providing educational opportunities in computers for students from these schools is a need which often can be easily filled by the university. The Computer Science Department at Bowling Green State University has offered a week-long computer summer workshop for the past five summers aimed at filling this need. The workshops have been very successful, introducing the world of computers to many talented area high schoolers who would not otherwise have had the opportunity. As the use of computers in the secondary schools increases and changes, the role of this workshop will also change, but there will always be a need for special learning opportunities, such as this workshop, which the university can provide to supplement the computer education in the secondary schools.
