In this paper, we elucidate how Korean temporal markers, OE and DONGAN contribute to specifying the event time and formalize it in terms of typed lambda calculus. We also present a computational method for constructing temporal representation of Korean sentences on the basis of G grammar proposed by [Renaud, 1992;1996].
