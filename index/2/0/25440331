When only one female student joined our Introduction to Structured Programming course in the Fall of 1993 and was gone by midterm, I became alarmed! During the last several years, our enrollment in Computer Science has attracted fewer and fewer females. I believe the lack of interest of female students to be a serious problem that needs to be addressed by educators. For this reason I have assembled a panel of educators who will share their ideas as to why this is happening and inform us of their efforts to counteract this gender imbalance.
