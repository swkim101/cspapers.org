The concept of a program which lists or enumerates all possible computer programs in a given language occurs frequently in the study of theoretical computer science topics such as computability and formal languages. This paper studies characteristics of such enumerations and presents a way to give students a better intuitive “feel” for this concept. A simple technique for enumerating programs is developed and is used to present the millionth computer program in an enumeration.
