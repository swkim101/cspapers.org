PPLive is currently the most well-known instance of an IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) application which stands out due to its increasing popularity. As of May 2006, PPLive had over 200 distinct online channels, a daily average of 400,000 aggregated users, and most of its channels had several thousands of users at their peaks. During the Chinese New Year 2006 event, a particular PPLive channel had over 200,000 simultaneous viewers [2]. There are several measurement studies about PPLive characteristics [1, 2, 5]. These existing studies tend to predominantly look at either network-centric metrics (e.g., video traffic, TCP connections, etc.), or at user-centric metrics (e.g., geographic distribution, user arrival and departure, user-perceived quality, channel population, etc.). Our crawler-based measurement studies are unique in focusing primarily on overlay-based characteristics, which lie somewhere in between the user-centric view and the network centric view. Our studies reveal that (1) node degree is independent of channel population size, and (2) small PPLive overlays (as many as 500 nodes) are similar to random graphs in structure.
