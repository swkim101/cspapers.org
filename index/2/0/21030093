In the 21st Century, software is the enabling innovation pillar for all of civilization’s needs – including: food supply, living space (water, waste, power, and climate) management, services (health, financial, transportation, communication) and human relations (social networking). While the professionalism inherent in implement-ing, deploying, and configuring software systems may not appear as advanced as that found in other more regulated professions such as medicine, aviation, and engineering – is it “good enough”? This panel will discuss whether we are learning effectively from our experiences with failure and human hazards. Panelists will also discuss how software professionalism can be accelerated and debate the effectiveness of proficiency certifications in fostering increased professionalism.
