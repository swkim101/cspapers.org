Robotic Navigation Through Gesture Based Control (RNTGBC) assists people who may not be able to operate a smart device using their fingers. These individuals might face limitations due to physical disabilities or may be in a job where their fingers are not free to operate the smart device. For this project, a motion sensor was used in combination with a robot. The sensor was used to capture gestures and operate the robot. The tools used are the Leap (a device that reads 3D gesture motion), the Sphero (a remote controlled rolling ball), and a laptop. RNTGBC uses the Leap device to control the Sphero with hand gestures. This technology is important because navigation through gestures can be adapted towards larger contexts, such as helping someone in a wheelchair move around or assisting someone who does not have their hands available when performing a job task.
