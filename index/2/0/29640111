This volume contains the proceedings of the twelfth International Workshop on Web Information and Data Management, held in Maui in conjunction with CIKM 2012 on November 2, 2012. These proceedings consist of an abstract based on the keynote address by Maria Grineva and 10 contributed papers that were selected from 16 submissions by the program committee for presentation at the workshop. 
 
The objective of the workshop since its inception at CIKM 1998 is to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners to present and discuss leading research into how web data and information can be extracted, stored, analyzed, and processed to provide useful knowledge to end users for advanced database and web applications. The rich WIDM'12 program continues this tradition. We hope that the reader finds inspiration and stimulation in the contributed papers.
