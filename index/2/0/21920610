Computer Science Circles (http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca) is a website that teaches Python for beginners, presented at SIGCSE 2013. It includes lessons, automatically-graded exercises, examples and visualizations. One purpose of the website is outreach with real human interaction: anyone who is stuck solving an exercise can privately send a question to the "CS Circles Assistant" (the author and two colleagues). As part of this poster, we will show some information about the 2500 student questions we have answered through this system, e.g. the questions where students most often reach out for help. We will also provide feedback from teachers using the site with their own classes. The website was open-sourced in August 2013 thanks to a SIGCSE Special Projects grant, bringing it in line with the great open-source components used to create it. One unique outcome of this open licensing is installing a site mirror in a correctional institute. The website was originally launched in English and French. Since then, we have worked with CS institutes from other countries: versions in German and Dutch have been released, with other translations under way. The poster will highlight some tools and caveats involved in this process. Users of the site submit their solutions for online auto-grading, with about 500000 exercises now completed. This has yielded a large amount of data about the frequency of different error messages. We will include a chart of the most common errors, and an illustration of how we used this to generate clickable hints to give better beginner-level explanations for the most common errors.
