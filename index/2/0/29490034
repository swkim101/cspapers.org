A 6-bit low power current steering data to analog converter (DAC) which sampling frequency up to 8GHz is presented. The converter consists of 4MSBs and 2LSBs, trading off between the precision and complexity of circuit. The 8-GSample/s conversion rate has been obtained by fully custom designed thermometer decoder and synchronization circuit. The spurious free dynamic rang (SFDR) more than 34.2 dB has been obtained from dc to 2.7GHz at sampling frequency of 8GHz. The power consumption at an 8GHz sampling frequency for a near Nyquist sinusoidal output signal equals 15.7mW. The DAC occupies 0.485 mm Ã— 0.675 mm in a 65nm CMOS technology.
