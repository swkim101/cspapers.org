HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) has emerged as the predominant technique for transmitting video over cellular for most content providers today. While mobile video streaming is extremely popular, delivering good streaming experience over cellular networks is technically very challenging, and involves complex interacting factors. We conduct a detailed measurement study of a wide cross-section of popular streaming video-on-demand (VOD) services to develop a holistic understanding of these services' design and performance. We identify performance issues and develop effective practical best practice solutions to mitigate these challenges. By extending the understanding of how different, potentially interacting components of service design impact performance, our findings can help developers build streaming services with better performance.
