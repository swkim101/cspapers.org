Recently, some approaches have been proposed to reduce such bias in order to get better action-value estimates, but are limited to finite problems.In this paper, we leverage on the recently proposed weighted estimator and on Gaussian process regression to derive a new method that is able to natively handle infinitely many random variables.We show how these techniques can be used to face both continuous state and continuous actions RL problems.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach we perform empirical comparisons with related approaches.
