Considering the revolutionary effects that computer technology has had on various elements of American life, including banking, retailing, hotel and airline reservations, periodical circulation, business management, industrial inventories, etc., it seems strange that computerized methods have not had a greater impact on engineering education than is evident today. This is especially strange in the light of the fact that many basic advances in computer theory and design have been made through research performed in our engineering colleges.
