Due to the PSD constraint, the computational complexity of previous algorithms per iteration is at least O(d2) where d is the dimensionality of the data.In this paper, we develop an efficient stochastic algorithm  for a class of distance metric learning problems with nuclear norm regularization, referred to as low-rank DML. By utilizing the low-rank structure of the intermediate solutions and stochastic gradients, the complexity of our algorithm has a linear dependence on the dimensionality d. The key idea is to maintain all the iterates  in factorized representations  and construct  stochastic gradients that are low-rank. In this way, the projection onto the PSD cone can be implemented efficiently by incremental SVD. Experimental results on several data sets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.
