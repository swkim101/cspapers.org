Binary offset carrier (BOC) modulated signals have been introduced in global navigation satellite systems such as Galileo and modernized Global Positioning System. This type of modulation creates multiple side peaks in autocorrelation function. Thus, it causes challenges in the stages of signal acquisition and tracking. In this paper, we present a new method of side-peak cancellation for BOC-modulated signals in order to remove or diminish the side peaks while keeping the sharp and narrow main peak. This proposed method could be applied to cosine-BOC(n, n) modulated signals, which are adopted to Galileo signals. Moreover, this method has better performance in reducing the error caused by multipath propagation than traditional method.
