This paper describes how a software development division in a large corporate environment found a creative way to integrate human factors techniques into their development processes. It discusses the limitations of a single Human Factors Engineer, the needs of a typical engineer on a software project, and how these limitations and needs produced the Product Usability Champion Program. Product Usability Champions are representatives from each software project in the division who act as usability watchdogs for their respective projects. The Human Factors Engineer's responsibility is to provide support to these Champions. This support includes access to a Usability Lab, technical advice, references, consulting, classroom training, hands-on training, Usability Champion program facilitation and support, and specific project team involvement. This paper describes the program's structure, implementation, and success.
