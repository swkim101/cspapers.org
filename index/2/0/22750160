In this paper, we compared various power gating schemes in terms of energy loss, crossover time, and wake-up time using the 45-nm Predictive Technology Model. In this comparison, the Dual-Switch Power Gating (DSPG) shows smaller energy loss, shorter crossover time, faster wake-up time than the other power gating schemes such as the Single-Switch and Charge-Recycled Power Gating schemes. Based on these advantages, the DSPG is suggested in this paper as a viable candidate suitable to a fine-grain leakage control scheme, where logic blocks go in and out very frequently and shortly between the active and sleep modes.
