Programming in Java can be a daunting task for introductory students, one that is only compounded by the cryptic compiler error messages they see when they first start to write actual code. This article details a project conducted by faculty and advanced students in the creation of an educational tool for Java programming, called Expresso. This paper discusses some existing programming tools, explains their drawbacks, and describes why Expresso is different. We also include a detailed list of typical errors made by novice programmers, used in the construction of the Expresso tool.
