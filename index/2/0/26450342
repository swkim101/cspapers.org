This paper proposes a combined forward and backward lattice-reduction aided detection scheme to improve estimation of transmitted signals in lattice-reduction aided (LRA) MMSE MIMO systems. The cross-correlation between the forward and the backward reduced channel matrices is also analyzed to make sure that the proposed detector achieves more reliable estimates. The proposed detector achieves much better BER performance than the conventional LRA detector in the 4 x 4 and the 8 x 8 MIMO systems. It is also shown that the achieved BER curve moves closer to the curve of the ML detector than that of the conventional LRA MMSE detector.
