SOLVER is built to maximize the interactions between the human users and CP techniques. It allows users to apply various consistency algorithms to specific constraints or the entire puzzle, and interactively make assignments and domain reductions. We also designed a ‘hint’ functionality that uses increasingly complex propagation algorithms in a controlled manner to guide and train the users to play the game.
