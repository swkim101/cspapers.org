What direction or path of learning should data modelling take? This author suggests a “course” for data modelling to follow. Artificial intelligence, databases, and programming languages are attempting to meet demands requiring a higher level of conceptual thinking than ever before. Likewise special tools and techniques are needed for that level of thought. Therefore data modelling methodologies are designed to provide an abstract level of system descriptions. A course based upon the comparative study of these various data modelling principles is described in this paper. This course stresses a transition from intuitive to formal development of data models. Such an approach facilitates the investigation of the concept of equivalence for data models, application models, and operations defined on data models.
