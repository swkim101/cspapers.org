Security issues of software plugins are seldom studied in existing researches. The plugin mechanism provides a convenient way to extend an application's functionality. However, it may also introduce susceptibility to new security issues. For example, attackers can create a malicious plugin to accomplish intended goals stealthily. In this poster, we propose a Software Plugin-based Malware (SPM) model and implement SPM prototypes for Microsoft Office, Adobe Reader and mainstream browsers, with the aim to study the development feasibility of such malware and illustrate their potential threats.
