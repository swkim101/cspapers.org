We have developed an intelligent robot camera system to support the production of broadcast television programs. The objective was to develop a system that automatically shoots scenes that are completely natural as if taken by an experienced camera operator, and that enables a single operator to control multiple cameras at the same time. We have developed an automatic program production system that is composed of several network-connected robot cameras programmed to mimic the shooting and camerawork techniques of professional camera operators. In this paper we give an overview of a prototype system using a new subject detection system and three robot cameras that are linked over a network and present a detailed summary of the trial results.
