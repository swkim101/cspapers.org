It is necessary for control of a PWM inverter to consider the sinusoidal transient effect and the load unbalances distribution. This paper propose a new control method for a three phase four wire PWM inverter having an output LC filter to achieve the three phase sinusoidal voltage. An observer used to predict and estimate the state variables for one step ahead. A fuzzy controller has been used to improve the performance of the inverter and to eliminate the disturbance. The simulation results for various operation conditions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique.
