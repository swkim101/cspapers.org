The pnzelists have made pioneering and sustained contributions to research in our field, and are therefore in a good position to comment on its development and direction. Each panelist will make a brief presentation on one paper or body of work (excluding their own) which has been most influential on the field of software testing and analysis and on their own research. A statement by Richard Hamlet follows; statements by the remaining panelists will be distributed at the s t mposium. These presentations will be followed by questions and comments by the ISSTA audieiace.
