This workshop is designed for faculty, considering teaching a course in mobile app development, who are unsure as to whether they should use iOS, Android, or both. To help them make an educated decision, in this workshop participants will build one app, to implement the game Pig, in both platforms. By so doing, they will be able to make a head-to-head comparison of the respective development environments, languages, and frameworks, guided by experienced instructors.
 Participants will need to bring (or share) a recent-vintage MacBook Pro / MacBook Air, with Xcode, Eclipse, and appropriate SDKs, installed prior to the workshop. Details, including installation instructions, may be found at androidios.goadrich.com. Laptop Required.
