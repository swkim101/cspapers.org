We are all excited to see an increasing number of national efforts to reform computing education. Persistent and sustainable change in a state, its higher education institutions, and its K12 districts requires the active participation of individuals and local organizations to engage policy makers, higher education, school districts and communities. U.S. education is highly distributed, with critical decisions pushed more to the community level and less at the national (or even state) level. The system is organized along K20 pathways and a reform process to improve these pathways will take place at multiple levels and state by state. This BOF will bring together emerging leaders at the state level with representatives from national initiatives to share best practices for implementing change. The NSF BPC Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance will present its 4-step model for state change: identify leaders, assess the CS education landscape, organize the statewide stakeholders, and find resources to enable change. We will moderate a discussion of how the ECEP model, its services and federal/foundation resources might be adapted to enhance state-based initiatives and partnerships. ECEP provides experts for state policy events, teacher professional development, and 2-4-year transfer summits. It provides training and funding to help start computing summer camps. ECEP trial interventions are helping more African American students pass the AP-CS-A exam.
