Investigates impact dynamics among free-floating multibody systems in space, by developing an extended inertial tensor concept, and establishes the theoretical basis for floating chain collisions. The authors have developed a concept named an 'extended inversed inertia tensor' (Ex-IIT), paying attention to free-floating behavior in the space environment. They apply Ex-IIT to impulse minimization arguments. To illustrate the magnitude of the impulses caused by link collisions in various conditions, the concepts of 'impulse index' and 'impulse ellipsoid' are introduced. By means of these concepts, the authors discuss the relationship of the impulse to collision directions and link postures, in order to determine the condition minimizing the impulse.
