An effective and robust feature selection method is desired to simultaneously identify the informative features and eliminate the noisy ones of data. In this paper, we consider the unsupervised feature selection problem which is particularly difficult as there is not any class labels that would guide the search for relevant features. To solve this, we propose a novel algorithmic framework which performs unsupervised feature selection. Firstly, the proposed framework implements structure learning, where the data structures (including intrinsic distribution structure and the data segment) are found via a combination of the alternative optimization and clustering. Then, both the intrinsic data structure and data segmentation are formulated as regularization terms for discriminant feature selection. The results of the feature selection also affect the structure learning step in the following iterations. By leveraging the interactions between structure learning and feature selection, we are able to capture more accurate structure of data and select more informative features. Clustering and classification experiments on real world image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
