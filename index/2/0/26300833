This paper describes an Expert-System (E.S.) for automatic econometric modelling. The aim of the system is to build a set of econometric equations on a data base. The specifications of the economic relationships are made explicit in a knowledge-based system in LISP. So the E.S. has two components: the first is an economic problem solving one, the second is a statistical and economic component. A third component which will interpret the econometric test of the statistical correlations and give economic explanation is envisaged.
