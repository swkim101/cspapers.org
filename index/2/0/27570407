Wearable devices combining with VR/AR technology become a research hotspot these years. In some research, tactile displays are put on the skin and synchronized with VR/AR environment. Researchers try to use these display to simulate varied embodied feeling to enhance the immersion in the VR/AR environment. In the field of game entertainment, based on the scenario, sometimes the feeling of passing through the body need to be presented to the user. However this is physically impossible. Thus we make a exploration attempting to simulate this feeling by thermal feedback. Here we use two thermal modules bonding on the two side of the wrist( inside and outside). When we actuate two modules sequentially, user would perceive the stimuli and interpret this into a feeling of passing though. In the paper, we will introduce the interface and describe the experiment to determine the principle for thermo-tactile illusion of passing through.
