However, how to discover discriminative as well as representative features in LDA model has not been explored. In this paper, we propose a latent Fisher discriminant model with representative feature discovery in an semi-supervised manner. Specifically, our model leverages advantages of both discriminative and generative models by generalizing LDA with data-driven prior over the latent variables. Thus, our method combines multi-class, latent variables and dimension reduction in an unified Bayesian framework. We test our method on MUSK and Corel datasets and yield competitive results compared to baselines. We also demonstrate its capacity on the challenging TRECVID MED11 dataset for semantic keyframe extraction and conduct a human-factors ranking-based experimental evaluation, which clearly demonstrates our proposed method consistently extracts more semantically meaningful keyframes than challenging baselines.
