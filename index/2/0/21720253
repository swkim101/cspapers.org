We introduce SmartTable, an online spreadsheet application that is equipped with intelligent assistance capabilities. With a focus on relational tables, describing entities along with their attributes, we offer assistance in two flavors: (i) for populating the table with additional entities (rows) and (ii) for extending it with additional entity attributes (columns). We provide details of our implementation, which is also released as open source. The application is available at http://smarttable.cc.
