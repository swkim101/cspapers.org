Design and test engineers in some companies have resisted the use of circuit simulation programs because of the necessity of learning a special language for circuit input and of the necessity of becoming too involved in computer operations. To overcome these objections the Circuit Analysis and Simulation Group at AE Labs has designed graphics processor programs to interface between the designer and the simulation programs. This paper provides a description of the current generation of these programs.
