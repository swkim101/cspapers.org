The AP CS A program is exploring the possibility of moving from the utilization of the GridWorld case study to the inclusion of several in-class laboratory exercises, beginning in 2014-2015 or later. The Development Committee believes labs may achieve many benefits of the past case studies, but a lab format will allow teachers more flexibility in teaching and a more agile development cycle for new materials. This Special Session will review the motivations, experiences, limitations, and constraints of case studies, motivations for the use of in-class laboratory exercises, and some components of three laboratory exercises that currently are under development by the AP CS A program.
