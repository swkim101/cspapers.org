This is my first time speaking at OOPSLA and I must confess to some apprehension. I’m not apprehensive about giving a speech; I do that all the time. Usually, however, I get up in front of transaction-oriented crowds and tell them about objects. My basic message to them is “Speed up.” Here I have a different challenge. I’m talking to object-oriented people about transactions, ‘and my message, at least in part, is going to be “Slow down.” And that’s a message I’m not used to delivering.
