An important characteristic of Canadian industry is that it is largely foreign-dominated. A result of this is that many products, that are manufactured in Canada, are designed elsewhere. Furthermore, since the development of design automation techniques and systems usually affects the whole corporation, this development is almost always done in the country in which its headquarters is established. As an example, consider the computer industry: although some major computer manufacturers have quite substantial research and development facilities in Canada, they are mainly users of Design Automation systems. The design and implementation of these Design Automation systems and the research into new Design Automation techniques is usually carried out in a central location. The same is true for companies in other fields of engineering. Although the above might indicate a far from fertile environment for Design Automation in Canada, some rather interesting developments in design automation are being carried out by Canadian universities, by Government agencies and by some Canadian-owned companies.
