A vendor of Design Automation systems must contend not only with the prospective user, but also with the user's computer staff. The latter can be very helpful, but may also have development plans which run counter to any outside purchase.
 Once a purchase decision is made, organizational problems and opportunities become paramount. For example, most turnkey design automation systems not only encompass design automation, but extend to automated drafting and numerical control programming. Management gradually realizes that a common database will allow the flow of design studies to drafting and then to manufacturing engineering without redundant handling or redraw. The major question becomes “should we allow department 'X' to make a decision that will affect departments 'Y' and 'Z' without a corporate team or at least a policy on database standardization?”
