Based on our newly developed event-based planning and control theory, a new action planning and control scheme for the telerobotic system is presented. It provides a unified model to integrate a human operator control command (supervisory command) with motion planning and control for automatic operation. As a result, supervisory command and autonomous motion planning and control are naturally combined together such that the autonomous motion plan can be adjusted and modified by human operator during its execution. This scheme lays down a foundation for planning and control of a general robotic system involving human operators. The scheme is implemented and tested on a PUMA 560 dual-arm system. A Spaceball is used by the human operator as a command generator to input the supervisory command. The experimental results of both single arm teleoperation and dual-arm coordinated teleoperation are presented.<<ETX>>
