In this paper, the influence of a substrate lens made of high-permittivity material on the overall performance of a traveling-wave stripline dipole antenna is presented. Input impedance and radiation characteristics of the antenna are fully investigated over a broad frequency range up to 5.0 THz. The results show that the lens shape represented by the ratio of the extension length to the lens radius primarily determines the best possible antenna gain and radiation spectral bandwidth. The antenna gain response exhibits an increased level of sensitivity to the lens shape as the lens size increases, and this is particularly important when it comes to optimizing large substrate lenses.
