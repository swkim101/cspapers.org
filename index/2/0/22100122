This paper deals with the description of the strategy adopted by the French team in the Sony legged league to play soccer. Not only the behaviors designed for RoboCup are presented, but also the arrangement of the three different modules inside the robot, namely the vision, locomotion and strategy modules. The vision module runs at lower priority and provides others with relevant information captured from the environment. The locomotion module is responsible for the walking gaits generation. It manages transitions between forward, turning and rotation modes. It incorporates changes in speed, and recovery procedures in case the robot falls down. The paper focuses on how the decision or other behaviors are being taken. The overall architecture and the communications between the three modules are also described.
