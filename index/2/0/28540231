A conventional approach to multiparty videoeonferencing is to support a four way meeting using a Picture-in-aPicture (PIP) device, In this approach, each remote participantâ€™s image is placed in one quadrant of the screen of a single monitor. This common view is then distributed to each person. In addition, the audio from eaeh participant is combined, and all voices emanate from a single loudspeaker.
