Madeup is a text- and blocks-based programming language for making things up---literally. Programmers write sequences of commands to move and turn through space, tracing out printable 3D shapes with algorithms and mathematical operations. The language is designed to teach computation from a tangible, first-person perspective and help students integrate computation back into the physical world. In this workshop, we empower educators to use the freely-available and browser-based Madeup programming environment in their classrooms. Participants should expect to learn actively.
