We will simulate an encounter of educators at dinner, in an elevator, or an impromptu gathering around the coffee machine. A number of topics will be introduced for lively discussion. Sample topics include: learning student names, defining grading criteria for projects, active learning techniques, visualizations of computing concepts and more. Additional topics will be proposed by the audience. An exchange of ideas from a wide range of participants will create a steady stream of great ideas.
