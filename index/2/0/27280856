Macroprogramming abstractions provide abstract distributed data structures to simplify the programming of wireless embedded networks. However, none of the current macroprogramming systems provide debugging support for application development. We have developed MDB, a GDB-like post-mortem debugger for the MacroLab macroprogramming abstraction. In this demonstration, we show how MDB enables application development and debugging at a single level of abstraction. MDB eliminates the need for a programmer to reason about low-level event traces and message passing protocols, instead allowing debugging in terms of abstract data types. We expect MDB to fill a crucial link in the development cycle as a macroprogram progresses from the drawing board to real deployment.
