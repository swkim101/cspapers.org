This demonstration will show two distributed sensory systems. One is an environmental monitoring system that can be used outdoor weather and habitat studies or for controlled environment monitoring (Figure 1). This system is composed of two types of wireless sensor. One is a simple relative humidity and temperature sensor and the other has total solar radiation, photosynthetic radiation, and barometric pressure (in addition to relative humidity and temperature).The second system is a platform for distributed motion detection that can be used for perimeter or area activity monitoring or for building occupancy analysis (Figure 2). The system is composed of a node which has multiple sensors including four passive infrared, two-axis magnetic field, and acoustic microphone.The data from both systems will be displayed on a user interface called MOTE-VIEW. This is a PC application which is used to view incoming data, chart sensor information over time, and visualize the network topology and sensor data on a map of the deployment.The demo will also provide information on the software and hardware building blocks for sensory systems. The software building blocks include the embedded firmware in the sensor nodes ("XMesh-enabled applications"), the data aggregation and dissemination layer ("XServe"), and finally the client layer ("MOTE-VIEW"). The hardware building blocks include the wireless platform modules ("Motes") and sensor suites and interfaces. These building blocks are packaged as development platform and will be on display.
