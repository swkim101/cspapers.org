This paper concentrates on studying, designing and manufacturing a dualband microstrip antenna, that is able to operate within 2.5 – 2.69 GHz (2.5 GHz band ) and 3.4 – 3.6 GHz (3.5 GHz band). Antenna is made from FR4-epoxy substrate having ε = 4.4, h= 1.6 mm (thickness). It has folder structure and includes three branches: two resonant branches and tuning branch which are fed by 50 Ω microstrip line.
