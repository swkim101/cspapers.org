In this poster we present a new approach to teaching ethics in a Network Security Programming course. Ethics is a crucial component of any network security course. As students learn to protect network services, they necessarily learn to attack network services, disguise their identities, et cetera. While a few colleges have gone as far as giving students background checks before teaching hacking skills, some simple new tactics can motivate students to employ their skills legally and ethically. These tactics lead students to discover what is ethical for themselves, rather than being told what is or is not ethical.
