This paper analyzes the effect of an indoor frequency selective fading channel, characterized by its power delay profile, on the performance of an asynchronous DS-CDMA system with high transmission rate (50 Mb/s or more). The bit error rate (BER) is determined by the characteristic function method and by Monte-Carlo simulations. The results show that when the rms delay spread is close to the transmitted symbol duration, the system performance degrades considerably and that the performance degradation strongly depends on the maximum delay spread.
