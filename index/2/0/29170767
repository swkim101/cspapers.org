Rather than a detailed treatment of the research projects in the area, which is beyond the scope of the paper and talk, the paper includes a meta-survey, pointing to edited collections and overviews in the literature for the interested reader. Computational sustainability research has been broadly characterized by AI methods employed, sustainability areas addressed, and contributions made to (typically, human) decision-making. The paper addresses these characterizations as well, which will facilitate a deeper synthesis later, to include the potential for developing sophisticated and holistic AI decision-making and advisory agents.
