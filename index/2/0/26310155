The Applied Computer Technology Department (ACT) of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), a college of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), offered a unique two-day workshop at which incoming freshmen students who are deaf or hard of hearing built their own personal computers.This paper provides extended details of our experience at the most recent offering of this workshop attended by 28 freshmen students. The workshop was held in September, 1997 after new-student orientation and before school began.Sufficient details are provided so that our experience might serve as a reference point for other universities interested in offering a similar workshop.
