Observations of fumaroles are important in forecasting volcanic eruptions. However, such observations are dangerous for humans because of volcanic gases and high-temperature steam that surround fumaroles. In previous study, a teleoperated mobile robot was developed to realize remote observations. However, it was observed that typical mobile robots were unable to reach fumaroles on a steep cliff. Therefore, extant research focused on the development of tethered small mobile robots to tackle thsese types of challenging cliffs to observe fumaroles. This study proposes a design of a tethered mobile robot to traverse a steep slope based on the analysis of slip and turnover. A few indoor experimental studies and field experiment were performed to verify the proposed design.
