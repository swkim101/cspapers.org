In this 5th International Workshop on SOA and Web Services, we will explore best-practices in the adoption, design, implementation, management and monitoring of SOA- and Web services-related methods, tools and technologies.
 This workshop is a continuation of a highly successful series of workshops at OOPSLA 2006, OOPSLA 2005, OOPSLA 2004, and OOPSLA 2003.
