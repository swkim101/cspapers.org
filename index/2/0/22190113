Frame rate up conversion (FRUC) has been playing an important role in the recent development of advanced television systems due to its benefits on both increasing the viewing quality experiences and reducing the cost of video transmission. However, with the increasing of video resolutions, notably from Standard Definition (SD) to High Definition (HD), FRUC is now asked to provide not only better interpolated frames quality but also lower time processing. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel spatial - temporal feature extraction based adaptive search range for effective FRUC. In the proposed adaptive search range scheme, a set of temporal and spatial features are carefully defined and exploited to adaptively assign an appropriate search range value to each considered block; thus, directly reducing the FRUC time processing. Moreover, since the optimal search range can be employed; the quality of interpolated frames is significantly improved. Experimental results conducted for a rich set of video test sequences shown the advantages of the proposed FRUC scheme, notably in both subjective objective image quality improvement and time processing reduction.
