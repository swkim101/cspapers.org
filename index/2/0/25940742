Despite its simplicity there exists, as yet, no position-based routing that is suitable for dynamic networks: Existing schemes construct subgraphs or overlays that come at a cost that may be too high. In a network where nodes are mobile, such constructions risk becoming stale before they become stable, potentially invalidating routing decisions.
 In this work we are investigating position-based routing for dynamic networks based on left- or right-hand rule (LHR). A node using LHR forwards messages to the neighbour that sits next in rotational order. When used to recover from greedy routing failures, LHR guarantees success if implemented over planar graphs; for this reason it is often called 'face-routing'. We note, however, that if planarity is violated then LHR is only guaranteed to eventually return to the point of origin. We have chosen LHR for two reasons. First, it is most prevalent in position-based routing literature and hence well-studied. Second, it is a simple rule requiring little-to-no overhead.
 We have started by looking for the specific causes of failure in LHR with the hope that we might quickly recognise and avoid them in mobile environments [1]. First, in the unit disc graph where communication ranges are normalised to 1, we analyze the way in which intersecting links may interact to invoke sides of a 4-gon (Figure 1a). We have provably enumerated all possible configurations to three possible cases. Surprisingly, only one of these configurations is able to defeat LHR. This is because there are two distinct traversals, each of which has the potential to restrict exit points in the other. We call this the 'umbrella' configuration due to its appearance.
