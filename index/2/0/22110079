A novel Mine-Ours-Yours (MOY) interaction design framework is proposed for designing collaborative play activities in environments that combine both private and shared interactive spaces. A collaborative game designed on a system that integrates multiple mobile devices with an interactive tabletop was presented to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed MOY framework. Observations from field trials involving two groups of children were used to summarize the collaborative behaviors that are likely to be observed under the different interaction design configurations.
