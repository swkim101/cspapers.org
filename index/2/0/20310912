Object-oriented programming has become increasingly popular in the past few years. This paper presents a cpu scheduling simulation project that we feel can convince students of the benefits of object-oriented design and spur their interest. We will first describe the project and discuss its solutions in three levels of abstraction: structure programming using Pascal, object-based programming using Ada, and object-oriented programming using C++. We will present our experiences in this assignment and explain why the object-oriented design is the best approach. This paper is intended to serve as a case study in an object-oriented language course or a programming languages course.
