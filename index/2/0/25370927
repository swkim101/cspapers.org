This paper describes an experimental undergraduate course in applications of artificial intelligence, sponsored by an Industry/Academic Partnership with Towson State University. The course was developed as one of several activities promoting interaction between faculty, students, and industry in the local metropolitan area.
Towson State University is located in the metropolitan Baltimore, Maryland area, in close proximity to many companies involved in technological projects related to defense, automation, and aerospace endeavors. Three companies provided projects, leadership, and support to the course. The three projects were expert systems in the area of electronic diagnostics.
This paper describes the course; the diagnostic systems projects done by the student teams; and the activities of students, faculty, and industry liaisons. An evaluation of the course included meetings with industry liaisons and faculty and a follow-up survey of the students. Consideration of prerequisites for improvement of the course led to discussions of overall curriculum revision. Suggestions for ways to improve the course are given.
Departments interested in offering similar artificial intelligence project courses with industry participation may benefit from these experiences and recommendations.
