Entities are centric to a large number of real world applications. Wikipedia shows entity infoboxes for a large number of entities. However, not much structured information is available about character entities in books. Automatic discovery of characters from books can help in effective summarization. Such a structured summary which not just introduces characters in the book but also provides a high level relationship between them can be of critical importance for buyers. This task involves the following challenging novel problems: 1. automatic discovery of important characters given a book; 2. automatic social graph construction relating the discovered characters; 3. automatic summarization of text most related to each of the characters; and 4. automatic infobox extraction from such summarized text for each character. As part of this demo, we design mechanisms to address these challenges and experiment with publicly available books.
