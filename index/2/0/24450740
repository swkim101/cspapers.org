"Clustered Storage is becoming pervasive and is a major paradigm shift from previous generations of storage products, much like when CDs made records obsolete." ~ Tony Asaro, Enterprise Strategy Group, Oct 2005The purpose of this presentation is to introduce you to a new paradigm shift that is currently taking place in the data storage industry: the movement toward Clustered Storage architectures. Distributed storage clustering for the data storage industry is in much the same position today that IBM was in 1981, poised to change the rules of the computer industry. Clustered Storage architectures are changing the rules of how data is stored and accessed. In this paper we will discuss the trends that clearly define clustered storage architectures as the future of data storage, detail the requirements of this new category of storage, and introduce the IsilonÂ® IQ clustered storage solution which is the first to deliver on the promises of this paradigm shift.
