A syntax directed compiler to simulate digital systems is described. The compiler has been written in Fortran IV for the IBM 7044, and is capable of simulating digital systems containing up to approximately 2500 logic elements. It is a two pass compiler. During the first pass it scans the source statements by using the Backus Normal Form definition of allowed syntax. From this a coded description of the program is constructed. During the second pass this coded program description is used to generate machine code in an order suitable for system simulation. The system being simulated is then evaluated on the basis of its cost and ability to satisfy predetermined input-output requirements.
