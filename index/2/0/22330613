A number of contextualized approaches to teaching introductory Computer Science (CS) courses have been developed in the past few years, catering to students with different interests and learning styles. For instance, entire courses have been developed around media computation or robots (real and virtual). There is however one context which, to our knowledge, has not been exploited in a systematic fashion - that of "big data," by which we mean massive, openly accessible online datasets from a wide variety of sources. We present progress on a code framework and methodology to facilitate the incorporation of large, online data sets into traditional CS1 and CS2 courses. The goal of our project is to develop a way to provide students a library that relieves them from low-level issues of reading and parsing raw data from web-based data sources and that interfaces with data structures and representations defined by students themselves. In addition, the library requires minimal syntactic overhead to use its functionality and allows students and instructors to focus on algorithmic exercises involving processing live and large data obtained from the Internet. At a minimum, the library should serve to create drop-in replacements for traditional programming exercises in introductory courses - raising the engagement level by having students deal with "real" data rather than artificial data provided through standard input.
