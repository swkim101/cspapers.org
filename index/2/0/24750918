Robotic walkers are a particular class of devices used to assist users with physical or cognitive impairments in their navigation of large public spaces. In this context, a guidance mechanism is a controller that steers the user towards the desired path when he/she deviates. Passive guidance mechanisms do not directly propel the vehicle and leave the user in control of his/her walk. The inherent safety of passive guidance and the intuitive behaviour of the device make this class of solutions preferable to any other for robot assisted walking. The possible ways to obtain a passive behaviour in robotic walkers either require complex and expensive sensors or generate potentially rough (bang-bang) manoeuvres that are detrimental to the user's comfort. The contribution of this work is a path following controller that simulates passivity using a pair of active motors operating on the rear wheels of the walker. The system estimates and tracks the velocity desired by the user and the motors generate a rotational torque only when a turn toward the path is required. The proposed solution delivers high levels of comfort, does not rely on expensive hardware and preserves all the important properties of a passive mechanism.
