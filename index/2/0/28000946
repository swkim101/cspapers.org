To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference, three distinguished colleagues have been invited to present both an historical perspective on the evolution of CAD for electronic systems over the past twenty-five years, and their view of where our industry is headed in the years to come. Each of the speakers has had a major influence on the development of electronic design automation technology. While each speaker has been asked to present a global view, their comments will be colored by their own regional experiences and emphasis.
