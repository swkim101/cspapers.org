This paper presents the design and implementation of a biologically inspired four legged walking robot, with a certain level of comparable complexities and similarities to its biological counterpart. A four-phase walking strategy inspired from four legged animals has been proposed and implemented in the robot. Four parallel Subsumption Architectures and a simple Central Pattern Generator are used in the robot for physical implementation. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot employs the proposed walking strategy and can successfully carry out its walking behaviours under various experimental terrain conditions, such as flat ground, incline, decline and uneven ground.
