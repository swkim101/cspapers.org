We present HapticDrone, a concept to generate controllable and comparable force feedback for direct haptic interaction with a drone. As a proof-of-concept study this paper focuses on creating haptic feedback only in 1D direction. To this end, an encountered-type, safe and un-tethered haptic display is implemented. An overview of the system and details on how to control the force output of drones is provided. Our current prototype generates forces up to 1.53 N upwards and 2.97 N downwards. This concept serves as a first step towards introducing drones as mainstream haptic devices.
