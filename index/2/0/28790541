As mobile devices evolve, end users have ever increasing demand for ubiquitous network access. WiFi, being now commonplace, has the potential to fulfill this demand. Apart from WiFi hotspots deployed by ISPs, home users start showing interest in sharing bandwidth with others (e.g. Fon bases its business model on users sharing open access points.) However, all existing WiFi sharing approaches are unsecured due to the difficulty of distributing access keys, discouraging potential users.
 Meanwhile, social networking provides a large scale, well established social graph, which is an attractive candidate for authentication services. Previous work on social networks as authentication mechanisms such as Social WiFi requires users to first register with a third-party server through an open Access Point (AP), which adds an unneeded step to the process, and complicates user management at the third-party.
 Our Social Network-Enabled EAP method (SNEAP) integrates the authentication services in social networks with the widely-adopted EAP framework. In addition, the extensibility of EAP and our software-based solution allow easy incremental deployment, and our chosen platform offers broad hardware compatibility.
