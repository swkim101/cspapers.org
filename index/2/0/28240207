Usability testing is often employed for evaluating user interfaces. Rosenbaum (1989) stated that usability evaluators require both an in-depth understanding of experimental design and methodology, and familiarity with an existing body of literature in human factors and usability. While many people, particularly in the social sciences, meet the first criteria, few have combined their experimental methodology training with human factors training. Psychologists and other social scientists without human factors training are, therefore, often hired to conduct usability tests. The accuracy of these observers, and the factors that affect observer performance in usability testing are unknown. A study was conducted to examine trainee observer performance in usability testing. Two factors that may affect observer performance, obviousness of usability problems and prior knowledge of problems, were examined.
