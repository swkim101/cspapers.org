The automotive industry stands on the threshold of a new opportunity - an opportunity that stems from the reinvention of the automobile using a new DNA that exchanges the internal combustion engine, petroleum, and mechanical linkages for fuel cells and batteries, hydrogen and electricity, and electronic systems and controls. Electrically driven vehicles and the introduction of advanced electronics and connected vehicle technologies will revolutionize how our vehicles operate, how we interact with them, and how they communicate with each other and the outside world. These new technologies will also, importantly, dramatically change how automobiles are designed and built. In this talk, Dr. Burns will highlight why the new automotive DNA will be paradigm shifting for the industry and address the design challenges and opportunities presented by the requirement for new electrical and electronics-based architectures, systems, and software for our vehicles.
