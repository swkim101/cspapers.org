We introduce X60, the first SDR-based testbed for 60 GHz WLANs, featuring fully programmable MAC/PHY/Network layers, multi-Gbps rates, and a user-configurable 12-element phased antenna array. These features provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to revisit the most important aspects of 60 GHz signal propagation and obtain new insights on performance expected from practical 60 GHz systems. X60's unique capabilities make it an ideal platform for experimentation and prototyping across layers.
