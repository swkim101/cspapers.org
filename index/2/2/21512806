In practice, datasources often contain sensitive information that the data owners want to keep inaccessible to users. In this paper, we formalize and study the problem of determining whether a given data integration system discloses a source query to an attacker. We consider disclosure on a particular dataset, and also whether a schema admits a dataset on which disclosure occurs. We provide lower and upper bounds on disclosure analysis, in the process introducing a number of techniques for analyzing logical privacy issues in ontology-based data integration.
