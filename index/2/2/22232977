Purpose: Participation in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest has steadily grown over the past several years, to the point where nearly 600 teams from all over the world annually enter the sixteen regional competitions. How institutions prepare teams for the regional contests vary flom school to school; only in the last few years have universities started to formally exchange information concerning their organizational methods. This tutorial discusses how it is done at two specific universities. There are always benefits from healthy competition in all fields. In particular, preparing and participating in an event such as an ACM Regional Contest should first and foremost be a learning experience which contributes to the growth of all individuals involved. Specifically, organizing for and competing in a programming contest can greatly improve the students' problem solving skills, their ability to communicate, their capabilities in working within a small team, and their capacity to develop and use test data, among other things. Target Audience: The tutorial is intended both for schools who have not previously competed but are considering doing so, and for institutions currently participating who wish to improve the quality of their preparations for the contest. Audience participation will be encouraged.
