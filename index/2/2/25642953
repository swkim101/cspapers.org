Preserving social Web datasets is a crucial part of research work for disaster management based on information from social media. This paper describes the Michinoku Shinrokuden disaster archive project, mainly dedicated to archiving data from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and its aftermath. Social websites should of course be part of this archive. We discuss issues in archiving social websites for the disaster management research communities and introduce our vision for Michinoku Shinrokuden.
