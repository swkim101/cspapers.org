This paper presents a new algorithm for the approximate analysis of closed product-form queueing networks with fixed-rate, delay (infinite-server), and load-dependent queues. This algorithm has the accuracy, speed, small memory requirements, and simplicity necessary for inclusion in a general network analysis package. The algorithm allows networks with large numbers of queues, job classes, and populations to be analyzed interactively even on microcomputers with very limited memory.
