The standard procedure for diagnosing lung cancer involves D computed tomography CT assessment followed by interventional bronchoscopy In general the physician has no link between the CT assessment results and the follow on bronchoscopy Thus the physician essentially performs bronchoscopic biopsy of suspect cancer sites blindly We have devised a computer based system that greatly augments the physician s vision during bronchoscopy The system uses techniques from computer graphics and com puter vision to enable detailed D CT procedure plan ning and follow on image guided bronchoscopy The procedure plan is directly linked to the bronchoscope procedure through a live fusion of the D CT data and bronchoscopic video During a procedure the physician receives considerable visual feedback on how to maneuver the bronchoscope and where to insert the biopsy needle We have performed a series of con trolled phantom and animal tests in addition to using the system on a large number of human lung cancer patients Results indicate that not only is the varia tion in skill level between di erent physicians greatly reduced but that their accuracy increases
