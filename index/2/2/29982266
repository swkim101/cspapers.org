Many CS1 courses lack a breadth in coverage of computing-related topics and do not actively engage in non-programming computer science topics. In addition, many introductory (and advanced) courses fail to help students develop oral communication skills. In this paper, we describe our experience with addressing these issues in CS1 courses at two different institutions through the use of brief, daily student presentations. Not only can this help recruitment and retention, but it helps to develop more well-rounded students. We also describe the results of a survey students take before and after the course to evaluate how participating in the course can affect attitudes and beliefs about computer science.
