The demo is focused on the implementation of ARP-Path (a.k.a. FastPath) bridges, a recently proposed concept for low latency bridges. ARP-Path Bridges rely on the race between broadcast ARP Request packets, to discover the minimum latency path to the destination host. Several implementations (in Omnet++, Linux, OpenFlow, NetFPGA) have shown that ARP-Path exhibits loop-freedom, does not block links, is fully transparent to hosts and neither needs a spanning tree protocol to prevent loops nor a link state protocol to obtain low latency paths. This demo compares our hardware implementation on NetFPGA to bridges running STP, showing that ARP-Path finds lower latency paths than STP.
