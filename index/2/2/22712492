Among the technical issues of electromagnetic compatibility for multiple antenna devices, determining the maximum specific absorption rate (SAR) is a challenging work because it is complicated and time-consuming. The SAR should be reported in term of the peak spatial-average SAR, which is determined by a plane measurement (area scan) and a volume measurement (zoom scan). For multiple antenna devices, the maximum local SAR in different measurement planes may correspond to different sets of relative phases of the sources, thus resulting in different volume measurements. This paper presents analyses on the maximum local SAR for a such device in different measurement planes, and suggest a simple and reasonable procedure to determine the spatial-average SAR.
