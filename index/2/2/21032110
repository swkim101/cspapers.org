Recently, ultra-wideband (UWB) is one of the most attractive technologies in communications. UWB communication systems are designed to intent to low power, low cost, and low complexity devices. However, costly high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is required to convert RF/IF signals to digital form for subsequent baseband processing in UWB system. By exploiting sparse property of UWB signal, using compressive sensing (CS) to reduce the sampling rate is a perspective approach. In this paper, we propose a UWB communications system using compressive sensing combined with time-hopping (TH) pulse position modulation (PPM) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), called CS-TH-UWB. This system is designed aims to reduce the sampling rate of the origin UWB system. CS technique possesses capability to implement under Nyquist sampling rate at transmitter side. At the receiver side, the under Nyquist rate samples are reconstructed with an acceptable loss. The simulation of this system is carried out to evaluate the BER of CS-TH-UWB. The results show that at low compression ratio of sampling rate, the different in BER performance is negligible. The higher compression ratio is the more degradation of BER performance.
