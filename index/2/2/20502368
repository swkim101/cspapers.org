We present a global controller for tracking nominal trajectories with a flying wing tailsitter vehicle. The control strategy is based on a first-principles model of the vehicle dynamics that captures all relevant aerodynamic effects, and we apply an onboard parameter learning scheme in order to estimate unknown aerodynamic parameters. A cascaded control architecture is used: Based on position and velocity errors an outer control loop computes a desired attitude keeping the vehicle in coordinated flight, while an inner control loop tracks the desired attitude using a lookup table with precomputed optimal attitude trajectories. The proposed algorithms can be implemented on a typical microcontroller and the performance is demonstrated in various experiments.
