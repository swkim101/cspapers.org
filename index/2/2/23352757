A Frequency Reuse algorithm which divides the users into two groups called Cell-Center Users (CCUs) and Cell-Edge Users (CEUs) is one of the most effective techniques that can mitigate the InterCell Interference as well as improve the spectrum efficiency in cellular networks. In literature, most of work on Strict Frequency Reuse algorithms in a Spatial Point Poisson network assumed that the reuse factor was 1 and there was either single user or single Resource Block (RB). Hence, the performance either CEU or CCU was discussed. In this paper, the performance of both types of users as well as total throughput of CEUs and CCUs are investigated. The analytical results indicate that most of users in Tier-1 are served as CCUs while the numbers of UEUs and CCUs in Tier-2 are similar.
