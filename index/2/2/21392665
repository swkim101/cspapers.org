In our quest to modernize our CS1/CS2 curriculum, we ran into several problems in the effective delivery of the courses and their associated laboratories. We have developed a teaching model in which students become the presenters for the hands-on laboratories. In order for this approach to be effective, the laboratories must be reused from semester to semester, so that student presenters are truly knowledgeable. The student-presenter model also requires more detailed supporting material and a rethinking of course grading policies.
