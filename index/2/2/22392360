This paper proposes a mechanism and a control system for a wire mobile robot with a multi-unit structure The mobile robot has an ultrasonic sensing system for environment recognition enabling it to move autonomously With this mechanism, control and sensing system, the robot can transfer to a branch wire and avoid obstacles on the wire This paper first clarifies the design of a mechanism and a method for avoiding obstacles and transferring the robot to a branch wire Then it shows experimental results using a prototype of mobile robot with an ultrasonic sensing system
