In most modern electronic systems production test consumes money and schedule time in significant amounts. Since production test is where conflicts between design, physical reality and the equipment specification must be resolved, any design automation approach must include this consideration at inception. Those responsible for the design of test equipment and test planning must react positively to Design Automation to benefit from its disciplined availability of information.
 A simplified structure of the Engineering/Production Test interrelation is shown on page 2. Engineering releases equipment information to Test Engineering similarly to fabrication information to the shop. Test Engineering prepares facilities and software for use by Production Test in the actual testing.
