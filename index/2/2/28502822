Java is an ideal language for developing embedded applications. However, most Java implementations and tools were designed for workstations and have limitations due to that heritage. Special tools are required to support deployment and effect better integration with target hardware. This talk will be in two parts. The first part will provide an overview of pervasive computing with a special focus on embedded Java, and described typical applications drawn from several different market segments. The second half will delve more deeply into the architecture of an embedded Java runtime and discuss technical issues relating to dynamic compilation, optimization, and deployment.
