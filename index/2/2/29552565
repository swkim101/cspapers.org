With recent advancements in smartphone digital camera technology, the opportunity to integrate computer vision into daily activities has become possible. A unique application of computer vision is ESPN's use of K-Zone during Major League Baseball broadcasts, which uses a combination of three cameras and multiple computers running sophisticated algorithms, to track a thrown baseball to within 2/5ths of an inch. While the sophistication of the K-Zone hardware and software allows for a high degree of accuracy, there is the potential for obtaining similar results using only a smartphone. The Mobile Video Velocity Estimation (MoVVE) project investigated the application of computer vision in the development of a speed-tracking app on a smartphone. This presentation will describe the design of the MoVVE software which uses OpenCV computer vision library functions to track the velocity and location of objects such as a thrown baseball using video obtained from a mobile digital camera. MoVVE was shown to successfully detect and track the baseball with a success rate greater than 90%. Baseball velocity estimates obtained with MoVVE were compared to those measured using a professional grade radar gun. For a test population of 112 pitches, 84% of the program's estimated velocities agreed to within 10% of the radar gun measurement, and 43% agreed to within 5%. Test pitch velocities varied from 30 mph to 60 mph with the program showing equal accuracy throughout the full range.
