The Context Aware Mobile Platform for Uniformed Security (CAMPUS) system was developed with the aim of using ambient intelligence and mobile communications to information sources as an aid to field security and law enforcement personnel. The system is centered on a context aware information distribution framework and a client operating on a head mounted display. The system allows field service personnel to receive information relevant to their current operations, review information from sensors, and communicate with colleagues while remaining vigilant during security and law enforcement operations. Sensor integration and mapping technologies are the key elements in provisioning of appropriate information services.
