This paper describes an original method for introducing linear recurrence relations. Boolean expressions are represented by binary trees and the counting of the internal nodes of these trees yield linear recurrence relations. The method allows the students to create their own family of Boolean expressions, to draw the corresponding binary trees, to deduce the recurrence relation representing the number of nodes in the trees, and finally, to solve and check the solutions of these relations.
