However, optimum interactions are not always achieved. Automated systems improve the quality of work performed and the safety of human operators by reducing the risk of errors and decrease the level of effort and stress during the operation. However, the benefits of automation may not always be realized, and work performance is inconsistently influenced by different types, levels, and degrees of automation [1,2]. In addition, an indiscrete and excessive dependence of automation, sometimes, allows easily involving secondary tasks and making to neglect monitoring and follow-up steps in a primary task [3]. Furthermore, it may interfere with the skill acquisition without automation.
