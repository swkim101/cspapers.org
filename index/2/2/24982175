In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing the control ROM width which is very important in the design of microprogrammed processors, because it directly reduces the silicon area of the control unit. In earlier works, only exhaustive enumeration procedures could lead to optimal results as this problem is NP-complete. We propose a heuristic algorithm based on graph partitioning. This algorithm results in nearly optimal solutions with the time complexity of O(n310gn) where n denotes the number of distinct microoperations. Comparison of the results with earlier works has shown that the proposed heuristic performs better than earlier works[7,8] in terms of cost andor CPU time.
