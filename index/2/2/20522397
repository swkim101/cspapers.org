The HTML5 specification introduces the audio and video media elements, and with them the opportunity to change the way media is integrated on the web. The current HTML5 media API provides ways to play and get limited information about audio and video, but no way to programatically access or create such media. In this paper we present an enhanced API for these media elements, as well as details about a Mozilla Firefox implementation created by the authors, which allows web developers to read and write raw audio data.
