Early discussion regarding a talk at the First-Timers Luncheon highlighted the opportunity for an oldtimer to welcome first timers, encourage participation, and provide perspectives.
 Throughout my career, I have been privileged to be able to connect my personal career with activities for the broad, educational-computing community. This talk reflects on factors that have impacted both my own career and the evolution of broader groups --- particularly SIGCSE.
 Some general principles (e.g., inclusion, respect, service and social responsibility) seem clear, but even then circumstances present challenges and contradictions. Other principles (e.g., encouraging creative brainstorming, utilizing serendipity, listening to people) may be less obvious, but equally vital.
 Many have described the SIGCSE community as a professional family, and this talk seeks to celebrate that community as promotes a vision for fulfilling personal careers and continued organizational development.
