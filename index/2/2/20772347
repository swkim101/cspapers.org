We have retained many of the aspects that have made the Doctoral Consortium a successful and popular event in the past, including the participation of world-class UbiComp researchers from academia and industry to serve as faculty panelists, and the opportunity for students who are approaching the later stages of their PhDs to receive direct feedback on their completed and remaining research. In addition this year’s Doctoral Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page. To copy otherwise, or republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists, requires prior specific permission and/or a fee. Elaine M.
