This paper reports on an NSF-grant supported summer workshop that brought music and computer science students together for eight weeks to explore creative projects in digital sound production. The dynamics of the students' collaborations were observed as they crafted experimental projects weaving together music, theatre production, sampled digital audio, and MIDI. Moving among various levels of abstraction, the students found practical and artistic motivations to learn the science of digital sound. The projects they produced suggest ways to revitalize computer science courses by linking science, art, and practice through digital sound, a subject naturally interesting to students.
