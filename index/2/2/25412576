This interactive workshop focuses on the National Science Foundation grant proposal review process. By a close examination of the review process, participants gain an understanding of how to write good reviews and how to improve their own proposal writing. The topics for the workshop include: the proposal review process from submission to award or decline; elements of a good review; NSF merit criteria (intellectual merit and broader impacts); elements of good proposals; the format of the typical review panel process; how to volunteer to review.
 The workshop uses a structured guided-interactive approach to lead participants through each topic by introducing related issues, engaging participants in group exercises designed to explore and share their understanding of the issues, and then providing some expert opinion on these issues.
 Faculty members who wish to better understand the NSF review process or seek funding in support of undergraduate computing education are encouraged to attend. Participants will include novice proposal writers and those with more experience who seek to improve their proposal writing or reviewing skills.
