One of the main challenges in large-scale data integration for relational schemas is creating an accurate mediated schema, and generating accurate semantic mappings between heterogeneous data sources and this mediated schema. Some applications can start with a moderately accurate mediated schema and mappings and refine them over time, which is referred to as the pay-as-you-go approach to data integration. Creating the mediated schema and mappings automatically to bootstrap the pay-as-you-go approach has been extensively studied. However, refining the mediated schema and mappings is still an open challenge because the data sources are usually heterogeneous and use diverse and sometimes ambiguous vocabularies. In this paper, we introduce UFeed, a system that refines relational mediated schemas and mappings based on user feedback over query answers. UFeed translates user actions into refinement operations that are applied to the mediated schema and mappings to improve their quality. We experimentally verify that UFeed improves the quality of query answers over real heterogeneous data sources extracted from the web.
