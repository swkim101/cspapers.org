Robot software controllers are often concurrent and time critical, and requires modern engineering approaches for validation and verification. With this motivation, we have developed a tool and techniques for graphical modelling with support for automatic generation of underlying mathematical definitions for model checking. It is possible to check automatically both general properties, like absence of deadlock, and specific application properties. We cater both for timed and untimed modelling and verification. Our approach has been tried in examples used in a variety of robotic applications.
