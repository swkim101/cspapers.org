The rapid proliferation of microcomputers in higher education for uses which vary from process and instrumentation control to computer aided instruction has caused many universities and state coordinating agencies to reevaluate their master plans for computing. This panel will discuss these issues and offer insight into possible solutions to some of the most common problems facing present and potential users of this technology.
 The use of microcomputers in the classroom and methods of acquisition utilized by a private university will be the concern of Dr. Pitts. Comparisons of the acquisition process between a large state institution with which he was recently affiliated and the private university will be emphasized.
 A different approach to the acquisition process and microcomputer utilization will be presented by Dr. Newman.
