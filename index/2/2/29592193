Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is a standardization program by which two heterogeneous computer systems located anywhere in the world will be able to exchange information easily by executing mutually agreed standardized protocols. The term "open" refers to the use of publicly standardized protocols by all manufacturers and networks rather than the private protocols used within each of their closed communities.
 The OSI approach has been adopted by all the major information systems standardization bodies in the world, including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Consultative Committee for International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT), the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS).
 The necessary standardized protocols are currently under intensive development throughout the world, principally in Europe, the United States and Japan. This activity will lead to the universal interconnection of the information systems of the world by the end of the 1980s.
