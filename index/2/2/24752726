Description FoodSmart T M is an open source, commercial grade application for recipe management and grocery list development. It was designed to show people how to build large, distributed object systems. The system includes over 94 domain objects. In addition to the FoodSmart application, the demo will access design patterns that were developed as part of writing the application. Viewers can see a complete system from design issue documentation to source code plus explanation to the actual application. FoodSmart was based on a 5 tier conceptual framework presentation, application, services, domain and persistence. The application uses 9 major technologies-Java script, HTML, JSP, EJB, JNDI, Persistent Cache Architecture TM, JDBC, and RDBMS. In addition, FoodSmart was designed to allow 4 architectural variants with two persistence (object and relational) modes. Supporting FoodSmart are multiple design patterns that address key issues in distributed object design such as use of a service-based architecture, short versus long transactions, object state distribution, scaling techniques and object to relational mapping. FoodSmart is the first available application that considers these issues in relationship to each other, providing developers with code and rules of thumb that will work in a highly scalable system.
