Two events have encouraged computer science departments to incorporate ethical issues and professional responsibilities into their curriculum. The first was the formation of the Computer Sciences Accreditation Board (CSAB) and the second was the publication of Computing Curricula 1991. In the CSAB criteria for accrediting programs in computer science [2], is the requirement that social and ethical implications of computing be included in computer science programs. The Computing Curricula 1991 states that "students must understand the basic cultural, social, legal and ethical issues inherent in ... computing" [7]. This article contains a description of one approach to teaching the social, ethical and legal implications of computing.
