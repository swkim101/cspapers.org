In this paper we describe the autonomous behavior control architecture of SDR-4X, which serves to integrate multi-modal recognition and motion control technologies. We overview the entire software architecture of SDR-4X, which is composed of perception, short and long term memory, behavior control, and motion control parts. Regarding autonomous behavior control, we further focus on issues such as spontaneous behavior generation using a homeostasis regulation mechanism, and a behavior control/selection mechanism with tree-structured situated behavior modules. In the autonomous behavior control architecture, we achieve three basic requirements, which are the concurrent evaluation of the situation of each behavior module, concurrent execution of multiple behavior modules, and preemption (behavior interruption/resume capability). Using the autonomous behavior control architecture described, we demonstrate that SDR-4X can spontaneously and passively interact with a human.
