The need for data structure analysis of OSI protocols has increased with the development of OSI protocols into Application layer protocols which require a wide variety of data structures. Especially, when using high speed networks such as FDDI and B-ISDN. Application data processing is liable to be the critical performance factor in the communications based on the OSI frameworks. This paper presents a data processing model to analyze the performance of the Application data receiving process in the Presentation layer. The model is based on a finite pushdown automaton. A scheme is proposed that can determine the memory space and processing time needed by the receiving process for any type of data structure. Consequently, an evaluation method is developed for Application protocols data structures in OSI. The method is then used to evaluate sample data structures commonly used for document transmission.
