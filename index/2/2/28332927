Khan Academy recently announced that they will soon be teaching introductory Computer Science topics with the Processing.js language and an interactive, web-based code editor. At UNC Asheville, we have been using a similar pedagogical approach for over a year. Specifically, we have integrated Processing.js into our introductory course for non-majors by building an open-source, web-based editor which makes it easy for students to edit, save and share their Processing.js sketches. This workshop offers a hands-on introduction to Processing.js and our editor. Participants will also be given an overview of the programming module in Creative Computing, our recently re-imagined CS0 course. Curious individuals with a laptop, a modern web-browser and some basic programming experience are welcome.
