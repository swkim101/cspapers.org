Answer selection for question answering is a challenging task, since it requires effective capture of the complex semantic relations between questions and answers. Previous remarkable approaches mainly adopt general Compare-Aggregate framework that performs word-level comparison and aggregation. In this paper, unlike previous Compare-Aggregate models which utilize the traditional attention mechanism to generate corresponding word-level vector before comparison, we propose a novel attention mechanism named Dynamic-Clip Attention which is directly integrated into the Compare-Aggregate framework. Dynamic-Clip Attention focuses on filtering out noise in attention matrix, in order to better mine the semantic relevance of word-level vectors. At the same time, different from previous Compare-Aggregate works which treat answer selection task as a pointwise classification problem, we propose a listwise ranking approach to model this task to learn the relative order of candidate answers. Experiments on TrecQA and WikiQA datasets show that our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
