This short note describes research into the application of AI techniques to the analysis of cinecardioangiograms. These are X-ray films of the heart taken while a radiopaque dye is injected into the heart cavity. The film shows the opacified blood inside the left ventricle, thus outlining the inside wall of the cavity. The problem is to build a knowledge base which can guide the analysis of the motion of the walls in these films, determine the various parameters which physicians use in their diagnoses and recognize abnormalities of heart wall motion.
