What does a University typically characterize as its “professional” degree programs? Engineering, nursing, business, education; in graduate programs, certainly medicine and law. Why are these “professional” programs when other degree programs are not? One reason is that the “professional” programs fall under the jurisdiction of separate accreditation bodies. This usually occurs because of a licensing requirement to practice that profession, meant to safeguard the public’s health or well-being by assuring quality standards in the training and performance of the professionaL Also implicit in professional degree programs is that the student is intending to seek employment as a practicing professional. Should computer science be considered a professional degree program? It does have an accrediting agency, and there is no doubt that, given society’s increased dependence upon computer systems, an assurance to the public of quality training is appropriate, More concretely, it is also the case that most computer science majors intend to seek employment as practicing computer scientists. This alone should be stilcient to consider providing the students with some insights into professionalism in their intended field of employment. This paper describes a course intended to tilI this roll. The next section gives a course overview, and sections 3-6 describe parts of the course in more detail. Section 7 is a brief conclusion. An extensive bibliography is included.
