Envy of another person's assignment is ``justified'' if you ``deserve'' the object and it is possible to assign you to the object. Currently, the literature only considers whether or not the agent deserves the object and ignores whether or not assigning her to it is possible. This paper defines a fair set of assignments in terms of what is possible. We prove that a fair set of assignments has the same properties as the set of stable matches: the Lattice Theorem, Decomposition Lemma, and Rural Hospital Theorem all hold. Moreover, there is a unique, student-optimal fair assignment: the assignment made by Kesten's Efficiency Adjusted Deferred Acceptance mechanism when all students consent.
