Whether we like it or not, college administrations and students are increasingly looking for online courses. K-12 schools are increasingly using online content and blending it with standard content. One of the bridges for us between traditional course delivery and online delivery is the blended course. This approach seems well suited to computer science, which often requires work in labs or with specialized equipment or software. It takes the approach of reversing that which is traditionally lecture and assignments, making classes more interactive and students less passive. This poster seeks input on a blended implementation of CS1 and a subsequent SoTL project to test the effectiveness of offering this course in a blended format.
