In this paper, we describe an experiment designed to test the effect of a novel first day lecture on student attitudes toward programming. The lecture does not require any knowledge of a specific language or a specific paradigm. Student evaluation surveys indicate that the lecture is effective at helping students to see programming as more than the simple creation of an artifact but rather as a systematic problem-solving process.
