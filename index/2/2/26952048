Interpolation is a technique for obtaining new unknown data points within the range of discrete known data points. In this paper we propose a new single image interpolation technique for Super resolution and demonstrate its effectiveness for aerial images. The proposed approach is a fast hybrid method of switching between covariance based interpolation technique and curvature based interpolation technique. The two interpolation techniques are applied on the basis of edges and smooth areas. The proposed algorithm has shown encouraging results in terms of visual quality and processing time.
