Components of the machine-readable dictionary can be applied in a number of information systems. The most direct applications of the kind are in wordprocessing or in "writingsupport" systems built on a wordprocessing base. However, because a central function of any dictionary is in fact data verification, there are other proposed applications in communications and data storage and retrieval systems. Moreover, the complete interrelational electronic dictionary is in some sense the model of the language; and there are, accordingly, additional implications for language-based information search and retrieval.
