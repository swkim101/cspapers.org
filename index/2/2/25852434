In the decade since Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing (MIT Press, 2002) was published, educational institutions have coalesced around the mission of increasing women's participation in computing. Yet, despite the uptick of interest in computer science majors and the surge of technology shaping all aspects of our lives, the numbers of women majoring in computer science are still abysmally small. In this talk, I will further reflect on why this is the case, and make connections to the issues raised in Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing---the underrepresentation in computer science of students of color. I will examine how underrepresentation in computing relates to the larger educational crisis in this country and issues we face as world citizens. This talk is part of an overarching mission to understand how inequality is produced in this country and the types of social action required to equalize opportunities and broaden participation in computing.
