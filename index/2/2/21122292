This paper is a general description of a system of Computer programs which perform all the routine functions, normally performed by an Engineer, encountered in designing and selecting the materials for a structural steel building from basic geometric and load data.
 The basic sequence of operations performed by the Engineer are:
 1. Establish the geometry of the building.
 2. Determine the loads to be supported.
 3. Determine the lengths and location of each member in the building.
 4. Distribute the loads to each member in the building.
 5. Determine the interaction of the member loads to other members.
 6. Combine loads and determine the maximum load and its location on each member.
 7. Determine the strength required for each member using its maximum load.
 8. Select the lightest commercially available steel hape which meets the strength requirements.
 Until recently only step 5 and sometimes 6 were accomplished on the computer. The MIT “STRESS” and the IBM “FRAN” are good examples of this type of program.
