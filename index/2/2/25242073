Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) is a method for studying the chemical properties of molecules with unpaired electrons. It is the most accurate method for measuring oxygen and oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Its application in clinical contexts is challenging because of the lack of standardized procedures for estimating the measurement quality. Clinically-relevant quantities are extracted from the amplitude, linewidth and resonance value of the EPR spectrum based on a model of the signal. In this manuscript, we study the Lorentz lineshape model in the derivative limit and propose Maximum Likelihood Estimates as well as formulas for the expected relative error. We validate the results with simulated spectra and a controlled in vitro dataset. The computed relative error is shown to be a good estimate of the observed instrumental variation.
