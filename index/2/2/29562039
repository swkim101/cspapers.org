For latent semantic modeling, a neural generative model called Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) is employed to describe the observed sentences and the corresponding latent semantic representations. Neural variational inference is used for the posterior inference of the latent variables. For salience estimation, we propose an unsupervised data reconstruction framework, which jointly considers the reconstruction for latent semantic space and observed term vector space. Therefore, we can capture the salience of sentences from these two different and complementary vector spaces. Thereafter, the VAEs-based latent semantic model is integrated into the sentence salience estimation component in a unified fashion, and the whole framework can be trained jointly by back-propagation via multi-task learning. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets DUC and TAC show that our framework achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models.
