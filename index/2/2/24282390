ISDN is an acronym for Integrated Services Digital Network. ISDN embodies world-wide standards that will engender the technology necessary to weave the fabric of a global communications network and provide the foundation for information age services. Siemens has a cost effective ISDN introduction strategy that will allow ISDN to interwork with existing switching systems, current transmission networks, and nonproprietary Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), as well as to interface with operational and administration systems. This strategy also entails the development of ISDN terminals, terminal adapters and service capabilities so that the end user can quickly realize the benefits of ISDN. Siemens is forming partnerships with Bell Operating Telephone Companies, like Wisconsin Bell Telephone Co., to perform market research of the end users to better determine their ISDN needs and applications. ISDN architecture is briefly discussed to provide a basis for some examples on how ISDN and network components can be combined to meet customer needs.
