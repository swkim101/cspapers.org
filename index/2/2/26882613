Many computer science departments have chosen to hire faculty to teach in a teaching-track position that parallels the standard tenure-track position. These teaching-track positions include the possibility for promotion, longer-term contracts, and greater pay as demonstrated by excellence in teaching, educational material development, and service. As this type of position has been growing rapidly in popularity, CS departments have been developing the expectations and responsibilities for such faculty almost ad hoc, creating policies that can be vastly different similarly-named positions at other universities. This birds-of-a- feather is designed to gather educators who are currently in such a position to share their experiences as members of the faculty of their departments and schools, and to provide opportunities for schools considering such positions to gather information. In past sessions, we have laid the groundwork for keeping this community together through online discussions and consolidating information about teaching-track positions at various universities together into an online database.
