I attended a meeting last month to help organize a national industry/defense symposium and we were considering possible names for a keynoter. One of the industry representatives threw us a challenge that I have attempted to take to heart. He said it didn't make too much difference who was keynoter and asked if any one of us could think of a single occasion when we were particularly inspired by or learned very much from a keynote address. He got no takers, probably not so much because we couldn't think of any, but because his question was somewhat startling. Nevertheless, there's a moral there someplace. I would like, therefore, to avoid somewhat the expected role of keynoter. Rather than set a theme, I will try to make you more aware of some of the downstream effects of design automation, and, hopefully, more conscious of the tremendous opportunity you have for using this awesome new marriage of the computer and the design process to benefit not only the design process itself, but the myriad of functions that follow in production, test, supply, maintenance, operation, and so forth. At the same time, I will grind my own particular ax, Defense Technical Data Management and Standardization.
