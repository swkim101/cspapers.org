This paper describes the Transformable HOvering Rotorcraft (THOR), a prototype Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that explores a novel approach in combining the range and speed of a horizontal flying platform with the hovering and maneuverability of a rotor-wing. This is achieved by integrating a tailless flying wing configuration with a single-axis rotor, or monocopter. By maintaining full utilization of all aerodynamic surfaces and propulsion sources in both flight modes, this method represents the most structurally efficient approach to achieving a cruising mode and a hovering mode on the same frame. Using a dual servo and motor configuration, we propose an under-actuated system that is able to achieve controllability in 4 degrees of freedom while in its horizontal cruising mode and in 5 degrees of freedom while in its hovering mode. In both indoor and outdoor experiments, the UAV is able to transition between either flight modes seamlessly and repeatedly without the need for any additional mechanisms and actuators.
