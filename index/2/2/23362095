Let's talk about how we teach upper-division courses! CS pedagogical content knowledge - i.e., knowledge of how to teach computer science - is mostly undocumented. This is particularly true for upper-division courses and in some cases this upper-division content is much more difficult to teach than CS1 or CS2 content! CSTeachingTips.org is an NSF-sponsored project to help curate tips that allow teachers to anticipate students' difficulties and build upon students' strengths. The lightning talk will be a call to action: first to share tips on Twitter @CSTeachingTips and at our CSTeachingTips booth and second to create research directions that will help us develop pedagogical content knowledge that extends beyond CS1.
