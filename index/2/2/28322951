Apparatus for holding a camera and flash unit so they are separated from one another, including a frame having an upper portion for holding the flash unit and a lower portion for holding the camera, and having a pair of laterally spaced handles near the lower portion. The handles are oriented so they can be held comfortably at slightly below eye level with the upper arms extending down and braced against the body and the forearms extending upwardly. One of the handles forms a palm pad lying under the camera so that the right hand can hold the pad in the palm while the thumb and middle or forefinger rest on the camera lens to turn it for focusing, or rest on the aperture ring for changing the lens opening. The other handle, which receives the left hand, is in the form of a bar which is angled from the vertical so it can be held without cramping the photographer's hand at the wrist.
