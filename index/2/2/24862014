The aim of the paper is an improved mathematical model of Linear Switched Reluctance Motor including the effect of magnetic nonlinearities. The starting point for the model is the variation of the flux linkage with the current. This variation is analytically described using Fourier series. The final step is reserved to predict the dynamic performances of the LSRM. An analysis and comparison of these methods is performed.
