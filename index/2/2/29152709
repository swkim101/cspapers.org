We present a novel framework for augmenting data sets for

machine learning based on counterexamples. Counterexamples

are misclassified examples that have 

important properties for retraining and improving the model.

Key components of our framework include a \textit{counterexample generator},

which produces data items that are misclassified by the model and

error tables, a novel data

structure that stores information pertaining to misclassifications.

Error tables can be used to explain the model's

vulnerabilities and are used to efficiently generate counterexamples for augmentation.

We show the efficacy of the proposed framework by comparing it

to classical augmentation techniques on a case study of object detection in autonomous

driving based on deep neural networks.
