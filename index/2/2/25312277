The paper presents a compact coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed ultra-wideband (UWB) printed antenna with a dual band rejection. Implemented with developed fractal structures-based Koch shape, the proposed antenna uses a complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) etched into a single layer to obtain the dual band-notched function. Also integrated with a new feeding method, four different antenna designs are optimized, simulated and measured. The final antenna occupies a compact area of 20 × 26.4 × 0.81 mm2 and has an impedance bandwidth of covering from 3.1GHz to 10.6 GHz for VSWR less than 2 with dual unwanted band notches of 3.3-3.6 GHz for WiMAX and 5.15-5.35 GHz for WLAN. The UWB-antennas demonstrate good omnidirectional radiation patterns in the H-plane, and bidirectional patterns in the E-plane like those of a small dipole.
