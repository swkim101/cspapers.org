This paper presents an off-board trajectory controller for a range of stride frequencies (2â€“45 Hz) that enables zero-radius turns and holonomic control on one of the smallest and fastest legged robots, the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot (HAMR). An experimental model is used as the basis for control to capture the highly nonlinear response of the robot to input signals. Closed-loop trajectories are performed with an RMS position error at or below 0.3 body lengths (BL) using gaits at speeds up to 6.5 BL/s (29.4 cm/s) for straight-line and sinusoidal trajectories.
