I will present a prototype tool that enables Java annotations to serve as an extension point for making programs more visually expressive. Thus, programmers can view and edit code in a way that more closely resembles the intention of the code, rather than the raw text. Examples that we have applied the tool to are JDBC 4.0, getters, setters and constraints, JSR 181Webservices, AspectJ, and state charts.
