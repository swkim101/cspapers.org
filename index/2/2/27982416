The search for sound principles for object-oriented languages has given rise to considerable research during the last few decades, leading to a better understanding of the key concepts of object-oriented languages and to important developments in type theory, semantics, program verification, and program development. The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussing new ideas in the foundations of object-oriented languages and provide feedback to authors. Submissions to this workshop were invited in the general area of foundations of object-oriented languages, object-oriented languages, including integration with other paradigms and extensions, such as aspects, components, and meta-programming.
