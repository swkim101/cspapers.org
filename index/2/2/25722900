We have developed education modules for topics in networking, security, and cloud computing. A networking instructor could use our modules to enhance the teaching of basic concepts by demonstrating these concepts with real experiments on GENI testbeds. Any systems instructor could use our security or cloud computing modules to begin teaching new topics, or enhance existing topics by adding hands-on experiments on GENI and CloudLab testbeds. Our NSF funded projects to develop these curricular modules have been successfully used by several instructors. Attendees at SIGCSE would comprise exactly the kind of audience, from varied institutions and dedicated to enhancing their curriculum, for whom we've built these modules. Our modules are freely available, and we are committed to helping instructors use our modules in their courses. The underlying testbeds, GENI and CloudLab, are also NSF-funded and thus freely available for instructors to use. Attendees will be provided a handout that contains relevant information, including contact for help, as they go back and begin using our education modules in their curriculum.
