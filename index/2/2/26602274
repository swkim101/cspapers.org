It is known that cognitive radio (CR) is an attractive concept to overcome the prevailing spectrum scarcity and inefficient spectrum usage. Also, with their intermittent spectral vacancies, TV white spaces offer a faster deployment potential considered with respect to cognitive radios. In this paper, system design of a high intermediate frequency (IF) to UHF frequency converter for cognitive radios have been discussed and the performance of such a converter analyzed as a proof of concept. For the design of RF front-ends, CR brings forth huge architectural challenges such as in-band local oscillator harmonics, ultra low sensitivity and high linearity. As shown in this paper, a high-IF radio front-end can successfully tackle some of these challenges. Additionally, such a high-IF converter enables white space operation for existing commercial devices by acting as frequency converters. From detailed measurements, the capabilities in both physical layer and application layer performance of a high-IF front-end developed out of off-the-shelf components is explained and is shown to provide negligible degradation to the commercial device being connected to.
