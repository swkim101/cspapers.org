An automatic theorem prover which displays a proof in natural language is described. This system proves properties of recursive programs, and constructs a proof tree corresponding to the proof. Then it translates the tree into the proof text in English by means of the tree traverse. The proof written by this system is easy to read, because the English text is placed Instead of notations of logics, and some redundant and trivial statements are disappeared.
