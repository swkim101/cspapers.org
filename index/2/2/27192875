To accelerate and simplify human activity recognition research, we have been developing a data processing tool named "HASC Tool." As the activity corpus becomes huge, it is not simple to handle the large number of files because it takes a lot of time to process. In this paper, we propose a distributed data processing mechanism which is implemented in the HASC Tool. By using the system, we can simply scale the local system into distributed processing. We also show the preliminary experimental result.
