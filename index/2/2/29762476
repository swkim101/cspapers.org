G-WHIZ is a QBE-style interface for the functional data model, with extensions that sup- port recursively defined structures such as part hierarchies. Explicit joins are rarely needed because set-valued and entity-valued functions of the functional model are supported. The recur-sive facilities are integrated with the rest of the language. G-WHIZ currently is being implemented as the user interface to a CAD/CAM DBMS.
