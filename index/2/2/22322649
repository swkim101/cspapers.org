It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First International Workshop on Hybrid Question Answering with Structured and Unstructured Knowledge (HQA) at WWW 2018. As more and more knowledge is available electronically in a structured or unstructured form over the World Wide Web, such knowledge provides a rich resource based on which both questions regarding our daily life and scientific questions posed by domain experts can be answered. To make this possibility a reality, tools that can (semi-)automatically answer questions based on a large amount of available data need to be developed.
