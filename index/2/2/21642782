Greater network latencies and swelling amount of data provide sound reason for semantic caching for multi-db environment. Properly implemented Semantic caches, provide better solution as compared to ordinary caches, as they have ability to quickly infer whether the query can be satisfied by the cache or not, due to the organization of the cache. Increasing amount of data and data intensive applications on the network, user queries may spend lots of computational resources, these requirements swells cache size, along with the increasing overheads of storage and retrieval of query semantics. We need to devise an efficient indexing scheme that is able to fetch the cache semantics precisely and at a fast rate for increasing efficiency of the semantic cache and to cope up with current querying pressures. This research proposes a hierarchical indexing scheme that is significantly efficient to serve the purpose of fast semantic cache. Our proposed scheme is based on the SQL query semantics to index cached queries using the hierarchical information provided by the SQL query itself
