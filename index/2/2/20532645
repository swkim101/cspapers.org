A fundamental task of automated guided vehicles is transporting heavy payloads. These payloads are often given in the form of large containers that are mounted onto a cart with four caster wheels. In this paper we investigate a combined detection and control architecture that allows an AGV to reliably detect and acquire such containers at any location, independently of a global localization system. We propose a solution using a horizontally mounted 2D laser scanner and a forward facing 3D time-of-flight camera to detect the payload. Furthermore we demonstrate the algorithm on an asymmetric AGV that consists of a differentially driven base and a trailer with a lifting unit.
