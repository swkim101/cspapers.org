We would like to give biped humanoid robots a following motion as one of the functions capable of supporting humans. Unfortunately, not much attention has been paid to research on human-following motions to date. In this paper, a follow-walking control method is described to realize such motions, which consists of a pattern synthesis part and a balance motion control part. First, we generate switchable unit patterns of a biped humanoid robot, based on human-robot interaction. Second, the unit patterns are synthesized according to the sense of the resultant contact forces. Finally, the compensatory motion of the trunk and waist is calculated by a cooperative motion control algorithm for the balance of the biped robot.
