This poster describes our involvement in the design of the user interface for a hi-fi audio set. The "life cycle" of a consumer-electronics product can, for the owner, roughly be divided into four phases: (1) first impression, (2) initial use, (3) long-term use and (4) replacement. During each of these phases different aspects of the user interface of the product are important. The first two phases, first impression and initial use, normally take place in the store where the product has to compete with other brands and models. The first-impression phase starts when potential buyers are shopping around and a product catches their eyes. During this phase it is important how the product promotes itself among competing products (self-promotion) and what kind of expectations the product elicits, i.e. the perceived potential. After some time the potential buyer selects the product for a closer inspection, and will typically start to perform some baseline tasks, starting the initial-use phase. Then it is important how the product's features are recognized (self-explanation). After the purchase decision has been made, the product enters the home where it has to comfort the owner. That is when the transition from initial to long-term use takes place. During long-term use, classical usability issues are dominant. The expectations that the user has acquired of the product are checked. Eventually the product will be replaced or become obsolete.
