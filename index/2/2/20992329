In this paper, a fall detection algorithm has been built using intelligent analysis of captured video signal. Five geometrical features are extracted from input video signal and are recognized by a trained feed-forward neural network. Experimental results on our self-built database show that the proposed fall detection system can detect fall events with quite high precision under different falling conditions.
