Continuous analytic current (-) voltage (I-V) model for cylindrical doped surrounding-gate MOSFETs (SGMOSFETs) is presented. Starting from Poissonpsilas equation, the dopant effect is considered approximately by a superposition principle with the exact channel potential and the charge equations in the depletion approximation. The current equation based on the unified charge control model without any charge-sheet approximation is valid for all the operation regions (linear, saturation, and subthreshold) and traces the transition between them without any fitting parameters. In the case of the SGMOSFETs with the fully-depleted condition, the results simulated from the SGMOSFET model reproduce various 3D simulation results within 5% errors.
