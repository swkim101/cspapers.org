Full-duplex wireless information and power transfer allows the implementation of wireless sensor networks without batteries. In a full-duplex wireless network, an access point and sensor nodes transmit information and power signals simultaneously. However, this simultaneous transmission leads to a collision problem. To solve this collision problem, we propose a media access control (MAC) protocol, namely the Full-Duplex Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Medium Access Control (FD-SWIPT MAC) protocol, for full-duplex wireless information and power transfer. The evaluation results show that the proposed FD-SWIPT MAC protocol outperforms other MAC protocols.
