The importance of the cache is very apparent in the field of computer science. The semantic cache increases its significance by attaching additional meaningful information with the queried data in the cache. XML is used to provide the structure for the data available on the Web. Therefore it is widely used in many organizations for transmitting the data. The structure of XML data files is different from traditional databases. XML data files stores the information in the form of tree. With the recommendation of W3C XPath is used for queering the information which contained in XML data files. For storing the information related to the XML data files, semantic cache should be maintain in such a way that will support the structure of the XML data files as well as the meaning of the queried data. In this paper an architecture known as SCAD-XML is presented which support the semantic cache for XML data files. A new scheme is introduces to support the data and the related information of the data in the cache. This scheme is based upon semantic overlay tree. An algorithm of the imperative component of query processing is also represented, which works under the certain rules. The rules are defined by viewing all the aspects of the queries that are posted by the user.
