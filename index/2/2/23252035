Ever increasing computing power and connectivity bandwidth together with falling storage costs is resulting in overwhelming amounts of multimedia data being produced, exchanged, and stored. One key application area in this realm is the search and retrieval of spoken audio documents. As storage becomes cheaper, the availability and usefulness of large collections of spoken documents is limited strictly by the lack of adequate technology to exploit them. Manually transcribing speech is expensive and sometimes outright impossible due to privacy concerns. This leads us to exploring an automatic approach to searching and navigating spoken document collections. This tutorial will present an overview of speech transcription, indexing, and search technologies for spoken documents, with an emphasis on a corpus containing recorded academic lectures. The tutorial will point out general problems in this area and suggest possible solutions. Included in the tutorial will be a discussion of scenarios and previous projects in the area of spoken document retrieval, issues of automatic transcription of long audio files, and techniques for the indexing and retrieval of spoken audio files.
