Estimating the real effort spent to implement the requirements of a software system, without superimposing any overhead on the development team, represents a paramount opportunity to keep a software project under control. Lagrein is a software system that tries to address this problem by supporting managers and developers in exploring how a software system has been developed. It supports the visualization of multiple metrics (polymetric views), it links individual requirements to the portions of the source code expected to implement them, it couples the source code with the effort spent in producing it. With a certain level of approximation, Lagrein makes it possible to estimate the effort required to implement each single requirement.
