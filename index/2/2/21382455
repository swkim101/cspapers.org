Institutions small and large often use student teaching assistants (TAs) to provide office hours, tutor students, and grade student work, and the quality of a course's TAs can greatly affect the quality of the course. In this BOF we will discuss the training we provide to prepare TAs for their course duties and the mentoring we provide to foster their role as future educators. Improving the effectiveness of TA training and mentoring can have an immediate impact on the quality of teaching, potentially improve retention and diversity in computer science, and have a long-term impact on all aspects of our field as our current students and TAs progress through their industry and academic careers. Our goal is to provide a forum for you to disseminate your TA mentoring practices and for you to hear the mentoring practices of others, with the goal to develop a collection of best practices for TA training and mentoring for computer science. This BOF is appropriate for professors or instructors of any computer science course or summer program that uses undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants.
