This paper suggests a method for computing term associations based on an adaptive bilinear retrieval model. Such a model can be implemented by using a three-layer feedforward neural network. Term associations are modeled by weighted links connecting different neurons, and are derived by the perception learning algorithm without the need for introducing any ad hoc parameters. The preliminary results indicate the usefulness of neural networks in the design of adaptive information retrieval systems.
