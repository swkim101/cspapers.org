MOOCs, 3D virtual world environments, game-based learning, simulations, digital story telling, and other learning-focused digital interactions hold tremendous potential for presenting information science concepts and problem-solving strategies to the generations of the 21st century. We use them to present both theoretical and practical concepts in an engaging manner, tailored to specific age groups and at many levels of abstraction. An abundance of recent projects have examined these individually and brought to light many common concerns. This session explores several interrelated questions: How can these varied activities can be integrated to effectively teach programming concepts, problem solving strategies, and programming skills at age- and discipline-appropriate levels? Do interactive digital simulations and visualizations facilitate construction of the mental models underlying computing concepts? What assessments will be effective in determining whether we are achieving our knowledge- and skill-related goals? How are these tools related to student learning styles and learning objectives? How can these artifacts be disseminated and sustained in the context of dynamic delivery platforms? This brainstorming session is an opportunity to share ideas and explore future collaborations.
