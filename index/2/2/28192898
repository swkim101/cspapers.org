Collision avoidance, in particular between robots, is an important component for autonomous robots. It is a necessary component in numerous applications such as humanrobot interaction, automotive or unmanned aerial vehicles. While many collision avoidance algorithms take into account actuation constraints, only a few consider sensing limitations. In this paper, we present a reciprocal collision avoidance algorithm based on the velocity obstacle approach that guarantees collision-free maneuvers even when the robots are only capable to sense their environment within a limited Field Of View (FOV). We also present the challenges associated to sensors with limited FOV, show the conditions under which maneuvering can be safely done, and the modifications that a velocity obstacle approach requires to satisfy such conditions. We provide simulations and real robot experiments to validate our approach.
