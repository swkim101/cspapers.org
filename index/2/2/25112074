A demonstration of a typical media package designed to faciliate group instruction in computer operations will be presented. The package consists of slides, captions stored on a filmstrip, and an illustrated workbook. Detailed sequential procedures can be shown to the students through a slide presentation thus saving expensive computer time. The media packages can also be used by individual students who wish to review the laboratory exercises. Each slide presentation closely follows the steps of a sequential laboratory procedure. This new captioning system allows verbal explanations and cueing techniques such as circles and arrows used to enhance the meaning of the visuals. The workbook is closely correlated with the slide presentation and is illustrated with prints of selected slides. This system allows revision of captions, workbook, or slides without revision of the entire instruction unit.
