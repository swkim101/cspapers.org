The JPL Robotics Research Program is developing techniques that might be applicable in the future to planetary missions, to the assembly of large structures in Earth orbit, or to free-swimming underwater vehicles where there is a need for the integration of a computer vision system with mechanical effectors. In each of these applications there Is a necessity for real-time processing and a size limit on the on-board processor. To meet these objectives, a random access picture digitizer and memory system (RAPID) has been developed which provides, in effect, real-time random access television cameras to the computer. This short report describes the impact of RAPID on the Robotics Program, both in terms of the hardware design and software organization.
