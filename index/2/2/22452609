The Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec) focuses on the theory and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning in adversarial settings such as security and privacy applications and conversely, the security and privacy implications arising through the use of large-scale AI methods. The workshop serves as the premier venue for this particular fusion of application, algorithms, and theory and continues to attract submissions from a diverse set of researchers, who address newly arising problems within this ever growing field. AISec provides a forum for researchers within the security, privacy, AI, and learning communities to discuss the role that intelligent technologies play in security and privacy applications and to present the unique needs of these problems to the AI and learning communities.
