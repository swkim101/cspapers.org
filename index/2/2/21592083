This report examines the behavior of the Linpack 300Ã—300 benchmark [Dongarra] on a parallel vector machine. It is observed that the performance of several parallel vector machines on this application is far below their nominal peak performance. Dissection of the internals of the algorithms shows how peak performance is limited. The insights gained provide guidance to algorithm developers as to ways to make maximum use of architectural strengths. System architects may gain insight about which system characteristics to optimize to increase the performance of future designs for this class of application.
