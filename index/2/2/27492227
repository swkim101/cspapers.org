There has been a continuing discussion in the SIGCSE Bulletin over the “gap” between the subject matter and methodology of Computer Science curricula and the needs of industry (1, 2, 3, 7, 8). There have been both denials that a gap exists, and reaffirmations of its existence. Two of the proposals for a solution to the problem have called for direct contact between students and industry during the education process. Goddard (9) discussed the internship and cooperative program at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The ACM curriculum recommendations for a Master of Information Systems degree(4) contain a course proposal for Systems Development Projects (course D3) which involves significant contact between students and industry.
 This paper discusses the need for professional training during the education process and our attempt to provide such training within a Computer Science Masters degree program by means of a course, the Master's Practicum.
