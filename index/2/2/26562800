As the complexity of human-computer interfaces increases, those who use these interfaces as well as those reponsible for their design have recognized an urgent need for substantive research in the human factors of software development [2], [5]. Because of the magnitude of the task of producing software for individual human-computer interfaces, appropriate tools are needed for defining and improving such interfaces, both in research and production environments. This paper describes the research being carried out to construct DMS (Dialogue Management System), which is a complete system for defining, modifying, executing, and metering human-computer dialogues.
