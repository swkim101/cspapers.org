Existing standards in capturing processes concentrate on client tools. Furthermore, semantic information are often available that cannot be captured in a structured way with the proposed standard formats. In addition, processes are usually used and maintained by multiple persons. Therefore, a collaborative platform to discuss and share information about processes is valuable. In order to address the challenge of maintaining and sharing knowledge about processes, we provide a tool to capture and annotate processes using Semantic MediaWiki as a collaborative platform. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our tool by presenting a demo available in the World Wide Web.
