The confidence oriented approach to dependability measurement is based on statistical hypothesis testing [1]. It can be used to analyze the effectiveness of testing and anal ysis methods and to define the concept of software trustability. This discussion focuses on trustability. Trustability is cotitdence in the absence of faults. In order to calculate trustability, it is necessary to know the detectability of testing and analysis methods. The detectability of a method for a fault class and a class of programs is the probability of its finding a fault in a program, if the program contains a fault. Stronger trustability measures can be calculated if associated fault class frequencies are also available.
