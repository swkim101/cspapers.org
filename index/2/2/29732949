Advances in process and lithography technologies in the last five years have presented users of these technologies with a dilemma: our ability to build complex devices is exceeding our ability to effectively design them.
 Present theory and practice suggests that a solution to this problem is to utilize a well-organized approach to design, layout, and test. Major portions of these approaches, or methodologies, involve the utilization of automation tools.
