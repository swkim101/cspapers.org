Entry-level college programming courses have high failure rates, which lead to high dropout rates for associated majors. These courses typically cover fundamental programming concepts for students to master in order to succeed in their majors. When attempting to perceive a student's competency, instructors often utilize Automated Assessment Tools, but most tools do not fully record student progress in assignments. Access to the student's problem solving steps can provide educators a more complete understanding of the student's thought process. Our tool tracks the student's steps and sequencing while attempting to complete assignments. With this resource, teaching methodologies can be modified to more effectively foster successful problem-solving strategies within early programming courses.
