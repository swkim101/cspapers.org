Students who attend academic conferences can broaden their horizons, increase their commitment to the discipline, find role models and mentors, and gain concrete opportunities for work and study. However, attending one's first conference can be an overwhelming experience. We often focus on the procurement of funding to send students to conferences, and do not spend as much time considering what will happen once they get there. In this BoF, we will share strategies for guiding and supporting undergraduates to take full advantage of attending a CS conference. This session will be led by two faculty members and two young alumni. We will draw on our collective experience helping our students/classmates make the most of attending the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, SIGCSE, and other CS research conferences. We invite discussion of any and all conferences participants have experience with, as similar strategies may apply. Specifically, we may consider how to help students: act with confidence in a professional setting; rehearse an "elevator pitch"; navigate career fairs and exhibit halls; choose wisely among parallel sessions and the "hallway track"; network effectively with potential mentors, advisers, and employers; present their own work in talks or poster sessions; reflect on their experiences; and share what they learn at their home institution.
