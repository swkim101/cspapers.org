As a female computer science educator, I've watched with growing alarm the drop in enrollment in our Computer Science programs from a ratio of 1:1 of males and females in 1983, to a current ratio of 5:1. The lack of interest of female students in Computer Science is still a very serious problem. As educators we should all be watching our own campus and addressing this problem. The panelists assembled from various institutions will address the issues of gender imbalance and relate their experiences in implementing solutions to counter this problem. Two of the panelist will discuss utilization of the World Wide Web addressing reasons for creating both Web sites. As long as this gender imbalance exists in our schools we need to continue our dialog to share and develop new ideas to encourage female participation in Computer Science Programs. The audience will be welcomed to participate in a larger group discussion.
