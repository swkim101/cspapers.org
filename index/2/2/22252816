This paper explores a problem of reconfiguration of a large set of agents using global control signals: right, left, up and down. A field of obstacles guides the reconfiguration by limiting motion in the various directions. This paper extends work by Becker et al. ([4], [5] and [7]), and shows there exists a workspace a constant factor larger than the number of agents that enables complete rearrangement for a rectangle of agents.
