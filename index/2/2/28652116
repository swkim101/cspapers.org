The topographic simulation technique, presented here, is part of the continuing development of the ACCEL1 system. It is based on the idea that the configurations of a circuit board can be represented in a topographic structure. This idea was first introduced to the authors by Dr. Iben Browning, Executive Director of the Thomas Bede Foundation in Los Altos, California. The ACCEL system was developed jointly by Sandia Corporation and the Thomas Bede Foundation, under contract to Sandia. The development began in the Spring of 1964 and has continued to the present. A working system has been programmed and demonstrated. The demonstration shows a circuit board being designed by the system, starting with a rough schematic of the circuit as the primary input to the ACCEL system, then proceeding through the main phases to the final computer output, which includes the actual photographic negative etching master, a finished circuit schematic, an assembly drawing, a hole drilling list, a parts list, and a jumper wire drawing.
