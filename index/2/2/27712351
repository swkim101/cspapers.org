This paper outlines our experiences with an undergraduate Operating Systems Lab course at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Our approach is different from that at many schools, in that we develop an operating system from scratch rather than examining an existing system. At the heart of our approach is a faith in the studentsâ€™ ability to design and implement a complex system. The current course structure, facilities, and examples of student projects are described, along with hints on how to make use of our experience at another school.
