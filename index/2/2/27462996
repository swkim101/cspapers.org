This paper presents a method for trajectory generation with BÃ©zier curves, by considering the wind field and dynamic constraints for small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Atmospheric phenomena affect UAS trajectories, so the wind presence should be considered in order efficiently perform a mission. These missions require precise area decomposition, efficient waypoint sequencing, and a smooth trajectory generation to fulfill the required level of safety and reliability. In this context, a path planning algorithm is presented which incorporates the use of an area decomposition scheme which considers complex shapes and restrictions, in order to provide high levels of coverage. A novel trajectory generation algorithm is proposed, which aims to harvest energy from the atmosphere by taking advantage of the previously estimated wind field and the identified wind features, such as shear wind and discrete gusts, by taking into account flight envelope restrictions. Different test cases and scenarios, including Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulations and real telemetry data analysis, are presented to assess the energy gain for the implemented algorithms. The results indicate promising energy gains of almost 15% in voltage saving if the mentioned factors are considered to re-plan the path with the energy-efficient trajectories.
