In augmented and virtual reality, there may be many 3D planar windows with 2D texts, images, and videos on them. Projective Windows is a technique using projective geometry to bring any near or distant window instantly to the fingertip and then to scale and position it simultaneously with a single, continuous flow of hand motion.
