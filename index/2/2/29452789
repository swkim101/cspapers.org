We report the statistically significant mean impacts of blind feedback, as implemented by 7 participants for the 2003 Reliable Information Access (RIA) Workshop, on 30 retrieval measures, including several primary recall measures not originally reported. We find that blind feedback was detrimental to measures focused on the first relevant item even when it boosted "early precision" measures such as mean Precision@10, implying that the conventional reporting of ad hoc precision needs enhancement.
