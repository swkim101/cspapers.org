This paper uses a holonic hand model introduced in our early works (1998), which is composed of 2-stems-of-links-1-joint nonconvex biped planar holons working in colony in order to perform dexterous grasps. This paper focuses on the reconfiguration control of the colony that we structure as a sequence of planar grasp operations defining a holonic regrasp, which uses a graph theoretic formalization of configuration changes that occur in this holonic hand during this regrasping phase.
