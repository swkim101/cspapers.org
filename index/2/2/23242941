We discuss the main methodological and technological issues arosen in the last years in the development of the enterprise integrated database of Telecom Italia and, subsequently in the management of the primary data store for Telecom Italia data warehouse applications.
The two efforts, although driven by different needs and requirements can be regarded as a continous development of an integrated view of the enterprise data. We review the experience accumulated in the integration of over 50 internal databases, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of this scenario for data warehousing and discuss the development of a large dedicated data store to support the analysis of data about customers and phone traffic.
