This paper describes a web based federated identity management system which is based on the user centric approach of the Information Card model, and has been enhanced to remove many of the problems inherent in Microsoft's original design. Furthermore the new design is adapted to interwork with existing SAML 2 federations. Our model supports not only improved user mobility and the aggregation of claims from multiple identity providers (IdPs), but also user authentication via just one of the IdPs without placing any constraints on the authentication mechanism that is used. This is achieved by introducing a new component, the Linking Identity Selector, which allows the user to select multiple cards at service provision time. Users can then use the combined set of credentials to access a wider range of web based resources. We describe our first example application which allows the user to present a credit card, a self asserted card, a hotel loyalty card and a frequent flyer card in order to make an online hotel booking, using voice biometrics for authentication.
