Information diffusion in social networks provide great opportunities for political and social change as well as societal education. Therefore understanding information diffusion in social networks is a critical research goal. This greater understanding can be achieved through data analysis, development of reliable models that can predict outcomes of social processes, and ultimately the creation of applications that can shape the outcome of these processes. In this tutorial, we aim to provide an overview of such recent research based on a wide variety of techniques such as optimization algorithms, data mining, data streams covering a large number of problems such as influence spread maximization, misinformation limitation and study of trends in online social networks.
