Relying on the recently introduced multi-algebras, we present a general approach for reasoning about temporal sequences of qualitative information that is generally more efficient than existing techniques. Applying our approach to the specific case of sequences of topological information about constant-size regions, we show that the resulting formalism has a complete procedure for deciding consistency, and we identify its three maximal tractable sub-classes containing all basic relations.
