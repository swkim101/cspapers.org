Given a set of integer keys from a bounded universe along with associated data, the dictionary problem asks to answer two queries: membership and retrieval. Membership has to tell whether a given element is in the dictionary or not; Retrieval has to return the data associated with the searched key. In this paper we provide time and space optimal solutions for three well-established relaxations of this basic problem: (Compressed) Static functions, Approximate membership and Relative membership.
