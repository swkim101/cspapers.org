Recurrent nets are more powerful than feedforward nets because they allow simulation of dynamical systems. Everything from sine wave generators through computers to the brain are potential candidates, but to use recurrent nets to emulate dynamical systems we need learning algorithms to program them. Here I describe a new twist on an old algorithm for recurrent nets and compare it to its predecessors.
