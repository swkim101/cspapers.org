Computer applications and computer science education for developing nations have received little attention in developed countries, largely because we are naturally interested in first putting our own house in order. This paper is first intended to call attention to the problems of developing nations. It surveys the ways in which developing nations need computing and computer science, and how computer science education can help satisfy these needs. The goals and problems of computer science education are then discussed.
 One of the gravest problems of a computer science department in a developing nation is isolation—from technology and research, from professional contacts, from advice. Contacts with departments in developed nations will alleviate, if not solve, this problem at little expense to us. This is not a formal “twinning”, requiring funds which are presently hard to fund, but an informal assistance.
