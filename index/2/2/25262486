COMPUTER-1 is an interactive editor/assembler simulator-debugger and program evaluator to be used as an instructional tool for an introductory course in computer organization and assembler language programming. COMPUTER-1's organization, assembler language and interactive facilities are designed to introduce basic concepts of computer architecture and assembly language programming while minimizing the amount of computer system dependent details present during this learning period. COMPUTER-1 is a decimal machine with a small modern single address instruction repertoire. A run-time view into COMPUTER-1's memory and registers is provided to help in program understanding and debugging. COMPUTER-1 provides a flexible instructor-oriented method for specifying and evaluating programming assignments and a way for students to determine whether and how well their programs have worked. COMPUTER-1 runs under UNIX and presumes the availability of a CRT with full-screen cursor addressability. COMPUTER-1 is a modern descendent of BASIC1 [1] in that it simulates a more contemporary architecture and possesses interactive features which are not tied to the capabilities of hard copy terminals or card readers.
