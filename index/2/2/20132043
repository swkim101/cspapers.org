A similarity metric based on the low-level content of images can be used to create a visualisation in which visually similar images are displayed close to each other. We are carrying out a series of experiments to evaluate the usefulness of this type of visualisation as an image browsing aid. The experiment described here considered the task of finding photographs matching a general textual description. Preliminary results indicate that people are faster when the images are displayed in a similarity-based visualisation than when they are arranged randomly.
