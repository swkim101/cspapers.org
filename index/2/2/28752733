Analysis of musical audio is of interest for a variety of tasks within the field of music information retrieval (MIR). One component of MIR is audio event detection, of which onset detection is one component. Audio offset detection is a complementary task to audio onset detection, but this task has received scant attention in the literature. This research will develop an offset detection task that can be included in the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation Exchange (MIREX) 2015 suite of evaluation tasks. The development of this task will provide a tool for researchers to evaluate performance of offset detection algorithms while establishing a baseline of performance for the current state-of-the-art. An existing offset detection algorithm will be utilized for testing prior to public release of the task in Summer 2015. Results of the public evaluation will be presented during the MIREX session at the 2015 International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) conference, to be held 26-30 October 2015 in Malaga, Spain.
