We study the proportional chore division problem where a protocol wants to divide an undesirable object, called chore, among n different players. This problem is the dual variant of the cake cutting problem in which we want to allocate a desirable object. In this paper, we show that chore division and cake cutting problems are closely related to each other and provide a tight lower bound for proportional chore division.
