This paper describes a system which provides a visual demonstration of the structure and flow of an ALGOL program. The program is displayed on a CRT and executed interpretively, highlighting each statement prior to execution and showing the result of the statement after execution. The primary use of the system is to demonstrate program operation in a classroom environment. It has also been used as an automatic benchchecking aid.
