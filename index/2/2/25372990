In an event-monitoring wireless sensor network (WSN), the sensors must be waked up fast to engage in active and high-rate sensing when events of interest occur. However, to prolong the lifetime of the network, the sensors should be put into the standby mode as long as possible. There is thus a tradeoff between the standby duration and the wakeup latency. Though the tradeoff is important, what is more important is a flexible transmission schedule that allows the tradeoff to be exploited. In this research, we use debris flow monitoring as a case study to illustrate how the tradeoff between long standby and fast wakeup can be exploited systematically with a flexible transmission schedule.
