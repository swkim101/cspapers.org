Ubiquitous environment's research has evolved 
considerably over the last years. The wide 
range of mobile devices, their high diversity and mobility have raised a variety of challenges being resource management a predominant, and therefore attracting special 
attention in the research community. The 
Composable-Adaptive Resource Management 
(CARM) middleware library provides a exi- 
ble infrastructure where personal devices create seamlessly on-demand interconnections 
links to share ubiquitous resources. In this paper we present a CARM interesting use case, 
consisting of an improved audio listening experience by sharing a high quality audio resource. A proof-of-concept implementation 
is provided, and a testbed comprised of two 
CARM enabled mobile phones with Bluetooth 
connectivity making use of remote device's 
audio resource is described. Our approach 
demonstrates the importance and usability of 
enhancing the dynamic resource sharing experience without altering the bandwidth efficiency.
