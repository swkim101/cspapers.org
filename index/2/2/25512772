One of the most important challenges in traditional learning environments is coping with the learning pace of naturally varying skilled learners. Not all learners have same learning tendency. They suffer if a proper way is not devised to cope with this challenge. In such a heterogeneous learning environment, they should be provided with personalized instructions based on their own perception skills to give them opportunity to learn on their own pace. Also, they can collaborate and interact with other peers to enhance then-learning. Definitely providing these features in a learning environment is not a simple and easy task. Although traditional computer based learning management systems can provide users with these facilities to some extent. However, there is a room for improvement. In this paper, we propose an agent based e-learning management system architecture to provide personalized, self-paced, and collaborative learning opportunities to its learners. We test our system in a university environment. The results of the experimentation show that we achieve the state of the art performance in learning.
