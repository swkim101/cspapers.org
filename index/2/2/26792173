This paper describes a methodology and a framework for building an analyzable real-time model of an object oriented system that is developed using a UML CASE tool. The real-time model is formulated by a new UML view named "MAST RT View". This view allows the designer to gradually build the real-time model according to the phase of the development process, to feed data into the analysis tools, and to bring the relevant timing responses back into the model. The MAST RT View has three models: the processing capacity of the hardware/software platform; the timing behavior of the application logical components; and the workload and the timing requirements of each real-time situation to be analyzed. This view is analyzable by the MAST set of tools, which includes worst-case schedulability analysis and discrete event simulation for hard and soft timing requirements.
