In some special circumstances, such as earthquakes, tsunamis and floods, etc. Infrastructure communication facilities are damaged, all communications are interrupted. For the communication between peoples, Android smartphones can be used to construct Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). To improve the work efficiency, it is necessary to run the Information Systems (Android Applications) in MANETs, therefore the distribution of information becomes convenient. However, it is very hard to get a real MANET environment to test Android Applications, and so far, we have not found any MANETs simulation environments which can be used to test actual Android Applications. Therefore, we propose a Simulation Experimental Environment for Android Applications in MANETs (SEEM). The test results show that the SEEM is practicable to test Android Applications in MANETs. We believe that the SEEM will be beneficial to the researchers and developers who need to develop and test actual Android Applications in MANETs.
