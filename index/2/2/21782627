In the Fall of 1999 the Center for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching (CEUT) and the International Office at Virginia Tech provided a small grant to support the incorporation of international aspects into the Computer Science curriculum. The "Professionalism in Computing" course was chosen as the vehicle for this activity on the grounds that (a) it is a required course of all majors, and (b) the topics within the course were best amenable to international extensions. Through the efforts of the students in the Spring 2000 offering of the course, together with a number of international students, lesson plans for the comparison of non-US aspects of three topics were developed. The topics were Privacy, Freedom of Speech, and Censorship, and the countries covered included Germany, South Korea, China, and Turkey.
