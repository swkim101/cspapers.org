The January 1989 report of the ACM Task Force on the Core of Computer Science (COCS) presents a critique of the traditional computer science introductory curriculum and suggests a radically different alternative: a three-semester survey course of the whole of the field. This paper presents an overview and critique of the COCS report and suggests an alternative vision of how to upgrade the CSI course. The alternative is based on an evolution from the current CSl to a course with more depth and rigor, and with a sense of history, but without broadening the focus beyond the traditional topics of algorithms, data structures, software methodology and a single high-level programming language. A new text serves as an “existence proof” of the viability of the approach.
