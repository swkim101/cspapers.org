In an effort to lower the rate of attrition of Engineering students, during the early years of their education, the University of Nebraska - Lincoln has instituted a series of two freshman engineering courses which are designed to motivate and retain these students. A description of each of these courses and the motivating factors of each are discussed. Creative plots and conceptual engineering design projects are used as a means of holding interest and teaching the basic engineering skills.
 Surveys taken over a number of years have shown an increase in the retention of engineering students since these courses were instituted. These surveys are discussed.
