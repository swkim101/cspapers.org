This paper proposes a compact circularly-polarized (CP) Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) cavity antenna for 5G application operating in 28 GHz band. The antenna consists of a patch with perpendicular-arrows-shaped on a SIW structure. Longitudinal slot etched on the SIW top metallic surface are also used to excite the radiator. The CP radiation is obtained by using a three-quarters-circle-shape loop structure, which make a 90° phase difference between two perpendicular arrows of the radiator. The low profile, light weight antenna offers both left and right hand circular polarization. The final design, with an overall size of 11 mm × 11 mm × 2.16 mm (λo × λo × 0.2λo at the 28 GHz frequency) yields a |S11| < −10 dB bandwidth of 25.200–28.375 GHz (3.175 GHz) and 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 27.466–29.200 GHz (1.734 GHz). At 28 GHz, the proposed antenna yielded a gain of 6.59 dBic.
