Most previous retrieval approaches have ignored the crucial feature of human-physical world interactions, which is greatly related to our memory and experience of daily activities. In this paper, we propose a gesture-based egocentric video retrieval framework, which retrieves past visual experience using body gestures as non-verbal queries. We use a probabilistic framework based on a canonical correlation analysis that models physical interactions through a latent space and uses them for egocentric video retrieval and re-ranking search results. By incorporating physical interactions into the retrieval models, we address the problems resulting from the variability of human motions. We evaluate our proposed method on motion and egocentric video datasets about daily activities in household settings and demonstrate that our egocentric video retrieval framework robustly improves retrieval performance when retrieving past videos from personal and even other persons' video archives.
