Because of the possible long-term importance of the first language, the panel will focus on issues related to the choice of language for introductory courses. There is currently a marked shift away from Pascal as the lingua frunca of early courses in Computer Science Curricula, , and a wide variety of paradigms and associated languages are being introduced in its Ijlace. The panel will identify and examine issues pertinent to language choice, concentrating on educational ol~jectives rather than specific language and implementation details.
