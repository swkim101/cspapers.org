Barkhausen Noise Analysis (BNA) method is one of non-destructive testing techniques. It allows evaluating the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage. However, the comparison between experimental results from different research groups is limited due to differences in experimental conditions. This paper aims to provide a Barkhausen noise measuring system model, taking into account all system's elements, so that those differences can be eliminated, hence allowing the comparison between “true” Barkhausen signals.
