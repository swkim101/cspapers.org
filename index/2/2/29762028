In this paper, a new low-complexity hybrid multiuser detection scheme is proposed. The structure cascades a linear successive interference cancellation detector and a 1-opt local search algorithm. The proposed multiuser detector is compared to other multiuser detectors in terms of BER and complexity. Simulation results illustrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to actual ones existing in literature.
