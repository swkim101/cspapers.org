In this paper, we propose a motion control strategy for a mobile robot helper to handle a single object in cooperation with a human. The method, referred to as the object trajectory-following method, controls the motion of the mobile robot so as to track the trajectory of the object manipulated by the human. Experimental results using the "MR (Mobile Robot) Helper" illustrate the validity of the method.
