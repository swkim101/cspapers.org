An extreme scale system is one that is one thousand times more capable than a current comparable system, with the same power and physical footprint. Intuitively, this means that the power consumption and physical footprint of a current departmental server should be enough to deliver petascale performance, and that a single, commodity chip should deliver terascale performance. In this panel, we will discuss the resulting challenges in energy/power efficiency, concurrency and locality, resiliency and programmability, and the research opportunities that may take us to extreme scale systems.
