In this paper, we address the problem of how a robot can optimize parameters of combined interaction force/task space controllers under a success constraint in an active way. To enable the robot to explore its environment robustly, safely and without the risk of damaging anything, suitable control concepts have to be developed that enable compliant and force control in situations that are afflicted with high uncertainties. Instances of such concepts are impedance, operational space or hybrid control. However, the parameters of these controllers have to be tuned precisely in order to achieve reasonable performance, which is inherently challenging, as often no sufficient model of the environment is available. To overcome this, we propose to use constrained Bayesian optimization to enable the robot to tune its controller parameters autonomously. Unlike other controller tuning methods, this method allows us to include a success constraint into the optimization. Further, we introduce novel performance measures for compliant, force controlled robots. In real world experiments we show that our approach is able to optimize the parameters for a task that consists of establishing and maintaining contact between the robot and the environment efficiently and successfully.
