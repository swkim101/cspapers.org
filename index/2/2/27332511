c The two traditional techniques for moving objects in graphical workspaces are dragging and cut and paste. Each method has some disadvantages. We introduce a new method, calledfixandfloat, formoving objects in graphical workspaces. The new methodfies the object(s) to the gaze or viewpoint, thereby letting the user move objects implicitly while,doing egocentric navigation. We describe the advantages this new method has over previous techniques, and give an example of its use in a 3D graphical workspace. )â€™ .:,
