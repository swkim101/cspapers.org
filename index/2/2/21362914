Node.js is one of the hottest open source web platforms currently available. It's built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript runtime engine and it allows you to write all kinds of network applications and servers in just a few lines of code. Node.js uses an asynchronous programming model built on non-blocking I/O and a single-threaded event loop. What this means, basically, is that you don't need to be concerned with awful race conditions or synchronization issues that arise when programming for a concurrent multi-user environment. This workshop is aimed mainly at web development instructors that would like to consider teaching a single programming language, JavaScript, for both client-side and server-side coding. Participants will learn how to employ Node.js on Windows, Mac OS or Linux in order to write scalable web servers and applications. Additionally, the Express web framework will be introduced in order to demonstrate how to quickly program traditional webapps and single-page applications (SPA) with the aid of jQuery, AJAX and RESTful web services. The resulting programs will be usable from any modern web browser, including those found in desktop and laptop computers, and mobile devices such as tablets and smart-phones. Participants should have prior working knowledge of client-side (running on a browser) JavaScript and HTML. More information: http://node.arielortiz.info/ Laptop Required.
