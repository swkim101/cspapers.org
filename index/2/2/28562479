We report here our cumulative 2-year experience with the “The Digtal World”, a course designed to increase the technological literacy of non-science students. The course relies heavily on computer-aided instruction, including the extensive use of electronic lectures and multimedia. Students were able to acquire a surprising level of sophistication by working with examples of digital technology chosen from their daily lives. Students were also able to identify weaknesses in areas of current technology and public policy similar to those identified by experts.
We describe our successes and failures, and present cumulative data on performance, by major, class, and gender. All courseware and applications for “The Digital World” are available from the author.
