In this paper, the wire-driven weight-compensation mechanism is proposed. This mechanism consists of a parallelogram linkage mechanism that has an extended portion with the wired double pulley. This is a lighter solution compared to others since no springs are utilized. Below, a detailed description of this new weight-compensation mechanism and performances of Float Arm V with this new mechanism are given.
