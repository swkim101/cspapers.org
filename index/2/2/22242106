The SURA Coastal Ocean Observing & Prediction (SCOOP) program is building cyberinfrastructure (CI) to enable advanced real-time ensemble forecasting of the coastal impacts from storms and hurricanes. This prototype of a reliable, flexible, grid-enabled forecast system integrates real-time distributed data and computer models for the coasts of the southeastern United States. The SCOOP system employs a service-oriented architecture with archive and transport services, metadata catalog, resource management, and portal interfaces. Currently, the SCOOP system uses distributed HPC machines (SCOOP, SURAgrid, others) to meet on-demand requirements. Geospatial web services disseminate the forecast results.We provide the architecture overview and describe the currently deployed system for Hurricane Season 2006 as an example in which a storm advisory automatically initiates a workflow that delivers timely forecasts. The system generates a wind-ensemble and then configures, deploys, and analyzes a variety of water level and wave models across distributed HPC resources to deliver timely forecasts.
