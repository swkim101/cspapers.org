In this paper, we present a novel near surface augmented reading system that brings digital content to physical papers. Our system allows a collocated mobile phone to provide augmented content based on its position on top of paper. Our system utilizes built-in magnetometer of a smartphone together with six constantly spinning magnets that generate designed patterns of magnetic flux, to detect 2D location of phone and render dynamic interactive content on the smartphone screen. The proposed technique could be implemented on most of mobile platforms without external sensing hardware.
