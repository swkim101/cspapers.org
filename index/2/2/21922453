In so many ways, software-intensive systems touch the lives of every individual, corporation, institution, nation, and contemporary civilization. Nonetheless, the gap between the technological haves and have-nots is growing and the gap between academia and the industries that create these software-intensive systems continues to be much lamented. I enter this presentation as one firmly planted in the pragmatic creation and evolution of such systems, and yet look outside industry for sources of state-changing innovation. In this talk, I'll examine the current state of software-intensive systems in the world, the forces that fall upon such systems and the people who develop, deploy, and operate them, and the means whereby we can keep the pipeline of innovation open and the academia/industry dialog vibrant. Along the way, I'll cover little-discussed topics including the moral dimension of software, the appreciation of beauty in software, and the privilege and responsibility of being a software developer.
