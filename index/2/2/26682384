Research on establishing a stable system using control theory has been ongoing for nearly two hundred years. Various methods and techniques have been developed throughout the years in order to control systems in a robust and stable manner. Naturally, as the controlled system is more complex, it is required to design more advanced control schemes. The most basic group of systems, (from here-on noted as a “plant”), which is analyzed and manipulated by a control system, are known linear time invariant (LTI) plants. For these sorts of systems, classic control theory produces remarkable benchmarks and is reviewed in many books and papers [1]. Modern control theory, such as optimal attempt to optimize the control law by applying a cost functional on the state and the control variables [2,3]. However, these methods rely on knowing the model of the plant or at least have a very good approximation.
