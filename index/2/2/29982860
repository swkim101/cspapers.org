When working in the constantly challenging field of Computer Science, all but the most brazen individuals will inevitably feel "in over their heads", which is the simplest incarnation of impostor syndrome. This issue affects members of this field at all levels: students, teachers, researchers, etc. For students, impostor syndrome is a great barrier to success, because they don't have full context of the skills necessary to be successful in CS. Computer Science attrition rates are extremely high relative to other areas of study, particularly among first and second-year college students. What can be done by educators and the industry to retain talent, that would otherwise be lost by those individuals not feeling like they belong? How can we instill confidence and encourage growth? How can these strategies applied personally, or to other experienced members of the field?
