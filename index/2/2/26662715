A new shot level video retrieval system that supports semantic visual features (e.g., car, mountain, and fire) browsing is developed to facilitate content-based retrieval. The video's binary semantic feature vector is utilized to calculate the score of similarity between two shot keyframes. The score is then used to browse the "similar" keyframes in terms of semantic visual features.
