This poster describes a new upper level undergraduate computer science course in team software development, featuring the Apple iPad as the development platform. The course draws from a wide range of state-of-the-art topics in software development theory and practice, including use of Apple's extensive software development Cocoa Touch framework for its mobile devices, advanced Object-Oriented Programming, gang of four Design Patterns, and traditional Software Engineering practices, including accountability to external clients and public presentation of results. The course was developed at Transylvania University, a small Liberal Arts college of approximately 1200 students, and it was taught there during the Fall 2010 semester.
