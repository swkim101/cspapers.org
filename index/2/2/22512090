Managing Interoperability and Complexity in Health Systems, MIXHS'11, aims to be a forum focussing on recent research and technical results in knowledge management and information systems in bio-medical and electronic health systems. The workshop will provide an opportunity for sharing practical experiences and best practices in e-Health information infrastructure development and management. Of particular interest to the workshop themes are technical solutions to recurring practical systems deployment issues, including harnessing the complexity of bio-medical domain knowledge and the interoperability of heterogeneous health systems. The workshop will gather experts, researchers, system developers, practitioners and policymakers designing and implementing solutions for managing clinical data and integrating existing and future electronic health systems infrastructures.
