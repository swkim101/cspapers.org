Efficient utilization of resources is one of the reasons of popularity of semantic cache. The authors presented detailed survey with comprehensive criteria for efficient query processing. The criteria include size of data, retrieval time, and processing time of data. The size of data directly effects the retrieval time as well as the processing time. Processing and retrieval time are also dependent upon the faster semantic content matching process. The listed results identify the weaknesses in the existing caching techniques of query processing on the basis of defined criteria.
