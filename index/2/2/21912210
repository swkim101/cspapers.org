This paper proposes a behavior log creation support system utilizing human pose/position sensors and behavior target sensors. The system is equipped with a human pose sensor and a staying room sensors as the pose/position sensors as a well as a voice sensor and a PC utilization history sensor to detect the target of the behavior. The human pose sensor classifies human behaviors into "standing", "sitting", and "walking". The staying room sensor records a name of the room where the user stays. The voice sensor detects the conversation which appears when the user is communicating with someone else. The PC utilization history sensor records not only whether a PC is used or not but also the names of the application software to serve as a detector of the behavior target during the computer work. The measured data from these sensors is displayed to the user to support creating the behavior log, i.e. to support the user to recall and to input contents and targets of his or her behaviors. The experiment of making use of the sensors and creating the behavior log proved that the recorded events of the behavior log per all events improve from 60% with no support to more than 90% with support of the system. The result quantitatively shows the capability of human behavior logging support of the system.
