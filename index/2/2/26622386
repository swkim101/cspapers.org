Improved square contour algorithm for blind equalization of QAM signals is presented in this paper. The new scheme employs the estimated symbols in the cost function along with the dispersion constant enforcing equalizer output to reside on multiple moduli. This mechanism reduces the error associated with the new cost function in an efficient manner, which leads to a noteworthy increase in convergence speed and inter-symbol interference suppression. The convergence characteristics of the proposed scheme demonstrated by the simulation results for 16-QAM signal constellation substantiate the efficacy of this new blind equalizer over existing square contour algorithm (SCA) and recently proposed modified square contour algorithm (MSCA)
