In this paper, we report on the implementation of SECSI, an expert system for database design written in Prolog. Starting from an application description given with either a subset of the natural language, or a formal language, or a graphical interface, the system generates a specific semantic network portraying the application. Then, using a set of design rules, it completes and simplifies the semantic network up to reach flat normalized relations. All the design is interactively done with the end-user. The system is evolutive in the sense that it also offers an interactive interface which allows the database design expert to modify or add design rules.
