Over the past years, several challenges and calls for research projects have pointed out the dire need for pushing natural language interfaces. In this context, the importance of Semantic Web data as a premier knowledge source is rapidly increasing. But we are still far from having accurate natural language interfaces that allow handling complex information needs in a user-centric and highly performant manner. The development of such interfaces requires collaboration of a range of different fields, including natural language processing, information extraction, knowledge base construction and population, reasoning, and question answering. With the goal to join forces in the collaborative development of natural language QA systems, the second OKBQA workshop is organized within the 40th SIGIR conference.
