This paper proposes an approximate-kinetic-model-based self-adaptive (AKS) control system to rapidly generate target walking speed by an underactuated compasslike bipedal walker. First, a model of the underactuated compass-like bipedal walker is built, and an open-loop system is introduced and analysed as the prototype of AKS system. Second, the control law of AKS is described in detail. The dynamic updating of trajectory is proposed and the calculation of control parameters by an approximate linearized model is analysed. Finally, simulations are conducted, and thus the capability of disturbance rejection and versatility is tested. As a conclusion, target walking speeds with 4âˆ¼6% steady-state error can be generated rapidly and steadily. Limit cycle walker can obviously improve the capability of handling disturbance and various tasks by AKS control system.
