The Second Workshop on Domain Specific Languages Design and Implementation (DSLDI 2014) is collocated with SPLASH 2014 conference and held in Portland, Oregon, USA on October 20th 2014. The goal of the DSLDI workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in sharing ideas on how Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) should be designed, implemented, supported by tools, and applied in realistic application contexts. More generally, we are interested in building a community that can drive forward the development of modern DSLs.
