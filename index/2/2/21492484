CNN (Convolution Neural Network) is widely used in visual analysis and achieves exceptionally high performances in image classification, face detection, object recognition, image recoloring, and other learning jobs. Using deep learning frameworks, such as Torch and Tensorflow, CNN can be efficiently computed by leveraging the power of GPU. However, one drawback of GPU is its limited memory which prohibits us from handling large images. Passing a 4K resolution image to the VGG network will result in an exception of out-of-memory for Titan-X GPU. In this paper, we propose a new approach that adopts the BSP (bulk synchronization parallel) model to compute CNNs for images of any size. Before fed to a specific CNN layer, the image is split into smaller pieces which go through the neural network separately. Then, a specific padding and normalization technique is adopted to merge sub-images back into one image. Our approach can be easily extended to support distributed multi-GPUs. In this paper, we use neural style network as our example to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. We show that using one Titan-X GPU, we can transfer the style of an image with 10,000Ã—10,000 pixels within 1 minute.
