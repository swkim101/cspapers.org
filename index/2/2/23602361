Most of the prior works summarize videos by either exploring different heuristically designed criteria in an unsupervised way or developing fully supervised algorithms by leveraging human-crafted training data in form of video-summary pairs or importance annotations. However, unsupervised methods are blind to the video category and often fail to produce semantically meaningful video summaries. On the other hand, acquisition of large amount of training data in supervised approaches is non-trivial and may lead to a biased model. Different from existing methods, we introduce a weakly supervised approach that requires only video-level annotation for summarizing web videos. Casting the problem as a weakly supervised learning problem, we propose a flexible deep 3D CNN architecture to learn the notion of importance using only video-level annotation, and without any human-crafted training data. Specifically, our main idea is to leverage multiple videos of a category to automatically learn a parametric model for categorizing videos and then adopt the model to find important segments from a given video as the ones which have maximum influence to the model output. Furthermore, to unleash the full potential of our 3D CNN architecture, we also explored a series of good practices to reduce the influence of limited training data while summarizing videos. Experiments on two challenging and diverse datasets well demonstrate that our approach produces superior quality video summaries compared to several recently proposed approaches.
