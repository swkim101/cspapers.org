Substrate coupling noise is a key problem in today's large mixed-signal systems. This noise is caused by the coupling of digital part and can perturb analog circuits through common substrate. The estimating and accurate modeling of noise coupling effects is a main challenge for designers. In this paper, we describe a method to quickly and accurately estimate substrate coupling effects based on Maxwell's equations and the integral solution for parasitic extraction. Examples are given which show that the proposed method is sufficiently accurate for practical circuit verification by avoiding a dense matrix storage and long computational runtime. Furthermore, a very good speedup factor is obtained when comparing our technique with other methods in the literature.
