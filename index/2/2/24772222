Autonomous driving vehicles are currently being developed in many countries. Autonomous driving systems are developed using the Robot Operating System (ROS), which is suitable for the development of robotics and used for various systems of autonomous driving vehicles. However, in the automotive industry, these systems have often been designed using MATLAB/Simulink, can simulate and evaluate models created for autonomous driving. These models cannot be used with the systems based on ROS. To use a model created using MATLAB/Simulink in ROS, it is necessary to rewrite the model for ROS and incorporate it into the autonomous driving system, reducing development efficiency. Therefore, we propose an integrated development framework that can simulate and operate an autonomous driving system based on ROS with MATLAB/Simulink. The proposed framework improves the development efficiency because the model created by MATLAB/Simulink can be used in the systems without a separate incorporation step. In this demonstration, we perform a co-simulation with the autonomous driving system using the proposed framework.
