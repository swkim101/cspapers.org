In a new model for answer retrieval, document collections are distilled offline into large repositories of facts. Each fact constitutes a potential direct answer to questions seeking a particular kind of entity or relation, such as questions asking about the date of particular events. Question answering becomes equivalent to online fact retrieval, which greatly simplifies the de-facto system architecture.
