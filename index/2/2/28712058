This paper describes the modeling and analysis of an elastic tongue mechanism of a talking robot WT-2 and the development of an acoustic simulator for the construction of the computational model of human speech production. WT-2 consists of lungs, vocal cords and articulators. It is essential to accurately estimate and analyze the shapes of these organs to develop an acoustic simulator. However, it was difficult to estimate and analyze the mechanisms, because they were composed of an elastic rubber to make various shapes and to seal the air and sound. Therefore, we constructed a modeling method to simulate the shape of the elastic mechanisms. This method is applicable to all the elastic body. We developed an acoustic simulator using this modeling method in the process of constructing the speech production model.
