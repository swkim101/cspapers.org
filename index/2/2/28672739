UPC extends ISO C into a Partioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming language. UPC allows programmers to exploit data locality and parallelism in their applications, while maintaining ease of use. UPC is running ubiquitously across nearly all HPC platforms and has been gaining rising support from the community. UPC is relatively very easy to use for irregular access patterns which can enable many new applications that are hard to express in other paradigms. In this BoF, the UPC consortium will share with the community the progress made in applications, specifications, tools, and implementations of UPC. Future plans will be also presented. The First half of the BOF will follow a panel format, where the members will represent the UPC consortium and will speak to different aspects of the UPC developments. The second half will be a question and answer session to promote the exchange of ideas.
