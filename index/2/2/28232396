We have induced a quadruped robot to walk with medium walking speed on irregular terrain based on biological concepts. The PD-controller at joints constructs the virtual spring-damper system as the visco-elasticity model of a muscle. The neural system model consists of a CPG (central pattern generator) and reflexes. A CPG receives sensory input and changes the period of its own active phase. The desired angle and P-gain of each joint in the virtual spring-damper system is switched based on the phase signal of the CPG. CPGs, the motion of the virtual spring-damper system of each leg and the rolling motion of the body are mutually entrained through the rolling motion feedback to CPGs, and can generate adaptive walking. We report our experimental results of dynamic walking on terrains of medium degrees of irregularity in order to verify the effectiveness of the designed neuro-mechanical system.
