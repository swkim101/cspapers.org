In this work we investigate the identification of a motion model for an autonomous underwater vehicle by applying different machine learning (ML) regression methods. By using the data collected from the robot's on-board navigation sensors, we train the regression models to learn the damping term which is regarded as one of the most uncertain components of the motion model. Four regression techniques are investigated namely, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, and Gaussian processes regression. The performance of the identified models is tested through real experimental scenarios performed with the AUV Leng. The novelty of this work is the identification of an underwater vehicle's motion model, for the first time, through machine learning methods by using the robot's onboard sensory data. Results show that the damping model learned with nonlinear methods yield better estimates than the simplified linear and quadratic model which is identified with least-squares technique.
