Data Science, the field of data extraction, manipulation, and analysis in order to derive knowledge or insight, is becoming an essential component of effective management and planning for industrial, research, scientific, and social communities. With the goal of engaging middle-school students in the important field of Data Science, the Sol y Agua project is developing a computer game based on regional environmental issues explored through data analysis. The Sol y Agua project will augment the learning environment of middle school students by incorporating simulation and data science to existing curricula in the form of an interactive educational game. The game has a theme of water sustainability and stewardship with an emphasis on information analysis, negotiation, and decision-making. The game will also immerse students in regional issues concerning biodiversity, sustainability, and the human impact on the environment. This video game will allow students to analyze and interpret data, and make informed decisions about water conservation and sustainability. Simulation and data visualization allow students to perform simulated, environmentally-conscious planning and virtual experiments. Using simulations allows students to easily and inexpensively gather data from the virtual environment. Data visualization allows us to quickly represent this data in new, meaningful, and engaging ways.
