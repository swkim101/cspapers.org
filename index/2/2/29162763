AI can provide improvements on the ways climate zones are derived and managed.This paper reports on analysis of aggregate household electricity consumption (EC) data from local utilities in Los Angeles,seeking possible improvements in energy management. In this analysis we noticed that EC data permits identificationof interesting geographical zones  — regions having EC patterns that are characteristically different from surrounding regions.We believe these zones could be useful in a variety of urban models.
