Search is one of the most important applications used on the internet, but it also poses some of the most interesting challenges in computer science. Providing high-quality search requires understanding across a wide range of computer science disciplines, from lower-level systems issues like computer architecture and distributed systems to applied areas like information retrieval, machine learning, data mining, and user interface design.In this talk I'll share some interesting observations and measurements obtained at Google, and will illustrate the behind-the-scenes pieces of infrastructure (both hardware and software) that we've built in order to extract this information from many terabytes of data.
