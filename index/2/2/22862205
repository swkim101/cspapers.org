Cooperative network coding is considered as a novel technology that integrates cooperative communications with network coding to improve the throughput and robustness of the network. In this paper, a network coding enabled cooperative network with multiple relays is considered, under Rayleigh fading. The outage probability of this network is analyzed and showed to be superior to the traditional network with multiple relays.
