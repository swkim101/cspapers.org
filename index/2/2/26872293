When robots perform manipulation tasks, they need to determine their own movement, as well as how to grasp and release an object. Reasoning about the motion of the robot and the object simultaneously leads to a multi-modal planning problem in a high-dimensional configuration space. In this paper we propose an asymptotically optimal manipulation planner. Our approach extends optimal sampling-based roadmap planners to efficiently explore the configuration space of the robot and the object. We prove probabilistic completeness and global, asymptotic optimality. Extensive simulations of a typical pick-and-place scenario show that our approach significantly outperforms a (nonoptimal) state-of-the-art approach. We implemented our planner on a real manipulator and were able to compute high quality solutions in less than a second.
