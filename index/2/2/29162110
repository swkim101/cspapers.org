To understand the underlying mechanism of link formation in signed networks, we propose a feature framework on the basis of a thorough exploration of potential features for the newly identified problem. Grounded on the framework, we also design a trinary classification model, and experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.
