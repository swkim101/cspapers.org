A number of current systems, such as QBIC [l], focus on the query-based strategies using similarity measures of image features. However, recent research [4] suggests that there is a need for the development of structured browsing and navigation methods to improve retrieval effectiveness. It may help users to construct a precise query while they only have a vague idea at the pre-search stage; and may help them to refine, narrow and reformulate the queries at the post-search stage.
