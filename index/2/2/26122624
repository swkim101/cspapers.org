Human beings live in form of communities. We will define a data sticker for addressing Humans in different Human Communities, based on Genetic and DNA Algorithms. The data sticker will be used in our on-going research of Community Algorithm Development. This sticker not only helps in addressing communities but it will be used for monitoring interaction of human within and among communities, in future. Community Ontology and Human Community Ontology defines a way to hold different Communities and especially Human Communities in them. Migration operator is defined for the chromosomes in a community, which will deal with any individual in an existing generation and new individuals in the upcoming generations of a human community.
