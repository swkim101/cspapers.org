Integration of experiential learning is critical in the field of computer science. It makes science education more rigorous, relevant, and extends the learning beyond the academic walls by engaging students in real world experiences and enforcing active learning. Engaging students in real world experiences is the new pedagogical method of active learning. Connecting theoretical concepts to real world applications will strengthen skills and knowledge (McLaughlin, 2010). Technology is evolving over night and the job requirements are extremely volatile. Educators in the field of computer science have a challenging task of staying abreast with the technology and market needs while self learning the new technologies. One way of staying a breast with the changing needs is to rely on the businesses for input on what should be taught and using them to extend the learning into the real world through experiential learning. The gap between academia and industry can potentially be reduced by interweaving experiential learning with regular classroom activities. This session will involve faculty and business leaders and employees, discussing various mechanisms of involving and collaborating with businesses in an attempt to bring real world simulations and experiences in a classroom. The techniques, challenges and merits of experiential learning will be discussed along with communication and other soft skills that are not covered in textbooks but can only be learned by experiential learning. Internships are one form of experiential learning. Business collaborations provide opportunities to bring awareness of market requirements and means of achieving experiential learning.
