A report will be made on the results of a one day invitational workshop held at the University of California at Irvine on 9 February 1976. The workshop will have brought together 50 leading educators and practitioners to discuss software engineering education and training: goals, constraints, and methods as seen from different perspectives.
 Workshop Goals 
 Increased awareness by all of the specific needs for software engineering education and training; a better understanding of the present and future role of software engineers; feedback on current trends in software engineering education; a published record of the workshop including contributed position papers and an abbreviated report of the discussions in order to make the proceedings available to a wider audience.
