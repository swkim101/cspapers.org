In this paper, we describe XHTML Meta Data Profiles (XMDP) which use XHTML to define a simple profile format which is both human and machine readable. XMDP can be used to extend XHTML by defining new link relationships, meta data properties/values, and class name semantics. XMDP has already been used to extend semantic XHTML to represent social networks, document licensing, voting, and tagging.
