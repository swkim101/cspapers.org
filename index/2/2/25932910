One of the most used systems in the toll domain is Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) systems [1] where antenna is the most important part. It assures essentially the performance of wireless communication systems. Depending on each application, the directivity of the antenna is different. The higher antenna directivity is, the more effective system is. That is why there are increasing demands for designing this kind of antenna. This paper presents a new structure of antenna with high gain to improve the ability of DSRC system for the transportation system applications. The deal of the new antenna is to use a metamaterial layer under a planar antenna. Our great success is a perfect agreement between the real measured and simulated results with 16dBi of directivity.
