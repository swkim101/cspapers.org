This paper: 1) describes the structure of a "uniform" frame system; 2) shows how entailments can be computed within the system; and, 3) shows how contingent facts that are related to a concept can become accessable as a function of how deeply the meaning of that concept is processed. The system is called Uni-Frame and differs from slot-filler frame systems primarily in its commitment to uniformly representing all concepts and to maintaining a representation which is semantically well knit.
