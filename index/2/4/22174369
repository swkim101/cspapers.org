The Semantic Web promises to create a more intelligent and flexible World Wide Web. It has the potential to deliver Semantic Web Services that can be of great utility to the engineering and product design community. When these services are integrated with new state-of-the-art collaboration tools like the Access Grid, improved product development processes and new and innovative business models can be envisioned. Researchers and Industrial partners in Germany and Canada are working together to explore the potential impact on engineering and design using semantically-aware methodologies, services and tools. This showcase will demonstrate progress to date using a live Access Grid session connecting the conference to participants in Toronto Canada and Stuttgart Germany.
