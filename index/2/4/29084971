In this special session, participants will learn how to use Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) effectively in computer science courses. This technique has been successful in reducing drop rates and increasing satisfaction among students. Therefore, it holds promise as a way to boost sagging computer science enrollments in general, and to increase participation of under-represented groups in particular. The goal of the session is to give participants practical information and hands-on experience.
