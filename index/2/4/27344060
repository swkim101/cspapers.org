In February, 1984, the Computer Science Department at Brigham Young University began working on a project that would automate the delivery of a beginning programming class. This project known as THE ELROND PROJECT, was funded by the university with the expectation that the instructional delivery costs and the need for additional faculty for this course could be reduced.
This paper describes the system design and principles that were used and presents strategies for creating computer automated courseware.
