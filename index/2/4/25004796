In this work, we propose to actively detect implicit fraudulent transactions. A novel machine learning method is introduced to distinguish anomalous electronic transactions based on the historical records. The transferor will be alerted during the on-going payment when the fraud probability is recognized as large enough. Compared with elaborative rule-based approaches, our model is much more effective in fraud detection.
