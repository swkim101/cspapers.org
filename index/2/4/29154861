Formal methods for temporal reasoning arouse interest of researchers from both theoretical and practical point of view. Such methods enable modelling and studying human-like reasoning mechanisms, thus constituting a valuable tool in cognitive science, philosophy, and linguistics. On the other hand, temporal reasoning formalisms have a number of potential practical applications, e.g., in task scheduling, action planning, and temporal databases. Temporal reasoning methods may be divided into point-based and interval-based depending on the type of the considered primitive ontological objects. My work revolves around the latter type of methods which seem to be more human-like and more suitable for such applications as continuous process modelling. My main result is that the satisfiability problem in a hybridized fragment of Halpern-Shoham logic in which formulas are in a form of conjunction of Horn clauses and only box modal operators are allowed (diamond operators are disallowed) is NP-complete over reflexive, as well as over irreflexive and dense time frames. Before hybridization this fragment was P-complete over such time structures.
