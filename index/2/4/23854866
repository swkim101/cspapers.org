In this paper, we perform a systematic design study of the "elephant in the room" facing the VR industry -- is it feasible to enable high-quality VR apps on untethered mobile devices such as smartphones? Our quantitative, performance-driven design study makes two contributions. First, we show that the QoE achievable for high-quality VR applications on today's mobile hardware and wireless networks via local rendering or offloading is about 10X away from the acceptable QoE, yet waiting for future mobile hardware or next-generation wireless networks (e.g. 5G) is unlikely to help, because of power limitation and the higher CPU utilization needed for processing packets under higher data rate. Second, we present Furion, a VR framework that enables high-quality, immersive mobile VR on today's mobile devices and wireless networks. Furion exploits a key insight about the VR workload that foreground interactions and background environment have contrasting predictability and rendering workload, and employs a split renderer architecture running on both the phone and the server. Supplemented with video compression, use of panoramic frames, and parallel decoding on multiple cores on the phone, we demonstrate Furion can support high-quality VR apps on today's smartphones over WiFi, with under 14ms latency and 60 FPS (the phone display refresh rate).
