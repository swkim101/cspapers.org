Often, the most interesting tools, methodologies, and insights come from designs that push hard on the “leading edge” of technology--what the survivors commonly call the “bleeding edge” of design. In this session, we collect three such on-the-edge designs, each done in a different style, each aimed at a very different market, each with its own unique set of challenges and solutions. All designers worry about complexity, about time-to-market, about correctness. But these designs go past the sorts of problems many of us have today, and offer some glimpses of problems and solutions we may all be facing tomorrow.
The session offers case studies from an enormous FPGA from Xilinx, a maximally high-end PC graphics engine from NVIDIA, and a huge CDMA system-on-a-chip for a cellular handset from Philips Semiconductors. Design leads from each design team will share some technical strategies, some success stories, and some horror stories in a set of introductory talks. A short panel session at the end will allow the audience to ask questions of all the speakers.
