Meta: a collection of meta-languages that augment/unify language-families, an advanced programming environment, a language interoperability framework, an infrastructure for reflection over source documents, and a generalization of XML. XML provides an extensible mechanism for defining syntax, while Meta provides an extensible mechanism for defining syntax and semantics.
