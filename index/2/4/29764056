This paper presents PeARS (Peer-to-peer Agent for Reciprocated Search), an algorithm for distributed Web search that emulates the offline behaviour of a human with an information need. Specifically, the algorithm models the process of 'calling a friend', i.e. directing one's query to the knowledge holder most likely to answer it. The system allows network users to index and share part of their browsing history in a way that makes them 'experts' on some topics. A layer of distributional semantics agents then performs targeted information retrieval in response to user queries, in a fully automated fashion.
