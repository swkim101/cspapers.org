Mediated access through a clustered collection is a new approach to accessing very large heterogeneous document collections. The user explores a relatively small, homogeneous, pre-clustered, and thus well structured, document collection covering a particular subject domain (called the source collection), in order to understand the concepts encompassed and to clarify and refine his/her information need. The user ostensively indicates clusters and documents of interest and is assisted in formulating a query, based on which a search is done on a large, heterogeneous, nonstructured collection (called the target collection). The original cluster structure is the basis for visualisation tools that allow the user to explore search results.
