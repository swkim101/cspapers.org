The motlvatlon, conception and design of a data filter operating In the security class.lflcatlon domain are described The filter architecture features dlstlnct dcmalns with a separate mlcrOprOcessor In each Isolatlon of the domains 1s accomplished exculslvely by hardware Sharing between the domains 1s con– trolled by trusted software This architecture facilitates verlflcatlon and prov]des flexlblllty, economy, and high throughput A prototgpe of the filter has been Implemented and applled to guarding channels connecting a multicompartmented database to lower level networks The protot~pe ’s operation is fully automatic It uses secret key dlg~tal signatures associated with each database record to authenticate classlflcatlon markings and data A filter security pollcy has been modelled and the prototype design and implementation have been shown Informally to comply. Future directions zn architecture, engineering, application and verification are discussed I20 CH1882-O/83/~/OIN$Ol.M@1983 IEEE
