We extend Reiter's general theory of model-based diagnosis [Reiter, 1987] to a theory of reconfiguration. The generality of Reiter's theory readily supports an extension in which the problem of reconfiguration is viewed as a close analogue of the problem of diagnosis. Using a reconfiguration predicate rcfg analogous to the abnormality predicate ab, we formulate a strategy for reconfiguration by transforming that for diagnosis. A benefit of this approach is that algorithms for diagnosis can be exploited as algorithms for reconfiguration, thereby promoting an integrated approach to fault detection, identification, and reconfiguration.
