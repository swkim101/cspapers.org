There have been increasing demands for developing robotic system combining camera and inertial measurement unit in navigation task, due to their low-cost, lightweight and complementary properties. In this paper, we present a Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) system which can utilize sparse depth to estimate 6D pose in GPS-denied and unstructured environments. The system is based on Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF), which benefits from low computation load when compared to optimization-based method, especially on resource-constrained platform. Features are enhanced with depth information forming 3D landmark position measurements in space, which reduces uncertainty of position estimate. And we derivate measurement model to access compatibility with both 2D and 3D measurements. In experiments, we evaluate the performance of the system in different in-flight scenarios, both cluttered room and industry environment. The results suggest that the estimator is consistent, substantially improves the accuracy compared with original monocular-based MSKCF and achieves competitive accuracy with other research.
