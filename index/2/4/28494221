Over the past decade, there have been major advances in the computer graphics field: in computer graphics techniques, the trend towards object-oriented programming, and availability of relatively inexpensive, high-resolution graphics hardware and sophisticated rendering packages. This suggests that a reevaluation of the traditional computer graphics syllabus is appropriate. The panel will focus on various approaches to teaching graphics as it relates to a computer science curriculum. Panel members have diverse backgrounds from small schools and large schools. Small schools with limited resources must find innovative ways to teach state of the art graphics using inadequate hardware. Public domain software and visual aides such as slides and videotapes will be discussed as an inexpensive way to support graphics education. Large schools with more resources have the luxury of developing course content based on faculty expertise and student interest. After opening statements of approximately ten minutes each, panelists will respond to questions from the audience and the moderator.
