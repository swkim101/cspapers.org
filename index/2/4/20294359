We take displays for granted in devices like our laptops, television, cell phones, and cars -to name a few places. The TFT LCD processes in use now are as mature as CMOS was 20 years ago, which is when we started seeing ASIC companies doing fabless chip design and investing heavily in CAD. Today, the display, as I believe I showed while working on the OLPC, is really just an ASIC!
 Why focus on the display? The display is the most expensive and power hungry component in your laptops, it can now be "taped out" just like an ASIC using standard TFT LCD fabs, and -in the limit- the laptop or the cell phone will become just a display in which the electronics are integrated into. I believe that we are about to see a revolution in display design, with gradual subsumption of more and more of the CPU and motherboard electronics, to further drive down cost and power consumption.
