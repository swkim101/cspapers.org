Mobile devices are integral to the workflows of many organizations working in rural or disconnected contexts. Data is often collected on mobile phones and tablets using tools like Open Data Kit (ODK). However, some of the applications require users to revisit and update previously collected data, necessitating easy viewing of stored data. To make it easier for organizations to create flexible information services, we present ODK Tables, an Android tool that allows users to enter and curate data on mobile devices. Tables leverages web tools to make mobile app creation simple. It provides abstractions to make the process straightforward and allows app designers to access data through a JavaScript API. App designers can create a custom app using only a small number of HTML and JavaScript files. This facilitates the creation of a custom user interface but leaves storage, data management, and synchronization to the framework. The result is a fully featured Android app based on established web-based tools with full support for disconnected operation.
