1. SUMMARY A major component of computer science education is learning software design and development. Many, if not most, jobs in software design and development are in human facing software, so-called front-end design and development. Because of this, students should be learning how to design and develop for the high variability in human abilities. One common example is designing user interfaces that can be easily localized for different written languages. Another example, the topic of this special session, is designing for people who interact with computers in different ways because of a disability, namely, accessible computing.
