As directed by the ACM Education Board, the ACM Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges (CCECC) delivered the final version of its curricular guidance for associate-degree Information Technology (IT) programs. The guidance, An ACM Competency Model of Core Learning Outcomes and Assessment for Associate-Degree Curriculum in Information Technology, includes core IT learning outcomes with associated assessment metrics. Examples of degree and certificate programs that align with the ACM core IT learning outcomes are part of a growing repository at CAPspace.org. These correlations demonstrate the adaptability of this competency-based curriculum approach to a variety of computing courses, certificates, and degree programs. The CCECC invites institutions to highlight their IT degree and certificate programs by submitting correlations at capspace.org/correlation/ using an easy-to-use web form.
