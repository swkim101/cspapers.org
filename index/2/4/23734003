With the advent of high-performance networks, multi-party collaborative environments are widely used to large-scale distributed meetings, collaborative work sessions, and distance lectures. To improve quality of experience in advanced collaborative environments, we attempt to better understanding of human factors by developing high-resolution tiled display to show multiple high-quality video streams simultaneously. It is to show DV (digital video) and HDV (high-definition digital video) on the tiled display consisting of arrays of LCD monitors to form a 6 by 4 display. Consequently this is primarily applied to provide properly large-scale view of collaboration space and detailed close-up of meeting documents. We also propose 3D graphics model sharing service based on hand-like input device. This is to share 3D graphic models in multi-party collaborative environments by using glove-based hand motion tracking and enable to transfer the hand motion to other participants through networks. Thus, this gives convenient interaction method for sharing 3D models.
