In support of our research projects in information retrieval, we have developed an integrated multi-process software system that shepherds research data from induction through aggregation, analysis, and presentation. We combine public-domain code libraries with our own software to provide a flexible, easily- configured modular system that exposes data online for easier collaboration. The goal is to create a single online infrastructure that allows colleagues to submit, process, analyze and visualize data, and discuss and prioritize issues through a single integrated interface. We demonstrate our system within the context of the large data set provided by the Indexer's Legacy project [1].
