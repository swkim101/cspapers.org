Detecting logo frequency and duration in sports videos provides sponsors an effective way to evaluate their advertising efforts. However, general-purposed object detection methods cannot address all the challenges in sports videos. In this paper, we propose a mutual-enhanced approach that can improve the detection of a logo through the information obtained from other simultaneously occurred logos. In a Fast-RCNN-based framework, we first introduce a homogeneity-enhanced re-ranking method by analyzing the characteristics of homogeneous logos in each frame, including type repetition, color consistency, and mutual exclusion. Different from conventional enhance mechanism that improves the weak proposals with the dominant proposals, our mutual method can also enhance the relatively significant proposals with weak proposals. Mutual enhancement is also included in our frame propagation mechanism that improves logo detection by utilizing the continuity of logos across frames. We use a tennis video dataset and an associated logo collection for detection evaluation. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods with a higher accuracy.
