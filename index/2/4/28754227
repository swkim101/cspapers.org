The introductory programming college course is usually difficult for many new students, as they struggle to master basic programming concepts and to develop logically correct programs. Surveys in college have estimated that around 30 percent of these students drop out or fail it. These tasks are even more difficult for Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) students, even when provided with accessible visual translations through sign language interpreters or real-time captions. We have extended the idea of traditional audio capture and transmission accessible technology devices by developing and testing use of smart phones as multimedia recording devices to record multiple videos and stream them to the deaf or hard of hearing student. We call this approach multiple video perspectives.
