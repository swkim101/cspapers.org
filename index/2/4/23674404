This paper proposes a novel algorithm for Content Based Scene Retrieval (CBSR) using video features such as moment, histogram, Edge Histogram Descriptor (EHD)... This application is similar for Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) but instead of finding corresponding images in the database, it identifies the corresponding scene which contains the testing frame. The proposed algorithm can deal with scene with similar contents which has not been mentioned in other methods. The simulation results show that identification performance obtains the accuracy up to 99.42% for a 2:31 minute trailer.
