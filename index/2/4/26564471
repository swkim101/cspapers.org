Deployed over smartphones and sensor devices, CoMon monitors diverse contexts of mobile users and their surroundings, and provides applications with the contexts of interests. Especially, to support long-term monitoring of highly diverse user contexts, it enables a smartphone to collaborate with other smartphones as well as external sensor devices in a nearby space opportunistically. Through cooperation, it overcomes the limitation of a single smartphone-based context monitoring, i.e. inherent scarcity of sensing modalities (e.g. no environmental sensors) and positions (e.g. in a pocket) or potential shortage of computation resources and battery power. Utilizing CoMon, context monitoring applications need to simply delegate their context monitoring requests to CoMon and become capable of fully exploiting resources within nearby spaces. Instead, CoMon plans the resource use for concurrent applications in cooperation with other devices. Specifically, CoMon maximizes sharing of sensing and computing resources among multiple devices of nearby users. Also, it avoids unnecessary usage of energy and computing resources by removing repetitive sensing and context processing across multiple devices.
