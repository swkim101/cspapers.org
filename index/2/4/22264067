In advanced technology nodes, standard cell pin access is becoming challenging due to a small number of routing tracks and complex design-for-manufacturing constraints. Pin access interference is further exacerbated by unidirectional routing, which is highly preferred to enable high-density metal patterns and comply with self-aligned multiple patterning solutions. Previous manufacturing-aware routing studies simply depend on the router or sequential planning schemes to resolve pin access interference, which introduces significant overhead on solution qualities. Therefore, we propose concurrent pin access optimization techniques to achieve fast and high-quality routing solutions. The concurrent pin access optimization is modeled as a weighted interval assignment problem, which is solved by an optimal integer linear programming formulation and a scalable Lagrangian relaxation algorithm. A concurrent pin access router is implemented while accommodating advanced manufacturing constraints, which outperforms state-of-the-art manufacturing-aware routers with better routability, fewer vias and faster runtime.
