In this paper, we propose goal recognition heuristics that rely on information from planning landmarks - facts or actions that must occur if a plan is to achieve a goal when starting from some initial state. We develop two such heuristics: the first estimates goal completion by considering the ratio between achieved and extracted landmarks of a candidate goal, while the second takes into account how unique each landmark is among landmarks for all candidate goals. We empirically evaluate these heuristics over both standard goal/plan recognition problems, and a set of very large problems. We show that our heuristics can recognize goals more accurately, and run orders of magnitude faster, than the current state-of-the-art.
