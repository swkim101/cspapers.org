Multimedia is the term applied to the technology which mixes sound, moving images, text and graphics on a computer. Elementary school children can now listen to their story books as the book’s images appear on the computer screen with each word of the text highlighted as it is spoken. As they watch, the figures in the images perform the activities described. Using a mouse the children can move around the image, examining features of it more closely. Students in high school studying Shakespeare can bring up the text of Hamlet in attractive script, obtain definitions of highlighted words, refer to reviews of the play, learn about the history of the period, and even watch and listen to Laurence Olivier and Jean Simmons performing the play. Chemistry students can complete their labs as interactive simulations thereby allowing experimentation without risk. Students can use the latest equipment to prepare multimedia reports capturing text and home video. All of this and more can be done on a personal computer with a CD-Rem or videodisc attached. The above are just a few brief descriptions of the kind of educational experiences the ‘multimedia generation’ will be exposed to before they reach our colleges and universities. This panel will discuss the implications of these experiences for those who teach computer science at the college level and address some of the following questions and others. What effects will this type of education have on the learning process? What do we need to know, that we don’t know now, in order to educate these students? Does what we teach and/or the way we teach need to change in response to these prior experiences? If it needs to change, how should it change? If we decide to make use of multi-media in our classes, what does it involve?
