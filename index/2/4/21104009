In this paper, we explore how the power differential between participants of an interaction affects the way they interact in the context of political debates. We analyze the 2012 Republican presidential primary debates where we model the power index of each candidate in terms of their poll standings. We find that the candidates' power indices affected the way they interacted with others in the debates as well as how others interacted with them.
