NeurOK LLC presents two products, based on its propnetary technology of content-based information retrieval and filtering. Both products are powered by the Internet Semantic Server TM, capable of learning the basic semantic categories from large documents collections. Each term as well as each document is then represented as a vector in semantic space, so that closely related documents have similar vectors. Thus one can compare the content of the documents, regardless of the particular choice of the used terms. Semantic Explorer TM provides an easy navigational tool in the interactive self-organizing maps of documents collections. It is capable of automatic extraction of a hierarchy of thematic categories, representing the structure of a database content. It facilitates comprehension of the content of large databases and can be used for quick content-based search of related documents.
