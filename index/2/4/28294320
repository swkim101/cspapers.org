In this paper we present a tool called Event Analyzer that processes events that compose a sequence. We present the data model in which Event Analyzer is based, as well as its query language that allows the expression of complex patterns to be searched over the sequence of events. The Event Analyzer has been developed and it now integrates the Fujitsu Symfoware e-Business Intelligence Suite Premium.
