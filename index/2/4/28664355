Abstract As sharing heavily relies on trust, in this position paper we advocate for the use of a socio-technical model of trust to inform the design of sharing services. We start by presenting the model and then moving on to establish the relationship between sharing and trust. We then deconstruct a sharing service proposal illustrating potential trust breakdowns. Finally, in an example, we illustrate how the socio-technical model of trust could be used to inform the (re)design of the selected service.
