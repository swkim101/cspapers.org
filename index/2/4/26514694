This paper will describe possible types of activities that can be used in a data structures course to give students experience applying the concepts being taught. It is suggested that problems be presented within a real context and in situations where there is more than one reasonable solution. Having students develop possible data structure solutions for a problem, determine appropriate criteria for comparison of the solutions, evaluate the solutions, and select a solution for a particular problem will provide them with valuable experience. In order to successfully do this, students need to have some experience using their analysis and synthesis skills to solve problems involving data structures. Many real life problems require not just one data structure but a combination of several data structures. Students will benefit from designing data structures for both simple and complex problems. They will not only have learned what each data structure is and how to manipulate it, but also when to use each particular data structure.
