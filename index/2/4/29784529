This paper addresses the problem of amodal perception of 3D object detection. The task is to not only find object localizations in the 3D world, but also estimate their physical sizes and poses, even if only parts of them are visible in the RGB-D image. Recent approaches have attempted to harness point cloud from depth channel to exploit 3D features directly in the 3D space and demonstrated the superiority over traditional 2.5D representation approaches. We revisit the amodal 3D detection problem by sticking to the 2.5D representation framework, and directly relate 2.5D visual appearance to 3D objects. We propose a novel 3D object detection system that simultaneously predicts objects 3D locations, physical sizes, and orientations in indoor scenes. Experiments on the NYUV2 dataset show our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and indicates 2.5D representation is capable of encoding features for 3D amodal object detection.
