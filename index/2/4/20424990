The pending revision of the ACM/IEEE CS curriculum guidelines for computer science, and the continuing broadening of the computing disciplines, among other considerations, make now a good time to review the role of mathematical reasoning in computing education. This birds-of-a-feather session provides an opportunity for people interested in mathematics and its role in computing education to reflect on and discuss the future of mathematical reasoning in our curricula, guided by the question of whether it should be broader than it has been, narrower, or if it is just right as it is.
