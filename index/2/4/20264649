A new case study for the AP curriculum, based on a marine biology simulation program will be released for the 2000-2001 academic year. The case study highlights linear and two-dimensional data structures, object interaction, object-oriented design, and discrete simulation. This seminar will introduce the new case study to AP teachers and other interested CS educators, and will discuss how it can be integrated into the AP (or CS 1 and CS 2) curricula.
