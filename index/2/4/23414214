Self-assessment is a procedure based on questions and answers covering knowledge in technical areas which allows an individual to determine his own activities for the purpose of keeping up with progress in his field. It is assumed that the individual wishes to continue active learning and that he wants to identify his deficiencies (usually in a manner where no one else knows of them).
 A major premise regarding self-assessment is that it should primarily be an educational experience for the participant.
 An alternative to using the professional testing agency approach for developing and administering self-assessment procedures for the computing field is proposed.
