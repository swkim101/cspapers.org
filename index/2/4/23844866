In the present paper, we focus on the design of an effective 3-D modelling for the simulation of urban environment propagation, which integrates the Urban Building Model (UBM), Ray-Tracing (RT) technique and the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD). UBM is an object-oriented data structure, in which each building is an object. Besides that, we also take into account some other urban elements such as car parking, traffic lights... Meanwhile, the RT technique helps us not only to delineate the propagation path but also to explain the interaction mechanism of rays through a complex area. In this work, we use the Shooting and Bouncing Ray (SBR) technique. Last of all, the asymptotic method UTD will be employed in order to calculate the scattered far-field attached to the rays. These rays propagated from the transmitter, after some interactions, mainly reflection and diffraction, inside an urban area, are intercepted by the receiver. This proposed model will be applied at high-frequency bands (X, K). As a consequence, we will evaluate the detection capability of the model for a target, i.e. a car, moving inside a realistic urban area. The simulated results have shown that the model can predict precisely the motion direction of the considered target.
