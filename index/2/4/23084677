In this paper, we study on the adaptation of EPON (Ethernet Passive Optical Network) mobile backhaul network to support the virtual single cell network. The virtual single cell network is a mobile network that offers fast movers no break handover for packet transfer by logical grouping adjacent small cells into virtual single cell. Due to constructing from a large number of small cells it requires cost-effective backhaul network. High speed PON is a good candidate for the mobile backhaul network since it can cost-effectively accommodate many terminals spread over the wide service areas. In our scope, we investigate adaptability of EPON mobile backhaul network into a virtual single cell network with modified WLAN interface shows (i) The EPON frame itself can be used for the virtual single cell network; (ii) The definition of mode bit in the preamble field should be modified; (iii) The mode bit meaning becomes to indicate communication types, point-to-point or multicast. The multicast here means limited broadcast to ONUs which possibly include a target terminal and transfer inhibit on the links under the OLTs which don't includes the target terminal; (iv) The broadcast communication should be indicated with LLID (Logical Link ID), not with the mode bit.
