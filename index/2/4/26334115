Directed by the ACM Education Board, the ACM CCECC (Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges) has produced curricular guidance for associate-degree IT programs consisting of core IT learning outcomes with associated assessment rubrics. The learning outcomes express core IT competencies which should be common to all IT-related associate-degree programs. The three-tiered assessment rubrics provide further clarity and meaningful evaluation metrics for each outcome, as well as facilitate integration into assessment-based curricula. The outcomes have been influenced by current and future needs of business and industry, certifications, related curricula, and government and standards bodies, along with the intent of being adaptable, not overly technology specific, and having reasonable staying power. These results are being made available during the poster session, in the exhibit hall at the committee booth, and online at www.capspace.org.
