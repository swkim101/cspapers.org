This one-day tutorial aims at industry practitioners, managers and developers alike, who want to learn more about how to successfully design, implement and run an Experience Factory, to systematically build up and manage the experience of an organization. State-of- the art methods and techniques on how to initially set-up or to further develop and improve an organizationÂ¿s Experience Factory are discussed. Participants should come from organizations (not only from the software domain) that are interested in implementing an Experience Factory to help effectively support improvement activities (such as TQM, ISO 9000, CMMI, SPICE, or TSP) to gain competitive advantages.
