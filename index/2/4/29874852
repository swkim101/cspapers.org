Experimental research on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms requires either writing variations on the same program or making one monolithic program with many parameters and options. By using an object-oriented library, the size of these experimental programs is reduced while making them easier to read, write and modify. An efficient and flexible realization of this idea is Connectionist Layered Object-oriented Network Simulator (CLONES). CLONES runs on UNIX workstations and on the 100-1000 MFLOP Ring Array Processor (RAP) that we built with ANN algorithms in mind. In this report we describe CLONES and show how it is implemented on the RAP.
