Learning one domain knowledge is good for undergraduate students to face existing job market, but it might not be enough for the future career challenges. At Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT), we are promoting Externally-collaborative, Project-based, Interdisciplinary Curricula (EPIC) learning that provides opportunities to work on interdisciplinary projects for the students. In this talk, I would like to share experience of designing and teaching an EPIC course by applying mobile application development to biomedical domain for creating a mobile health system at WIT. The students from two different departments, Computer Science and Networking and Biomedical Engineering, learn together and work collaboratively on a final project. The lessons learned from this process include: (1) How to find appropriate disciplines to make a course? (2) How to design a syllabus for students with different backgrounds? (3) How to design lectures and laboratory assignments for the collaboration? (4) How to guide students to work on the project collaboratively? etc. At the end of the talk, I will conclude my experience with suggestions and describe the future work in this direction.
