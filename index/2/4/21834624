The emergence of large-scale receptor-based systems has enabled applications to execute complex business logic over data generated from monitoring the physical world. An important functionality required by these applications is the detection and response to complex events, often in real-time. Bridging the gap between low-level receptor technology and such high-level needs of applications remains a significant challenge.We demonstrate our solution to this problem in the context of HiFi, a system we are building to solve the data management problems of large-scale receptor-based systems. Specifically, we show how HiFi generates simple events out of receptor data at its edges and provides high-functionality complex event processing mechanisms for sophisticated event detection using a real-world library scenario.
