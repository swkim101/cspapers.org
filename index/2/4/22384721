Peer review is the most critical process in evaluating an article to be accepted for publication in an academic venue. When assigning a reviewer to evaluate an article, the assignment should be aware of conflicts of interest (COIs) such that the reviews are fair to everyone. However, existing conference management systems simply ask reviewers and authors to declare their explicit COIs through a plain search user interface guided by some simple conflict rules. We argue that such declaration system is not enough to discover all latent COI cases. In this work, we study a graphical declaration system that visualizes the relationships of authors and reviewers based on a heterogeneous co-authorship network. With the help of the declarations, we attempt to detect the latent COIs automatically based on the meta-paths of a heterogeneous network.
