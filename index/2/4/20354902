This paper proposes a lattice-reduction aided detection (LRAD) based on the Gram-Schmidt (GS) procedure. In MIMO systems, LRAD achieves good bit error ratios (BERs). The proposed detection method reduces the column vectors of the channel matrix using the LLL algorithm and then the GS procedure to create mutually purely orthogonal column vectors in order to improve BER. The proposed detection method can achieve more reliable estimation of the transmitted signals than the conventional LLL algorithm, and the BERs are improved about 5dB at BER=10−5 for the 8×8 MIMO system over the conventional LLL algorithm. Also the BER curves for the proposed detection is as steep as those for the conventional LRAD.
