This paper describes a study of the required mathematical support for the computing program at Southwest Baptist University. A list of requisite mathematical concepts identified in four core courses is presented. Additionally, the results of a survey of required mathematics support courses for eighty-four small colleges and universities offering computing programs are presented and contrasted with the concepts identified by the study. The results highlight the need for a freshmen level discrete mathematics course.
