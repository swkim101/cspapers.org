In this paper, we propose a novel means for introducing undergraduate students to research experiences in computer science â€” via an introductory Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) course. Students explore the content areas typically covered in an upper-level A.I. course (heuristic search, constraint satisfaction, game-playing etc.), while also learning about the mechanics of how empirical research is conducted in this field.
