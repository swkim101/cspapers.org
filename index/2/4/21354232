The inherent limitations in RF spectrum availability and susceptibility to interference make it difficult to meet the reliability required for automotive safety applications. To address this challenge, this work explores an alternative communication system called Visual MIMO that uses light emitting arrays as transmitters and cameras as receivers. Visual MIMO applied to vehicular communication proposes to reuse existing LED rear and headlights as transmitters and existing cameras (e.g. those used for parking assistance, rear-view cameras) as receivers. In this work we show a proof of concept based demonstration of the Visual MIMO system consisting of an LED transmitter array and a high-speed camera.
