This session is for anyone currently using Alice 2 and / or Alice 3, or those exploring the possibility of using Alice in their curriculum. The session will focus on a mapping of an Alice curriculum and instructional materials to CSTA, code.org and ACM curriculum standards and guidelines for a wide range of age/grade levels. The discussion leaders and attendees will share teaching strategies, tips, and techniques for implementing these standards. This is an opportunity to share assignments and pointers to web sites to access instructional materials, such as syllabi, student projects, exams, and other resources with experienced Alice instructors and those new to Alice. Goals for this session include: Review a course mapping of the Alice curriculum to well-known introductory curricula and pedagogy learning standards. Discuss learning standards and objectives encountered in the use of Alice in different environments and educational contexts. Allow educators using Alice to share exemplary assignments and teaching strategies. Provide an opportunity for those thinking about using Alice to ask questions as they determine how it may be most useful in their particular situation. Foster the development of community by allowing Alice teachers to connect and become resources for each other throughout the year. Allow educators to interact with Alice team members to learn more about the latest features of Alice 3 and Alice 2.
