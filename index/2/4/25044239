DataMine is a statistical database mining system with strong emphasis on interactiveness and nice graphical representation of information produced. It also supports an offline mode of discovery, and provides an extensive API which allows users to write "mining applications" just as easily as routine database applications, The central idea is to perform discovery with a "human in the loop" guiding the system using his initial hypothesis and the feedback from the system. Users can pose a rule-query against a rulebase and the system can generate all rules matching their query. The rulebase could either be pregenerated (using offline mode) or could be realized in real-time as the discovery progresses.Rules generated by the system are of the form:Body -> Consequentwhere Body is a conjunction of the elementary predicates of the form (A=a), where A is an attribute and a is a value from the attribute domain of A. Consequent is a single elementary predicate. Each rule can have several parameters like support, confidence, atypicality, color etc. (the definitions have been left out) which can also be used by the user in framing the rule query.For continuous attributes, the system also allows the user some control in deciding how they are discretized. It also allows for the creation of extra attributes at run time which can then be used in queries like the rest.
