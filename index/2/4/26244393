We consider settings where electric vehicle drivers participate in a market mechanism to charge their vehicles. Existing work typically assumes that participants are fully rational and can report their charging preferences accurately. However, this may not be reasonable in settings with non-experts. To explore this, we design a novel game called Bid2Charge and compare a fully expressive interface that covers the entire space of preferences to two restricted interfaces that offer fewer possible reports. We show that restricting the usersâ€™ preferences significantly reduces deliberation times while also leading to an increase in utility by up to 70%.
