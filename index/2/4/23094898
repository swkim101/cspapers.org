We present Twonet, a large-scale sensor network testbed with dual-radio nodes. Twonet has 100 Opal nodes with low-power 32-bit ARM CPU and 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz radios. These nodes are managed by a network of 20 Raspberry Pi nodes at tier 2 and a PC server at tier 1. These nodes together provide a robust testbed for public access. Twonet represents a major addition to the collection of wireless sensor network testbeds that are publicly available. We hope Twonet's availability will foster sensor network research based on a modern 32-bit sensor node architecture and multi-channel wireless networking.
