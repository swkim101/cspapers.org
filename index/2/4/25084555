Have you read any of the common reads for SIGCSE 2017? Now's your chance to talk about them! Two novels: The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace & Babbage: The Mostly True Story of the First Computer by Sydney Padua (Pantheon Graphic Novels, 2015) and The Martian by Andy Weir (Broadway Books, 2014) as well as a short story: "The Last Question" by Isaac Asimov (Science Fiction Quarterly, 1956) were proposed at the end of the 2016 conference. If you're interested in science fiction, whether on a personal, academic, or pedagogical level, come join us in this BoF and discuss one or more of the two books and short story. We'll provide potential topics and discussion questions targeting how to incorporate these books into a CS course, but the discussion will be open. The BoF will close with a discussion of potential books for the 2018 conference.
