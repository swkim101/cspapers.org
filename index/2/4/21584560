A new nonlinear control law for path following with skid-steered mobile robots is proposed. A terrain dependent kinematic model is utilized in path coordinates, and the kinematic parameters are experimentally evaluated. A kinematic path following control is developed using the Lyapunov approach. A separate linear velocity control is then proposed, taking reachable curvatures and actuator saturation into account. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated in different terrain scenarios, and compared with two other state-of-the-art algorithms. The skid-steered vehicle used for the experiments is the Robotnik Summit XL, a well known commercial mobile robot.
