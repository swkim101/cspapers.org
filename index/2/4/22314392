A small multiband-printed antenna for multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) communication system using metamaterial structure is proposed as well as the whole concepts of miniaturization are introduced. To reduce the mutual coupling between two multi-band antennas, we develop a compact stop-band filter loaded with Complementary Split Ring Resonator Transmission Line (CSRR-TL) on ground plane. A resonant frequency obtained with high isolation value is f0 = 2.33GHz. Total small patch size is 0.20λ0 × 0.11λ0 with 1.6 mm thickness. The novel MIMO antenna for Long Term Evolution (LTE) is fabricated by using low cost FR4 (εr = 4.4) substrate. Both the simulated and measured results are shown to illustrate the performances of the proposed antenna.
