However, the performance gains have come at a cost of substantially intensive computation complexity, which prohibits its usage inresource-limited applications like mobile or embedded devices. While increasing attention has been paid to the acceleration of internal network structure, the redundancy of visual input is rarely considered. In this paper, we make the first attempt of reducing spatial and channel redundancy directly from the visual input for CNNs acceleration. The proposed method, termed ESPACE (Elimination of SPAtial and Channel rEdundancy), works by the following three steps: First, the 3D channel redundancy of convolutional layers is reduced by a set of low-rank approximation of convolutional filters. Second, a novel mask based selective processing scheme is proposed, which further speedups the convolution operations via skipping unsalient spatial locations of the visual input. Third, the accelerated network is fine-tuned using the training data via back-propagation. The proposed method is evaluated on ImageNet 2012 with implementations on two widely adopted CNNs, i.e. AlexNet and GoogLeNet. In comparison to several recent methods of CNN acceleration, the proposed scheme has demonstrated new state-of-the-art acceleration performance by a factor of 5.48* and 4.12* speedup on AlexNet and GoogLeNet, respectively, with a minimal decrease in classification accuracy.
