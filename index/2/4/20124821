Modern Knowledge Graphs such as DBPedia contain significant information regarding Named Entities and the logical relationships which exist between them. Twitter on the other hand, contains important information on the popularity and frequency with which these entities are mentioned and discussed in combination with one another. In this paper we investigate whether these two sources of information can be used to complement and explain one another. In particular, we would like to know whether the logical relationships (a.k.a. semantic paths) which exist between pairs of known entities can help to explain the frequency with which those entities co-occur with one another in Twitter. To do this we train a ranking function over semantic paths between pairs of entities. The aim of the ranker is to identify the path that most likely explains why a particular pair of entities have appeared together in a particular tweet. We train the ranking model using a number of lexical, graph-embedding and popularity-based features over semantic paths containing a single intermediate entity and demonstrate the efficacy of the model for determining why pairs of entities occur together in tweets.
