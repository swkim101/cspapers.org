This talk reports on findings gained during roadmapping activities for automotive embedded systems development, conducted in the broader environment of the Artemis Technology Platform (http://www.artemis-office.org/). It discusses key trends in the distributed development of embedded automotive applications, and the challenges arising towards implementing such new development processes. Topics covered range from impact on real-time analysis, safety analysis, distributed control, and human-in-the-loop analysis. The talk will point out resulting research directions and research priorities.
