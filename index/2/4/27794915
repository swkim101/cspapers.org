This paper discusses the preliminary-announcement and display function of the robot's following action and intention, especially about the direction of motion and the speed of motion for mobile robot which moves on a 2-dimensional plane. We started with a software simulation about the announcement method indicating a state just after the moment, with lighting lamps and with using blowouts (elastic arrow) on translation and rotation separately. As a result, the following three remarks have been obtained: not only the direction of motion but also the speed of motion is effective to estimate the following translation. Not the rotation speed but the rotation angle (the target direction) is efficient to understand the following revolution. Around 1-second before the actual motion is the optimal timing to recognize the robot's following motion both on translation and rotation. Moreover we have verified the validity of the preliminary-announcement and display also for the general movement on a plane.
