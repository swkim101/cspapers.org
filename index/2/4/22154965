Very seldom does the initial design of an active circuit result in all design constraints being met. Hence, design techniques involve a process of initial design-analysis-redesign-analysis, until the circuit meets the specifications. This paper presents the general philosophy of a computer program which automates the “analysis-redesign” cycle for a large variety of passive or active, linear or nonlinear circuits. The computer program employs both circuit simulation and optimization techniques. Simulation corresponds to the analysis portion of the cycle in that it determines the circuit's response and whether or not the design constraints have been met. The optimization technique alters parameter values to minimize a function which reflects the design constraints. Thus, the optimization procedure performs the redesign.
