We have all seen the articles about highly skilled programmers available remotely at amazingly low rates. Large CAE vendors already develop their software in several countries. What are the driving forces...location, local talent, cost of living, inexpensive labor? Are the fundamental issues language barriers, time zones, or customer contacts? What are the facts? Can you utilize this resource? How can you manage a project with team members distributed around the world? Is there a growing trend of software development jobs moving to these low-cost providers? To address these intriguing questions we are fortunate to have a panel of experts engaged in all aspects of this topic. We have suppliers and users of remote programming talent, proponents and skeptics of the real benefits of a geographically distributed software development. Each of the panelists will highlight their experiences: What coordination problems or additional costs arose, how were these problems solved? Were they able to realize real costs savings? How were the other success factors, such as time to market, product quality, and customer satisfaction, impacted? Finally, they will give their views of how this segment of the global computer industry will evolve in the next 5 years. Following the opening statements, the panel will be available to answer your questions or debate alternative points of view.
