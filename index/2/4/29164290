The class imbalance problem has been neglected by traditional feature selection methods, therefore the selected features will be biased towards the majority classes. Because of the superiority of F-measure to accuracy for imbalanced data, we propose to use F-measure as the performance measure for feature selection algorithms. As a pseudo-linear function, the optimization of F-measure can be achieved by minimizing the total costs. In this paper, we present a novel cost-sensitive feature selection (CSFS) method which optimizes F-measure instead of accuracy to take class imbalance issue into account. The features will be selected according to optimal F-measure classifier after solving a series of cost-sensitive feature selection sub-problems. The features selected by our method will fully represent the characteristics of not only majority classes, but also minority classes. Extensive experimental results conducted on synthetic, multi-class and multi-label datasets validate the efficiency and significance of our feature selection method.
