This paper presents a dual-resolution local sensor based planning method for hyper-redundant robot mechanisms. Two classes of sensor feedback control methods, working at different sampling rates and different spatial resolutions, are considered: full shape modification (FSM), and partial shape modification (PSM). FSM and PSM cooperate to utilize a mechanism's hyper-redundancy to enable both local obstacle avoidance and end-effector placement in real-time. These methods have been implemented on a thirty degree of freedom hyper-redundant manipulator which has 11 ultrasonic distance measurement sensors and 20 infrared proximity sensors. The implementation of these algorithms in a dual CPU real-time control computer, an innovative sensor bus architecture, and a novel graphical control interface are described. Experimental results obtained using this test bed show the efficacy of the proposed method.
