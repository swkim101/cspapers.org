Let me state clearly at the outset that I disagree with the premise that the problem of interfacing to database systems has outlived its usefulness as a productive environment for NL research. But I can take this stand strongly only by being very liberal in defining both "natural language interface" and "database systems". same as "Are there any vice presidents who are either male or female". This same system, when asked for all the Michigan doctors and Pennsylvania dentists, produced a list of all the people who were either doctors or dentists and who lived in either Michigan or Pennsylvania. This is the state of our art?
