Today, general-purpose commercial multicores approaching one hundred cores are already a reality and even thousand core chips are being prototyped. Maintaining coherence across such a high number of cores in these manycore architectures requires careful design of the coherence directory used to keep track of current locations of the memory blocks at the private cache level. In this work we propose a novel organization for the coherence directory that builds on the brand-new concept of way combining. Particularly, our proposal employs just one pointer per entry, which is optimal for the common case of having just one sharer. For those addresses that require more than one pointer, we have observed that in the majority of cases extra pointers could be taken from other empty ways in the same set. Thus, our proposal minimizes the storage overheads without losing the flexibility to adapt to several sharing degrees and without the complexities of other previously proposed techniques. Through detailed simulations of a 128-core architecture, we show that the way-combining directory closely approaches the performance of a non-scalable bit-vector sparse directory, and beats other scalable state-of-the-art proposals.
