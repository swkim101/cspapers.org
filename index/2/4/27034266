Recent studies on the impact of CS teacher professional development (PD) opportunities have highlighted areas of improvement to effectively grow the number of well-prepared CS teachers. In this BoF Google will share data from CS4HS, an annual program that awards funding to research institutions and education nonprofits globally for the purpose of developing innovative and scalable CS PD that maps to local standards and demands. These data will serve as a starting point to engage the attendees in a wide-ranging and action-oriented discussion on ways the CS education community can improve our PD processes and results.
