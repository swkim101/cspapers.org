Fetching items is an important problem for a social robot. It requires a robot to interpret a person's language and gesture and use these noisy observations to infer what item to deliver. If the robot could ask questions, it would help the robot be faster and more accurate in its task. Existing approaches either do not ask questions, or rely on fixed question-asking policies. To address this problem, we propose a model that makes assumptions about cooperation between agents to perform richer signal extraction from observations. This work defines a mathematical framework for an item-fetching domain that allows a robot to increase the speed and accuracy of its ability to interpret a person's requests by reasoning about its own uncertainty as well as processing implicit information (implicatures). We formalize the item-delivery domain as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and approximately solve this POMDP in real time. Our model improves speed and accuracy of fetching tasks by asking relevant clarifying questions only when necessary. To measure our model's improvements, we conducted a real world user study with 16 participants. Our method achieved greater accuracy and a faster interaction time compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our model is 2.17 seconds faster (25% faster) than a state-of-the-art baseline, while being 2.1% more accurate.
