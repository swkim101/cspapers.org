We introduce the online interval scheduling problem, in which a set of intervals of the positive real line is presented to a scheduling algorithm in order of start time. Upon seeing each interval, the algorithm must decide whether or not to \schedule" it. Overlapping intervals may not be scheduled together. We give a strongly 2-competitive algorithm for the case in which intervals must be one of two lengths, either length 1 or length k (cid:29) 1. For the general case in which intervals may have arbitrary lengths, (cid:1), the ratio of longest to shortest interval, is the important parameter. We give an algorithm with competitive factor O((log(cid:1)) 1+(cid:15) ), and show that no O(log(cid:1))- competitive algorithm can exist. Our algorithm need not know the ratio (cid:1) in advance.
