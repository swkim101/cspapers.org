Effects of operations on abstract data objects are often difficult for students to comprehend. Visual models can be helpful to students, when the connections among the data object models, virtual machine representations of data objects, and algorithms operating on the data objects are made clear to the students.
This paper discusses the design criteria used to develop a series of Pascal programs, implemented on widely used microcomputers, which make use of graphics to illustrate the effects of programming algorithms on common data structures. These programs were designed to be used in classroom demonstrations and by individual students working in the computing laboratory.1
A non-machine specific design of an algorithm teacher is proposed. It is a programmed environment to help students in a beginning computer science course learn problem solving skills. This paper provides an overview of the problem, a motivation and justification, followed by a brief description of what the program should provide the student.
