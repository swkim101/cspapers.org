We consider estimating the parametric component of single index models in high dimensions. Compared with existing work, we do not require the covariate to be normally distributed. Utilizing Steinâ€™s Lemma, we propose estimators based on the score function of the covariate. Moreover, to handle score function and response variables that are heavy-tailed, our estimators are constructed via carefully thresholding their empirical counterparts. Under a bounded fourth moment condition, we establish optimal statistical rates of convergence for the proposed estimators. Extensive numerical experiments are provided to back up our theory.
