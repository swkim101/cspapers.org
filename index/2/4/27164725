By now, most people are familiar with the Java 2 platform and how Sun has grouped Java technologies into three editions (Standard, Micro and Enterprise Editions). Sun introduced the Java 2, Micro Edition (J2ME) in June 1999 to address the needs of the consumer electronics and embedded devices community. Specifically, the J2ME was built for devices with limited power, network connectivity (often wireless), and graphical user interface capabilities.
Today, the J2ME provides a Java platform to an incredibly diverse set of devices. Generally speaking, this space covers devices with less computing capabilities than a personal computer, yet more capabilities than a smart card.
