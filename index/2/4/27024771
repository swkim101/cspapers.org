A high speed target tracking system using a two-dimensional vision sensor with cell-parallel processing capabilities is described. A general purpose processing element connected to each sensing element processes various vision tasks in data parallel at a speed far beyond the video rate. The sensor architecture is simple and scalable, and assumes that this vision should be implemented into a VLSI chip. The cycle time of parallel processing vision is 670 /spl mu/s in the case of their experimental target tracking system. By using the fast position signals, the system has attained target tracking at the actuator speed limit.
