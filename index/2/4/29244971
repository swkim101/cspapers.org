For the automatic vectorization and concurrentization of Fortran- or Pascal-like programs the dependencies have to be determined and to be observed with every transformation. The full dependence relation is a transitive relation. Direct dependencies are defined as such dependencies that cannot be represented transitively by other dependencies.
It will be shown that information about the direct dependencies is useful for renaming and expansion of structured variables. Indeed, many other transformations that are applied for automatic parallelization and program restructuring can be extended in this way. Though some extensions have already been made by other authors, with the concept of direct dependencies a uniform theoretical background for all these transformations is given.
As most known dependence tests do not give information about direct dependencies, it is also explained how to determine direct dependencies.
