Model Predictive Control is becoming more and more present in robotic applications. It has been successfully used in control of humanoid robots to adjust positions of the footsteps in order to satisfy stability constraints. In this paper we show how to adapt such scheme for a quadruped robot utilizing a static walking. The MPC is used to provide a center of mass projection reference, keeping it within support polygons to ensure stability. User is given freedom in choosing the desired dynamical behavior of the reference. The proposed control framework is tested in simulation and on a real quadruped robot. An emphasize is put on generality of such approach which is independent of gait parameters.
