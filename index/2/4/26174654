The objective of this tutorial is to provide the participants with opportunities to think differently about future challenges facing software engineering research and practice. Collaborative design, social creativity, and meta-design are identified as themes that will be of great importance in the years to come. The concept of design is used very broadly affecting all aspects of the process of creating, using, and evolving software-intensive systems. Stakeholders coming from different disciplines and engaging in collaborative design can contribute to social creativity by exploring new approaches, new problems, and new visions. Meta-design is a methodology empowering users to act not only as passive consumers but as active contributors and designers, thereby facilitating and supporting social creativity.The themes of the tutorial will be illustrated with specific theoretical frameworks and innovative systems. The relevance of these themes has been demonstrated by their desirability and importance on research, education, and design practices in companies, educational institutions, and research organizations.
