Women make up 51% of our population, yet they represent only 10% of those currently employed as scientists. Recognizing the underutilized scientific resource that women represent the congress of the United States directed the National Science Foundation to make available not less than $1,500,000 to develop and test methods of increasing the flow of women into scientific careers. (Public Law 94-80, 1976)
 To carry out this mandate, NSF sent out a call for proposals in early 1976. The proposals were to be of two kinds: (1) Science Career Workshops where women students would be introduced to and hopefully motivated into choosing careers in the sciences and (2) Career Facilitation Projects where women who have scientific training but are not using it could be brought up to date and made ready to enter the job market or enter graduate school.
 This paper describes the Career Facilitation Project being undertaken by the Computer Sciences Department of the University of Texas at Austin, supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant #SMI6-20420.
