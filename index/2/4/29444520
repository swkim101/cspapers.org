A smart phone subscriber needs wide bandwidth services for more fast data communication on the internet. The conventional MIMO system is now developing to resolve these problems with limited device space for antenna and frequency band environment reserved. One of a way to make it practically is to add the number of antennas theoretically. But it is difficult to increase the antenna element as a limited space on the system. Therefore an active beam forming scheme is known as a way of constructing a low power MIMO system for that. In this paper, the fast switching control block was suggested to adjust a reactance of the antenna element and verified experimentally the effects by switching signal on an orthogonal beam forming through a spatial domain.
