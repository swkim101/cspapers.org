Active learning is becoming increasingly popular as a way to engage students and to provide social support. Providing social support is important because it has been shown to improve both student retention (Slavin 1990, Tinto 1987, Wenger 1999) and performance (Hsiung 2012, Kulkarni 2015, MacNeil 2015). Most forms of active learning use a flipped classroom model of teaching where students are expected to interact with materials, such as lecture videos, alone before class and then engage in active learning during class time (Lage 2000). In our previous work with team-based learning, students generally preferred learning in face-to-face teams (MacNeil 2016). To support co-located teams outside of class, we propose the design for a mobile app that is currently in development which uses students' location to form ad-hoc social learning opportunities for students that are located near each other. We take inspiration from flash teams, which create dynamic expert teams based on the availability of experts online (Retelny 2014). Our app will create teams based on the availability of students and their range of expertise, while leveraging additional context, such as student's location and intention. Students upload course topics that they are struggling with and a general geo-location. The app opportunistically pairs students and suggests that they arrange to meet based on either a geo-location match, a topic match, or preferably, both. In designing our prototype, we consider the possibility of suggesting exercises or assignments that students could work on together. Finally, we provide a brief discussion of the theoretical opportunities and challenges associated with using student's location for ad-hoc social learning.
