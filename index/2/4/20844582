We propose the correlated mobile k-hop clustered networks model to implement correlated node movements and scalable clusters. We divide network states into three categories, i.e., cluster-sparse state, cluster-dense state and cluster-inferior dense state, and achieve the critical transmission range for the last two states. Furthermore, we find that correlated mobility and cluster scalability are closely related with each other and the impact of these two properties on connectivity is mainly through influencing network state transition.
