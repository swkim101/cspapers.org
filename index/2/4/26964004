This paper describes a wireless routing method that can be applied in automatic electricity/water meter reading in building. The routing method is based on the geologic location of the sending and receiving devices. In this case, the geologic location is the combination of floor, area and room within a building. The method is built on the application layer of Zigbee protocol [1] [2], which is a reliable and energy-saving protocol. The Zigbee stack (z-stack 1.4.3 of Texas Instrument) are applied on kit CC2431DK [3] of Texas Instrument. In addition, several test cases, which verify the routing method in some special contexts, are also considered.
