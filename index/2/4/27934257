An image processor based on an arrayed structure was implemented.. It has five design features: (1) memory unit separation into a picture memory for images and a control data memory for programs, (2) processing unit separation into a parallel processing part and a serial processing part, (3) parallel processing by an arrayed structure, (if) use of a special micro-processor for an array's processing element, and (5) direct control of parallel processing by programming. It deals with images consisting of 256 Ã— 256 pixels and processes them by sixteen processing elements. The original images are given by a TV camera. The processed images are outputted to CRT display equipments. The basic operations in the array are data conversions, local operations, sequential processings, manipulations between two images and so on. By using those operations, many kinds of image processing can be done in this processor.
