Computer scientists require a precise and complete understanding of recursion. Earlier work has indicated that recursion merits attention in CS1 [2]. We present a simple test question that, when used in a final exam for three courses over two semesters, is shown to significantly predict student performance on the final. To evaluate student responses, we present an evaluation rubric that directly reveals common misconceptions about recursion and recursive procedures.
