Iris recognition has emerged as a vital and tested methodology for research investigations and routine security applications in the context of increasing security requirements. Thus biometrics has attained a very significant place in human verification and identification. In this paper, an efficient and precised methodology is brought out through using Fisher linear discriminant analysis method and principal component analysis method. These methodologies create different sections in low dimensional sub space. The suggested system in this research work contains four components i.e. preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and matching. The preprocessing part again consist of pupil localization, image refinement, iris localization and normalization procedures. The suggested algorithm in this research paper was tested on CASIA Iris image database. The soundness and time efficiency of the suggested algorithm proves it as perfect technique for real time applications.
