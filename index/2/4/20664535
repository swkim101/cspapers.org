In this paper, we describe a method using semantic constraints to reduce the ambiguities and generate case structure from phrase structure in Chinese sentence analysis. 
 
Semantic constraints written on semantic markers indicate the plausible case structure. Different sets of semantic markers are chosen according to the purpose. A priority evaluation scheme steers the analysis towards the most plausible structure first, without trying all possibilities.
