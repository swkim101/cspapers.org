The authors deal with Esprit II programme PANORAMA project which develops a generic perception and navigation system for mobile robotic machines operating in partially unstructured environments like outdoor work sites. The system is described in a general level and the functions of the subsystems are explained. One of the subsystems, the piloting system, is considered in more detailed. The final demonstration which is done by using a full scaled mining machine, is explained and results and experiences on the project summarized.
