In this demo, we will show the implementation of a content-based SPatial Image Retrieval Engine (SPIRE) for multimodal unstructured data. This architecture provides a framework for retrieving multi-modal data including image, image sequence, time series and parametric data from large archives. Dramatic speedup (from a factor of 4 to 35) has been achieved for many search operations such as template matching, texture feature extraction. This framework has been applied and validated in solar flares and petroleum exploration in which spatial and spatial-temporal phenomena are located.
