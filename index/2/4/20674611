In this paper we investigate a series of candidate regular planar mesh geometries in terms of their suitability for utilization as mesh primitives for constructing compliant robotic structures. In prior work, we established a framework of compliant, articulate robotic meshes, termed Modular Active Cell Robots (MACROs), created from contractile Shape Memory Alloy linear-actuators (Active Cells). In this paper, we examine how to utilize these MACROs and other mesh-like robots in large regular or semi-regular topologies. We evaluate axial strains and stiffness characteristics for a range of MACRO meshes created using different mesh-primitives, which are drawn from known regular space-filling lattice geometries. We then describe the implications of these results on the design of MACRO structures, including the tradeoffs between different primitives for various structural performance properties.
