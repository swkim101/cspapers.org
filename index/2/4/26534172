The concept of atomic (ACID) transactions has played a cornerstone role in creating today's enterprise application environments. While numerous multi-party business applications involve various patterns based on atomic transactions, it was not until recently the term “business transactions” accumulated any concrete meaning. Rapid developments in the Internet infrastructure and protocols have yielded a new type of application interoperation that makes concepts which could only previously be considered in an abstract form an implementation reality. The effects of such changes have been felt most strongly in business environments, fuelling the mindset for a transition from traditional atomic transactions to extended transaction models better suited for Internet interoperation.
