Curriculum '68 has been credited with being the document that established computer science as a new discipline separate from Mathematics. It became the model for the creation of new college programs in computer science. The Committee that produced Curriculum '68 is being honored at this Symposium as the winner of the SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions in Computer Science Education. This session will give the Curriculum '68 Committee members in attendance at the Technical Symposium an opportunity to share their perspectives on the evolution of computer science as a discipline. They will also share their views on the education of computer and information sciences personnel, and offer their perspective on computer science education in the future. This session will offer a unique opportunity for today's generation of computer science educators to learn from the experiences of the Curriculum '68 Committee members. This session is a Special Event being held to celebrate and commemorate the 21'st birthday of SIGCSE.
