Over the last 10+ years, large datacenters have benefited from computer technology and physical infrastructure advances that substantially improved their efficiency. However, there is still much room for improvement, as the datacenters' computational resources are often poorly utilized and technology advances are starting to falter. In this talk, I will discuss some interesting avenues for continued efficiency improvement driven by smarter software, including greater use of parallelism and predictive workload scheduling.
