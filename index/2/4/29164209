While most research has been directed toward machines and humans, the principles and methods developed for AI might be extended to other species as well. Birds frequently behave in a manner that is intelligent and convey information in their vocalizations that is meaningful to others. In this paper we report on a method combining clustering and dynamic Bayesian networks to describe the semantics of songs among Cassinâ€™s Vireos (Vireo cassinii), and show how behavioral contexts possibly affect bird song output.
