Simulation of dynamic systems by use of analog computers is well established as a practical tool of the control engineer. With the advent of fast digital computers, it has become not only feasible but attractive to perform many such investigations using digital simulation. As an example, a study of a simple control system is presented to illustrate the ease and flexibility of this technique in design.
 Digital simulation permits the engineer who has no specialized training in computer programming or operation to readily utilize simulation in both the design and analysis aspects of his work. It has proven a fast, effective, and economical tool for general investigations of continuous, dynamic systems and is of particular interest to the practicing control engineer.
