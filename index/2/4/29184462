The Computer Program Library, a compilation of computer programs coded in FORTRAN and executed in the batch mode, facilitates both direct and adjunct use of the computer by students. A six year project, the library now contains over 290 fully-documented subprograms and programs which engineering students utilize for problem-solving, independent study projects, and research. In addition, the library provides the instructor with a ready source of material which may be used to augment course content in several ways. The computer program library concept has proven to be an effective method of implementing computer augmented engineering education, especially in curricular areas not adequately serviced by task-oriented software and/or in small emerging educational institutions.
