In this paper, a development of a single DOF joint drive mechanism using regenerative servo clutches is described. The regenerative servo clutch is a kind of a clutch developed by the authors which consists of a regenerative brake and a differential gear mechanism, and it can control the transmitted torque by controlling the regenerative brake torque. The joint drive mechanism developed in this study is the system which can perform the servo control of the angle of the output shaft using the externally provided constant-speed power directly, by controlling the transmitted torque by using the two regenerative servo clutches for normal and reverse rotation. Through the experimental results, the effectiveness of the developed mechanism and controller was confirmed.
