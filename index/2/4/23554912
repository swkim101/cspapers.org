Projects using Object Oriented technology typically fall into one of two categories: either they are run with traditional project management techniques, or they are run by "technology experts" who don't use any project management techniques. This panel will attempt to give out some hints as to how to be more successful managing OO projects.Questions to be addressed include:&bull; How is Object Oriented Project Management different? Is a "paradigm shift" required for project management?&bull; What aspects of Object Oriented project management should be stressed? What are some tips, tricks or gotchas experienced by the panel members?&bull; Does a project manager need to be more technical to lead an Object Oriented project? Should he/she have had previous experience with Object Oriented development?&bull; What are some alternate organizational structures which would better support Object Oriented projects?&bull; What is the nature of an Object Oriented life cycle and how is it different?&bull; Is there a difference in techniques between different languages or between different domainsAudience members with relevant experience will be invited to sit on the panel in two "guest" seats.
