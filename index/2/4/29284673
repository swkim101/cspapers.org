Among the most prominent aspects of office automation is the concept of electronic mail. Despite the fact that numerous â€œOffice of the Future&" descriptions seem to focus upon electronic mail as a great opportunity, seldom is it treated as a phenomenon in its own right rather than product. More often it seems to be a technological byproduct, available to counter certain specific business ailments, most notably the inefficiency of transportation of packaged messages. Despite the obvious advantages of E-mail, it is not seen as either essential to office of the future as a concept or as theoretically interesting to researchers.
 Several commentators, however, have pointed out that messaging may be an alternative form of interpersonal communication (See Bair [l]), without especially treating messaging as a core concept in office automation.
 This paper proposes to open the debate, not into the technical or behavioral feasibility of E-mail or the other messaging manifestations, nor into the economic benefits of implementation, but rather into the foundations of pre-programmed, non-real-time verbal interaction (printed and oral) as a general phenomenon.
