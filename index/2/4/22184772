Current works on FCN has brought great advances in the task of semantic segmentation, but the receptive field, which represents region areas of input volume connected to any output neuron, limits the available information of output neuron's prediction accuracy. We investigate how to involve the full-scale or full-image features into FCNs to enrich the receptive field. Specially, the full-scale feature network (FFN) extends the full-connected network and makes an end-to-end unified training structure. It has two appealing properties. First, the introduction of full-scale-features is beneficial for prediction. We build a unified extracting network and explore several fusion functions for concatenating features. Amounts of experiments have been carried out to prove that full-scale-features makes fair accuracy raising. Second, FFN is applicable to many variants of FCN which could be regarded as a general strategy to improve the segmentation accuracy. Our proposed method is evaluated on PASCAL VOC 2012, and achieves a state-of-art result.
