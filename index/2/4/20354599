The Eclipse platform was originally designed for building an integrated development environment for object-oriented applications. Over the years it has developed into a vibrant ecosystem of platforms, toolkits, libraries, modeling frameworks, and tools that support various languages and programming styles. The seventh ETX workshop provides a platform for researchers and practitioners to transfer knowledge about the Eclipse Platform and exchange new ideas. It is held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on October 27th, 2015 and co-located with SPLASH 2015.
