â€˜Traditionally, efficient algorithms for computing a minimal triangulation of a graph (i.e. embedding a graph into a triangulated graph by adding an inclusion-minimal set of edges) required first computing a special ordering on the vertices of the graph, called a minimal ordering. We give a new algorithm which efficiently computes a minimal triangulation using an arbitrary ordering on the vertices.
