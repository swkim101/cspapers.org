Many gesture interfaces such as "Put-That-There" require operators to wear special devices such as "Data-Glove" to make the system recognize hand gestures. However, wearing such devices prevents the realization of a natural interface. We have developed the "Finger-Pointer" experimental system, which can recognize pointing actions and simple hand forms in realtime by image processing. The operator is not required to physically contact any control devices. We present the details of the image processing techniques employed, and a principle for stable measurement of pointing direction. We also solved the time lag problem with multi-channel integration.
