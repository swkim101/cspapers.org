Power thermal and process limitations encourage modern processors to integrate few cores on the same die in order to maintain overall performance growth, expected by the industry. While two years ago, most processors where single core configuration, the majority of the current processors contain dual or quad cores and the number of cores on die is expected to grow over time.
