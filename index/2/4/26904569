This panel will describe several points of view and experiences in dealing with “non-traditional” computing science students by offering several definitions and descriptions of the non-traditional student, by describing programs and curricula designed to meet their needs, and experiences and challenges presented by these populations of students. Non-traditional students are generally thought to be older students returning to college for a degrees and generally carrying with them external job and family responsibilities, and frequently entering as part-time students. However, there are other characteristics that make a large number of potential students be classified as “non-traditional”. Audience participation will be encouraged.
