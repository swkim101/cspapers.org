One research topic is how to exploit and utilize the correlations among various features across multiple views with the aim of improving the performance of learning tasks, such as classification. In this paper, we propose a new multi-view feature learning algorithm that simultaneously analyzes features from different views. Compared to most of the existing subspace learning methods that only focus on exploiting a shared latent subspace, our algorithm not only learns individual information in each view but also captures feature correlations among multiple views by learning a shared component. By assuming that such a component is shared by all views, we simultaneously exploit the shared component and individual information of each view in a batch mode. Since the objective function is non-smooth and difficult to solve, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm for optimization with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm performs better than all the compared multi-view learning algorithms.
