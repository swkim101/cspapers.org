YottaYotta provides a summary of its Global Data Sharing project at the Data Intensive Computing Environment (DICE). DICE provides a multi-agency environment aimed at reducing the time-to-solution for complex data intensive problems in a diverse geographical setting over real-world wide area networks.One of the serious barriers to global data sharing is the challenge of data locality. In order to ensure optimal utilization of globally distributed IT resources, data must be both "local" and "global" at the same time. Users must ensure that their data is "local" so that processing at any given site can progress without the delays of remote I/O or file transfer. However, at the same time, the data must be "global" so that it remains consistent, while offering coherency of data access between sites. YottaYotta presents a new architecture that leverages clustered file systems and enables site agnostic resource scheduling across wide area heterogeneous storage environments.
