While building nine object-oriented financial systems since 1989, we evolved techniques for modeling “financial vehicles” (bonds, contracts, real estate, racehorses). We specify each particular financial vehicle and vehicle type by combining objects that model the fundamental ideas behind financial vehicles. These techniques enable installed systems to accommodate new kinds of financial vehicles. Many normal software design techniques proved ineffective.
