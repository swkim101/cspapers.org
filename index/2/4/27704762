In this paper, we propose a new approach to automatically compose data providing Web services. Our approach exploits existing mature works done in data integration systems. Specifically, data providing services are modeled as RDF Parameterized views over mediated ontologies. Then, an RDF oriented algorithm to compose services based on query rewriting techniques was devised. We apply also an optimization algorithm on the generated composition to speed up its execution. The results of our experiments show that the algorithms scale up very well up to a large number of services, covering thus most realistic applications.
