Simplified control strategies based on the concept of "Final Position Control" for free reaching movements of the human upper limb have been simulated in a model incorporating six lumped muscles. The resulting movement repertoires bear some resemblance to normal human movements, but do not provide a complete explanation for observed behavior. The significance of these findings are discussed, and some implications for manipulator control are suggested.
