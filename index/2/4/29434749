A chordless cycle in a graph $G$ is an induced subgraph of $G$ which is a cycle of length at least four. We prove that the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property holds for chordless cycles, which resolves the major open question concerning the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. Our proof for chordless cycles is constructive: in polynomial time, one can find either $k+1$ vertex-disjoint chordless cycles, or $ck^2 \log k$ vertices hitting every chordless cycle for some constant $c$. It immediately implies an approximation algorithm of factor $\mathcal{O}(\sf{opt}\log {\sf opt})$ for Chordal Vertex Deletion. We complement our main result by showing that chordless cycles of length at least $\ell$ for any fixed $\ell\ge 5$ do not have the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. 
As a corollary, for a non-negative integral function $w$ defined on the vertex set of a graph $G$, the minimum value $\sum_{x\in S}w(x)$ over all vertex sets $S$ hitting all cycles of $G$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(k^2 \log k)$ where $k$ is the maximum number of cycles (not necessarily vertex-disjoint) in $G$ such that each vertex $v$ is used at most $w(v)$ times.
