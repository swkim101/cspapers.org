This paper presents a first attempt towards finding an abstractive compression generation system for a set of related sentences which jointly models sentence fusion and paraphrasing using continuous vector representations. Our paraphrastic fusion system improves the informativity and the grammaticality of the generated sentences. Our system can be applied to various real world applications such as text simplification, microblog, opinion and newswire summarization. We conduct our experiments on human generated multi-sentence compression datasets and evaluate our system on several newly proposed Machine Translation (MT) evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our method brings significant improvements over the state of the art systems across different metrics.
