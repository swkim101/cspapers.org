The PLUSS approach (Product Line Use case modeling for Systems and Software engineering) is a domain modeling method tailored towards the development of long lived software intensive systems. PLUSS provides means to maintain a common and complete use case model for a whole family of systems. In this paper, we describe how the commercial requirements management tool Telelogic DOORS and the UML modeling tool IBM-Rational Rose can be extended and used for managing system family models in accordance with the PLUSS approach.
