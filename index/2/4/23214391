The enrollment in introductory computer science courses has been growing steadily for the last couple of years. Interest in the field is exploding across the nation. Colleges and universities of all shapes and sizes have seen enrollment in introductory computer science courses and to some extent in upper-division electives explode as well. Most R1 institutions handle such growth through the use of graduate TAs to teach CS1 courses. Many primarily undergraduate and/or liberal arts institutions don't have these resources, however. Complicating the scenario further, students coming to these non-research institutions expect personal interaction, are from a growingly diverse set of high-school graduates and seem to be less prepared for college than ever. Given the current funding climate for higher education, it is difficult to imagine how most universities and colleges will be able to negotiate this scenario. This BOF will provide a platform to discuss how to handle the growing, diverse, and uninitiated CS1 enrollment from many perspectives - individual, departmental, and institutional. What creative solutions can be brought to improve institutional motivation and how do we ensure that traditionally under-represented groups don't get left behind in the onslaught?
