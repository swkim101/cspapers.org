In this paper, we present an effective and accurate gaze estimation method based on two-eye model of a subject with the tolerance of free head movement from a Kinect sensor. To accurately and efficiently determine the point of gaze, i) we employ two-eye model to improve the estimation accuracy; ii) we propose an improved convolution-based means of gradients method to localize the iris center in 3D space; iii) we present a new personal calibration method that only needs one calibration point. The method approximates the visual axis as a line from the iris center to the gaze point to determine the eyeball centers and the Kappa angles. The final point of gaze can be calculated by using the calibrated personal eye parameters. We experimentally evaluate the proposed gaze estimation method on eleven subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that our gaze estimation method has an average estimation accuracy around 1.99Â°, which outperforms many leading methods in the state-of-the-art.
