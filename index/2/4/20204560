Coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission of distributed antenna systems is efficient in performance improvement for wireless communications, and it has been considered in the specifications of LTE-Advanced. Base station (BS) or transmit point (TP) selection is necessary and important for a system with a large number of BSs or TPs. A grouped TP selection and reporting scheme is proposed and investigated in this paper. The performance of the scheme, as regards to average capacity and edge user capacity, and the cost of implementation are studied, and it is compared with the optimum scheme and two other schemes. The grouped scheme, compared to the optimum TP selection exhibits a good performance but with a low feedback burden.
