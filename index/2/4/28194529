The varied and complex dynamics of deformable terrain are significant impediments toward real-world viability of locomotive robotics, particularly for legged machines. We explore vertical jumping on granular media (GM) as a model task for legged locomotion on uncharacterized deformable terrain. By integrating (Gaussian process) GP-based regression and evaluation to estimate ground forcing as a function of state, a one-dimensional jumper acquires the ability to learn forcing profiles exerted by its environment in tandem to achieving its control objective. The GP-based dynamical model initially assumes a baseline rigid, non-compliant surface. As part of an iterative procedure, the optimizer employing this model generates an optimal control to achieve a target jump height while respecting known hardware limitations of the robot model. Trajectory and forcing data recovered from evaluation on the true GM surface model simulation is applied to train the GP, and in turn, provide the optimizer a more richly informed dynamical model of the environment. After three iterations, predicted optimal control trajectories coincide with execution results, within 1.2% jumping height error, as the GP-based approximation converges to the true GM model.
