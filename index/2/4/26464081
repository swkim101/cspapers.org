Density tapered array has a feature of having uniform excitations in all array elements. Then, a feeding network becomes very simple and array antenna will be applied for multi frequency operations. In this paper, a MATLAB program of achieving arbitrary density tapered distributions is developed. For example, the density distribution of cosine on a pedestal is designed. Moreover, radiation patterns in the wide range of frequencies are investigated. For the frequency change from 900 MHz to 2500 MHz, low side lobe levels are kept unchanged.
