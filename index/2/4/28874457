The Microsoft SQL Server storage engine was rearchitected to support row level locking in Version 7.0. This required significant changes throughout the store; from page update primitives, logging and recovery, to accessmethods. One interesting engineering aspect of this project was the fact that we kept the system running during the entire transformation of the underlying architecture â€“ a task we liken to transforming a zebra into a cheetah by transplanting one organ at a time. This talk will focus on how real-world pragmatics collided with academic purity and what solutions resulted.
