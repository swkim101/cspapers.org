We comprehensively investigate beat noise cancellation in 2-D OCDMA systems using OHL array considering the real shape of optical pulse. The receiver's noises and multiple access interference (MAI) as well as the impact of pulse propagation are all taken into account. The numerical results show that, when OHL array is employed, the performance of 2-D OCDMA systems is much improved compared with the other cases of without OHL array. In addition, the 2-D OCDMA systems using OHL array can meet the requirements of the optical access networks in both number of users and transmission length. For example, with the average transmitted power per chip is âˆ’12 dBm, the system can support 30 users at bit rate 1 Gbit/s and maximum transmission length of 33 km. Other necessary parameters for practical system design also can be found in this paper including required transmitted power and optimum threshold.
