It is well known in the HPC community that latency is critical and that CLOS architectures are key to scalable, low-latency, high-bandwidth systems. The critical element in the further scalability of these systems is the emergence of a robust, multi-vendor ecosystem for low-latency interconnect components with a low cost. Ethernet has the cross-market appeal, and comprises a majority of HPC systems, but is not yet seen as a performance leader. This presentation will expose the audience to new capabilities in Ethernet that make it suitable for the highest performance systems. In particular, TCP/IP/Ethernet interconnect technology now has: 1) 10 Gbps data rate 2) Extremely low latency 3) Full protocol offload and acceleration 4) Scalable, non-blocking topologies (fat trees, etc.) 5) Congestion management enhancements 6) Aggressive Ethernet-ecosystem pricing The presentation will include simulation results to show interconnect and congestion management performance in an HPC cluster from an end-to-end system perspective.
