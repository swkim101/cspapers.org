The retrieval of documents from DSRS is even easier than the storage, The user describes the document by date, subject, or any of the categories under which it was stored. Within seconds, the document appears on the Quick-Look-Monitor. The user inspects the QLM screen to see if it is the proper document. If so, the doeument is then printed out on the Document Writer, and a hardcopy appears, looking just like a copy of the original document.
