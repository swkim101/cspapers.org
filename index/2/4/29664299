This poster explores the differential effects of formal undergraduate research experiences on the graduate degree intentions of underrepresented racial-ethnic minority and racial majority computing majors. Across two studies, it was found that formal undergraduate research experiences in computing have a greater and more positive effect on the educational aspirations of underrepresented racial-ethnic minorities as compared to racial majorities. For underrepresented racial-ethnic minorities, this effect is manifested in the gains in academic and career self-efficacy and gains in knowledge about the graduate admission process they develop as a result of their formal research experience. Together, these findings suggest that psychosocial skills that are strengthened during formal undergraduate research experiences play an important role in influencing the educational intentions of underrepresented racial-ethnic minorities in the field of computer science.
