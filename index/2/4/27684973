Pattern-Based Programming Instruction (PBPI) is a theory-based approach to teaching programming that focusses on the nature of programming problems and their solutions rather than on the syntax and semantics of a language. Using PBPI encourages students to write good code; provides students with building blocks for designing larger programs; and allows instructors to teach programming process rather than language details.
