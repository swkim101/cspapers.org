This paper presents the technologies we developed for transmitting video contents over heterogeneous wireless platforms. The video delivery and presentation schemes are encapsulated into a user-oriented, content-aware, and device-adjustable client system for accessing a multimodal, multilingual digital video library. The mobile access system, iVIEW client, provides a friendly user interface that meets the challenge of rich multimodal information presentation on wireless hand-held devices. An XML schema is employed to organize the multimodal metadata for better data interoperability. Furthermore, we investigated a context awareness mechanism complementary to the XML schema to facilitate scalable degradation under restricted resources in a wireless application environment.
