In many cases, sensornets require continuous monitoring, 24x7, at remote, inaccessible locations making energy management a critical part of most sensornets. The sensornet research community has explored energy conservation and energy harvesting to address this problem of long-lived sensornets. Energy conservation is a primary concern in almost all sensornet work, and techniques from low-power hardware and OSes to coordinated network protocols and applications. Complementing energy conservation, energy harvesting gathers new energy from the environment.
