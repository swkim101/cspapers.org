In 2004, Jiang et al. presented a secure communication between set-top-box and smart card in DTV broadcasting. Their proposed protocol has following merits: security, dynamic session key, mutual authentication, lower computation and communication and users could freely chosen password. Moreover, the proposed scheme could prevent smart card clone and MacCormac Hack problems which are serious problems in DTV broadcasting. However, Jiang et al.'s scheme causes much computation and communication overhead of smart cards and STBs. In this paper, we propose an efficient secure communication between set-top box and smart card in DTV broadcasting. Our propose scheme not only has the same merits as that of Jiang et al.'s scheme but also significantly reduces the computation and communication cost. Therefore, our scheme only requires several hashing operations in both smart card side and STB side, and has a very small quantity of transmission data.
