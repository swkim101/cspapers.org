The Exploration, Navigation and Retrieval of Information in Cultural Heritage Workshop (ENRICH 2013) offers a forum to 1) discuss the challenges and opportunities in Information Retrieval research in the area of Cultural Heritage; 2) encourage collaboration between researchers engaged in work in this specialist area of Information Retrieval, and to foster the formation of a research community; and 3) identify a set of actions which the community should undertake to progress the research agenda. The workshop will foster a new stream of Information Retrieval research and support the design of search tools that can help end-users fully exploit the wonderful Cultural Heritage material that is available across the globe.
