A review of literature in the Digital Humanities field reveals ongoing research on curriculum development. Case studies highlight projects as a means of teaching humanities computing. From a computing perspective, a literature review reveals studies on building successful programming curricula across disciplines; implementing project-based learning ; the role of Computer Science departments in inter-disciplinary studies and the role of teaching web programming to non-majors. Students must fulfill two pre-requisites in order to attend our class: at least one semester each in web design and programming in a high-level language (e.g. Python or Java). CS majors are welcome to take this as an elective. This course was given for the fourth time in the fall, 2012 term. Topics in this course focus on the following subjects and projects: textual analysis by writing programs in Python; a text encoding project using XML with adherence to current Text Encoding Initiative standards (see TEI - http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml); building an on-line archive from primary source materials using xHTML/CSS, XML, XSLT and JavaScript; and creating works of software art using Processing /Java (http://processing.org/). Students are exposed to current research throughout the Digital Humanities by a series of guest lectures given by NYU faculty from the departments of English, History, Museum Studies, and Classics.
