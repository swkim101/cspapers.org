Developing large-scale systems are major efforts which require careful planning and solid methodological foundations. This paper describes CASE-METHOD, the methodology for building large-scale case-based systems. CASEMETHOD defines the procedure which managers, engineers, and domain experts should follow in developing case-based systems, and provides a set of supporting tools. An empirical study shows that the use of CASE-METHOD attains significant workload reduction in system development and maintenance (more than 1/12) as well as qualitative change in corporate activities.
