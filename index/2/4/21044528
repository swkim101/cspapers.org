Physical and mathematical models are developed for kinematic sections of NUSTBOT-I a four degrees of freedom two legged robot. A brief review of robot construction and control is presented first. Detailed word bond-graph model is included to give an idea of the whole robotic structure. Each kinematic section is represented by a simplified schematic diagram and its bond-graph model is generated. These models are used to develop state-space representation for all kinematic sections. Also based on these bond-graph models motion profile simulations are generated using 20-Sim modeling and simulation software.
