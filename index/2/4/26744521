This study proposes a method for estimating the contact force of the fingertip by inputting vibrations actively. The use of active bone-conducted sound sensing has been limited to estimating the joint angle of the elbow and the finger. We applied it to the method for estimating the contact force of the fingertip. Unlike related works, it is not necessary to mount the device on a fingertip, and tactile feedback is enabled using tangible vibrations.
