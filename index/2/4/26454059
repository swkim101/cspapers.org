This paper discusses a way of capturing a spinning object using two flexible manipulators. We propose a capturing procedure using hybrid position/force control and vibration suppression control. The procedure is established so that the manipulators capture the object automatically measuring position and rotational velocity of the object. The motion of the two hands of the manipulators are synchronized with the rotation of the object. The hands make contact with the spinning object safely, considering link flexibility, and then brake the spin smoothly. The effectiveness of our method is shown in experiments using two 3D manipulators, each of which has two flexible links and seven joints.
