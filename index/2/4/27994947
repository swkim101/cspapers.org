This paper proposes a walk structure consisting of a dynamic pattern, a sensory reflex and a motion adjustment. The dynamic pattern is generated off-line based on the constraint of dynamic stability, assuming that the models of the humanoid and the environment are known. The sensory reflex is simple, but rapid motion programmed in respect to sensory information. The sensory reflex increases the humanoid adaptability to environmental uncertainties, but it may conflict with humanoid its constraints. To solve this problem, the walking constraints violated easily by the sensory reflex are formulated, and the method to coordinate the dynamic pattern and the sensory reflex through the motion adjustment is present. The effectiveness was confirmed by walk experiments of our developed 31 DOF humanoid.
