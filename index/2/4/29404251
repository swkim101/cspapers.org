Many colleges and universities offer an introductory computer science course based on a specific programming language. The Department of Computer Science at the University of Kansas has recently created a new environment in order to better teach such topics as problem solving, algorithmic design, elementary programming techniques, and elementary computer techniques. This paper will discuss the transition from a time-sharing environment to a modern microcomputer laboratory. It will also discuss the pedagogic techniques used in the new environment. It is hoped that others will benefit from our experiences.
