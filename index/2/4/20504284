To communicate across a network system, entities within the system need to be able to identify one another. An identifier usually takes the form of a name or an address. Conventions for the assignment of these identifiers and their resolution affect many aspects of network design. Identification is thus a crucial issue for network architecture and standardization. In this paper, our discussion is first devoted to the semantics of names, addresses, and routes, with emphasis on the relationships among them. We then examine the implications of layered network architecture, syntactic differences of identifiers, and broadcast communication. Finally, we turn our attention to naming and addressing in large dynamic networks.
