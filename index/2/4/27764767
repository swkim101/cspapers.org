Internet-of-Things devices need sensors with low power footprint and capable of producing semantically rich data. Promising candidates are spiking sensors that use asynchronous Address-Event Representation (AER) carrying information within inter-spike times. To minimize the overhead of coupling AER sensors with off-the-shelf microcontrollers, we propose an FPGA-based methodology that i) tags the AER spikes with timestamps to make them carriable by standard interfaces (e.g. I2S, SPI); ii) uses a recursively divided clock generated on-chip by a pausable ring-oscillator, to reduce power while keeping accuracy above 97% on timestamps. We prototyped our methodology on a IGLOOnano AGLN250 FPGA, consuming less than 4.5mW under a 550kevt/s spike rate (i.e. a noisy environment), and down to 50uW in absence of spikes.
