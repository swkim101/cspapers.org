This paper is a brief discussion of the preliminary specifications design automation system (DAS) for digital devices. The goal of the proposed system is to allow a systems designer to describe his initial requirements to evaluate and modify his design as it passes through the various stages automatic implementation. The development of this system is motivated by need for eneration of an extensive library of designs for use in the UCLA Variable Structure Computer System<supscrpt>1</supscrpt> and by the need for a framework in which optimization research studies may be carried out. It is hoped that this system may also provide information and tools for the many industrial organizations who cannot Justify investment in a design automation system.
 Design automation has been the subject of serious study both in universities and in industry for several years.<supscrpt>2-7</supscrpt> Several programs for writing logical equations, <supscrpt>8,9</supscrpt> optimizing boolean equations,<supscrpt>10,11</supscrpt> placing circuit modules, <supscrpt>12-14</supscrpt> routing wires, <supscrpt>15,16</supscrpt> simulation,<supscrpt>17-19</supscrpt> and documenting systems have been developed. The emphasis in this work has been for the most the individual design and programs.
