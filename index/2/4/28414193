In this paper, two types of robust adaptive compensation control schemes for the trajectory tracking control of robot manipulator with uncertain dynamics are proposed. The proposed controllers incorporate the computed-torque control scheme as a nominal portion of the controller; an adaptive fuzzy control algorithm to approximate the structured uncertainties; and a nonlinear H âˆž tracking control model as a feedback portion to eliminate the effects of the unstructured uncertainties and approximation errors. The validity of the robust adaptive compensation control schemes is investigated by numerical simulations of a two-link rotary robot manipulator
