The challenge of a computer literacy course is to present general principles of computer science, while at the same time engaging students who are nonmajors and demonstrating the relevance of the subject. In this paper we describe our experience with a course that uses the Internet as a motivating theme to introduce students to fundamental concepts of computer science. The students found the course interesting and were visibly stimulated by the material. In comparison with previous semesters, the students left the course with more practical skills as well as a greater appreciation of the interrelations between mathematics and computer science.
