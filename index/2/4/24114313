This paper summarizes PLEASE 2013, the Fourth International Workshop on Product LinE Approaches in Software Engineering. The main goal of PLEASE is to encourage and promote the adoption of Software Product Line Engineering. To this end, we aim at bringing together researchers and industrial practitioners involved in developing families of related products in order to (1) facilitate a dialogue between these two groups and (2) initiate and foster long-term collaborations.
