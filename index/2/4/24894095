In this paper, a visual servoing strategy for dealing with the problem of keeping the observed points in the camera field of view is proposed. The approach consists of a switching control law based on camera displacement estimation and regulated from the position of the points in the image. In absence of uncertainties on the intrinsic parameters and optical axis direction, global stability is achieved and all points are kept in the field of view. Moreover, the trajectory length is minimized in the rotational space and, for some cases, also minimized in the translational one. Robustness against uncertainties is also guaranteed.
