Mobile video is now an everyday possibility with a wide array of commercially available devices, services and content. These technologies promise to transform the way that people can consume video media in their lives beyond the familiar behaviours associated with fixed TV and video technologies. Building upon earlier studies of mobile video, this paper reports on a study using diary techniques and ethnographic interviews to better understand how people are using commercially available mobile video technologies in their everyday lives. Drawing on reported episodes of mobile video behaviour, the study identifies the social motivations and values underpinning these behaviours that help characterise mobile video consumption beyond the simplistic notion of viewing TV to kill time wherever you may be. Implications for adoption and design of mobile video technologies and services are discussed.
