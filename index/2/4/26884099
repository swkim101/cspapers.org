Low energy consumption is one of the design challenges for data transmission for sensor networks. We identify the drawbacks of two conventional data transmission protocols, in terms of balance of energy consumption. We propose an approach to balance energy consumption, and present the theoretical analysis and approximate methods of our approach. Preliminary simulation results show that our approach can achieve a longer overall lifetime of a sensor network.
