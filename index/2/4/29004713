Our contention is that there now exists a considerable body of lab exercises that may be used in conjunction with introductory courses. There are fewer models available for instructors of more advanced programming courses, especially those courses which attempt to introduce students to current practices in software engineering. In this paper, we report on our experiences in building a second-year programming course that includes a significant lab and project component. These labs and projects are the vehicle we use to introduce students to the world of professional practice in software development.
