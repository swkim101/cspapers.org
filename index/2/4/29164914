First, makeup-related facial traits are classified into structured coding. Second, these facial traits are fed in- to examples-rules guided deep neural recommendation model which makes use of the pairwise of Before-After images and the makeup artist knowledge jointly. Finally, to visualize the recommended makeup style, an automatic makeup synthesis system is developed as well. To this end, a new Before-After facial makeup database is collected and labeled manually, and the knowledge of makeup artist is modeled by knowledge base system. The performance of this framework is evaluated through extensive experimental analyses. The experiments validate the automatic facial traits classification, the recommendation effectiveness in statistical and perceptual ways and the makeup synthesis accuracy which outperforms the state of the art methods by large margin. It is also worthy to note that the proposed framework is a pioneering fully automatic makeup recommendation systems to our best knowledge.
