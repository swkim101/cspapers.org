Face recognition system is used for the identification and verification of a face from a video or digital image. In the first phase, Viola Jones algorithm is used to detect and crop face region automatically from image/video frame. The second phase is to recognize the face of a person, in our proposed method Bag of Word technique used to extract features from an image which uses SURF for interest point selection, the proposed technique is tested on different state of the art face recognition databases and found more accurate and fast for face recognition. Our proposed method recognizes more than two person faces, multi-class support vector machine is used to classify the face image and assign a class label based on the learning of the classifier. The algorithm for the detection and recognition of faces is implemented in MATLAB application, and achieves a high accuracy rate of 99.21, which will be tested on the mobile robot.
