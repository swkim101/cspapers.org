In a multirobot system (MRS) several robots can operate simultaneously on the same product. We propose the use of timed Petri nets to evaluate the efficiency of the system. The throughput and utilization of robots allows us to evaluate the benefits of the MRS. A methodology has been developed that, given a set of robots and platforms, allows what the optimum operation mode is, under different conditions, to be decided.
