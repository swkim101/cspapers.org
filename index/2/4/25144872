Diabetes patients adjust their insulin injections according to their food consumption, physical activity and glucose levels. These adjustments are often trial-and-error, and newly diagnosed patients often use logbooks to catalog their daily activities and aid their physicians in developing an appropriate regimen. Gluballoon is an electronic diabetes logbook that makes food/insulin/glucose/activity logging fun, easy and precise. Designed for newly diagnosed diabetes patients, working in conjunction with physicians, Gluballoon helps patients understand how their daily activities affect their blood glucose levels. The mobile service we built uses newly developed technologies to automatically log physical activity, insulin dosing and glucose levels. The collected data is compiled into a central service available from tablets, phones, and the web that displays their vital statistics (and the relationship between the statistics) in an easy and fun visual format.
