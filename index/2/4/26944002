In [9] we defined the concept of agent oriented programming (AOP), which can be viewed as a specialization of object oriented programming (OOP). AOP views objects as agents with mental state, and, in the spirit of speech act theory, identifies a number of message types - informing, requesting, offering, and so on. AOP is a general framework. In this paper we present a specific and simple language called AGENTO; we define its syntax, present its interpreter, and illustrate both through an example.
