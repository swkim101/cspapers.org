In this paper, we investigate threshold-based dual-hop relaying schemes in conjunction with partial relay selection in terms of outage probability and bit error probability. The best relay chosen by partial relay selection will transmit jointly with the source using either amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) if the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeds a given threshold; otherwise, it will keep silent. Simulation results are in excellent agreement with numerical results and they show that the proposed protocol provides a good compromise between direct transmission and conventional dual hop relaying with partial relay selection schemes.
