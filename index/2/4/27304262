FeelCraft is a media plugin that monitors events and states in the media and associates them with expressive tactile content using a library of feel effects (FEs). A feel effect (FE) is a user-defined haptic pattern that, by virtue of its connection to a meaningful event, generates dynamic and expressive effects on the user's body. We compiled a library of more than fifty FEs associated with common events in games, movies, storybooks, etc., and used them in a sandbox-type gaming platform. The FeelCraft plugin allows a game designer to quickly generate haptic effects, associate them to events in the game, play them back for testing, save them and/or broadcast them to other users to feel the same haptic experience. Our demonstration shows an interactive procedure for authoring haptic media content using the FE library, playing it back during interactions in the game, and broadcasting it to a group of guests.
