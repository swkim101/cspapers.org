Scientific applications demand tremendous amounts of computational capabilities. In the last few years, the computational power provided by clusters of workstations and SMPs has become popular as a cost-effective alternative to supercomputers. Nodes in these systems are interconnected using high-speed networks via "smart" Network Interface Controllers (NIC). These controllers allow the overlap of computation and communication by processing communication tasks on the NIC and computational tasks on the host processor(s).
