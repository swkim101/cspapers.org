In this letter, a novel mobile phone antenna for 2G, 3G and 4G standards is presented. Based on the folded inverted-L antenna associated with a ground stub, the proposed structure can operate in all the different bands of mobile telecommunications (GSM/UMTS/LTE). With a volume of 68Ã—17 mm2 and placed on a FR4 Epoxy substrate, total efficiency of this structure is higher than 55% in the lower band (700-960 MHz) and 77% in the higher one (1615-2700 MHz).
