Over the past few years, a great deal of attention in the networking and mobile-computing communities has been directed towards building networks of ad-hoc collections of sensors scattered throughout the world. The UC Berkeley SmartDust project [2], as well as researchers at UCLA and MIT [3, 1, 4] have embarked on projects to produce small, wireless, battery-powered sensors and low-level networking protocols. These projects have brought us close to the the vision of ubiquitous eompnting [6], in which computers and sensors assist in every aspect of our lives. To fully realize this vision, however, it will be necessary to combine and query the sensor readings produced by these collections of sensors. In this demo, we show how database-style declarative queries can be executed over data streaming from sensor networks. Our demo consists of two major components: a set of Berkeley TinyOS battery-powered, wireless sensor "motes" (see Figure 1) that produce and process data, and a desktop-based query processor which parses queries, distributes them over motes, and collects and displays answers. Specifically, we allow conference attendees standing at our query processing workstation to query a number of motes distributed throughout the demo space. Queries are posed via a simple graphical user interface that offers a number of features:
