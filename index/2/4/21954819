Standard knowledge representation languages are seriously lacking an explicit formal semantic specification. This may cause considerable trouble when applied to large amounts of rapidly changing data. 
 
Based on an abstract data type view of knowledge representation languages a formal definition of a frame data model is presented in terms of a denotational semantics approach using a subset of META-IV. After introducing some basic concepts of the model several semantic integrity constraints are outlined which ultimately lead to the formulation of a set of operations in the frame data model.
