In this demonstration we present our software CROWSE (Clusering the Results of Web Search Engines) that produces a hierarchical topic-wise classi cation of results returned by a search engine. Most search engines return the results in the form of a linear list ranked in a user-independent manner. CROWSE uses unsupervised incremental classi cation and the user is presented with a tree-like structure which can be used to navigate quickly through the potentially large number of documents retrieved. It also provides facilities to the user to direct topic-wise organization by optionally letting them provide a seed taxonomy. Further, the system allows the exibility of storing the results of muliple searches into a single resulting structure. The system also provides the user with a GUI to modify the taxonomy.
