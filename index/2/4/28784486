This paper presents a unified control framework for controlling a quadrotor tail-sitter UAV. The most salient feature of this framework is its capability of uniformly treating the hovering and forward flight, and enabling continuous transition between these two modes, depending on the commanded velocity. The key part of this framework is a nonlinear solver that solves for the proper attitude and thrust that produces the required acceleration set by the position controller in an online fashion. The planned attitude and thrust are then achieved by an inner attitude controller that is global asymptotically stable. To characterize the aircraft aerodynamics, a full envelope wind tunnel test is performed on the full-scale quadrotor tail-sitter UAV. In addition to planning the attitude and thrust required by the position controller, this framework can also be used to analyze the UAV's equilibrium state (trimmed condition), especially when wind gust is present. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the controller's capacity, and experiments are conducted to show the attitude controller's performance.
