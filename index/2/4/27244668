1. SUMMARY Google's App Inventor for Android (AIA) is a visual programming environment for creating mobile phone applications that is designed to be accessible and appealing to college nonmajors taking introductory courses in computer science. Specifically, AIA provides a development environment similar to StarLogo TNG [7], Scratch [5], and Alice [2] but enabling users to create mobile applications incorporating social networking, location awareness, and Web-based services for Google's Android platform [1].
