Bluetooth allows three high quality voice (HV) packets to carry voice information over the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. The bit error rate (BER) measurements have been used in this report to evaluate the performance of voice packets in the presence of noise and interference. Starting from the problem definition and classifying the voice packets into HV1, HV2 and HV3 type, Bluetooth system has been unpacked. The paper also discuses Bluetooth related wireless standards operating in the same ISM band such as IEEE 802.11 b, whose presence in the close proximity causes interference to Bluetooth operation. Finally a Matlab based simulink model has been used to analyze the BER. The maximum tolerable BER of 5times10-2 is required to recover a perceptible quality of voice information. With respect to BER the HV2 type outperforms HV1 and HV3 due to the low SNR requirement for the same BER
