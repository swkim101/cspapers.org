This paper presents an algorithm, called ARIES/CSA (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics for Client-Server Architectures), for performing recovery correctly in client-server (CS) architectures. In CS, the server manages the disk version of the database. The clients, after obtaining database pages from the server, cache them in their buffer pools. Clients perform their updates on the cached pages and produce log records. The log records are buffered locally in virtual storage and later sent to the single log at the server. ARIES/CSA supports a write-ahead logging (WAL), fine-granularity (e.g., record) locking, partial rollbacks and flexible buffer management policies like steal and no-force. It does not require that the clocks on the clients and the server be synchronized. Checkpointing by the server and the clients allows for flexible and easier recovery.
