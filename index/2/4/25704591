Dynamic programming is one of the important algorithmic techniques often not appropriately covered in the core undergraduate CS courses, and there is no sufficient emphasize on application of advanced techniques to practical problems. As a result, students are not becoming fully familiar with this extremely important concept. We present our experience in integrating dynamic programming algorithmic technique in various core and elective undergraduate computer science courses, such as introductory programming, cryptography and bioinformatics. Examples are based on the real world scenarios and motivate students to learn in order to solve practical problems.
