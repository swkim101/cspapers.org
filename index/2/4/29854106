This paper studies the realization of turning gait contro1,taking a quadruped walking vehicle as the subject of the research. Based on the analyses of previous works. a kind of turning gait with the center of gravity of the vehicle walking along mutiple broken lines has been planned, which Is more suitable for practical control than previous methods. The process of the turning gait and its feasibility are discussed in detail. The turning gait presented in the paper is now being implemented in the newly-develop& omnidirectional quadruped walking robot JTUWH-11.
