Helitron is considered as very important type of DNA involved in mechanism's evolution. These elements are not well studied and the major researches done are biological experiments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach aiming to characterize and classify helitron's types. Accordingly, we use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification technique known to be preferment in DNA related studies. We opt for the RBF kernel function after testing different kernel. Furthermore, we used the Wavelet coefficients features. These features are the direct result of the Complex Morlet Wavelet Transform applied to binary input form of DNA sequence resulting from the new FCGS coding technique.
