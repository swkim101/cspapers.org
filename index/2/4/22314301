Derivational analogy, a method of solving problems based upon the transfer of past experience to new problem situations, is discussed in the context of other general approaches to problem solving. The experience transfer process consists of recreating lines of reasoning, including decision sequences and accompanying justifications, that proved effective in solving particular problems requiring similar initial analysis. The derivational analogy approach is advocated as a means of implementing reasoning from individual cases in expert systems.
