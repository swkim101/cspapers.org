It doesn’t work the way you think it works. Technical, business, and social factors affect the way that new technologies are deployed, Once ideas me let out of the laboratory, common sense disappears, especially in the rush to show that one company’s products are superior to another’s almost equal, very similar ones. The easy part of interface design is the technology and the science. The hard parts are the social aspects: negotiating the multiple constraints on products, including cost, business models, the sales story, time to market, and those well known impediments to progress: the installed base and industry standards. The race is to the swift and the clever, not to the best. Customers purchase what they are told they want. Wants are not the same things as needs, customers are not the same people as users. Don’t believe everything you read. In fact, don’t believe anything. How much science and research actually impacts products? Less than you might think, less than you might hope, but often for good reasons. November 2-4, 1994 UIST ’94 193
