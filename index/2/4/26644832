In this paper, we proposed a new multi-relay selection and power allocation scheme to maximize network lifetime. To maximize network lifetime, it is important to select appropriate relay node for cooperative communication and allocate power fairly among nodes in a network as well as to minimize total transmitted power. In the proposed scheme, the channel condition and residual power information were considered in multi-relay selection and the allocated power is proportional to the residual power, satisfies the required SNR at destination node and minimizes the total transmission power. In this paper, proposed scheme is base on ldquoamplify and forwardrdquo (AF) model. We evaluate the proposed scheme using extensive simulation and simulation results show that proposed scheme obtains much longer network lifetime than the traditional scheme.
