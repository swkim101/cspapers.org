Traditional processes for homework assignments are not always a good fit for the sorts of problems often seen in computer science classes. We present our experiences in implementing policies designed to encourage students to involve the instructor and fellow students in their learning process. By shifting to group assignments and permitting students a revision cycle, we improve student satisfaction and maintain or increase student outcomes while decreasing the instructor's grading load.
