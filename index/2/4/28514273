This paper presents the first steps toward a formally proven tool for schedulability analysis of tasks with offsets. We formalize and verify the seminal response time analysis of Tindell by extending the Prosa proof library, which is based on the Coq proof assistant. Thanks to Coqâ€™s extraction capabilities, this will allow us to easily obtain a certified analyzer. Additionally, we want to build a Coq certifier that can verify the correctness of results obtained using related (but uncertified), already existing analyzers. Our objective is to investigate the advantages and drawbacks of both approaches, namely the certified analysis and the certifier. The work described in this paper as well as its continuation is intended to enrich the Prosa library.
