This paper summarizes the information gathered by the author during visits to 40 small liberal arts colleges in the east and Midwest during the winter of 1987. It focuses on the following questions: What is happening with computer science programs as colleges are coping with declining computer science enrollments? What trends are noticeable in staffing levels of computing faculty and of administrative and academic computing center support staff? How should colleges balance mainframe and micro computing and how many public access microcomputers are enough? Should students be required or strongly urged to buy a microcomputer? Should colleges provide faculty and administrators with microcomputers? What about networking? The paper provides tables and graphs to help small colleges answer these questions.
