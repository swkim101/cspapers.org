Some have proposed that engaging students in research can help with retention of underrepresented groups. In this paper, we report on a particular approach we have used to introduce high school students to open-ended robotics projects in a three-week summer program. We describe the structure of our summer program, how we ramp the students up to speed, and we summarize the five open-ended "research" projects that the students work on. These projects can be adopted for open-ended work elsewhere by high school students or undergraduates.
