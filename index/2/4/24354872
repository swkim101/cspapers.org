Speech recognition using circular microphone array is addressed in this paper. Eight microphones are located around the service robot to form a 2D microphone array. To enhance the speech quality, a novel adaptive beamformer composed of a delay-and-sum beamformer, adaptive blocking filters (ABFs) and adaptive cancelling filters (ACFs) is proposed. While the adaptive generalized sidelobe canceller (AGSC) connects the ABF and the ACF in feedforward, the proposed adaptive beamformer has them in feedback. The advantages of the proposed structure are the robustness to the steering vector errors and cross-talks and the reduced number of filter taps that gives the same speech quality compared to the AGSC with a larger number of filter taps. The experimental results show that the proposed structure is superior to the AGSC in objective and subjective evaluations. Speech recognition result shows that the proposed robust adaptive beamformer guarantees the recognition performance even in a low SNR and highly reverberant environment.
