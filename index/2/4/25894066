A wheeled inverted pendulum cannot balance without control, and it is important to save motion in a control range. In some situations, however, to avoid a collision, the maximum acceleration and deceleration must be applied. A motion-planning method for a wheeled inverted pendulum (“body” hereafter)-which uses full performance from all attitudes under hardware constraints-was developed. The developed method involves two steps. First, a linear combination of zeroth to fourth differentials of parameters based on the motion equation of a wheeled inverted pendulum is obtained. Second, the arbitrary attitude of the wheeled inverted pendulum and hardware constraints are expressed on a phase plane containing angular rate of body motion and an angular inclination of the body. By executing these two steps, a motion plan can be expressed on the phase plane. A simulation based on a model confirmed that the movement plan formulated by this technique can be followed with no error.
