Snake robots have been researched for locomotion in unstructured environments due to its unique and adaptable gaits, however, they have not been used to interact with the environment in a dexterous manner, for example to grasp or push an object. In this paper, the effect of both the configuration of the snake robot (shape) and the friction between the snake robot and ground on a wrench applied to another object are studied. It is assumed that the snake robot has anisotropic friction with the ground, a property that has been proved to be essential for locomotion. The extreme cases of no friction and ideal unbounded friction can be both studied at the same time, making the model and conclusions very versatile and possible to apply to any coefficient of friction. The model and metrics are tested in a study case.
