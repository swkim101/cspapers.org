Many consider that the best strategy to teach an introductory computer language course is to start programming very early in the semester. This paper discusses the drawbacks of such a strategy and presents an alternative way to teach such a course. Based on experiments the alternative strategy appears to be more effective. The advantages and outline of the alternative strategy are discussed. Furthermore, the course outline to teach a FORTRAN language based on the alternative strategy is presented.
