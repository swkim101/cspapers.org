Bluetooth wide availability in vehicles either through passengers’ smartphones or vehicles hardware have been poorly exploited by researchers[2]. Neighbor Discovery is an exclusive Bluetooth [3] feature can be utilized to enhance transportation services while maintaining vehicle’s privacy. In this project, we advocate for using Bluetooth in developing intelligent transportation services. We name our project DriveBlue. Traffic incidents (e.g. congestion, accidents) are likely to affect drivers daily commute. So far solutions to such problems are based on statistical analysis. Bluetooth was used to estimate the travel time by extrapolating the period used to travel between two points [1]. In this project, we exploit Bluetooth neighbor discovery to detect traffic conditions (e.g. average road speed, differentiate between vehicles on regular lanes versus HOV) with receivers placed in a single site as in Fig. 1a. Features are extracted, and classified revealing some of the current traffic conditions.
