End-to-end on-demand scheduling of optical network resources for high-end grid applications has been studied by many national and international R&D organizations and research projects. Many new questions have arisen addressing technical, organizational and policy based issues.To address these challenges involved in building a global research network infrastructure, a strategic alliance between two international organizations has been formed; The Grid High-Performance Networking research group (GHPN) in GGF, mostly focusing in defining applications network requirements and network services; and GLIF, working towards enabling a globally interconnected lambda test-bed.Organized by the two organizations, the aims of this session are: (1) to increase community awareness and engagement to this common GHPN/GGF and GLIF research agenda; (2) to announce a new effort in collecting, reporting and analyzing experience concerning delivery of network services across heterogeneous optical domains. This effort will accelerate R&D problem solving in delivering lambda services in a global scale and will contribute towards standards regarding APIs and network interfaces among multiple network and Grid layers.
