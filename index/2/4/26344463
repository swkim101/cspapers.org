Teaching and learning how to program requires environments designed to support these activities rather than commercially available integrated development environments. This paper presents an instructional environment which embraces the entire process of design, algorithm development, testing and debugging while minimizing the syntactic details with which students must cope. Students using this environment develop a view of programming in which design and testing are integral parts of program development.
