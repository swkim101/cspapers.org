Recently, many algorithms have been used in designing antennas for RFID tags as BSO, NMA … to achieve optimum gain for the antennas to increase range from reader to tag and enhance impedance matching. This paper presents Genetic Algorithms (GA) in the design of RFID tag antennas, namely Micro-strip Patch Antenna at 2.45 GHz. The input impedance of Microwave Chip Mμ Hitachi is 60 Ohms. An antenna is designed to match impedance with this chip, then simulated by CST Studio Suite and measured by Network Analyzer ZBV8 terminal.
