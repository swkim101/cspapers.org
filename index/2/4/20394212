The goal of this workshop is to foster precise and explicit OO specifications of business and system semantics, independently of any (possible) realization. As a result of lip service to these ideas, the systems we build or buy are all too often not what they are supposed to be. Doing better than that requires both a clear understanding of the semantics of the problems together with their business and technological environments, and abstract, precise and explicit specifications of that semantics. The specific theme this year is on serving the customer.
