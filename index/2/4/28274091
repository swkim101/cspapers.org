INTRODUCTION In 1968 Stanley Kubrickâ€™s 2001, A Space Odyssey did much to popularize the vision of natural language dialogue with an intelligent, autonomous agent. Although there has been a good deal of research into intelligent automata in the twenty years since, many of the critical issues for natural language dialogue seem only more intractable than originally supposed, and the prospect of users interacting with HAL by the year 2001 is highly questionable, at best. But does this mean that natural language interfaces are dead? In spite of some erosion in the credibility of the technology, the fact is that quiet progress has been made on a number of fronts, and there are currently a handful of commercially available natural language systems serving real users in real applications.
