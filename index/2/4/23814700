This paper is concerned with the optimal transceiver design in flat-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels. Interference alignment (IA) is recently known as an emerging technique to obtain the maximum total degree of freedom. Finding the transceiver matrices for perfect IA is mathematically challenging since the interference alignment problems are highly nonlinear and nonconvex. Interference leakage minimization and signal to noise plus interference ratio (SINR) maximization methods were developed to suppress the interference from the undesired users. However, most of previous works commonly assume that the equal power is allocated to each user and each stream. In this paper, we develop an iterative optimization algorithm to optimize power allocation to each stream. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm offers a higher sum-rate than the interference leakage minimization method.
