In order to search and rescue the victims in rubble effectively, a 3-D map of the rubble is required. As a part of the national project of rescue robot system, we are investigating a method for constructing a 3-D map of rubble by teleoperated mobile robots. We are also planning to build an intuitive user interface for teleoperating robots and navigating in a virtualized rubble model using the obtained 3-D model. In this paper, some preliminary research results are introduced. We did some design studies of laser range finders that can be mounted on a mobile robot and can get the range data of the rubble around the robot. Then, we formulated a 3D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Map Building) algorithm and conducted some simulation studies. Lastly, we proposed a novel motion canceling camera system and confirmed its validity by experiment.
