Efficient scheduling of jobs for computer systems is a problem of continuing concern. The applicability of scheduling methodology described in the operations research literature is severely restricted by the dimensionality of job characteristics, the number of distinct resource types comprising a computer system, the non-deterministic nature of the system due to both interprocess interaction and contention, and the existence of a multitude of constraints effecting job initiation times, job completion times, and job interactions. In view of the large number of issues which must be considered in job scheduling, a heuristic approach seems appropriate. This paper describes an initial implementation of such an approach based upon a fast, analytically driven, performance prediction tool.
