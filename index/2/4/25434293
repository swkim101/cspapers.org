With the Java language replacing C++ on the 2004 AP CS Exam, teachers need to be informed about the changes that must be implemented to support an OO approach to programming. This special session will include a retrospective look at the motivation behind the change to an object-oriented language, the process undertaken to select a testable language subset, the need to continue the development and classroom implementation of a Case Study, and a look at how the shift from an object-based approach to programming in C++ to an OO approach in Java leads to curriculum modification.The AP CS Development Committee's charge is to not only provide a comprehensive testing mechanism, but also advise, through various publications, a direction that high school teachers should take in preparing a foundation for more advanced student studies during college. This special session will bring together two college and two high school members of the AP CS Development Committee to share some of their insights into how the experts do it. Time will be provided to discuss participant's questions.
