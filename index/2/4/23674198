The ABET Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) has been involved in a multi-year process to update the accredAitation criteria to incorporate a new framework for outcomes assessment, as well as to update the specific program criteria in computer science, information systems and information technology. Of the program criteria revisions, the computer science criteria are the most heavily revised, with the goal of achieving some degree of consistence with the CS2013 Report. This Birds of a Feather session is designed to discuss the philosophy behind the criteria changes, and present a draft of the revised criteria for review and comment. The session will promote attendee participation via small group discussions, thereby providing the opportunity for participants to provide input on the revised criteria. The session will also solicit feedback to ABET on computing accreditation in general, and on the overall accreditation process.
