Computer Science departments have special requirements for their computing environments, distinct from the "normal" requirements of most other departments. However, shrinking budgets and other factors make it difficult for many of us to provide an adequate computing environment for our students, above and beyond the generic support provided by our school's computing services division. This paper describes the use of bootable, "live" USB keys to provide students with a standard, portable environment that they can use on their own computers as well as in our labs.
