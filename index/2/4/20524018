This paper describes a self-paced audio-tutorial introductory Fortran programming course. The course is designed for students with no previous programming experience and consists of nine lessons. Each lesson has two parts: (1) a handout that directs the student's reading in the course text and contains comments, suggestions, examples and self-test quizzes; (2) a handout and accompanying cassette tape that solves example problems in detail - problem analysis, development of algorithm (flowchart) and program. There are six programming assignments and a test on each lesson. A unique feature of the lessons is the use of peek-a-boo strips to aid and encourage students to carefully read the example programs and to show the structural relation between the flowchart and the program.
