Existing programming languages use display terminals as powerful typewriters, The FORAL LP user, in contrast, does not even need to know how to type. He enters transactions by using a light pen to touch nodes and arcs of a two-dimensional semantic network. The system immediately checks each touch for errors and constructs a FORAL II statement. This paper presents the FORAL LP light pen syntax and the FORAL LP pen touch to the FORAL II textual language compiler.
