DYNALAB, short for D YNAmic LABomtoTy, is a software system that supports interactive, highly visual, and motivating lecture demonstrations and laboratory experiments in computer science. In its current form— Version 1. O—DYNALAB consists of a virtual computer called the Education Machine (E-machine for short) [Pat89], an E-machine Emulator [Bir90], a Pascal compiler for the E-machine [Go093], an Ada subset compiler for the E-machine [Po094], comprehensive program animators for X-windows [Pra94] and MS-windows [Bor95], and an extensive library of programs. The rest of this paper describes DYNALAB in more detail.
