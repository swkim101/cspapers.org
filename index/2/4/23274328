This paper describes the development of a windshield cleaning robot system (WSC). The WSC is intended to be used for Boeing 747 aircraft parked at airports prior to service. The objects to be cleaned are spots on the windshield caused by collision with dust, insects, and birds during takeoff and landing. The WSC was developed with the objective of realizing a system which could be operated by a single operator able to complete the work on one aircraft in 10 minutes. The WSC consists of the manipulator (the arm and the cleaning device), the installation unit, the control unit, and the operation unit. A position and force control method is applied to the WSC. The target position of the arm tip is modified by using the signals from the force sensor and the joystick. In accordance with this control method, the pressure force is kept constant and the tip is moved so as to follow the shape of the workpiece. The various safety features provided include an interference limit to limit the area of movement of the arm tip. System evaluation experiments were carried out and the effectiveness of applying a lightweight manipulator with long arms to this work was confirmed.<<ETX>>
