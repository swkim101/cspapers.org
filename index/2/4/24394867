The shift in computing hardware to parallel systems is well underway. Sequential chips are no longer designed, and the proud era of von Neumann architecture passes into history.
 Foundational change of this magnitude will disrupt traditional habits throughout the discipline, especially how students are to be introduced to and prepared for new challenges. But prepared how, and for what, exactly?
 With parallel programming models evolving, and a variety of approaches being tried in academia and industry, flexibility is vital. Customary time lags between research findings and classroom experience will have to be shortened, and industrial best practices find a new level of academic pertinence, quickening the pace of adoption for parallel education. In this talk, we'll look at some of these university/industry collaborations now underway.
