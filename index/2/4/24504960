We developed an eyes-free text entry interface using contact area to determine pressed state for mobile device with touchscreen. The interface gives audio feedback for a touched character similar to VoiceOver of iPhone, but audio feedbacks of two simultaneous touches are considered. A desired character is entered by pressing once. Independent entry of two fingers can reduce movement distance for searching a character. Whole interaction occurs in touched states, additional tactile feedback can be augmented.
