When integrated with push notifications, a live migration function can be used to ensure that systems have a high reliability in cases of hardware failures. However, the dependencies for a large range of hardware devices need to be addressed before realizing emergency live migration. Our platform introduces container-based light virtualization and an automated build function to isolate an application so that it can be deployed on different devices such as Edison, Raspberry Pi model B, BeagleBone Black, and Odroid XU3.
