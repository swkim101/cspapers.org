After natural disasters occur, people in disaster areas need to inform their families, friends about their current situation thus resulting in a high demand of call requests to mobile telephone networks. In this paper, we study an emergency communications infrastructure which exploits wideband CDMA (WCDMA) based emergency multi-system access (EMSA) utilizing a mechanism of selecting proper base station (SPBS). In this emergency system, a mobile subscriber will send an emergency call request to an appropriate base station according to the strength of pilot signals received from all-around base stations. In the proposed EMSA with SPBS, an emergency call might be provided by either contract network of this mobile subscriber or other mobile networks. The performance of this infrastructure obtained by using a WCDMA network simulator shows that WCDMA based EMSA utilizing SPBS outperforms conventional single system access (SSA) in terms of lower system call blocking rate.
