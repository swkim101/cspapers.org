Transducer is a device usually electrical, electronic or electro-mechanical that converts one type of energy to another for various purposes including measurement or information transfer. The type of transducer we are implementing is orthomode transducer. It is a polarization diplexer, a device that forms part of an antenna feed system and serves to combine or separate orthogonally polarized signals. This diplexer can also separate orthogonal polarizations within the same frequency band. In the current paper it has been deployed as a transmitter and receiver at the same time by receiving one signal at some particular downlink frequency (10.95 GHz to 12.75 GHz) at one rectangular port and transmitting the other signal at uplink frequency (14 GHz to 14.5 GHz) by using the second rectangular port. Our model of ortho-mode transducer built on a circular waveguide and supplied with step transitions in input rectangular waveguide ports is proposed. Scattering matrix parameters, return loss, VSWR, coupling and TX loss are analyzed on the HFSS. By using computer aided design we have taken the design figure for the workshop process. After having manufactured it, we tested OMT on network analyzer and compared the results with the simulate ones.
