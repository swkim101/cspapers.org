In this paper, a novel clustering algorithm, called Saliency-Guided Constrained Clustering approach with Cosine similarity (SGC3), is proposed for the image cosegmentation task, where the common foregrounds are extracted via a one-step clustering process. In our method, the unsupervised saliency prior is utilized as a partition-level side information to guide the clustering process. To guarantee the robustness to noise and outlier in the given prior, the similarities of instance-level and partition-level are jointly computed for cosegmentation. Specifically, we employ cosine distance to calculate the feature similarity between data point and its cluster centroid, and introduce a cosine utility function to measure the similarity between clustering result and the side information. These two parts are both based on the cosine similarity, which is able to capture the intrinsic structure of data, especially for the non-spherical cluster structure. Finally, a K-means-like optimization is designed to solve our objective function in an efficient way. Experimental results on two widely-used datasets demonstrate our approach achieves competitive performance over the state-of-the-art cosegmentation methods.
