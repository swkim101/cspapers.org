We present here a new formalization of beliefs, which has a simpler semantics than the previous formalizations, and develop an inference method for it by generalizing the resolution method. The usual prepositional formulas are embedded in our logic as a special type of belief formulas. One can obtain a non-monotonic logic of beliefs by applying, say, circumscription to the basic belief-logic developed here which is monotonic in nature. One can also apply the technique repeatedly to construct a hierarchy of belief-logics BLk, k > 1, where BLk‚äÉBLk-1and BLkcan handle formulas involving up to level k nested applications of the belief operator B.
