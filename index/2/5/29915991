The authors have studied the cellular robotic system (CEBOT) with the aim of realizing a self-organizing robotic system. It can be regarded that CEBOT is one of the multi-agents robotic systems studied by many researchers. It is generally considered that one of the features of the multi-agents robot is that the system can carry out many kinds of tasks under various environments due to coordination among many agents. It is assumed that a group of the agents can get higher performance than an ability of single agent. In this paper, the relation between the resource amount, which implies both hardware and software installed into the system, and system performance is discussed. At first, a new concept called function amplification is proposed and defined, the control law of each agent to achieve the function amplification is secondarily discussed. In the last part of this paper, some simulations are reported and discussed to demonstrate the relation between resource amount and system performance.
