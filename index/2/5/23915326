We develop a general-purpose framework to employ Minimax distances with any classification method that performs on numerical data. For this purpose, we establish a two-step strategy. First, we compute the pairwise Minimax distances between the objects, using the equivalence of Minimax distances over a graph and over a minimum spanning tree constructed on that. Then, we perform an embedding of the pairwise Minimax distances into a new vector space, such that their squared Euclidean distances in the new space are equal to their Minimax distances in the original space. We also consider the cases where multiple pairwise Minimax matrices are given, instead of a single one. Thereby, we propose an embedding via first summing up the centered matrices and then performing an eigenvalue decomposition. We experimentally validate our framework on different synthetic and real-world datasets.
