In particular, my research is focused on logic-based reasoning systems that model human spatial reasoning methods and may enable better understanding of humans reasoning mechanisms in future. Importantly, such formalisms are also interested from the practical point of view â€“ they have a number of potential applications, e.g., in robotics, architecture design, databases, among others.
