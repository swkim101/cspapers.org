This paper reports the author's progress toward developing a microcomputer laboratory suitable for teaching some of the basic concepts of computer science. The rationale for this approach is presented, followed by a description of the hardware and software environment thus far developed. Finally we present two course outlines: one for an undergraduate laboratory course in computer systems and another for a graduate course in microcomputer systems design for engineers.
