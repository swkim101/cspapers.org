This paper presents the savings of electricity consumption cost in residential sector of Bangladesh through replacing the instantaneous power supply (IPS) units with solar photovoltaic (PV) system. In Bangladesh, presently total electrical demand is about 6000 MW with total generation of about 4500 MW. About 1500 MW or 25% of total demand is unserved with current generation. To get rid of this acute power crisis, people here are using IPSs. IPSs are not generating any power by themselves but consuming a huge power form the national grid when the power is available and when the grid power cuts of, it supply a very little amount of the consumed power to the users. It is a comprehensible loss to Bangladesh Power System (BPS). Total installed capacity of IPS units is about 150 MW in the residential sector of Bangladesh. Through economic analysis, it is observed that around $2,144,587,386 can be saved in residential sector of Bangladesh over the period of next 25 years by replacing the IPSs with solar PV system.
