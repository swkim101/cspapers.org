We present a novel model for validating and improving the content and structure organization of a website. This model studies the website as a graph and evaluates its interconnectivity in relation to the similarity of its documents. The aim of this model is to provide a simple way for improving the overall structure, contents and interconnectivity of a website. This model has been implemented as a prototype and applied to several websites, showing very interesting results. Our model is complementary to other methods of website personalization and improvement.
