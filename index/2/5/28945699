With NSF funding, we have developed a collection of instructional laboratories to enhance the security component in IT education. The labs are developed with a layered and modular design that can be tailored for different courses, accommodating new tools and being conducted in various environments with minimum modifications. This workshop introduces to participants these labs and the environment to conduct them. The workshop proceeds in four sessions in which we: 1) introduce the labs, techniques and environment; 2) demonstrate a lab; 3) guide participants to practice with a lab, 4) debrief. The intended audience is educators who teach IT security courses or other courses with security components at colleges or universities. Experience is not required. Each participant receives an electronic version of 1) the lab assignments that we have developed and used in our teaching practice, and 2) preconfigured virtual machines and tools used to conduct the labs. Laptop required.
