The Atomic Web Browser achieves atomicity for distributed transactions across multiple RESTful APIs. Assuming that the participant APIs feature support for the Try-Confirm/Cancel pattern, the user may navigate with the Atomic Web Browser among multiple Web sites to perform local resource state transitions (e.g., reservations or bookings). Once the user indicates that the navigation has successfully completed, the Atomic Web browser takes care of confirming the local transitions to achieve the atomicity of the global transaction.
