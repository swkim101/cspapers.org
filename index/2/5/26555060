This article considers a model of cooperative spectrum sharing between primary and secondary systems in which transmission occurs in two phases. In this scheme, we introduce that a single secondary transmitter, ST, employs a quadrature-phase-based signal to present the secondary message, while the primary message is presented by an in-phase-based signal. This allows simultaneous spectrum sharing without mutual interference. Therefore, an interference constraint is not necessary to protect primary operating performance from being degraded by the secondary user operations. Theoretical analysis and Simulations are then provided to confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme over the the current conventional methods.
