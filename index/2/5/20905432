We present an extension of the standard game description language for general game playing to include epistemic games, which are characterised by rules that depend on the knowledge of players. A single additional keyword suffices to define GDL-III, a game description language with imperfect information and introspection. We define syntax and semantics and present an execution model for this extended language. We develop a provably correct answer set program (ASP) for reasoning about GDL-III games. We also show how the extended language can be used to formalise general epistemic puzzles and how those can be solved using a mere game controller for GDL-III, that is, without requiring any game-playing intelligence beyond the ability to generate legal play sequences.
