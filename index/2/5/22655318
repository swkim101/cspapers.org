We propose a general design for secure collaboration systems, which is underpinned with an access control policy model, an administrative scheme, and an enforcement scheme, based on the Type Usage Control (TUCON) model. TUCON is a generalized form of the usage control model (UCON) proposed recently. By utilizing mutable object attributes, UCON can reflect the dynamic nature of ad-hoc collaborations such as temporal and/or spatial usages. In TUCON, every object has an object type as a persistent attribute, which works as a name space that indicates an organization to which the object belongs. With object types, TUCON policies can distinctly control intra-organization and inter-organization information flows. This approach achieves the autonomy of collaborative teams as well as the mutual confidentiality of collaborating organizations.
