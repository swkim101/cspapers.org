Forcefree control can realize the flexible motion of industrial articulated robot arms without any change of the built-in controller. In this paper, the forcefree control was extended to realize flexible motion emulating operational circumstance free of inertia, friction and gravity through the independent compensation of inertia, friction and gravity. The property of the forcefree control with independent compensation was also investigated by experimental study of an actual industrial articulated robot arm, where the external force was measured with a force sensor which was attached to the tip of the robot arm.
