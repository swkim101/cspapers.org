This paper describes the use of the Chief Programmer Team method in an operating systems class to implement a subset of a multiprogramming operating system. The operating system consisted of elements of Job Management, Task Management, and Data Management functions. The students were divided into four groups. One of these, called the Steering Committee, was responsible for assigning coding and design duties to each of the three coding groups. When each major part of the operating system was completed, the Steering Committee would examine the code and approve it, or return it to the coding group for revision. Thus, the Steering Committee acted as Chief Programmer to the other three groups. When all parts of the system were completed, they were linked together and tested. A comprehensive survey containing questions regarding the effectiveness of the Chief Programmer approach was given to all students. The results of this survey indicated that the group programming effort was superior to the conventional method of assigning the project, in its entirety, to each student. Key Words: Chief Programmer Team, Monitor, Operating Systems, Systems Programming.
