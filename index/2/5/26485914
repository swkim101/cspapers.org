This paper poses a non-linear dynamical system on bipartite graphs and shows its stability under certain conditions. The dynamical system changes the weights on the nodes of the graph in each time step. The underlying weight transformation is non-linear, motivated by information gain in a document retrieval setting. Stability analysis of this problem is therefore more involved than that of PageRank-like algorithms. We show convergence using methods from Lyapunov theory and also provide some examples of how the algorithm performs when ranking keywords and sentences in a set of documents.
