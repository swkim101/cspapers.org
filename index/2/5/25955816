The scope of computing in the modern business corporation today may be typified by the term Total Information Systems. What is required to construct a Total Information System is a mixture of hardware, communications equipment, software, operations research technology, and a highly skilled staff of people to define and integrate this technology with the information needs of the modern business corporation. Without needlessly belaboring a point, business has grown far beyond the familiar payroll and accounting ledger kind of programming, and has become the major user of computers in many sophisticated ways. To support this use, a source of talent must be defined.
 At the Founder's Conference of the Society for Management Information Systems (SMIS), September 1969, one of the topics was precisely the criticalness of this flow of talent. As has been the case with other, similar conferences with a strong business representation, the critical shortage of qualified computer staff personnel was discussed. This shortage, it is widely agreed, will be getting worse, especially in the senior positions of systems analysts, designers and consultants. As is also often the case in discussions of the sort which took place at the SMIS meeting, the university (the most obvious source of this talent) was cited as being, first of all, generally unresponsive to business needs and, secondly, simply numerically unable to provide the number of people being forecast as required. The recommended plan of attack was for business to develop in-house training and to “put pressure” on the academic community.
