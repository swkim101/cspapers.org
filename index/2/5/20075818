This paper introduces a wireless phase calibration algorithm that can be applied on cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) radio frequency identification (RFID) system and auto acquire an accurate radio frequency (RF) phase information without any offline training. The key observation is that the raw phase measurements even measured form different RFID tags contain a same set of unknown phase errors. With enough tags' phase measurements, we can determine all the unknown phase errors, since the number of known phase measurements is much larger than the number of unknown phase errors. Real-world experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
