This paper deals with the problem of trajectory generation with a motion profile in joint space, the motion profile is a mathematical function that affect the performances of the robot such as the optimization of energy, optimization of time and especially the continuity of movement, in robotics we have three problems to solve, modeling, control and trajectory planning, in this work we developed a dynamic model of a flexible arm and we used proportional derivative controller so that the robot can follow the desired path then we tested some motion profiles to see the effect of each one of them.
