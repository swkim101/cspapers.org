A new course, Computer Science Professional Development Seminar, engages students in reflective self-discovery and career planning, and also facilitates attainment of student outcomes assessment data for continual improvement of our program. Prior to requiring this half-semester course, students selected when to attend colloquia and various presentations. This strategy did not insure that students had a common exposure to topics. Though this course is titled as a professionalism course, this poster describes broader content coverage. Lifelong learning, ethical professionalism, and social media are included. The learning experiences in this course encourage students to establish an early commitment to their personal career development. Additionally, students are guided to increase their awareness of social issues and professional practice knowledge areas from CS2013. Targeted to the second-year (sophomore) population, this course helps connect the students with our departmental community and leads the students to better understand expectations and capstone opportunities. During this course, students receive mentorship by upper-class students, alumni, faculty, staff, and outside computing professionals. Since the course is required, students are afforded dedicated time to expand their understanding of professionalism, to learn about many opportunities for undergraduates, to reflect on case studies and on their intended career path, and to advance their preparations for the next step of their career. This annual course has been offered four times. We strive to keep section enrollments at seminar level to facilitate discussion and to promote community. Some events with outside speakers require one common meeting of all sections. Course management strategies are offered.
