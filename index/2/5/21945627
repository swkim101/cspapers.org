At the opening Plenary of CHI’96, Herbert Clark challenged human-computer interface design to emulate some of the graceful repair found in face-to-face conversation. However, the dominant paradigm in recent user-interface design has been one of action, not communication – direct manipulation, not commands. In day-to-day life we find the transition between the worlds of action and communicationproblematic, so it is not surprising that we experience similar problems in the computer world. Nowhere is this transition more marked than when using undo – we are forced to think M what we have just ~ – breakdown.
