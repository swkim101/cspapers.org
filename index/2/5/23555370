Vacuum cleaning robots are by a significant margin the most populous consumer robots in existence today. While early versions were essentially dumb random exploration cleaners, recent systems fielded by most of the major manufacturers have attempted to improve the intelligence and efficiency of these systems. Both range-based and visual sensors have been used to enable these robots to map and localize within their environments, with active range sensing and active visual solutions having the disadvantage of being more intrusive or only sensing a 1D scan of the environment. Passive visual approaches such as those used by the Dyson robot vacuum cleaner have been shown to work well in ideal lighting conditions; their performance in darkness is unknown. In this paper we present research working towards a passive and potentially very cheap vision-based solution to vacuum cleaner robot localization that utilizes low resolution contrast-normalized image matching algorithms, image sequence-based matching in two-dimensions, and place match interpolation. In a range of experiments in a domestic home and office environment during the day and night, we demonstrate that the approach enables accurate localization regardless of the lighting conditions and lighting changes experienced in the environment.
