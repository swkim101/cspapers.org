During the ITiCSE 2002 conference in Ã…rhus, Denmark, a panel presentation on the topic of import to and export from Computing Science Education and other fields focused on the case of Mathematics Education Research. The outcome was very successful, with the panelists' presentations giving rise to active audience participation.Continuing with the theme from the earlier panel, this proposal suggests a similar format with the expanded theme of transfer into Computing Science Education from Science Education Research. This panel will look at how research theories developed in the context of various areas of science education can be applied to Computing Science Education as well as ways in which computing science educational theories may be used in those areas. Because Computing Science Education is a young discipline, it is still in search of its research framework [2]. In formulating such a framework, it can be practical and productive to adapt approaches from research in other disciplines, both educational and related areas. At the same time, the younger discipline can offer innovative new approaches to the older discipline.The panelists will examine possibilities and difficulties in some import and export attempts between several areas of Science Education Research and Computing Science Education. For this context, science is considered to include mathematics.
