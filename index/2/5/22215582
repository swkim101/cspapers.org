Software testing is indispensable for all software development. As all mature engineering disciplines need to have systematic testing methodologies, software testing is a very important subject of software engineering. In software development practice, testing accounts for as much as 50% of total development efforts. It is imperative to reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of software testing by automating the testing process, which contains many testing related activities using various techniques and methods.
