Recent developments in mobile eye tracking equipment and automated eye movement analysis point the way toward unobtrusive eye-based human-computer interfaces that are pervasively usable in everyday life. We call this new paradigm pervasive eye tracking - continuous eye monitoring and analysis 24/7. PETMEI 2011 provides a forum for researcher from human-computer interaction, context-aware computing, and eye tracking to discuss techniques and applications that go beyond classical eye tracking and stationary eye-based interaction. We aim to discuss the implications of pervasive eye tracking for context-aware computing and to identify the key research challenges of mobile eye-based interaction. The long-term goal is to create a strong interdisciplinary research community linking these research fields together and to establish the workshop as the premier forum for research on pervasive eye tracking and mobile eye-based interaction.
