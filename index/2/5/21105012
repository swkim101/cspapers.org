Data integrity control is a significant function in a large data base system. A rollback/restart/recovery (R/R/R) capability is one of the two principal components of a data integrity control system. R/R/R is the capability, on the detection of an invalid data state at time t, to rollback the data system to a valid state known to exist at time to and then restore it to a state of validity at time t via a recovery process. The design and application of R/R/R systems has received very little attention. Chandy [1] has recently reviewed previous work.
