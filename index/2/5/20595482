This paper reports on advances in the design and development of a high performance direct-drive joint for robotics and automation. The key design aspects of the mechanical components, sensors, control architecture, and a hydraulically actuated dynamometer testbed are described. We also present a number of advanced implementations in control, motor torque control, and motion control using positive joint torque feedback. Experimental results illustrate outstanding performance regarding thermal response, torque ripple, reference trajectory tracking, torque disturbance rejection, and joint stiffness.
