Two of the most demanding subjects in a Computer Science Curriculum are Compiling Techniques and Databases. In both courses, a major problem is: what should be the main project in the laboratory?. Since 1974, we have had students at various universities write compilers (2) in such a course. In each case, a complete compiler has been implemented. We have tried to establish a direct connection between the Compiling Techniques Course and the Databases Course because both can be selectively chosen by the same students.
 This paper is divided into three parts: first, we outline the content of each course and the relationship existing between them; secondly, we analyze the criteria for language selection with regards to both courses (also with respect to methodology and to structured programming); third, we discuss the language and illustrate it using some examples.
