This paper describes a fast motion planning method which can be applied to online collision avoidance. It is based on C-obstacle determination, but the way in which the surface contours are established reduces significantly the determination time. Collision checking is based on exploring possible virtual intersection between the two convex polyhedra which define the robot link and the obstacle. Virtual intersection is deduced by examining the signs of distances between a facet of a robot polyhedron and the vertices of the obstacle polyhedron, and that between a facet of the obstacle polyhedron and the vertices of the robot polyhedron. A subsidiary feature of this planner is that it can determine the direction for the robot to retract from an approaching obstacle, according to the types of virtual intersection detected.
