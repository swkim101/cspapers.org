In this paper we address the issue of learning diverse ranking models for search result diversification. Typical methods treat the problem of constructing a diverse ranking as a process of sequential document selection. At each ranking position, the document that can provide the largest amount of additional information to the users is selected, because the search users usually browse the documents in a top-down manner. Thus, to select an optimal document for a position, it is critical for a diverse ranking model to capture the utility of information the user have perceived from the preceding documents. Existing methods usually calculate the ranking scores (e.g., the marginal relevance) directly based on the query and the selected documents, with heuristic rules or handcrafted features. The utility the user perceived at each of the ranks, however, is not explicitly modeled. In this paper, we present a novel diverse ranking model on the basis of continuous state Markov decision process (MDP) in which the user perceived utility is modeled as a part of the MDP state. Our model, referred to as MDP-DIV, sequentially takes the actions of selecting one document according to current state, and then updates the state for the chosen of the next action. The transition of the states are modeled in a recurrent manner and the model parameters are learned with policy gradient. Experimental results based on the TREC benchmarks showed that MDP-DIV can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.
