The STARS Computing Corps is a national alliance with the mission to grow a diverse community of computing leaders. STARS serves as a framework for integrating civic engagement into college computing departments with the goals of broadening participation of underrepresented groups in computing, recruiting K-12 students into the computing pipeline, and retaining students in computing majors. The STARS approach to broadening the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in computing is based on research that has shown the value of creating a community and sense of identity. The Corps creates such a community across multiple institutions, including women's and historically black colleges and universities, with members that share the core values of becoming responsible leaders who use their computing skills for social benefit. Each cohort of students and faculty at a STARS member university collaborates with local K-12 schools and industry partners to conduct computing-related outreach, service, and research that can broaden participation in computing. These local cohorts help to build community within and across STARS member institutions, retain students in college degree programs in computing, recruit new students into computing, educate local K-12 teachers, counselors, students, and parents about computing, and build bridges with local industry and community organizations. This workshop will provide hands-on training for new schools to learn how to begin and build a STARS Computing Corps cohort on their own campus.
