Educators responsible for coordinating a staff to grade a large volume of exams or projects have learned, sometimes the hard way, the importance of writing good rubrics: they keep the graders on track, grading equitably, consistently, and quickly. But these benefits of a well-written rubric extend also to those of us without a grading staff, even to single classrooms of twenty or so students. Good rubrics will change your life! In this workshop, we will present various principles we have found to write effective analytic rubrics for student programming work, helping to keep our grading unbiased and to assess the student work more quickly. We will show specific examples of good rubrics, and then participants will jointly grade some sample work according to a shared rubric, discussing what works and what doesn't. Finally, participants will break into small groups to workshop a rubric for an assignment they've given in their own class. Most examples will be at the CS1/CS2 level (and CS1-only educators are welcome), but some of the discussion will address higher-level courses as well. Participants should bring the specification/handout for a programming assignment they have recently given in class (which need not be CS1/CS2), and are encouraged (if possible) to bring a small number of handed-in student solutions for that assignment. Laptops are not necessary unless that's how the participant is bringing or accessing their student solutions.
