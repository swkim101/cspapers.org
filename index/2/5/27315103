When a student performs a project, under the supervision of a faculty member, it is important that the student feel that the project is of merit and reflects both the student's capabilities as well as the student's interests. All too often the project is fine unto itself but has no connection to the student's other studies or background except that the project falls in the same major field.
Therefore it is important to create a project, in cooperation with a student, that is not only challenging in itself but also relies heavily upon the student's previous coursework. It should mimic project work as performed outside the academic sphere in that it yields a useable result.
Through the use of techniques such as a contract for project grade, outlining attainable goals agreed upon by both the student and the instructor, the student gains an understanding of the project in relation to the student's entire course of studies, as well as future endeavors.
