The Web contains a huge volume of information, almost all unstructured and, therefore, difficult to manage. In Digital Libraries, however, information is explicitly organized, described, and managed. In this paper, we propose an architecture that allows the construction of digital libraries from the Web, using standard protocols and archival technologies, and incorporating powerful digital library and data extraction tools, thus benefiting from the breadth of the Web contents, but supporting services and organization available in digital libraries. The proposed architecture was applied to the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, providing an important first step toward rapid construction of large DLs from the Web, as well as a large-scale solution for interoperability between independent digital libraries.
