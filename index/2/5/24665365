This paper presents a pattern and frequency reconfigurable meander line Yagi-Uda antenna for digital terrestrial television reception. To achieve a compact size for installing on a vehicle, the antenna is designed with meander line. The main beam switching and resonant frequency tuning are accomplished by loading two driven elements and four parasitic elements with the short or open of RF switches. The frequency is reconfigured with different electrical length of the driven element. The direction of the beam is shifted by alternating the short or open status of RF switches in parasitic elements.
