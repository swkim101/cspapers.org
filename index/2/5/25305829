In this paper, we introduce the concept of breadth-last technical elective courses, which are designed to assist undergraduate CS students in integrating their entire core curriculum into a coherent whole at the end of their degree programs. Specific breadth-last courses in intelligent mobile robotics and computer game development have been implemented and are presented here to demonstrate the pedagogical concepts being discussed.
