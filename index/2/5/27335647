The performance of multiple systems sharing a common data base is analyzed for an architecture with concurrency control using a centralized lock engine. The workload is based on traces from large mainframe systems running IBM's IMS database management system. Based on IMS lock traces the lock contention probability and data base buffer invalidation effect in a multi-system environment is predicted. Workload parameters are generated for use in event-driven simulation models that examine the overall performance of multi-system data sharing, and to determine the performance impact of various system parameters and design alternatives. While performance results are presented for realistic system parameters, the emphasis is on the methodology, approximate analysis technique and on examining the factors that affect multi-system performance.
