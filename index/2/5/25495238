Successful execution of a planned task using robotic manipulators, requires that the task satisfies both the kinematic and dynamic abilities of the manipulator. The executability of a task is generally unknown a priori. In this paper, the dynamic ability of a manipulator for motions constrained by the holonomic constraints and by the loading in the object maneuver are considered. Simulation and experimental results for holonomically constrained motions are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the presented formulation in analyzing the task executability and preventing manipulator damage for some tasks, especially, those involving environmental interaction.<<ETX>>
