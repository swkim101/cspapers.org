In surface treatment processes like plasma spraying and spray painting of workpieces, protecting the uninvolved surface by applying masking tape is a common process. Due to the operation complexity for different geometries, such taping tasks depend on a lot of manual works, which is tedious and tiring. This paper introduces an automatic agile robotic system and the corresponding algorithm to do the surface taping. The automatic taping system consists of a 3D scanner for workpiece 3D model reconstruction, a taping end-effector which is mounted on a robot manipulator to handle the taping task, and a rotating platform that is used to hold the workpiece. The surface covering method and the taping path planning algorithms using the scanned model are introduced. With the implementation of the compliance mechanism, the force feedback and the tape cutting mechanism, the system is able to tape flat, cylindrical, freeform, and grooved surfaces. Experiments conducted on taping an engine inner liner shows that the surface can be covered with uniform taping overlap and very little wrinkle. The proposed system is a useful taping package for industrial applications such as workpiece repairing and surface protection, where surface treatments are involved.
