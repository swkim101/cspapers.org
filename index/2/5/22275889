We have been teaching cybersecurity using hands-on, interactive exercises that have successfully engaged students. However, in order to meet the increasing demand for security professionals, we need to greatly expand the community of faculty teaching in this area. We would like to bring together new and experienced faculty to do this. Ambareen Siraj has set up a dedicated Facebook group to allow us to work together outside of SIGCSE events, but we need to develop a critical mass of users. During the BoF, we will encourage participants to sign up for the closed group, and we will have an exercise where they ask and answer questions about what they want from this learning community. One benefit of having a learning community is that it will be easier to provide support for new members to learn about resources and get help. These resources include exercises, webinars, and slides. We will share experiences, practices and ongoing efforts, including our own (e.g. Security Injections, the Security Knitting Kit project, and EDURange). The BoF also benefits experienced members, helping them to reach other faculty with similar interests. As a community we have begun to share exercises and discuss what works and what problems students and instructors have encountered. For the last five years, we have been doing that at SIGCSE. We will discuss ways to integrate security-related exercises into existing courses. The questions we will ask are, "What exercises have you tried? What are your experiences? What are you looking for from the community?"
