This report describes the first set of proprietary design automation programs that will become available for licensing from C-E-I-R in 1968. The system (called DAPSY V. 2) is a group of building block programs that automate the layout and design of printed circuit boards using integrated circuit (IC) packs. The programs perform three basic functions: the logic is partitioned into IC packs, the packs are placed on the board, and the inter-connections are routed.
