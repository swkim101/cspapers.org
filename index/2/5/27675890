Besides the link structure, network data are often equipped with the content information (i.e, node attributes) that is usually noisy and characterized by high dimensionality. As the curse of dimensionality could hamper the performance of many machine learning tasks on networks (e.g., community detection and link prediction), feature selection can be a useful technique for alleviating such issue. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised feature selection on networks. Most existing feature selection methods fail to incorporate the linkage information, and the state-of-the-art approaches usually rely on pseudo labels generated from clustering. Such cluster labels may be far from accurate and can mislead the feature selection process. To address these issues, we propose a generative point of view for unsupervised features selection on networks that can seamlessly exploit the linkage and content information in a more effective manner. We assume that the link structures and node content are generated from a succinct set of high-quality features, and we find these features through maximizing the likelihood of the generation process. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our approach can select more discriminative features than state-of-the-art methods.
