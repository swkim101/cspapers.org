The importance of usability in security and privacy technologies is now widely accepted. A vibrant and growing research community in usable security and privacy has contributed a wide range of results in the past 15 years. Despite this, the vast majority of computing students are being exposed to very little of this discipline. In this presentation, we describe our ongoing efforts to enable broader education in this area. We are leading the construction of a body of knowledge for usable security and privacy education, to serve as an organizing framework for the discipline. We are also creating online learning modules for several key topics, as resources for faculty and students. We seek feedback on these resources as well as faculty participants who are interested in utilizing and evaluating the learning modules.
