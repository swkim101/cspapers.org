Cyber physical systems (CPS) feature a tight combination of and coordination between the system's computational and physical elements. A current NIST report estimates that "by the end of the decade, embedded networking and computing components are projected to account for more than half of the value share in diverse sectors, including automotive, consumer electronics, avionics and aerospace, manufacturing, telecommunications, intelligent buildings, and health and medical equipment" and further conjectures that "future applications of CPS are more transformative than the IT revolution of the past three decades". While the increasing proliferation of embedded systems in general and CPS in particular provide a variety of new possibilities, new risks and challenges emerge. Due to the strong interdisciplinary character, advancement in CPS requires a new systems science that encompasses both physical and computational aspects. The scope of the Workshop on Trustworthy Embedded Devices (TrustED) is security of embedded devices in general with focus on cyber physical systems and their environments. TrustED 2013 is a continuation of previous workshops in this series, which were held in conjunction with ESORICS 2011 and IEEE Security & Privacy 2012 (see http://trusted.trust.cased.de for details). The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts from academia and research institutes, industry, and government in the field of security and privacy in cyber physical systems.
