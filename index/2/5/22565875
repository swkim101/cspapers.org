The "Killer Examples" series of workshops are highly interactive workshops whose goals are to bring together educators and developers to share their respective design pattern and object-oriented expertise, and to provide a forum for discussion of techniques for presenting these examples and the design patterns they showcase to students.These workshops have been an annual occurrence at OOPSLA since 2002, in Seattle. The theme of the workshop is "killer examples" for design patterns; to earn the title "killer" an example must provide clear and overwhelmingly compelling motivation for design pattern use.This poster will describe the results of this year's workshop. See "Killer Examples" for Design Patterns: The fifth annual OOPSLA "Killer Examples" workshop, elsewhere in the Conference Companion, for more information.
