Recently, variety of DML methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy of clustering by learning a distance metric; however, most of them only perform a linear transformation, which yields insignificant to non-linear separable data. This study proposes a DML method which provides an integration of kernelization technique with Mahalanobis-based DML. Thus, non-linear transformation of the distance metric can be performed. Moreover, a cluster validity index is optimized by an evolutionary algorithm. The empirical results on semi-supervised clustering suggest the promising result on both synthetic and real-world data set.
