This paper describes a microcellular type propagation environment model that is typical in the Defence Housing Authority in Pakistan. Broadband Access systems are being deployed in this environment. Propagation characteristics in this environment have been investigated in this paper for the typically deployed frequency of 3.5 GHZ. Median path loss, fading and coverage is being reported for propagation at 3.5 GHz band and has been compared with a new band that is being opened up for Broadband wireless access across the globe in the 700 MHz band. The simulation method is based on the quite commonly used ray tracing technique.
