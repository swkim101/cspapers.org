Does the Cell BE Processor have a place in HPC? If so, what is that place? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Cell relative to HPC? What changes would make Cell better suited to HPC? What kinds of performance can we expect from Cell in HPC? Where will the bottlenecks be and how can we avoid them? What kind of performance might we expect from a Cell-based supercomputer? These and related questions will be discussed in a moderated forum.Additional topics for open discussion will include:The Cell BE SDK and its components The Cell BE system simulator Systemsim Installing the SDK Building the SDK Programming to Cell BE Compilers & Tools Samples codeVarious application-oriented source code including Fast Fourier Transform, image, audio resample, math, game math, intrinsics, matrix operation, multi-precision math, noise generation, oscillator, surface, synchronization, and vectorSample port of scalar code to the Cell BE
