Document clustering is central in modern information retrieval applications. Among existing models, non-negative-matrix factorization (NMF) approaches have proven effective for this task. However, NMF approaches, like other models in this context, exhibit a major drawback, namely they use the bag-of-word representation and, thus, do not account for the sequential order in which words occur in documents. This is an important issue since it may result in a significant loss of semantics. In this paper, we aim to address the above issue and propose a new model which successfully integrates a word embedding model, word2vec, into an NMF framework so as to leverage the semantic relationships between words. Empirical results, on several real-world datasets, demonstrate the benefits of our model in terms of text document clustering as well as document/word embedding.
