A general application guidance system -GAGS- was developed to convenient enduser component for data base systems. It has the following four main features: 1. Dialogue supported methods dictionary: guides the user from a given application problem to the adequate solution method or program. 2. Dialogue supported data dictionary: gives syntactic and semantic information about the data available in data administration systems. 3. Dialogue supported execution facility: offers a system triggered execution of programs found with the help of the methods dictionary in order to process data identified by means of the data dictionary. 4. Dialogue supported system guidance: enables the unexperienced user to work with software systems without being a DP-professional. 
 
The basic information structure for the interactive guidance which is the common basic concept of the four facilities listed above, is the information network. It is generated by breaking down the knowledge about the application area in question into information elements (network nodes) which are interconnected (network arcs).
