We present the Lightweight Information Validation Environment, LIVE as asolution to the high complexity and data sizes of modern day computational science applications. LIVE is a data workspace that facilitates the creation of dynamic data processing overlays we call I/O graphs. We use LIVE as aplatform for dynamic extension of scientific applications using lightweight data extraction, runtime discovery and flexible data selection.
