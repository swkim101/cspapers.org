Automatically generating textual descriptions of numerical data is a particularly useful task with the explosion of accessible online information. A textual description allows people to absorb key features more easily, especially when there are large amounts of data involved. Some work has been done in automatically generating text from data; e.g. Mittal et al. [1995] and Robin and McKeown [1996]; in these cases, apart from simple runs in the data, more complicated temporal features of the data have not been described. However, a great deal of data is time-varying in nature: e.g. stockmarket prices, government figures, patient medical records, computer network statistics and weather data, and phenomena such as trends and dramatic changes in the data are of interest.
