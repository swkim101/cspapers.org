As research includes more and larger user studies, a significant problem lies in combining the many types of data files into a single table suitable for analysis by common statistical tools. We have developed a data-aggregation tool that combines user logs, expert scoring, and task/session attributes. The tool also integrates the n-grams derived from a given sequence of actions in the user tasks. The tool provides a GUI for quick and easy configuration.
