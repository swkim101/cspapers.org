Passive indoor positioning systems (PIPS) enable non-invasive tracking of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, Wi-Fi tags) using enterprise network infrastructure. This empowers operators of large airports and retail facilities to optimize cost-intensive resource allocation as well as to provide location-based services to their customers such as geo-fencing and proximity marketing. However, existing PIPS often generate noisy location estimates due to unpredictable interference and attenuation of wireless signals in indoor environments. To address this problem, we propose a novel map matching approach that uses a floor map to constrain location estimates to possible paths a mobile user can take.
