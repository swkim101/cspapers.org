The tutorial surveys state-of-the-art methods for storing and retrieving multimedia data from large databases. Records (= documents) may consist of formatted fields, text, images, voice, animation etc. .4 sample query that we would like to support is ‘in a collection of 2-d color images, find images that are similar to a sunset photograph’. Indexing for images and other media is a new, active area of research; the tutorial will present recent approaches and prototype systems, for 2-d and 3-d medical image databases, 2-d color image databases, and l-d time series databases.
