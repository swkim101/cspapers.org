The ACM/IEEE-CS Computing Curricula Report 1991 includes the the knowledge unit Human-Computer Communication. The KU N in two parts, User Interfaces and Computer Graphics. The objectives of some of the suggested early courses in the Report include User Interfaces. However, there is no indication of where, if at all, Computer Graphics could be included with course work apart from an elective course in the area. The panel will present through concrete examples how computer graphics may be integrated into courses, even traditional ones. The resentatlon is m three parts, f addressing three areas that are consistent with the pane 's theme. 1. Understanding a fundamental aspect of computer graphics through laboratory exercises in CS 1. A discussion on graphics algorithms that are easily programmed by CS 1 students and lead to an understanding of how graphical images are generated and why " jaggies " appear. A discussion on the use of graphics algorithms as a motivation to learning concepts taught in CS2 and data structures courses. An overview of algorithm visualization systems, both from the perspective of the student who uses such a system to ex@ore algorithms/data structures and from the perspective of the instructor who develops wsualizations of algorithms as a pedagogical tool.
