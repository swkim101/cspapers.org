Advances in computing and telecommunication technology provide abundant new opportunities for academic dishonesty. Anecdotal evidence suggests that students are far more aware than faculty of various mechanisms for cheating on exams, plagiarizing assignments, and soliciting work for pay. Fortunately, technological advances also provide the alert instructor with some tools for combating such academic dishonesty.In this session, we will present information on how calculators, cell phones, beepers, and other handheld technology may be used to cheat on exams; how the Internet is used to match students with sources for solutions to their assignments; and existing tools and services for the faculty member.The intention of this session is to inform faculty about various ways that students may commit academic fraud; and tools and approaches that are available to reduce their effectiveness. We also hope to gain further information from other faculty and/or students in attendance. We do not intend to debate whether these activities should be allowed due to the ease with which they are committed, as is often discussed.We will provide a bibliography of articles about high-tech academic dishonesty, software tools and services for detecting plagiarism (including shared code in programming assignments), and Internet resources.
