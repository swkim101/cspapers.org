For several years, the introductory assembly language course at Indiana-Purdue at Fort Wayne has used “structured” assembly language on an IBM System 370. A later course makes use of VAX-11 MACRO assembly language on a VAX 11/780. This paper shows how the major constructs for structured programming may be implemented in VAX-11 MACRO. The scheme involves assembly language templates for each of the constructs, a standard labeling scheme, and a commenting method which reflects the structure of the program.
