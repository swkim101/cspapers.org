ASAG, the <underline>A</underline>ssignment <underline>S</underline>cheduler, <underline>A</underline>nalyzer and <underline>G</underline>enerator [2], was first developed in 1968. Its purpose was to help fill the gap between computer grading systems and large scale, frame-oriented CAI systems. In particular, it was designed to generate assignments at a level and pace appropriate for each student and, at the same time, to automate assignment checking and record keeping in a mass education environment.
 The original system design met these goals, but the manner of implementation imposed some unexpected and undesirable restrictions on both the students and instructors. In order to ease these restrictions, and lay the groundwork for implementing ASAG in other courses, two major revisions have recently been made to the system. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and describe these new ASAG features.
