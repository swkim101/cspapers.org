Cognitive Radio (CR) is a state-of-the-art technology that provides unlicensed users the capacity to share the wireless spectrum with licensed users in an opportunistic way. However, due to the complexity of Cognitive Radio, it is difficult to be implemented in handheld devices such as PDA or iPAD. The challenging for the design here is mainly about the power consumption and resource utilization. This article will discuss about the optimized architecture based on FPGA devices for solving these problems. The Altera-based FPGA is used in this research and evaluation.
