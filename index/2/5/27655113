While the flexibility and autonomy of information production and sharing on the Web is phenomenal, it is daunting to navigate, collect, process, and track data in this dynamic and open information space. The problem is aggravated when the sources of information change continually and unpredictably, and the queries are Continual Queries, i.e., queries for which responses given to users must be continually updated, as the sources of interest get updated. We need to frequently visit the sites of interest and fuse the newly updated information to track the changes to determine if they are relevant to a userâ€™s information needs. We seek to relieve the user from maintaining personal Web-polling schedules by building Web-CAM, a Web-based Continuous Adaptive Monitoring system. It continuously pushes the updates to the user while they are still fresh. The term monitoring is used explicitly to account for the differences from the classical crawling technique. A monitoring task fetches a web page, much like a crawler does, but with the goal of fetching new information relevant to one or more queries, while a crawl is not done with any specific user request in mind.
