The AKBC 2013 workshop aims to be a venue of excellence and vision in the area of knowledge base construction. This year's workshop will feature keynotes by ten leading researchers in the field, including from Google, Microsoft, Stanford, and CMU. The submissions focus on visionary ideas instead of on experimental evaluation. Nineteen accepted papers will be presented as posters, with nine exceptional papers also highlighted as spotlight talks. Thereby, the workshop aims provides a vivid forum of discussion about the field of automated knowledge base construction.
