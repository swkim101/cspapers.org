AsthmaGuide is a smartphone and cloud based asthma system in which a smart phone is used as a hub for collecting a comprehensive collection of information. The data, including data over time, is then displayed in a cloud web application for both patients and healthcare providers to view. AsthmaGuide also provides an advice and alarm infrastructure based on the collected data and parameters set by healthcare providers. With these components, AsthmaGuide provides a comprehensive ecosystem that allows patients to be involved in their own health and also allows doctors to provide more effective day to day care. Using real asthma patient wheezing sounds we develop a new combination of classifiers that is 96% accurate at automatically detecting wheezing. This abstract provides an overview of the design and implementation of AsthmaGuide and provides empirical evidence that AsthmaGuide is 3% - 11% more accurate in detecting wheezing sounds than standard techniques.
