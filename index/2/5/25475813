In a latch-type address buffer circuit for use in a clock-synchronous CMIS.RAM, a transistor is connected between an inverter, which is supplied with an address signal and the power source. A clock circuit is provided for generating an internal clock signal by which only in the period of latching the input address signal, the transistor is turned ON to make the inverter operative, thus reducing the total power consumption.
