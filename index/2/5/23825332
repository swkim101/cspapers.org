Enhanced Publication Information Systems (EPISs) are information systems devised for the management of enhanced publications (EP), i.e. digital publications enriched with (links to) other research outcomes such as data, processing workflows, software. Today, EPISs are typically realised with a "from scratch" approach that entails non-negligible implementation and maintenance costs. This work argues for a more systemic approach to narrow those costs and presents the notion of Enhanced Publication Management Systems, software frameworks that support the realisation of EPISs by providing developers with EP-oriented tools and functionalities.
