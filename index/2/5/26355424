While text based languages have been (relatively) straightforward to grade automatically, visual programming languages have been largely left out of the equation. However, as the demand for introductory CS courses has recently grown, so too has the interest in CS courses that use visual programming languages, and thus the need for a scalable solution to providing student feedback. The demo will present a system an autograder for Snap!, a visual programming language inspired by Scratch. Our autograder is a hosted solution which would allow other courses to use our tools with little effort. At the most basic level, the autograder contains a database of questions, test cases, and a method for presenting results to students. However, there are additional features for integration through LTI and advanced data analysis. The autograder allows real-time feedback for students, and for instructors to write tests in JavaScript, and eventually Snap! directly. We will show how instructors can write test cases and integrate the tool into their classrooms. We will also demo some data analysis capabilities of our system. This demo should be informative to those working with visual programming languages, including ones other than Snap!. We hope to provide a useful tool, and gain feedback for future iterations of the software.
