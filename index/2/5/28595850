This paper presents a functional model based object-oriented framework for mechatronic system development. The approach has been applied to conceptual design of a new generation plate making system for DNA micro-array manufacturing automation. The contributions of this paper include the functional model and object-oriented development framework for mechatronic systems, and concepts of cost and design optimization at the system functional model level.
