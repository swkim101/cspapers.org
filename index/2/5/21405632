The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to revolutionize the way people interact with their environment and the objects within it by creating a ubiquitous network of physical devices. However, current advancement in IoT has been heavily targeted towards creating battery-powered electronics. There remains a huge gap between the collection of smart devices integrated into the IoT and the massive number of everyday physical objects. The goal of my research is to bridge this gap in the current IoT framework to enable novel sensing and interactive applications with daily objects.
