ETHER is a new pattern directed invocation language for problem solving applications, ETHER programs allow arbitrarily much processing to happen in parallel. For example, when a goal generates several subgoals they are all pursued in parallel ETHER introduces the concepts of an activity which is a generalization of process, and platform, a generalization of context. Two uses for parallelism are discussed: parallel evaluation of subgoah and the use of opponents, concurrently running activities that attempt to show a subgoal is unattainable. If the opponent succeeds then work on the subgoal halts.
