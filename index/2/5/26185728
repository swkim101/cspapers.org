The purpose of this paper is to present an improvement of the stability of an electro-optic modulator obtained from temperature control. A digital system developed with a PSOC microcontroller is used associated with a small power amplifier. The behavior of the modulator can be observed by the way of its nonlinear properties. By the thermal control of the modulator it is possible to reduce significantly the drift of the modulator.
