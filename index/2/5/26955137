The brokers must make trades in multiple markets and to be successful, brokers must make many good predictions about future supply, demand,and prices. Clearing price prediction is an important part of the brokerâ€™s wholesale market strategy because it helps the broker to make intelligent decisions when purchasing energy at low cost in a day-ahead market. I describe my work on using machine learning methods to predict prices in the Power TAC wholesale market, which will be used in future bidding strategies.
