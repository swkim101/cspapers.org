Searching conversational speech poses several new challenges, among which is how the searcher will make sense of what they find. This paper describes our initial experiments with a freely available collection of Enron telephone conversations. Our goal is to help the user make sense of search results by finding information about mentioned people, places and organizations. Because automated entity recognition is not yet sufficiently accurate on conversational telephone speech, we ask the user to transcribe just the name, and to indicate where in the recording it was heard. We then seek to link that mention to other mentions of the same entity in a variety of sources (in our experiments, in email and in Wikipedia). We cast this as an entity linking problem, and achieve promising results by utilizing social network features to help compensate for the limited accuracy of automatic transcription for this challenging content.
