A novel mechanism of transclusion for collecting and producing information on the Web, named partial bookmarking, is proposed. Partial bookmarking allows a user to collect portions of any web page by making it able to use for a spatial hypertext, like a web document element, without the need to duplicate its contents. Whereas the previous studies involving transclusion required pre-designed linkable objects, such as XML elements or HTML objects, partial bookmarking does not rely on any document structure. To accomplish partial bookmarking, we enhanced a conventional web browser with multiple tabs by introducing the technology of mirroring to display only a portion of a web page appropriately while factoring in potential copyright issues.
