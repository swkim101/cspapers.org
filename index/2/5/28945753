This paper provides an overview of the 1st International Workshop on Multimodal Crowd Sensing (CrowdSens 2012), held at the 21st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2012). This workshop aimed to provide an open forum for researchers from various fields such as fields such as Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction, Data Mining, Information Retrieval, User Modeling and Personalization, Stream Processing, and Sensor Networks, for addressing the challenges of effectively mining, analyzing, fusing, and exploiting information sourced from multimodal physical and social sensor data sources.
