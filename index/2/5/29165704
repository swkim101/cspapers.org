Based on a common sense that words do not repeatedly appear in an effective keyphrase, we propose a novel algorithm named KCSP for document-specific keyphrase candidate search using sequential pattern mining with gap constraints, which only needs to scan a document once and automatically specifies appropriate gap constraints for words without usersâ€™ participation. The experimental results confirm that it helps improve the quality of keyphrase extraction.
