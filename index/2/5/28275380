ings based on the distinctiveness of the discipline and their departments. Yet all focus on core PFF concepts, providing the next generation of faculty members with exposure to a broad range of experiences and settings that will better prepare them for their careers. This chapter examines nine common kinds of PFF activities: courses for credit, seminars and workshops, certificate programs, activities at partner institutions, mentoring programs, assessment and evaluation tools, attention to diversity, informal student activities, and activities and resources through the disciplinary societies. Courses are the primary way education is organized, and this is true for PFF. The PFF program in biology at the University of Cincinnati offers three seminar courses for graduate credit. " Becoming a More Effective Teacher " and " The Academic Job Search Process " are offered through the graduate school and open to graduate students in all disciplines. They cover topics related to the job search process, the diversity of academic positions available, trends in higher education, and approaches to cultivating student learning. The third course, " Effective Tools for Teaching in the Biological Sciences, " is targeted to the particular challenges and opportunities of teaching in the discipline. It includes topics such as course preparation, classroom presentation
