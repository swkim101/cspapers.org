In computer networks, file transfer methods are used as a tool to exchange files among computers. Efficiency of a file transfer method is generally measured in terms of bandwidth usage, integrity, security, scalability and fault tolerance. We have critically reviewed some state-of-the-art patent file transfer methods to know about their shortcomings and strengths for different scenarios. We analyzed that none of them is up to the mark in terms of all parameters of efficiency and there is a great need of research in this area. After a critical analysis, some methods for the improvement have also been proposed in this study.
