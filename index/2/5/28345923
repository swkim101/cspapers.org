The goal of the CS for SC Landscape Report is to examine the current state of computing education on the K-12 level within the state of South Carolina. Building off of the 2007 South Carolina's Computing Competitiveness Report, the report more fully examines the fundamental questions of who? what? and where? in terms how computer science education has developed in the state over the past nine years. Results are reported in this poster based on a survey of 158 K-12 educators and ten follow-up interviews with leading computing teachers and program administrators from around the state. This research is funded through a generous grant through the National Science Foundation Broadening Participation in Computing Alliance (NSF Award No. 1228352, 1228355) administered through Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP).
