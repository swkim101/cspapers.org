This special session brings together leaders from three groups: code.org, Exploring Computer Science [1-3](ECS) and Computer Science Principles [4, 5] (CSP) who have formed a public/private partnership to generate resources for introductory computer science students at many levels. These leaders report on work completed as well as ongoing and future work to help the community broaden participation in computer science while scaling and facilitating communities of students and teachers in high school and college.
