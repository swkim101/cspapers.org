The goal of the Career Development Forum is to provide a supportive environment for recent PHDs (under 5 years) to discuss issues related to career development, including defining a research trajectory, identifying funding sources, getting involved in professional service within SIGCHI and elsewhere, communicating their work and strengthening their public profile, and balancing work, family and social life. A selected group of recent PHDs will interact with senior researchers from academia and/or industry. Each recent PHD will be provided with a 20+ minute slot to discuss his/her career and career development with the other attendees. There will also be a series of panels in which senior HCI researchers discuss research development, getting involved in professional service, and work/life balance.
