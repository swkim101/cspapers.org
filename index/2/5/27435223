The pa#enumber or book thickness of a graph is the minimum number of pages required to embed the graph in a book; i.e., if the vertices are arranged along the spine of a book, the pagenumber is the number of pages required to draw the edges without crossings. More formally, an embedding of a graph in a book is a linear {or cyclic) ordering of the vertices and a coloring of the edges such that if a < b < c < d and edges (a,c) and (b,d} both exist then (a,c) and {b,d) have different colors. The one-page graphs are precisely the outerplanar graphs, and thus k-page graphs are sometimes called k-outerplanar, but this latter definition is not universal. Graphs of small pagenumber have arisen in several different areas of complexity theory and VLSI design. The following are just a sample; for a furthur discussion, see [CLR2]. Single-row routing (see, e.#., [RS]), with the restriction that no wire can pass between two nodes, is just the two page embedding problem. The Diogenes ap-
