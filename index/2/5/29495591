It has become a clich√© to talk about Wanamaker's dilemma, his famous quote that "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half" is well known. So why talk about it today? Well, I'll show you that some of the best targeted consumer marketing still suffers exactly from this problem, and tell you why -- it's not humanly possible to solve it! At Amplero we've finally solved it and made that solution accessible to marketers, using machine learning in combination with the revolution in online experimentation that the advent of the multi-armed bandit has brought about.
