Research shows that middle school is the optimum time to introduce coding and computer science concepts. According to research from Accenture and Girls Who Code, computing appeal for girls peaks in middle school, where having an inspiring teacher and thinking that coding is "for girls" are instrumental in sparking interest. Middle schools tend to have electives where coding classes can find a home. But how do you convince the teachers that this change in academic focus is in the best interests of the students? And how do you prepare them to teach a content that they do not know and might not agree with? I haven't seen advice or research on how to overcome teacher resistance to computer science and coding. In 2013 an 8th grade elective was converted into a coding and computer science concepts course. Several of the business education endorsed teachers continue to push for less coding and more productivity tools in this course. Teachers with the Computer Science endorsement provided research, student interest surveys and employment outlooks to these teachers but they did not budge. Enrollment in the coding class has doubled and tripled in many of the schools, but a number of the teachers are still not enthusiastic about the course and the content. What could we have done differently to help these teachers accept change? Build a foundation for change -- Share current research on the importance of introducing coding and computer science. Build Community -- Look to local colleges for mentoring and co-teaching possibilities. Build Relationships -- Strengthen the connections between teachers and administrators.
