Ucigame (pronounced OO-see-GAH-me) is a Java package that supports the programming of 2D sprite-based computer games. Designed for novice programmers, it enables students in an introductory class to write computer games that have animated sprites, music and sound effects, and event-driven keyboard and mouse handling. Ucigame has also been used successfully in a senior-level class for experienced programmers.
