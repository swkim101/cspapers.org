A critical piece of any successful curriculum is a robust example that permeates the key concepts of the field. For computer science, we refer to such an example as CS-complete. A good CS-complete example is applicable in CS1, CS2, and Discrete Mathematics. Approximately 4000 years ago, the ancient Egyptians used a numbering system that serves as a prototype CS-complete example. In this paper, we outline the use of Egyptian numbering system as an example that naturally extends through CS1, CS2, and Discrete Mathematics.
