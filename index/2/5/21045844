The dynamics of a rolling disk and a single wheel robot on an incline are derived and established respectively. The condition of rolling up is addressed. If the condition of rolling up is violated, a methodology of tracking is proposed. The system is stabilized around the position perpendicular to the surface. Simulation results are also provided.
