The 2007 International Symposium on Wikis brings together wiki researchers, practitioners, and users. The goal of the symposium is to explore and extend our growing community. 
 
The symposium has a rigorously reviewed research paper track, as well as plenty of space for workshops, posters, panels, demonstrations, and open discussions. We intend WikiSym 2007 to be an exiciting venue for anyone who is involved in using, researching, or developing wikis. 
 
We recognize the online world is always evolving, and we also welcomed contributions which are about other online media consistent with the wiki philosophy of being open, organic and participatory. 
 
Given the interdisciplinary nature of wikis, we have especially invited contributions from researchers and practitioners from a wide range of fields including: 
business, marketing, law 
communications and media studies 
computer science, human-computer interaction 
history, political science, geography 
information and library science 
linguistics, discourse analysis, language studies 
natural sciences, medicine 
 
. 
 
We were very happy at the positive support, and we did get submissions covering all aspects that we suggested. For the research paper track, we received 39 submissions. Of these, we accepted 9 as full papers, and 11 as short papers. All submissions were reviewed by at least three members of our international program committee, and acceptance was decided by consensus. 
 
We feel that the wiki idea is continuing to gain pace as it reaches many people who see the benefits and fascination of this simple but far-reaching approach to sharing knowledge in a community.
