Geographic retrieval and visualization systems are essential to satisfy user's spatial information needs. However, the end users spatial information need is much more diverse and demanding in complex decision making scenarios such as: Persons moving to a new area need information about which place meets their individual demands. To analyze such requirements, we conducted a study with 18 users of different age group, knowledge, and expertise. In this paper we report the study methods, results, analysis and insights to build an end user-friendly geospatial decision support system.
