The acknowledgment schemes of legacy 802.11 do not support optimized performance due to high overheads. The performance further deteriorates for real time traffic. Transmission opportunity (TXOP) mechanism and Block Acknowledgements (Acks) were later introduced to facilitate improved performance in 802.11e. In this paper we aim to prove the effectiveness of both TXOP and Block Ack and analyze their effects under varying channel conditions through simulations carried out in NS-2.
