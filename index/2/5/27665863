By dividing the path planning problem into two subproblems (local and global planning), we obtain a planner for redundant manipulators that is fast, effective and versatile. Local planning is achieved within a potential field paradigm, modelling a rigid linked manipulator with slightly flexible links. The planner can either be used within advanced tele-operated systems, or as path refinement within an autonomous planner. We use a geometric construction which we call the skeleton to provide a concise connection between the global and local planners. The global planner acquires critical geometric information from the skeleton and end-effector paths are extracted and used to direct the local planner as a first step to a geometric reasoning planner.<<ETX>>
