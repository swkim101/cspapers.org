The eROSE plugin for ECLIPSE uses version archives to guide programmers: You changed fKeys[] and eROSE suggests you to change initDefaults(), because both items always have been changed together in the past. In addition, eROSE points out item coupling that is undetectable by program analysis, for instance between fKeys[] and a properties file. All eROSE needs is a CVS repository; we designed eROSE to be as efficient and unobtrusive as possible.
