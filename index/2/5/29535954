The panelists will share their experiences in developing closed laboratory exercises for lower level CS courses with particular emphasis on using graphical presentation techniques as a pedological and motivational tool. The use of interactive animations and visualization is combined with structured support for the student programmer to provide an apprentice style learning environment.
Three major threads form the backbone of this curriculum. The first is the use of interactive animations and experimentation programs to introduce and illustrate dynamic processesâ€”e.g. algorithm behavior, or changes in data structures over a period of time. The second thread is the use of graphics in student programs, not only as motivation, but also as a visual feedback and debugging tool. The third thread trying all together is the extensive use of model programs, shell drivers, toolkits, and procedures that encapsulate abstractions. These programming tools support the apprentice style of learning and illustrate good software design and practice throughout the curriculum.
