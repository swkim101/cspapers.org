Runestone is an open-source ebook platform designed to create and publish interactive computer science textbooks (See http://runestoneinteractive.org/). Runestone textbooks support programming within the browser, code visualizations, and a wide variety of practice activities, from multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions to Parsons Problems (drag-and-drop mixed-up code). The presenters have several years of experience developing and using ebooks for CS1, AP CS A, AP CSP, data structures, and web programming. Several studies have demonstrated good usability and positive learning and attitude impacts on students using these ebooks. Runestone ebooks can be customized to meet the needs of individual courses and teachers. The goal of this workshop is to help computer science teachers use and modify Runestone ebooks. The hands-on session will start by leading participants through use of the ebooks as if they were students. Participants will next create their own custom course of any existing ebook in the library and will use the instructor's dashboard to review student activity, modify the course, and grade students. Finally, participants will create their own assignments using Runestone's active learning components, which serves as a starting point for authoring their own content in Runestone. Laptop Required.
