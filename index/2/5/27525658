Most of the early work was empirical, i.e., collecting da ta and trying t o postulate models based upon the da ta [Akiyama71], [Basili&Zelkowitz77], [Belady&Lehman7G], [Boehm73], [Endres75], [Walston&Felix77], [Wolverton74]. Some of the work involved the postulation of a metric or even model tha t tried to explain the nature of the process or product [Boehm,Brown&Lipow76], [Elshoff76], [Fuer&Folkes79], [Halstead771, [McCabe76], [Musa75], [Putnam78]. Measurement was also used for evaluating the hypotheses in controlled experiments, [Basili&Reiter79], [Cur tis791, [Gannon&Horning75], [Sackman,Erikson&GrantG3] and occasionally was promoted as an integral par t of the software development process [Basili&Turner75].
