Treat is a special purpose language for use in compiler writing. A Treat program translates a graph into c-trees (the intermediate language of the pcc compiler) and uses the back end of the C compiler to generate code. Treat has been developed specifically for use in an AdaTM compiler. A Treat program consists of applicative transformation rules. Treat's distinctive aspects include triggering transformations during pattern matching, a context mechanism for dynamic binding and assignment in a language with lazy evaluation.
