To improve student's class experience, the use of mobile devices has been steadily increasing. However, such use of mobile learning environments in the class is mostly static in nature through content delivery or traditional quiz taking. In CS courses, we need learning environments where students can interact with the problem and faculty can assess their learning skills in real-time using problems with different degree of difficulty. To facilitate such interactive problem solving using mobile devices, a comprehensive backend system is necessary. However, such system is not available to CS instructors. To facilitate in-class interactive problem solving, a Mobile Response System (MRS) is developed, which is independent of any interactive problems or its domain. This demo session will present details of NSF funded MRS software, associated pedagogy, and how to use it in the class. MRS provides faculty with the opportunity of evidence-based teaching by allowing students with exercises with different learning outcomes and by getting an instant feedback on their performance. The formative assessment information provided by MRS allows the faculty to have real-time evidence of students' comprehension of covered lecture materials on that particular class and also helps faculty to identify the concepts that need to be repeated or reinforced. MRS is open sourced, extensible and can render interactive exercise developed by third party developer.
