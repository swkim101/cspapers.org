The Learn Java in N Games project (LJING) aims to teach topics in CS1, CS2, and other courses by having students implement a variety of games. Each game is presented as a stand-alone module, easily incorporated into an existing course without committing to major curricular changes. Modules include unusually clear solution code, skeleton code for students to complete, JUnit tests for quick feedback to students and automated grading, and clear assignment statements with learning objectives. Program code strictly separates game logic from graphic user interfaces (GUIs), allowing the same code to be used in both conventional and mobile Android environments. In this three-hour tutorial, participants will complete two assignments. These assignments are ready to be used in classes the next day.
