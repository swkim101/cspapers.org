This paper proposes an approach to enlarge the impedance range of admittance-type haptic interfaces. Admittance-type haptic interfaces have advantages over impedance-type haptic interfaces in the interaction with high impedance virtual environments. However, the performance of admittance-type haptic interfaces is often limited by the lower boundary of the impedance that can be achieved without stability issue. Especially, it is well known that low value of inertia in an admittance model often causes unstable interaction. This paper extends recently proposed input-to-state stable approach [1] to further lower down the achievable impedance in admittance-type haptic interfaces with less conservative constraint compared with the passivity-based approaches. The primary challenge was identifying the nonlinear hysteresis components which are essential for the implementation of the input-to-state stable approach. Through experimental investigation and after separating and merging the admittance model and the position controller, the partial admittance model (from the measured human force to the desired velocity) and the velocity controller (from the velocity tracking error to the controller force) were found having counter-clockwise hysteresis nonlinear behavior. Therefore, it allows implementing the one-port input-to-state stable (ISS) approach for making both components dissipative and ISS. An additional advantage of the proposed ISS approach is the easiness of the implementation. No model information is required, and the network representation is not necessary, unlike the passivity-based approaches. Series of experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach in term of significantly lowering the achievable impedance value compared with what the time-domain passivity approach can render.
