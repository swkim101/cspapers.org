This paper is concerned with minimising path errors due to trajectory design without dynamic consideration of the arm movement and the performance of the actuators. A Controller is proposed which takes into account the integral dynamics of the "manipulator system". The scheme works by introducing the trajectory generator in to a task space feedback control loop. The trajectory is adapted on-line to make actuator demands which can be physically achieved (if such a trajectory exist), while constraining the tool to the required path.
