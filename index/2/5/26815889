This demonstration shows a wireless, acoustic sensor network application--- monitoring amphibian populations in the monsoonal woodlands of northern Australia. Our system uses automatic recognition of animal vocalizations to census the populations of native frogs and the invasive introduced species, the Cane Toad (see Fig. 1). This is a challenging application because it requires high frequency acoustic sampling, complex signal processing and wide area sensing coverage [2]. Our prototype consists of a hybrid mixture of Stargates and inexpensive, resource-poor Mica motes operating in concert. The Mica motes are used to collect acoustic samples, and expand the sensor network coverage. The Stargates are used for resource-intensive tasks.
