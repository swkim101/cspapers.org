Higher efficiency and the safety of hull inspection can be achieved by replacing the conventional methods with modern crawling robots. This paper consists of detailed study of the design and development of a crawling robot with a novel permanent magnetic wheel based on Halbach magnetic array. The magnetic array and the wheel assembly were designed based on the magnetic simulation results. Maintaining the adequate adhesion force as well as the friction force of the wheels were considered in designing the wheels. The crawling robot is equipped with a steering system based on Ackermann steering method hence the steering angles are controlled by an algorithm and actuated using servo motors. The driving system of the robot is equipped with four geared stepper motors and they are controlled separately by the algorithm according to the inputs of the controller. The control architecture and the components used for the robot control system are explained. The operator can remotely control the robot and inspect the hull surface via the camera feed available in the HMI (Human Machine Interface) of the robot. The prototype of the crawling robot was tested in a similar environment and the test results are included in the paper.
