Magnetically compatible robots are required to develop haptic interfaces for neuroscience studies and MRI guided robots for minimally invasive interventions. This paper introduces an MR compatible master slave concept using a hydraulic transmission, and presents an operational robot able to work within an MRI/fMRI scanner and acquire images continuously during motion. It describes a magnetically inert actuator using a direct drive to power the hydraulic circuitry and a modular set of position and force/torque sensors that we have developed. These were integrated into a haptic interface prototype with on rotary degree of freedom, which can be used in conjuction with an fMRI. The MR compatibility was confirmed experimentally, and the performances show a manipulation accuracy of a few micrometers over a range of several centimeters, and forces up to several thousand Newton.
