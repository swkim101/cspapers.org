An approach to motion planning among moving obstacles is presented, whereby obstacles are modeled as intelligent decision-making agents. The decision-making processes of the obstacles are assumed to be similar to that of the mobile robot. A probabilistic extension to the velocity obstacle approach is used as a means for navigation and modeling uncertainty about the moving obstacles' decisions.
