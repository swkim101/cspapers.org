The implicit delimiting or narrowing of the domain of quantification, e.g., in the case of "unselective quantifiers" such as the adverbs of quantification always, usually, mostly, etc., is a heavily context-dependent phenomenon that has much in common with anaphora, presupposition projection, the dynamics of reference time, reference location, etc., and other of the context-dependent phenomena discussed in Partee (1979). While many nonlinguistic factors clearly play a role in such phenomena, there are interesting issues at the inter-section of discourse processing and sentence grammar, since in addition to context as constructed at the discourse level, there are subsentential "local contexts" which have limited lifespans and are constrained by aspects of sentence grammar, both syntactic and semantic.
