Current sensor network nodes are not designed for a rapid succession of large-scale deployments. While hundreds of nodes have been deployed in static networks (e.g. ExScale, GreenOrb) large-scale, mobile, repetitive deployments are difficult to manage. We developed a new platform, the WREN, to be a low-cost, easy to maintain and rapid to deploy, wireless sensing node for human contact network measurements.
