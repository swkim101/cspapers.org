Through a larger initiative involving mathematical sciences faculty from the three State of Iowa Board of Regentsâ€™ institutions, faculty members from the Departments of Statistics and Mathematics at Iowa State University have started a collaboration in the area of statistics training for future and current mathematics teachers. In this paper, we begin by discussing the recent developments in high school mathematics education at both the state and national level that served as a focus for change in the statistics education of mathematics teachers in the state. We then describe our present efforts in changing curriculum in statistical content and pedagogy in the undergraduate and graduate programs at Iowa State for future and current mathematics teachers. Finally, we offer some direction for future work in these regards.
