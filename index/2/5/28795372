A SIGCSE'95 panel [1] espoused the philosophy that software engineering principles should be considered an integral part of the the entire undergraduate computer science curriculum. This was in response to traditional beliefs and practices pervading curricula at that time; namely, that software engineering was "additional material" to be covered, often in isolated upper-division courses, and not a natural component of all computer science courses. A group of five panelists discussed their efforts in this area and a lively panel/audience discussion ensued.
