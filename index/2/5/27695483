However, DT models usually suffer from the curse of dimensionality and achieve degenerated performance when there are many noisy features. To address these issues, this paper first presents a novel data-dependent generalization error bound for the perceptron decision tree(PDT), which provides the theoretical justification to learn a sparse linear hyperplane in each decision node and to prune the tree. Following our analysis, we introduce the notion of sparse perceptron decision node (SPDN) with a budget constraint on the weight coefficients, and propose a sparse perceptron decision tree (SPDT) algorithm to achieve nonlinear prediction performance. To avoid generating an unstable and complicated decision tree and improve the generalization of the SPDT, we present a pruning strategy by learning classifiers to minimize cross-validation errors on each SPDN. Extensive empirical studies verify that our SPDT is more resilient to noisy features and effectively generates a small,yet accurate decision tree. Compared with state-of-the-art DT methods and SVM, our SPDT achieves better generalization performance on ultrahigh dimensional problems with more than 1 million features.
