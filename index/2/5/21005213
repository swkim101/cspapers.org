This paper presents a simple prototype of a lightweight sensing and tactile communication system that allows bidirectional communication between two humans, or between a human and a computer. This system tracks the user's actions with simple sensors, and uses tiny vibration motors as feedback devices. Vibration motors provide feedback that is both intuitive and minimally intrusive. The design is simple, flexible, and extensible to large-scale, full-body motion tasks.
