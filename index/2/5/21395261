This paper tries to realize the backward double salto. This is more difficult and challenging than the backward single salto by a self-standing horizontal bar exercise robot discussed in a previous paper. The present robot has three links that are connected with two rotational joints and driven by two DC motors controlled by a PD-control law. The backward double salto needs 7.3 rad/s over the horizontal bar in the simulation. First, a control method is shown that accelerates rotation around the horizontal bar within two forward giant swings. Finally, experimental results demonstrate a backward double salto which is consistent with the simulated one.
