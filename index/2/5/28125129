We study strategic games in the tradition of cooperative game theory, where players may make binding agreements that involve side payments. We use a decomposition of strategic games into competitive and cooperative components to define and axiomatize a solution that unifies earlier solutions and generalizes to the case of incomplete information. In the latter case, we give incentive compatible mechanisms that achieve first-best efficiency.
