The history of Government interest and involvement in CAD can be traced to the very origins of this field. The author is aware of Government sponsored work in the electronics area in the late 1950's and was personally involved in CAD development both in-house and on contract since the early 1960's. This paper addresses only electronics CAD, but there has been considerable Government investment in non-electronics CAD as well. There are currently numerous CAD programs in widespread use which had their origins in Government sponsored work. Virtually all the circuit analysis programs, many of the logic simulators, and many of the PC and IC layout programs are obvious examples of work resulting from early Government sponsorship.
