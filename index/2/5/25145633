In most business software systems the time dimension of business objects plays a significant role. Time is a crosscutting concern that is hard to separate from other business logic. We have developed a toolkit that allows existing business application systems to be extended with "time-conscious" behavior in a non-intrusive way by factoring out all aspects of time-related behavior into a framework and a set of classes that is distinct from the existing code base. The Time Conscious ObjectsTM (TCOTM) toolkit is currently implemented in JavaTM, but through the use of generation technology the toolkit can easily be made available in any language that supports polymorphism.
