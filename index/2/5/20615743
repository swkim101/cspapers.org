Let be a graph with vertices and edges; we write and when the graph in question is not clear. A matching of is a subset of the edges such that each vertex is incident to at most one edge of . A maximum matching of is a matching of maximum cardinality. A perfect matching is a matching of cardinality . Finding a maximum matching is a classic problem with many practical applications, see [7]. The fastest algorithms to solve it take time, for bipartite graphs [5] as well as general graphs [8]. Faster algorithms are known for some special graph classes if we want to find a perfect matching, see e.g. [2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12]. Our research was motivated by [2], where we showed how to find a perfect matching in a 3-regular biconnected graph in time. A natural question to ask is whether this algorithm can be extended to similar types of graphs, such as 3-regular graphs that are not biconnected. In this paper, we show that whether a 3-regular graph is biconnected or not makes a big difference. More precisely, we show that there is a linear reduction from the maximum matching problem to the maximum matching problem in 3-regular graphs. By this we mean that we can transform any graph into a 3-regular graph with ! edges such that a maximum matching in can be recovered from one in in !
