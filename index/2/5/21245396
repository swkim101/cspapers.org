This paper proposes a novel image quality enhancement method using fuzzy filter and texture map. The texture map of the original images or the compressed images is estimated and then is used to control the strength's filter. The task is to reduce blocking artifacts while preserving the sharpness of decompressed images. The simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy filtering scheme achieves the best visual quality and PSNR among the simulated methods.
