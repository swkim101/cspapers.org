This work focuses on the abstraction hierarchy for a grasp which has been recognized from low-level hand-object interaction data. Previous work done on grasp classification and recognition is discussed. The proposed abstraction hierarchy is presented with illustrations, implementation issues, as well as experimental results. Issues pertaining to the conceptual analysis of the other aspects of recognizing grasping tasks are also presented. The authors report on the current status of the project and future work.
