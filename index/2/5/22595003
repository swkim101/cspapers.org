A static and OSPF routing integration scheme has been proposed to use 2 types of lightpaths: i.e. point-to-point and one-by-one lightpaths in IP-over-CWDM networks. The 2 types of lightpaths cause multipaths with different routing: i.e. static and OSPF routings, and therefore, a suitable scheme is necessary to assure that packets are routed by the shortest route, even if the routings are different. The proposed scheme can provide the packet routings by the shortest route, which was evaluated experimentally in a 5-node network with ROADMs.
