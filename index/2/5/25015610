Do different people hold different reasons for promoting universal computer science education (CS4All)? Do different rationale for CS education imply different learning designs? Is it possible to design educational activities that meaningfully integrate multiple purposes and visions? As CS4All initiatives kick off in localities across the United States, we believe that these questions are key to developing policies, pedagogies and technologies that actually are 'for all'. In this session, participants will engage in a facilitated conversation supported by an informal collaborative tabletop card game. The game, meant to promote reflection, debate, discussion and ideation around CS education, will engage participants as designers tasked with integrating multiple commonly-held values and visions of Computer Science education into a concrete learning activities. The goal of this informal activity and brainstorm is not to become a master designer in 45 minutes. Rather, this design challenge acts as a launching pad to have meaningful discussions around the various visions of Computer Science education and what it looks like to translate these visions into practice. We will also invite participants to give feedback on their experience using the game as a conversation starter, with the hope that it might be used by others engaged in deliberations around how to design CS educational experiences. The game will be supplementing an ongoing research project, "CSed Visions" (http://wp.me/P3GrOX-ek) that investigates the role that visions and values play in Computer Science education.
