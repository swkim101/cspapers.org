This file system grew out of exploratory work in the file system-terminal area. The main reason for such a project was to explore file organizations that would be useful for a wide range of Design Automation applications. The specific problem we chose was the update and maintenance of logic sheets. A secondary reason was to gain some knowledge of how the standard capabilities of OS/360 could be used to implement a file system.
