Deep learning has catapulted to the front page of the New York Times, formed the core of the so-called 'Google brain', and achieved impressive results in vision, speech recognition, and elsewhere. Yet researchers have offered simple conundrums that deep learning doesn't address. For example, consider the sentence: 'The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of Styrofoam.' What was made of Styrofoam? The large ball? Or the table? The answer is obviously 'the table', but if we change the word 'Styrofoam' to 'steel', the answer is clearly 'the large ball'. To automatically answer this type of question, our computers require an extensive body of knowledge. We believe that text mining can provide the requisite body of knowledge. My talk will describe work at the new Allen Institute for AI towards building the next-generation of text-mining systems.
