This paper describes the current state of HILARE: a modular progressively-built mobile robot aimed at general robotics research. The computer organization comprises of local mini and micro processors coupled with a remote time-shared system acting as a consulting facility. A multi-level decision-making system is presented with world models, inference rules, and algorithms particular to each level. The navigation planner uses a geometric model wherein 2-space is partitioned into polygonal areas based on perceptual and/or initial information. A cost function is proposed which provides support for optimal or E-optimal path finding.
