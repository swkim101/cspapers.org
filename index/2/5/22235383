The need for workers in the information technology and computing industry is on the rise. Code.org estimates that by 2020, there will be more that 1 million more computer jobs available than there will be computer science graduates to fill them. Efforts, by organizations such as the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and code.org, to attract students to information technology and computing appear to be working. While it appears that there will be students to teach, will there be qualified teachers to teach them? The CSTA report "Bugs in the System: Computer Science Teacher Certification in the U.S." asserts that the "certification/licensure processes for Computer Science in the U.S. are deeply flawed." The goal of this session is to bring together educators from the high school and college level to discuss what the CS Education community needs to do to address this problem.
