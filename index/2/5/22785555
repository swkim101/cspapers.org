The structure of a modular introductory course in Computer Science is described. Two types of modules are offered, lecture and language, over three time periods. Students enrolled for the course complete three lecture and three language modules. Each student chooses modules which match his or her interests and background. In this way the course provides a useful alternative for all students on campus.
