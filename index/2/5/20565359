IDA was developed to allow a casual user to retrieve information from a data base, knowing the fields present in the data base, but not how they are distributed to the files. IDA is part of the LADDER System that accepts queries in a restricted subset of English about a data base stored on CCA's Datacomputer. IDA's input is a very simple, formal query language which is essentially a list of restrictions on fields and queries about fields, with no mention of the structure of the data base. It produces a series of DBMS queries, which are transmitted over the ARPA network. The results of these queries are combined by IDA to provide the answer to the user's query. In this paper, we define the input language, and give examples of IDA's behavior. We also present our representation of the "structural schema," which is the information needed by IDA to know how the data base is actually organized. We give the heuristics used to produce a program in the language of the DBMS. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this approach, as well as future research areas.
