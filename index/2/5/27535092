A system is described for semi-automatically tagging a large body of technical English with domain-specific syntactic/semantic labels. These labels have been used to disambiguate prepositional phrase attachments for a 10,000-word body of text containing more than 1,000 prepositions, and to provide case role information for about half of the phrases.
