This session is a projection of likely developments in software engineering in the 1980's, dealing with both technical and sociopolitical topics. It is based upon a report prepared for the Oregon Report on Computing, held in March, 1978.
 The future of software engineering will involve providing answers to a large number of questions presently under investigation. Because the field is so immature, the questions cover virtually every area of software development, including each stage of the software life cycle.
 Of equal importance is the impact that these technical developments will have upon organizations and individuals. Thus, along with these technical issues, a number of sociopolitical questions are raised. Then these technical and non-technical questions are discussed in a unified setting.
 It is the intent of the session to identify the frontiers of research in software engineering, the impact of this research on actual software development practices, and the questions that should be addressed in gaining further understanding of our discipline.
