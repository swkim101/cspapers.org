Block Programming languages (e.g., Scratch, Blockly) are widely used in teaching students within K-12 classrooms and in some universities with hopes of introducing programming concepts to beginner students. The use of block programming languages in classrooms is an effort in encouraging students' interest in computer programming by utilizing Papert's "low floor" and "high ceiling" metaphor. The Hour of Code is one example demonstrating the impact block languages have in education; however, there are not many languages offering an emphasis on advancing skills in mathematics or reading while focusing on the need of students with learning disabilities. This poster describes our creation of a block language using Blockly's API. Our block language, Hopper's Fables, named after Admiral Grace Hopper, is a storytelling language based on completing interactive mathematical problems in an effort to engage students while going through the story. It is the intent of Hopper's Fables to aid elementary students with learning disabilities through enhancing their math and literacy skills, while simultaneously building the student's digital fluency and developing their computational thinking skills. Hopper's Fables is based on research of related work, which allowed for the creation of an evaluation rubric. Analyzing the characteristics of existing languages allowed Hopper's Fables to come to life. By combining Papert's "low floor" and "high ceiling" philosophy with educational foundations, Hopper's Fables will provide students with an appropriate and enchanting learning environment.
