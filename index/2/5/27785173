This paper proposes an architecture with a two-layered structure for implementing an air-hockey robot that performs tactically in the deployment of entertainment robots. The two-layered architecture is comprised of two components: a tactical component that governs tactics and a skill component that deals with individual shots. The skill layer shoots a puck autonomously by selecting an appropriate way of shooting while considering what is physically feasible. The tactical layer controls the behavior of the skill layer by adjusting a probability function for selecting shooting methods. In this study, we implemented the architecture and conducted experiments to demonstrate its usefulness.
