In many path-planning algorithms, attempts are made to optimize the path between the start and the goal in terms of Euclidean distance. Since the moving object is shrunk to a point in the configuration space, the Findpath problem can be formulated as a graph-searching problem. This is known as the VGruph Algorithm. Lozano-Perez points out the drawbacks of the VGmph Algorithm. The first drawback is related with rotation of a moving object. This drawback has been solved by using the sliced projection method. However, the VGruph Algorithm has serious drawbacks when the obstacles are three-dimensional. The Recursive Compensation Algorithm is proposed to solve the drawbacks of the VGraph Algorithm. The Recursive Compensation Algorithm is to find the collision-free shortest path in 3D without increasing the compelexity of the VGruph and it is proved to guarantee the convergence to the shortest path in 3D. Simplifying the VGmph, the Recursive Compensation Algorithm can save not only the memory space to represent the VGmph but also the graph-searching time.
