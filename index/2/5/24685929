Response time is one of the key components of the human interface in an interactive computer system. This study evaluated two different response times and their impact on learning effectiveness. Using a counterbalanced experimental design (2**2 combinations of 2 response times), this study measured completion times, lesson mastery, error rates, and attitude. Data were obtained from student questionnaires.The Control Data PLATO Computer-based Education system provided the environment for the study. The system was connected to two networks with different response time characteristics. The means of the two response times tested were .25 sec (response time A) and 1.3 seconds (response time B). The covariate analysis of variance and chi square tests were used to show the significant difference between the two response times (p &lt; .05), giving the following results:1. The subjects using the shorter response time finished the lessons significantly faster than the subjects using the longer response time.2. The number of subjects that mastered the lessons was significantly higher for the subjects using the shorter response time.3. The performance of subjects using the shorter response time for time dependent tasks was significantly better than the subjects using the longer response time. However, for time independent tasks, the subjects using the longer response time performed significantly better.4. The subjects using the faster response time showed significantly more favorable attitudes toward the response time experienced than the subjects using the slower response time.In conclusion, the shorter response time (A) was more efficient for learning and was more favored by students.
