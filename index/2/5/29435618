Map-reduce computation is the on-ramp to data-intensive cloud computing, and arguably the most widely deployed form of parallel/distributed computing. Participants will carry out exercises designed for students at CS1, intermediate, and advanced levels that introduce data-intensive scalable computing concepts using WebMapReduce (WMR), a simplified open-source interface to the dominant Hadoop map-reduce programming environment. WMR supports programming in a choice of languages including Python, Java, C++, and C#. Besides a hands-on experience with introductory teaching materials, the workshop includes an overview of teaching advanced map-reduce programming using WMR, and a comparison of WMR to direct Hadoop programming. All materials will reside on csinparallel.org, and the demonstration WMR system is reservable for participants' courses. Intended audience: CS instructors. Web-enabled laptop required.
