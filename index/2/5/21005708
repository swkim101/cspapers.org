Many parallel applications, for example, Adaptive Mesh Refinement simulations, need dynamic load balancing during the course of their execution because of dynamic variation in the computational load. We propose a novel tree-based fully distributed algorithm for load balancing homogeneous work units. The proposed algorithm achieves perfect load balance while doing minimum number of migrations of work units.
