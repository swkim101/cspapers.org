In this paper, an implicit numerical scheme of diffusion smoothing is given for both intensity and depth images, which uses a changeable time step to reduce the computation. Emphasised is a "small leakage" diffusion model as an efficient way to maintain both boundary position and curvature signs along the surface boundary in smoothing, which will be useful for approximation and segmentation of sculptured surfaces.
