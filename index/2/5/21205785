Integrated circuits, as compared to discrete components, have greatly increased the amount of circuitry that can be mounted on a printed wiring card. Also, board assemblies can be mounted close together, 0.4 inch and less, by taking advantage of low profile flat packs. These packaging efficiencies result in high component densities and significantly smaller equipment, with unfortunately decreased wiring areas. In addition, more sophisticated and complicated performance is obtained by high operating speeds and carefully controlled interconnection wiring. Crosstalk, capacitance to ground, line impedance, signal and voltage isolation, etc., must be accurately controlled within predetermined limits.
