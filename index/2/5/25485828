Plagiarism is of great concern to faculty in all fields, including computer science as it leads to one certain outcome -- a compromise not just in student learning but also in the entire academic process. Faculty attempt to deal with this epidemic in varied ways such as by writing new course materials each semester, putting a larger or entire grade focus on exams, or even asking individual students to explain their assignments. However, plagiarism remains a source of frustration for both faculty and administrators. This BoF will bring interested faculty together to discuss the various and surprising ways in which students plagiarize, the methods of countering plagiarism, and the currently available tools for detecting plagiarism. Questions we will be discussing include: Do students understand plagiarism in the context of writing software? How can we create an atmosphere that discourages plagiarism, yet fosters collaboration and encourages learning from multiple sources? To what extent can one make an assignment "plagiarism-proof"?
