Superconductor processors based on Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) circuit technology can reach and exceed operating frequencies of 100 GHz, while keeping processor power consumption low. These features provide an opportunity to build compact, multi-petaflops systems with ultra-high-speed 64/128-bit single-chip microprocessors to address the government's critical mission needs for high end-computing (HEC).
