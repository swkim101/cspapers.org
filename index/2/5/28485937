It is well known that active learning strategies, like Peer Instruction and Cooperative Learning promote deep learning of material in the classroom. These techniques are typically accomplished by having students use cell phones or laptops. However, research has also shown that use by students of these technologies detract from learning. In this poster we examine our low-tech solution: the use of inexpensive, handheld whiteboards in our classrooms. We provide examples of activities which make use of the boards, in contexts ranging from introductory programming to upper-level networking.
