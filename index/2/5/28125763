In this presentation, the author will describe how to manage a DB2 Parallel Edition (I%) Database. DB2 I% belongs to the IBM, family of open DB2 client/.server database products including Dl32/6000, DB2/2, DB2 for fIP-IJX, and DB2 for the Solaris Operating Environment. DB2 PE employs a shared nothing architecture in which the database system consists of a set of independent logical drtabase nodes. Each logical node represents a collection of system resources including, processes, main memory, disk storage, and communications, managed by an independent database manager. The logical nodes use message passing to exchange data with each other. Tables are partitioned across nodes using a hash partitioning strategy. The costbased parallel query optimizer takes table partitioning information into account when generating parallel plans for execution by the run time system.
