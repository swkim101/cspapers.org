Logic programming languages require a careful, incremental presentation in order to be understood by students of the standard von Neumann programming languages. In this paper, the characteristics and programming methodology of PROLOG are developed through a sequence of logic-oriented problems of increasing complexity. These activities are essential to fully understanding the mechanisms and internal behavior of this language and A.I. applications programs in general. In this approach, students are more motivated toward non-procedural logic. Even the problems alone have long been a source of interest in academic circles.
