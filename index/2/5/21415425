A memory system can be made fault-tolerant with the application of an error-correcting code, that is, the mean time between failures of a properly designed memory system can be significantly increased with ECC. In this context, a system fails only when the errors exceed the error-correcting capability of the code. Also, in order to optimize data integrity, the ECC should have the capability of detecting the most likely of the errors that are uncorrectable.
