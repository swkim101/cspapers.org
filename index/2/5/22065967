The Model Driven Architecture (MDA) can have a greater impact by expanding its scope to Domain Specific MDA (DSMDA). This helps developers to represent their systems using familiar domain concepts. For each DSMDA, a transformer is needed to convert Domain Specific Platform Independent Models (DSPIM-s) to Domain Specific Platform Specific Models (DSPDM-s). Such model transformers are time consuming and error prone to develop and maintain. A high-level specification language to formally specify the behavior of model transformers is required. The language must also have an efficient execution framework. This research proposes to develop such a language and execution framework.
