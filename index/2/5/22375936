Over the past few years, a number of research investigations have been initiated for static analysis of concurrent and distributed software. In this paper we report on experiments with various optimization techniques for reachability-based deadlock detection in Ada programs using Petri net models. Our experimental results show that various optimization techniques are mutually beneficial with respect to the effectiveness of the analysis.
