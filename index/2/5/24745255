High velocity machine-generated data is growing rapidly. To act on this data in real time requires models that learn continuously and discover the temporal patterns in noisy data streams. The brain is also an online learning system that builds models from streaming data. In this talk I will describe recent advances in brain theory and how we have applied those advances to machine-generated streaming data. At the heart of our work are new insights into how layers of cells in the neocortex infer and make predictions from fast changing sensory data. This theory, called the Cortical Learning Algorithm, has been tested extensively. We have embedded these learning algorithms into a product called Grok which is being applied to numerous problems such as energy load forecasting and anomaly detection. I will give an introduction to the Cortical Learning Algorithm including how it uses sparse distributed representations and then show how Grok makes predictions and detects anomalies in streaming data. The Cortical Learning Algorithm is now an open source project (www.numenta.org) and I will give a brief introduction to the project.
