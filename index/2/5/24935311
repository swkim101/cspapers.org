The developments of robotics inform research across a broad range of disciplines. In this paper, we will study and compare two collision selective neuron models via a vision-based autonomous micro robot. In the locusts' visual brain, two Lobula Giant Movement Detectors (LGMDs), i.e. LGMD1 and LGMD2, have been identified as looming sensitive neurons responding to rapidly expanding objects, yet with different collision selectivity. Both neurons have been modeled and successfully applied in robotic vision system for perceiving potential collisions in an efficient and reliable manner. In this research, we conduct binocular neuronal models, for the first time combining the functionalities of LGMD1 and LGMD2 neurons, in the visual modality of a ground mobile robot. The results of systematic on-line experiments demonstrated three contributions of this research: (1) The arena tests involving multiple robots verified the effectiveness and robustness of a reactive motion control strategy via integrating a bilateral pair of LGMD1 and LGMD2 models for collision detection in dynamic scenarios. (2) We pinpointed the different collision selectivity between LGMD1 and LGMD2 neuron models, which fulfill corresponding biological research. (3) The utilized micro robot may also benefit researches on other embedded vision systems as well as swarm robotics.
