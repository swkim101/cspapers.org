In this paper, a novel architecture for charging mode controller of Li-Ion battery charger is proposed. It is design to generate stable control signals even when noise level reaches several tens of millivolts. The trickle current is as low as 200mA enabling longer life cycle for Li-Ion battery. The large current reaches 1A without any impact on trickle current offering a faster charging time for Li-Ion battery. Li-Ion battery charger is designed based on CMOS TSMC 0.13um technology and simulated by Cadence.
