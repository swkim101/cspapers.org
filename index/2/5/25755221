Performance of polyphase sequences in radar applications can be evaluated using measures including autocorrelation function, integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR), and peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR). In this paper, we adopt particle swarm optimization to find optimal parameters of Oppermann sequences such that sequences with optimal ISLR and PSLR are generated. This class of sequences has been chosen as it allows to design for a wide range of correlation characteristics by essentially controlling three parameters. A sequence design example is provided in order to illustrate that particle swarm optimization is indeed well-suited to produce optimal sequence designs with respect to the considered performance measures.
