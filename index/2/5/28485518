Deaf and hard of hearing students are an underrepresented group in computing and face extra challenges in university-level computing courses. This paper describes a 9-week Summer Academy for Advancing Deaf and Hard of Hearing in Computing that jump-starts the academic careers of deaf and hard of hearing students and strengthens their interest in computing. Students take introductory computing and animation in a fun, supportive, accessible environment. We report on some of the problems students face and lessons we have learned about helping them overcome those problems. Through the academy, they meet other successful deaf and hard of hearing technology professionals, tour top computing companies, and display their own work to the local deaf and hard of hearing community. Students gain leadership, independent learning skills, and complete the program better prepared for a college major in computing.
