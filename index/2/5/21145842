The ACM-IEEE CS2013 curricular recommendations include a dramatic growth in parallel and distributed computing (PDC) topics, in response to the necessary industry shift toward multicore computing, and to emerging technologies such as cloud computing. How can your institution integrate those recommendations into your undergraduate CS curriculum? In this special session, leaders in PDC education will succinctly present their curricular strategies in relation to CS2013 recommendations, while attendees carry out a workshop-style activity to identify opportunities and assemble resources for blending more PDC content into their own local CS curricula.
