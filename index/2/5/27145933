Constructing a mobile application is expensive and time consuming. In this paper, we present NitroGen which is a platform independent tool that provides a consumable integrated set of capabilities to construct mobile solutions aiming at reducing development and maintenance costs. NitroGen is a visual, mostly codeless, cloud-based platform to construct mobile applications. It can easily connect to back-end services thus enable fast and facile development in enterprises. Evaluating NitroGen, we found among others, that participants learned it fast and found it simple and suitable for mobile applications development.
