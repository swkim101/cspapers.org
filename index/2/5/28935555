The extended Dijkstra’s algorithm considers not only the edge weights but also the node weights for finding shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a given graph. To show the advantage of the extended Dijkstra’s algorithm, this paper proposes a load-balancing algorithm and a multicast algorithm in Software Defined Networking (SDN) on the basis of the extended Dijkstra’s algorithm for a graph derived from the underlying SDN topology. We use Pyretic to implement the proposed algorithms and compare them with related ones under the Abilene network topology with the Mininet emulation tool. As shown by the comparisons, the proposed algorithms outperform basic algorithms.
