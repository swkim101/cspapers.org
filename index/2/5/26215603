For understanding human activities in urban public spaces, we have been developing a sensing platform for visualizing data derived from sensor devices in the spaces. The platform collects sensing data from sensor devices installed in public spaces, and provide a simple communication interface to access the sensor data for client systems. In this demo abstract, we describe a working prototype of a sensor data streaming service for visualizing urban public spaces. The streaming data includes the number of pedestrians, pedestrian flows, and sound pressures of the human activities in the sensing area. As an application of the streaming service, we will show a client system that visualizes the current pedestrian flows in the sensing area with very little delay. The flows are visualized like a view of live camera without pedestrians' appearances. The system has a search interface to retrieve the sensing data in a past period and also visualizes them.
