Network Function Virtualization promises to reduce the cost to deploy and to operate large networks by migrating various network functions from dedicated hardware appliances to software instances running on general purpose networking and computing platforms. In this paper we demonstrate Scylla a Programmable Network Fabric architecture for Enterprise WLANs. The framework supports basic Virtual Network Function lifecycle management functionalities such as instantiation, monitoring, and migration. We release the entire platform under a permissive license for academic use.
