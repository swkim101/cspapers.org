It has been a challenge to retain computer science students, especially underrepresented students such as woman and minority. This poster describes our experiences in implementing a mentoring program to improve computer science retention and graduate rates at North Carolina A&T State University (NCATSU). NCATSU is among the United States' Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) serving more than 10,000 students. The Department of Computer Science on the average enrolls 195 undergraduate students, among them approximately 90% are African American and 30% are African American woman. The Computer Science Department at NCATSU in an attempt to increase retention and graduate rates of minority and women students developed the High-Need Student Mentoring Program supported by the Department of Education Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP). This poster describes the High-Need Student Mentoring Program (HNSMP). HNSMP is designed to provide special attention to undergraduate students who show signs of having academic difficulty. The goal of this Program is to increase retention by increasing the academic performance of these students. HNSMP's strategy is to assist these students before they reach the point of academic probation or suspension. We will describes data we collected, our findings and challenges we encountered in implementing this program, and our proposed strategies to overcome these challenges. Our experiences and the effective techniques found may be beneficial for other colleges and universities in retaining computer science students, especially African American students.
