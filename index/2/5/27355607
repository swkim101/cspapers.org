At the University of Twente, the Netherlands, we have beendeveloping methods and techniques in the area of object orientedanalysis and design. Our major contribution is the so-calledComposition Based Object Oriented Software Development (COOSD)methodology, which includes methods, computational models, andsupporting tools. We have applied this methodology in about 20pilot studies and we have been organizing tutorials in Europe.
The supporting tools, organized in an Integrated CASE toolenvironment, support the developer both in the analysis and in thedesign process, whereafter automatic translation of the design,described in a high-level object oriented language, called SINA, toC++ is offered.
