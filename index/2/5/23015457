This paper proposes an improved lattice-reduction aided (LRA) MMSE detection with successive interference cancellation (SIC) using both the forward and the backward (F&B) reduction LLL algorithms. We also apply a simple list detection to the F&B-LRA MMSE with SIC. The proposed detector provides good BER performance relatively close to that with the ML detection for both QPSK and 16QAM in the 8times8 MIMO system.
