JetBrains MPS is a comprehensive environment for language engineering. New languages can be defined as standalone languages or as modular extensions of existing languages. Since MPS is a projectional editor, syntactic forms other than text are possible, including tables or mathematical symbols. This demo will show MPS based on mbeddr C, a novel approach for embedded software development that makes use of incremental language extension on the basis of C.
