Star-P is a unique technology offered by Interactive Supercomputing after nurturing at MIT. Star-P through its clever abstractions is solving the ease of use problem that has plagued supercomputing. Given that there have been around 30 parallel MATLABs including three other major offerings, Star-P must be way ahead to compete in the marketplace.Some of the innovative features of Star-P are the ability to program in MATLAB, hook in task parallel codes written using a processor free abstraction, hook in existing parallel codes, and obtain the performance that represents the HPC promise. All this is through a client/server interface. Other clients such as Python or R could be possible. The MATLAB, Python, or R becomes the "browser." If we make it look easy, it is because decades of parallel computing experience has taught us that it is not.This talk demonstrates the abstractions and innovations that make this possible.
