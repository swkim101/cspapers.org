Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has become a promising network architecture in which network devices are controlled by a SDN Controller. Employing SDN offers an attractive solution for network security. However the attack prediction and Prevention, especially for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is a challenge in SDN environments. This paper, analyzes the characteristics of traffic flows up-streaming to a Vietnamese ISP server, during both states of normal and DDoS attack traffic. Based on the traffic analysis, an SDN-based Attack Prevention Architecture is proposed that is able to capture and analyze incoming flows on-the-fly. A multi-criteria based Prevention mechanism is then designed using both hard-decision thresholds and Fuzzy Inference System to detect DDoS attack. In response to determining the presence of attacks, the designed system is capable of dropping attacks flows, demanding from the control plane.
