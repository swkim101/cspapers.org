In many cases, this is a hit-or-miss proposition based on partly informed intuition. In a new book to be published by Morgan Kanfmann, Database Tuning: principles, experiments, and troubleshooting techniques we at tempt to lay out a principled and experimentally-based study of the topic. The source code for the experiments will be available on the web h t tp : / /www.mkp.com/dbtune In this tutorial, we report on the main lessons learnt while working on this book. Here is an outline of the topics covered:
