Music tag words that describe music audio by text have different levels of abstraction. Taking this issue into account, we propose a music classification approach that aggregates multi-level and multi-scale features using pre-trained feature extractors. In particular, the feature extractors are trained in sample-level deep convolutional neural networks using raw waveforms. We show that this approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several music classification datasets.
