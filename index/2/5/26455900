In the fall of 1998, the ACM Education Board and the Educational Activities Board of the IEEE Computer Society appointed representatives to a joint task force to prepare Computing Curricula 2001 (CC2001). The CC2001 report is the current installment in a series of reports on the undergraduate computer science curriculum that began in 1968 and was then updated in 1978 and 1991 [1, 6]. The computer science volume of the CC2001 report was presented to the community in a series of three public drafts, followed by a final report approved by the governing boards of the ACM and the Computer Society. The purpose of this panel is to discuss strategies for implementing the recommendations of the final report in a wide variety of institutions.
