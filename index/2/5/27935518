The rapid advancements in the smartphone domain has made WiFi, Bluetooth and 3G commonplace in most devices, as well as accelerometers, gyros, fast CPUs and large amounts of memory. During these advancements the IR transmitter was eventually dropped, starting perhaps most importantly with the release of the Apple iPhone. It has since been observed a need for directional transmission functionality. The system described herein propose a way to to achieve short range directional data-communication on a smartphone without adding external hardware. The outcome of this project is intended to be open-sourced, enabling any application developer or phone-manufacturer to include the technology into their products.
