In this study, fundamental characteristics of MIMO antennas are investigated using two types of folded monopole antennas (FMA) in order to cover more operational frequency bands of WiMAX. To increase the number of resonant frequencies, parasitic elements are used. As a result, one type of FMA could satisfy the two bands of WiMAX, and the other type of FMA could cover all the three bands of WiMAX with parasitic elements. Moreover, this was possible without increasing the total antenna volume. We confirmed the validity of the simulation by comparing with measured data.
