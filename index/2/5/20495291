Teaching computer concepts to engineering, computer science and technology students has been a difficult task. Using large mainframes presents too remote an environment for effective learning. Microcomputers, although they provide more hands-on exposure than large machines, are too expensive for individual study and interaction. At the other extreme, it is unrealistic and time consuming for students to work directly with discrete IC's or microprocessor chip sets.
