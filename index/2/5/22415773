The ITCIS Database (Integrated Telephone Customer Information System) was designed and developed to support multiple real-time and batch applications connected with customer services for the Netherlands Post, Telephone, and Telegraph Service (PTT). All software components are operational and the system is partially implemented. Current effort is involved with the remaining implementation, incorporating changes due to user requests and tuning.
