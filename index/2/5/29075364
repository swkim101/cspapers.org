The Internet of Things enables authors to use physical objects for communicating digital content that may influence human decision making. Human experts may employ this novel information channel to deliver instructions concerning an object right where it is needed -- at the object. Eventually, the user of such an object may perceive the object as an expert information source. However, since real-world actions are usually performed in contexts difficult to predict by the author of such instructions, a follower will have to adapt these before application. This article proposes to link knowledge concerning such adaptation with the object as well, and thus to create a two-way communication between expert author and instruction follower.
