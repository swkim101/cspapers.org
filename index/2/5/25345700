Computing in the Arts (CITA) is an innovative, interdisciplinary curriculum model which integrates computer science and information technology with traditional art theory and practice. At the College of Charleston, implementation of an undergraduate CITA degree program resulted in an increase in the number of female and minority students pursuing computing-related degrees. [14] With the support of the National Science Foundation (DUE 1323605) and two partner institutions, we are building a community of educators who are creating innovative instructional materials that synthesize computing and the arts. Three faculty summer workshops (Wake Forest University in 2014, College of Charleston in 2015, and University of North Carolina at Asheville in 2016) involved over 70 computer science and arts faculty from across the U.S. What has emerged are various ways of synthesizing computer science and arts, including creation of new synthesis courses, modifications to traditional computing courses, development of new CITA-like curricula, design of CITA-like project experiences for undergrads, and other creative endeavors combining computer science techniques and traditional art practices and theory. During the session, we will discuss steps involved in moving forward and keeping this community growing. The session will involve audience participation, including exchanges between the session presenters and other audience members. The goal is to share our results, hear about results from other non-presenting colleagues, and to continue to grow the teaching of computer science and computational thinking to the arts and humanities masses, as well as to further enrich traditional computer science courses with creative applications, assignments, and projects.
