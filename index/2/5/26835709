A course in advanced problem solving and algorithm development is described in this paper. This course differs from the approach taken in many algorithm texts in that it emphasizes the problem solving process involved in developing the algorithms rather than proofs of correctness. Algorithms are studied in the areas of number theory, array processing, sorting and searching, text processing, and data structures. The course concludes with a discussion of linear, binary, and non-linear recursive algorithms.
 While some of the algorithms may have been seen previously in other courses, often the problem solving process involved in developing the algorithms is not treated. Thus, the course greatly enhances the students' understanding of the art of problem solving. In addition, it exposes the students to many important algorithms which they will find useful both in later computer science courses and in their professional careers.
