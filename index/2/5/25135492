In real-world, our DNA is unique but many people share names. This phenomenon often causes erroneous aggregation of documents of multiple persons who are namesake of one another. Such mistakes deteriorate the performance of document retrieval, web search, and more seriously, cause improper attribution of credit or blame in digital forensic. To resolve this issue, the name disambiguation task is designed which aims to partition the documents associated with a name reference such that each partition contains documents pertaining to a unique real-life person. Existing solutions to this task substantially rely on feature engineering, such as biographical feature extraction, or construction of auxiliary features from Wikipedia. However, for many scenarios, such features may be costly to obtain or unavailable due to the risk of privacy violation. In this work, we propose a novel name disambiguation method. Our proposed method is non-intrusive of privacy because instead of using attributes pertaining to a real-life person, our method leverages only relational data in the form of anonymized graphs. In the methodological aspect, the proposed method uses a novel representation learning model to embed each document in a low dimensional vector space where name disambiguation can be solved by a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly better than the existing name disambiguation methods working in a similar setting.
