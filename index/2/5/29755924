It is apparent that good programming style and documentation standards are an integral part of the requirements of this discipline. Attempts which have been useful by the author to not only teach, but require, the use of these techniques are described in terms of both successes and failures. Samples are presented from the introductory computer science course and the senior level modeling and simulation class. These materials include skeletal programs and pseudocode which are used for illustration, student use, and evaluation. A technique used to simplify the evaluation of student programs is also presented.
