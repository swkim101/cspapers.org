We propose a system for the derivation of algorithms which allows us to use "factual knowledge" for the development of concurrent programs. From preliminary program versions the system can derive new versions which have higher performances and can be evaluated by communicating agents in a parallel architecture. The knowledge about the facts or properties of the programs is also used for the improvement of the system itself.
