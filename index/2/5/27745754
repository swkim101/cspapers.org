This demonstration shows the actual application of our wireless AMI[1] system, AMR Xpider. This system consists of a sink node and multiple relay nodes. Hundreds of sensing nodes, which are connected to the relay node, transfer metering data to the MDMS (meter data management system). A total of 20,000 AMR Xpider units have been installed in apartments in South Korea for gas metering during the past three years. The AMR Xpider units are used for actual billing purposes. They operate with battery life of at least five years (generally, around seven years), with an average communication success rate of 98%.
