Community service courses are often where undergraduates make connections between academic content and practical computer science applications, build bridges between the university and the community, and ultimately increase access to technology in such communities. In this poster we report on our efforts-supported by a NSF Broadening Participation in Computing grant-to design, implement, and evaluate a service-learning course based on a "cascading mentoring" model linking together the faculty, administration, and undergraduates of an urban university's computer science department with area high school students. The poster presents the cascading model and through a series of post-interviews offers preliminary data charting undergraduates' experiences as both mentees and mentors.
