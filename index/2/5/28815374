OVERVIEW In September 2003, the Policy Analysis Market (PAM) will open for live trading. Net Exchange has designed and will operate PAM under contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). PAM is a combinatorial information market: a market in futures, options, and derivatives that are based on eventualities rather than specific commerce. PAM will trade contracts of one year maturity, issued quarterly, that span economic, civil, and military conditions in the countries of the Middle East. A trader will be able to trade the pure contracts and to construct and trade composites of pure contracts that reflect his or her insights.
