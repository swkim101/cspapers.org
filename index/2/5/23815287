Educational portals such as Algoviz.org contain rich information resources, and a key concern is directing the users to specific resources that are of interest to them. While AlgoViz has significant traffic, we cannot count on active user participation in the form of explicit ratings of individual resources. Often called a "cold-start" problem, this scenario is well-known in community-based websites. Lacking active user data, we instead use log data to deduce user trends. We describe our techniques for clustering users based on the log data. We show how this cluster analysis can be used to refine searching and browsing within AlgoViz. Our approach has the potential to be useful for a wide range of educational resource portals.
