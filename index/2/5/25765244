The structure and use of a test-generating system having the following parameters is described.
 1. Each test is a ten item multiple choice instrument where each item has five (5) alternatives.
 2. Each test is generated from a relatively small file (most often less than 150 card images).
 3. Although the file contains only five (5) disjoint tests, over nine million different tests (each with its own set of correct answers) can be generated from it.
 4. The correct answers to each test are stored directly on the test (in coded form).
 5. Test responses are machine correctable and such correcting need not be done on the system that generated the test.
 6. The reliability of different forms of tests generated from one file is theoretically high (no statistical evidence is available to support a claim of high reliability).
 7. The grading program produces a total score as well as giving the correct answers for all items on that test.
