Recently, the C # and the V ISUAL B ASIC communities were tanta-lized by the advent of LINQ [18]—the Language INtegrated Query technology from Microsoft. LINQ represents a set of language extensions relying on advanced (some say hard to understand) techniques drawn from functional languages such as type inference, λ - expressions and most importantly, monads. The 3 rd edition of C # just as the 9 th of V ISUAL B ASIC allow programmer to directly access relational and XML-based databases from within the programming language. We show that very similar capabilities can be achieved in the C++ programming language without relying on any language extensions, compiler modiﬁcations, external processing tools, or any other vendor speciﬁc machinery: A RA R AT is a C++ template library whose objective is type safe generation of SQL statements for access relational database systems. Learning curve is minimal since A RA R AT resembles relational algebra, which is at the core of SQL.
