This session is a chance for researchers studying concept inventories (CIs)--low-cost assessments highlighting student misconceptions in a field--and CS education practitioners to communicate about advances in concept inventories in an engaging and utterly ridiculous way. We use a "quiz show" format to present CI items from various authors' work across the computing curriculum. On each question, audience members and volunteer contestants consider their own response and guess students' common responses. Then, they see how authentic student data illustrate the misconceptions these items probe. The session's goal is three-fold: educate practitioners about recent results in concept inventory research that may suggest surprising trends in student learning, popularize concept inventories as a tool in research and practice, and collect the audience's expert responses to concept inventory items.
