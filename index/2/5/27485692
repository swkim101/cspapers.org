Chroma is a widespread feature for cover song recognition, as it is robust against non-tonal components and independent of timbre and specific instruments. However, Chroma is derived from spectrogram, thus it provides a coarse approximation representation of musical score. In this paper, we proposed a similar but more effective feature Note Class Profile (NCP) derived with music transcription techniques. NCP is a multi-dimensional time serie, each column of which denotes the energy distribution of 12 note classes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrated its superior performance over existing music features. In addition, NCP feature can be enhanced further with the development of music transcription techniques. The source code can be found in github1.
