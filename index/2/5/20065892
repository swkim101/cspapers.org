Grid technologies allow for distributed computing and collaboration. Scientists and others utilizing grid collaboration tools often need to share resources using applications besides seeing and hearing each other with audio and video. The ability to share applications in real time is crucial for distant learning and remote collaboration. Web browser sharing is particularly important to long distance biomedical education and research, since a range of biomedical information resources are accessible via the web, including databases of gene sequences, protein structures, biomedical literature, drug and clinical trials. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has focused on increasing the interactivity and functionality of the shared web browser on Access Grid. Satisfactory synchronization performance was observed as well as the return of retrieval to all participating browsers when NLM's online databases were searched. NLM plans to apply those methods to other shared applications for highly interactive long distance training and research collaboration.
