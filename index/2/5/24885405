The open-source OpenDSA eTextbook system is seeing rapidly growing use around the world. It combines textbook-quality tutorial material with many algorithm visualizations (AVs), simulations, and a large collection of interactive exercises, including small programming exercises. Its materials are re-configurable for specific classes. Being implemented in HTML5, it requires only a web browser to be accessible to students. Available content now includes comprehensive coverage for Data Structures and Algorithms courses, and rapidly growing content for Programming Languages, Translators, and Formal Languages courses. This session will provide a demonstration of the most innovative features of OpenDSA as they might be used by students and instructors in a range of Computer Science courses.
