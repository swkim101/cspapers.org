In this paper, we introduce the concept of combined mining to select combined itemsets that are not only high utility and high frequency, but also involving relations between itemsets. An effective method for mining such actionable combined high utility itemsets is proposed. The experimental results are promising, compared to those from traditional HUIM algorithm (UP-Growth).
