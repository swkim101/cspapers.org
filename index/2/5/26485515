This paper discusses some of the issues concerning education in the academic environment and training in the industrial work environment. Recent college graduates, “new-hires”, must realize as they enter the workforce, that even though they have completed four year degree programs, they are beginning at an entry-level position. They will need job specific training to make them productive software engineers from their employer's perspective.
The aspects of distinguishing between education and training are discussed along with an understanding of how college prepares graduates for employment in the computer industry; specifically, the field of military software development as developed at Texas Instruments.
