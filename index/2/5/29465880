In this paper, we present a sizing algorithm using resonant model based on a proposed novel heap structure - multiple spaces in heap. Experiments using the algorithm and selected GC method show that, in average, the performance overhead from managing multi-spaces in heap can be reduced from 8.38% to 4.25% when CPU utilization of server is 40% and from 42.42% to 3.52% when CPU utilization of the server is 70%.
