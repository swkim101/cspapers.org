A new mulitcode multicarrier interleave division multiple access (MC-MC-IDMA) system is proposed and analyzed in frequency selective channels. The system supports different modulation schemes for variables data rates. Each user transmits his message by choosing a sequence from an orthogonal code-set. An MC-MC-IDMA system achieves spreading gains both in time and frequency domains. Bit error rate of the system is derived and simulation results are presented.
