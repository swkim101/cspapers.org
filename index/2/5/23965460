In this paper, we design an admission control scheme for ad hoc WLAN based on self-restraint mechanism. The self-restraint admission control mechanism is implemented in each of the wireless nodes instead of the access point (AP). It has two important admission control abilities: first, it can restrain itself from joining the network if the network channel is congested; second, a joining node can drop itself from the network if the channel becomes congested as a result of its admission. We simulate an ad hoc WLAN and show that the self-restraining mechanism works effectively in sustaining traffic in ad hoc WLAN and also protects real-time traffic.
