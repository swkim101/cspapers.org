The World Wide Web conference is a well-established and mature venue with an already long history. Over the years it has been attracting papers reporting many important research achievements centered around the Web. In this work we aim at understanding the evolution of WWW conference series by detecting crucial years and important topics. We propose a simple yet novel approach based on tracking the classification errors of the conference papers according to their predicted publication years.
