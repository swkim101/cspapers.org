As large scale distributed ﬁle systems come into wide spread use supporting industrial organizations, the performance and scalability of ﬁle systems becomes important issues. Key factors such as ﬁle server bottlenecks and network congestion are heavily dependent on ﬁle system workload characteristics, yet no workload study on such systems has been reported to date. In this paper, we present a case study of a large industrial distributed ﬁle system supporting several thousand users. Our study is at the workgroup level, rather than at individual ﬁle access level. Our study reveals substantial departures from observations made in previous academic and centralized commercial environments. The average ﬁle size is 25-30 Kbytes, much larger than those from previous studies. Over weekly periods, we found that more than one-third of the ﬁles are active. Of the active ﬁles, read activities dominate writes 9:1. We found a very high level of ﬁle sharing: 50-60% of the ﬁles are shared among two or more workgroups. On the other hand, a single workgroup remains as the only writer for 97% of the write active ﬁles, suggesting that dynamic ﬁle replication at the workgroup level may effectively improve ﬁle access performance. It is also noted that shared ﬁles tend to be larger, and that write activities decrease as ﬁle sharing increases. We believe that these observations are representative of an important class of industrial computing environments, and are valuable input to future ﬁle system design.
