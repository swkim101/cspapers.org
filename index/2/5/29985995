The Linguistic String Project of New York University has developed computer programs that convert the information in free-text documents of a technical specialty into a structured form suitable for mapping into a relational database. The processing is based upon the restrictions on the use of language that are characteristic of the subject matter and the document type. These restrictions are summarized in a “sublanguage grammar” that provides a set of word classes and formulas corresponding to the objects and relations of interest in the domain. The programs are independent of the particular sublanguage grammar employed. The application to narrative patient records will be described and the applicability of the methods to other domains discussed.
