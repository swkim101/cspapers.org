N<r,,,.l,,Ld One important step in integrating heterogeneous databases is matching equivalent attributes: Determining which fields in two databases refer to the same data. In semantic integration, attributes are compared in a pairwise fashion to determine their equivalence. Automation is critical to integration as the volume of data or the number of databases to be integrated increase. Semiut “discovers” how to match equivalent attributes from information that can be automatically extracted from databases; as opposed to requiring human lmowledge to predefine what makes attributes equivalent.
