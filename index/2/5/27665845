The general goal of this workshop was to bring together researchers working toward developing a theoretical framework for the analysis and design of neural networks. The technical focus of the workshop was to address recent developments in understanding the capabilities and limitations of various models for neural computation and learning. The primary topics addressed the following three areas: 1) Computational complexity issues in neural networks, 2) Complexity issues in learning, and 3) Convergence and numerical properties of learning algorithms. Other topics included experimental/simulation results on neural networks, which seemed to pose some open problems in the areas of learning and generalization properties of feedforward networks.
