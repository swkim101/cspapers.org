In this paper we present, by way of an example, techniques for using the independently compilable units of Turbo Pascal 4.0. (Turbo Pascal is a Pascal compiler available from Borland International.) We suggest ways that units can be used to illustrate software engineering principles, including information hiding, modularity, and procedural and data abstraction. The paper describes Turbo Pascal units and gives a sample project. It also suggests a number of ways that this or similar projects can be used to illustrate these principles to CS1 and CS2 classes.
