In this paper, we propose a new prototype model of a micro pump using ICPF (Ionic Conducting Polymer Film) actuator as the servo actuator. This micro pump consists of two active one-way valves that make use of the same ICPF actuator. The overall size of this micro pump prototype is 12 mm in diameter and 20 mm in length. The actuating mechanisms are as follows: (1) the ICPF actuator as the diaphragm is bent into anode side by application of electricity. Then the volume of the pump chamber increases, resulting in the inflow of liquid from the inlet to the chamber; (2) by changing the current direction, the volume of the pump chamber decreases, resulting the liquid flow from the chamber to the outlet; and (3) the ICPF actuator is put on a sine voltage, the micro pump provides liquid flow from the inlet to the outlet continuously. Characteristic of the micropump is measured. The experimental results indicate that the micro pump has the satisfactory responses.
