In the power plant under operation, there are many important equipments which the operator must inspect in the non-operation state. Our milestone of the humanoid robot which can inspect for the man is moving around the Power Plant and inspection experiments by using navigation system of autonomous and tele-operation fusion control. We constructed and implemented a navigation system, which is controlled by Tag (RF-ID) and Remote teaching human interface. The robot just reads a tag with information on the plant maintenance, and the robot can act with the information. Therefore, switching of the program movement of the robot and the remote control become very easy.
