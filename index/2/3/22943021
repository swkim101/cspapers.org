Language Integrated Query (LINQ) is part of the upcoming version 3.5 of the .NET Framework. As a combination of APIs and enhancements to the .NET programming languages, LINQ provides a uniform approach to querying of data across any data source. LINQ pulls the querying experience into the programming language space, providing full static typing and tool support.
 LINQ is built to be pluggable, allowing data source providers to insert their own query engines. Using the new C# 3.0 this demonstration peels apart the layers of LINQ to show how a smooth user experience on the surface emerges from new language features, naming conventions and metaprogramming facilities.
