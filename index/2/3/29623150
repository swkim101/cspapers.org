Implications of using robotics and mobile computing in the curriculum extend far beyond motivation and engagement because skills in these areas can help students be more successful at the workplace. Our approach to teaching both subjects in one course focuses on using Sphero, a small ball-shaped wireless robot that can be controlled and programmed using an Android or iOS device via a Bluetooth link. Workshop participants will experience several hands-on projects that are offered to student in an Android+Sphero course, which culminates in a robot racing competition. This workshop is intended for high school and college faculty interested in mobile computing and/or robotics courses, projects, or activities.
