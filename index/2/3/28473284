The tasks of data-parallel computation jobs come up with diverse and time-varying resource requirements. The dynamic nature of task requirements brings challenges on making good scheduling decisions, due to it is hard to keep work-conserving. In this paper, we present BETS to cope with the requirement dynamics that aims at utilizing cluster resources fully. BETS employs a task model that represents for runtime task requirements, a coarse-grained task pipeline to make use of resources in a time-division multiplexing fashion, and fine-grained resource management to guarantee performance.
