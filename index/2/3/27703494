Human-system-interfaces for haptic display with emphasis on tactile information are research fields of growing interest. Their application to system design in multi-modal telepresence and virtual environment (VE) systems implies mechatronics engineering challenges as well as the need for consideration of human factors. A tactile actuator array for dynamic display of distributed tactile shape information is presented. Actuator design focus was directed at high pin forces and a bandwidth sufficient for most one-fingered tactile shape exploration tasks performed by dynamic interaction. The resulting overall device dimensions currently prohibit an attachment to the effector of typical kinesthetic feedback devices. Experimental results are presented for a virtual presence scenario where tactile stimulation emerges from dynamic interaction between virtual objects on a conveyer belt moving relative to a resting fingertip.
