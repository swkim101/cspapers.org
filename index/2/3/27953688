Summer camps offer a ripe opportunity for increasing computer science diversity. This panel provides several examples of summer camps that specifically recruit from traditionally underrepresented demographics. The panelists run camps at a community college, a private liberal-arts college, and public universities. The camps are residential and day camps, coed and all-female camps, ranging from three-days to two-weeks long, with campers from 10-years-olds to high school seniors. In addition to describing their camps, the panelists will provide information on securing funding, recruiting campers from underrepresented populations, measuring impact, and lessons learned along the way. Demonstrations of what campers accomplished will also be shown.
