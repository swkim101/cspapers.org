Rensselaer has launched a new Bachelor of Science degree program in Information Technology [4,5]. This degree is an alternative to the more traditional computer science or computer systems degrees that Rensselaer continues to offer. It focuses on the application of computing and communications technologies in a student-chosen application area called a second discipline. The expectation is that a company doing business in the second discipline or closely related area will employ a student completing this degree.
This paper describes the motivation behind the new degree program and its interdisciplinary approach. It also presents the organization of the curriculum and its requirements.
