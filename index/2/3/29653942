In the fall of 1998, the ACM Education Board and the Educational Activities Board of the IEEE Computer Society appointed representatives to a joint task force to prepare Curriculum 2001, the next installment in a series of reports on the undergraduate Computer Science curriculum that began in 1968 and was then updated in 1978 and 1991. The purpose of this panel is to present an overview of the early work of the task force and to generate discussion in the SIGCSE membership about the directions and plans for the new curriculum.
