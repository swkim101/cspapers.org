This paper is concerned with the justification and development of a computer science option which has been approved for inclusion within Auburn University's Industrial Engineering curriculum. From a specification of many of the areas covered by the field of industrial engineering, it became clear that the use of the computer is an integral part of the industrial engineer's work. An analysis of the courses thought to be most useful to an industrial engineer further indicated that such courses fell into a logical sequence from which a minor area of competence in computer science could be developed.
 The courses comprising the option are presented by means of a precedence diagram which indicates suggested course sequencing. Also presented is the Auburn Industrial Engineering program with the embedded computer science minor.
