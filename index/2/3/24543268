As VLSI technology scales to deep sub-micron, design for interconnections becomes increasingly challenging. The traditional bus routing follows a sequential bit-by-bit order, and few works explicitly target inter-bit regularity for signal groups via multi-layer topology selection. To overcome these limitations, we present Streak, an efficient framework that combines topology generation and wire synthesis with a global view of optimization and constrained metal layer track resource allocation. In the framework, an identification stage decomposes binding groups into a set of representative objects; with the generated backbones, equivalent topologies are accompanied by the bits in every object; then a formulation guides the routing considering wire congestion and design regularity. Experimental results using industrial benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.
