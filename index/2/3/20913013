This paper presents information from a survey of departments offering accredited computer science degree programs. It discusses demographic information related to curricula, faculty, and students for all such programs, and identifies various trends based on these data. These results are of interest and use to all accredited and non-accredited programs alike, since they facilitate monitoring and comparisons among individual degree programs in the nation in terms of curriculum issues, faculty composition and salaries, student enrollment and graduation rates.
