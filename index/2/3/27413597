The influence of diamond heat sink layers on the electrical characteristics of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) has been investigated using numerical simulation in Wachutka's thermodynamically rigorous model of lattice heating. It is shown that the diamond layers can significantly decrease device temperature, thus improving its current-voltage characteristics. Parameters of the diamond heat sink were optimized for the HEMTs on sapphire and silicon substrates.
