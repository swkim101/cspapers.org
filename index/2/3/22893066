The modelling of a real world system requires a description of the changes which occur in it in response to well defined events. In this paper, these dynamic aspects are investigated. After a reviewing of the literature on the notion of event, a formalism suitable for describing events is proposed and the use of such a formalism in the frame of data base applications design methodology is shown.
