We present TinyVM, a Virtual Machine (VM) for nesC and C applications on sensor motes. TinyVM executes compressed bytecode on-the-fly to conserve memory. To facilitate creation of application-specific VMs, partitioning of applications into bytecode, VM instruction set extensions and machine-code is supported. We provide experimental evidence for the efficiency of TinyVM on Atmega128-based motes and on the Intel iMote2. TinyVM also runs on Windows and Linux, and we are currently porting TinyVM to Telos-based motes.
