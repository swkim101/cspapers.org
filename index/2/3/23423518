Zoonoses are a class of infectious diseases causing growing concern of health authorities worldwide. Human and economic costs of zoonoses are substantial, especially in low-resource countries. New zoonoses emerge as a consequence of ecological, demographic, cultural, social and behavioral factors. Meanwhile, global antimicrobial resistance increases. This public health threat demands for a new approach to which the concept of "One Health" is emblematical. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of human, animal and environmental health. To protect and improve public health it is imperative that transdisciplinary collaboration and communication takes place between the human and the veterinary domain. This strategy is now widely endorsed by international, regional and national health policy and academic bodies. Nonetheless the contributions of both the social sciences and the new data sciences need more appreciation. Evidence is available that the methods and concepts they provide can budge "One Health".
