We present a study to evaluate OpenDSA, an open source, online system combining textbook-quality content with algorithm visualizations and interactive exercises for data structures and algorithms courses. We hypothesize that answering many questions and exercises with immediate feedback allows students to know whether they are on track with their learning. In a quasi-experimental study, a control group received lecture and textbook for three weeks. The treatment section spent class time working through equivalent content and exercises in OpenDSA. A post-test compared the two. An opinion survey examined students' perception and opinions about the experience. Detailed interaction logs were used to analyze student use of the tutorials and exercises to understand how they used the system.
