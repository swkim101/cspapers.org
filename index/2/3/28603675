We propose high-frequency traffic control (HFTraC), a rate control scheme that coordinates the transmission rates and buffer utilizations in routers network-wide at fast timescale. HFTraC can effectively deal with traffic demand fluctuation by utilizing available buffer space in routers network-wide, and therefore lead to significant performance improvement in terms of tradeoff between bandwidth utilization and queueing delay. We further note that the performance limit of HFTraC is determined by the network architecture used to implement it. We provide trace-driven evaluation of the performance of HFTraC implemented in the proposed architectures that vary from fully centralized to completely decentralized.
