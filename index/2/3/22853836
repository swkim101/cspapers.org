This paper describes the principles, implementation, and results of a weeklong summer science course for junior high and high school students interested in computer science. To motivate and foster interest and creativity in students, while providing adequate complexity to introduce programming concepts and techniques, we used programming projects in computer graphics as the main learning tool. Included in our discussion are experiences across three course offerings, as well as detailed course assignments.
