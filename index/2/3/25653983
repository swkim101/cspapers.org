This paper presents a framework for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) designed to observe impacts of climate change in crop fields. We propose a system architecture for ubiquitous WSNs for monitoring automatically and continuously in realtime. A prototype system includes two base stations and several sensor nodes which are powered by solar cell are designed and implemented. Climatic parameters from sensor nodes are sent via WSN to the base station, while base station communicates with remote data server center through GPRS network. By using multiple methods of communication, it could enable monitor areas where not in GPRS coverage. With advantages of low-cost and ubiquitous monitoring, the system can be applied widely in agriculture in developing countries like Vietnam.
