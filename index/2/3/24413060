Due to the wide spread of android smartphones, different types of attacks have emerged against android systems and accordingly many researches have been accomplished in the android security. In particular, a variety of covert channels have been recently developed in android systems. They are usually built up by utilizing physical media and distinct characteristics of systems in the literature. To the best of our information, however, we do not find out any research work establishing covert channels in android systems on basis of the sequential analysis, which is a kind of statistical decision theory. This is mainly because the sequential analysis has been conventionally treated as defense technique in terms of security. In contrast to this common application of the sequential analysis, we discover a new covert channel based on the sequential analysis in android systems. The key idea of newly devised covert channel is to harness the sequential analysis in order to encode (resp. decode) private information bits to (resp. from) multiple sequences of randomly selected data. Through simulation, we demonstrate that our developed covert channel works efficiently and thus it could be substantial threat to android systems.
