SIGCSE has for a long time nourished an audience excited about teaching mathematical reasoning principles across the curriculum through the Math Thinking Birds-of-a-Feather session and panels on mathematical reasoning. While these forums are useful for discussing reasoning topics, they do not provide a consistent venue for sharing math-reasoning activities to be used in the classroom. Therefore, SIGCSE attendees interested in math thinking have routinely wished for a place for discussing engaging math reasoning examples and assignments. Providing such a forum is the purpose of this session. The exercises and assignments will help faculty find ways to incorporate mathematical reasoning in CS1, CS2, data structures and algorithms, discrete math, and software engineering courses.
