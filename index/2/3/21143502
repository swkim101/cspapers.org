Are you interested in incorporating some of your favorite science fiction in your classes? Did you know it can help improve student interest in the technical topic? Come join us as we talk about ways to connect SciFi to artificial intelligence, robotics, networking, intellectual property, and other topics. We'll start with overviews of how we've used SciFi and have plenty of time for discussion of new works and old that connect to the material we need to cover, while drawing students into the content and the field.
