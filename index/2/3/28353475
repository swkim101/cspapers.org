In the Go-Lab European project, we are investigating an online lab portal that enables students to perform personalized scientific experiments with online labs. To protect sensitive student data, such as user activity data and learning preferences, this paper presents a classroom-like pseudonymity approach that fulfills the specific requirements of the Go-Lab portal: (1) enforcing student privacy, (2) enabling personalization, and (3) providing a teenager-friendly design.
