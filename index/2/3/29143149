Multiple inheritance has been adopted by many 00 programming languages (such as C++, CLOS, and Eiffel). On the other hand, there are languages (such as Smalltalk, Objective C, and Object Pascal) that do not offer multiple inheritance. Despite missing the feature, these languages seem to be as effective as those that offer it. It is then natural to ask how essential multiple inheritance is to object-oriented programming.
