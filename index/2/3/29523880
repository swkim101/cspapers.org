Top designers and design engineering managers will present this wish list to make their next (or even current) design a much better design experience. They will not focus on pie-in-the-sky research topics, but describe down-to-earth challenges that designers face in getting their designs out the door. The panelists will use their data and experiences to substantiate their wish lists and address the main question: What needs to change in the design flows and design tools to improve Time-to-Market (TTM) and design quality?
