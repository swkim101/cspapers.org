Distributed Database is a very well known and popular concept that most of the organizations use when they need to store data over the network or in different locations. Now when they have large amount of operational data they want to use that data to support decision making as a mean of gaining competitive advantages. But the problem is that these operational systems were not designed to support any sort of decision making. Organizations need to have a way in which they can use their archive and operational data for decision making. Data warehouse was designed to meet the requirements of the organizations which receive data from different operational sources and support decision making. Organizations have there data on the web and as the organization matures data also increases.

To maintain data effectively on the web we need a Web Warehouse. Web warehouse is the management of data on the web, it is a data warehouse on the net. This paper describes the effectiveness of the web warehouse leading towards business intelligence.
