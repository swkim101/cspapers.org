This paper presents an ontology-based semantic framework to question answering. Both question and source text are parsed into underspecified semantic expressions where names of semantic atoms and predicates are defined in an interlingual ontology. Answer retrieval is done using subsumption and unification, and queries are expanded incrementally using ontological rules. Ranking of answers is achieved by using graded unification.
