Force-sensing system represents one of the vital components of robotic systems for physical interaction performances. This system is facilitated by the force controllable actuators. However, to make a force controllable actuator, it is still a challenging subject for the majority of the robotic system. This paper proposes a novel POWERPACK unit integrated a torque sensor, a harmonic drive and a motor for enabling the force control. The torque sensing element is based on the capacitance sensing to achieve a compact and a simple structure. In this research, reveals the practical details of the POWERPACK and evaluates the performance of the actuator unit.
