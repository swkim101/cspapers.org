The great deployment of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks has spawned momentous challenges for future data communication. Consumers often criticize the connectivity and performance related issues. Many of the routing protocols are suggested for wireless LAN. Prominent steps for selection of routing protocols according to the nature of network environment produce better performance. We use DSDV routing protocols to evaluate the performance of TCP & UDP over wired cum wireless LAN. We use Network Simulator-2 with different parameters, generating different speeds of mobile nodes and different link capacity (bandwidth) with same packet size in every scenario. We compare TCP and UDP in terms of throughput, good put and other significant parameters to justify their performance in particular circumstances.
