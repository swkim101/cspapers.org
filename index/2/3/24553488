Deep compression refers to removing the redundancy of parameters and feature maps for deep learning models. Low-rank approximation and pruning for sparse structures play a vital role in many compression works. However, weight filters tend to be both low-rank and sparse. Neglecting either part of these structure information in previous methods results in iteratively retraining, compromising accuracy, and low compression rates. Here we propose a unified framework integrating the low-rank and sparse decomposition of weight matrices with the feature map reconstructions. Our model includes methods like pruning connections as special cases, and is optimized by a fast SVD-free algorithm. It has been theoretically proven that, with a small sample, due to its generalizability, our model can well reconstruct the feature maps on both training and test data, which results in less compromising accuracy prior to the subsequent retraining. With such a warm start to retrain, the compression method always possesses several merits: (a) higher compression rates, (b) little loss of accuracy, and (c) fewer rounds to compress deep models. The experimental results on several popular models such as AlexNet, VGG-16, and GoogLeNet show that our model can significantly reduce the parameters for both convolutional and fully-connected layers. As a result, our model reduces the size of VGG-16 by 15&#xd7;, better than other recent compression methods that use a single strategy.
