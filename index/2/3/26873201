Research suggests that the African American population is continuously growing in America, yet African Americans are disproportionately represented when it comes to undergraduate and graduate degrees and careers in computing. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been developed as tools to disseminate information about various jobs in computing. The ECAs used in this study are African American men and women in those fields. This paper is about a pilot study conducted at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia to assess user satisfaction and effectiveness of the website which houses those ECAs. Twenty-two male undergraduates who were pursuing a degree in computer science participated in a study where they engaged the ECAs to learn more about various computing careers. Those individuals who participated in the study said that the tool was easy to use and that they will consider a career in computing in the future. This pilot study will be used to conduct another study that will focus on African American, male and female high school students and individuals interested in obtaining a graduate degree and/or career in computing. The study's limitation is that there is no control group to compare the results with. Future work will include groups who will either interact with disembodied agents, agents that are presented as Caucasian, or a collection of agents who are more demographically diverse instead of trying to match the demographics of the target audience.
