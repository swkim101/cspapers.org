This work focuses on integrated routing and motion planning for an autonomous vehicle in a road network. We consider a problem in which customer demands need to be met within desired deadlines, and the rules of the road need to be satisfied. The vehicle might not, however, be able to satisfy these two goals at the same time. We propose a systematic way to compromise between delaying the satisfaction of the given demand and violating the road rules. We utilize scLTL formulas to specify desired behavior and develop a receding horizon approach including a periodically interacting routing algorithm and a RRTâˆ—-based motion planner. The proposed solution yields a provably minimum-violation trajectory. An illustrative case study is included.
