This paper investigates a new scheme for dynamic adaption of contention window (CW) to enhance performance of information dissemination in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) protocol. The proposed scheme is based on a criteria feature, which the CW size is adapted according to the network collision probability to enable to prioritize different levels of message traffic. Unlike the traditional backoff algorithm, which the size of the window remains fixed no matter what the network load condition is, in an envisioned scheme the CW size fluctuates based on network load condition to reduce latency in the dissemination of a warning message. The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated using the OPNET modeler with dynamically adaptive CW size, whose results clearly verify its performance enhancement in terms of throughput and reduction in end-to-end delays.
