Security and error control coding are two crucial aspects of the digital communication systems. The increasing deployment of systems easy to eavesdrop, such as wireless systems, makes strategic the protection of the data secrecy. This paper presents an encryption scheme allowing to jointly perform an error control and dynamic coding in only one step. Based on the dynamic observation of the reciprocal propagation channel between the legitimate nodes, a “session key” is generated in order to manage the channel coding system, namely a turbo-code. This new scheme allows a dynamic security coding without change of the hardware structure of the transceiver devices.
