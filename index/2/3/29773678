In small mobile robots, decreasing the number of actuators is usually desirable to reduce the size and weight of the robot, but it is usually at the expense of the robot's degree of freedom (DOF). This work presents the development and preliminary experimental testing of a novel Legged Piezoelectric Miniature Robot (LPMR) driven only by a single piezoelectric unimorph actuator and yet fully capable of being maneuvered to move forward, turn right, or turn left. The underactuated motion is achieved by exploiting the bending vibration modes disparity of the piezoelectric actuator at different driving frequencies and designing specific positions of the robot's legs to generate a differential-drive-like mechanism. The speed of the robot can be controlled through regulating the magnitude of the applied voltage. The proposed underactuated system is experimentally verified and a preliminary characterization of the LPMR in terms of its forward and turning speed versus applied voltage and payload is investigated and reported.
