This paper describes a Software Quality Laboratory which will be used to develop new software quality analysis tools and evaluate their effectiveness. The laboratory will consist of a centralized data base for storing information about programs and a set of analysis routines which can be invoked interactively. A major effort using the laboratory will be the development of an executable assertion language. The laboratory will also be used to perform research in program verification and testing.
