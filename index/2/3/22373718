Over the last decade, automated vehicles have been widely researched and their massive potential has been verified through several milestone demonstrations. However, there are still many challenges ahead. One of the biggest challenges is integrating them into urban environments in which dilemmas occur frequently. Conventional automated driving strategies make automated vehicles foolish in dilemmas such as making lane-change in heavy traffic, handling a yellow traffic light and crossing a double-yellow line to pass an illegally parked car. In this paper, we introduce a novel automated driving strategy that allows automated vehicles to tackle these dilemmas. The key insight behind our automated driving strategy is that expert drivers understand human interactions on the road and comply with mutually-accepted rules, which are learned from countless experiences. In order to teach the driving strategy of expert drivers to automated vehicles, we propose a general learning framework based on maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning and Gaussian process. Experiments are conducted on a 5.2 km-long campus road at Seoul National University and demonstrate that our framework performs comparably to expert drivers in planning trajectories to handle various dilemmas.
