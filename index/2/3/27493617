Identifying collision-free paths over long time windows in environments with stochastically moving obstacles is difficult, in part because long-term predictions of obstacle positions typically have low fidelity, and the region of possible obstacle occupancy is typically large. As a result, planning methods that are restricted to identifying paths with a low probability of collision may not be able to find a valid path. However, allowing paths with a higher probability of collision may limit detection of imminent collisions. In this paper, we present Dynamic Risk Tolerance (DRT), a framework that dynamically evaluates risk tolerance, a function which is formulated as a time-varying upper bound on the acceptable likelihood of collision for a given path. DRT is implemented with forward stochastic reachable sets to predict the exact distribution of obstacles in a scalable manner over an arbitrarily long time window. In effect, DRT identifies actions that balance risks posed by both near and far obstacles. We empirically compare DRT to other state of the art methods that are capable of generating real-time solutions in highly crowded environments, and demonstrate the success rates for DRT that is 46% higher than the best performing comparison method, in the most difficult problem tested.
