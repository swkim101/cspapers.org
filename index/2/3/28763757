Sublanguages differ from each other, and from the "standard language", in their syntactic, semantic, and discourse properties. Understanding these differnces is important if we are to improve our ability to process these sublanguages. We have developed a semiautomatic procedure for identifying sublanguage syntactic usage from a sample of text in the sublanguage. We describe the results of applying this procedure to three text samples: two sets of medical documents and a set of equipment failure messages.
