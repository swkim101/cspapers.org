There are always some students who succeed and some students who don't. Our four panelists are committed to the success of all students, but have different explanations for students' lack of success. This panel discussion will highlight both their shared beliefs and disagreements between veteran CS educators Stuart Reges and Dan Garcia, CS education researcher Colleen Lewis, and Professor of History and Philosophy of Science Nathan Ensmenger. We hope this lively discussion will bring together divergent and complementary positions and expertise, as well as invite significant audience participation.
