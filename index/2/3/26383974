A fuzzy decision-making system for multi-criteria robot motion planning and control is described for a constant speed omni-directional mobile robot with active stereo cameras capable of panoramic viewing. The robot can be commanded to move to a target point through an unknown environment while satisfying multiple criteria. Advantages of the proposed method are confirmed by simulation. A multi-agent approach is also described for path planning with multiple robots.
