Emerging white-light LEDs allow the combination of illumination and optical wireless communication in one optical source. Visible light communication (VLC) uses solid-state LEDs to broadcast information and is an attractive technology for indoor positioning system. In this paper, we propose a higher accuracy indoor positioning algorithm using a stereo image sensor and white-light LEDs by the visible light communication. Indoor white-light LEDs are located at the ceiling of a room and broadcast its position information by VLC technology. Mobile receiver with stereo image sensor receives LED position information by VLC and estimates its position and angle information. Simulation results are given to show the efficiency of proposed indoor positioning algorithm.
