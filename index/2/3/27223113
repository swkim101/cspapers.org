A recent study [7] has shown that many computing students are not able to develop straightforward programs after the introductory programming sequence. Normal student assessment should have highlighted this problem, it did not, therefore normal assessment of programming ability does not work.We examine why current assessment methods (written exams and programming assignments) are faulty. We investigate another method of assessment (the lab exam) and show that this form of assessment is more accurate.We explain why accurate assessment is essential in order to encourage students to develop programming ability.
