POGIL activities are carefully designed to guide students to discover and explore concepts while encouraging students to practice process skills (e.g., team work, leadership and problem solving). Many college instructors have written POGIL activities for CS 1, CS 2, Software Engineering and other upper division CS classes (http://www.cspogil.org). High school teachers are also writing POGIL activities for the AP Principles course. This BOF is an opportunity for educators to share POGIL activities and ideas for improving group dynamics and encouraging reflection. We welcome everyone interested in learning more about POGIL and will provide information on regional POGIL workshops.
