This paper presents a miniaturization method of planar inverted F antenna structure by folded monopole antenna placed on FR4 dielectric. The proposed antenna comprises compact size (23 × 14 × 5 mm3), easy to make and provide enough bandwidth, which covers 3G band (VSWR ≤ 2). Using the simulation program to optimize antenna structure and calculate the antenna parameters in order to verify its applicability for the 3G devices.
