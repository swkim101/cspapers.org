We demonstrate an Excel interface that enables novice users to access and process networked sensor data in real time as well as to retrieve archived data for analysis and visualization. The spreadsheet provides application users an intuitive and familiar interface for sensor network programming and user-interaction. This approach builds upon a multi-tier system architecture (Figure 1), which consists of sensor motes, field access points (such as T-mote Connect), gateway servers, and back-end database. By tasking the sensor motes and the gateway server, Excel can obtain streaming sensor data from selected sensors. These data are converted into easy to use XML format by the gateway node. Using built-in XML support in Excel, users can map the data to desired locations in the spreadsheet. The users then have full data processing and visualization capabilities provided by Excel. At the same time, raw and processed data can be stored into a SQL server for archiving. Through Excel, users can send queries in SDL to retrieve data from the database for later analysis.
