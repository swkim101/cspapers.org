Model Predictive Control (MPC) is increasingly being proposed for real time application to provide flexible device monitoring and it has become an advanced development trend of embedded technologies. In this paper, practical application of predictive algorithm is proposed to control a thermal system in real time using the high performance processor STM32. The control algorithm is obtained by the implementation of the MPC in this industrial standard hardware, using Keil development tools designed for ARM processor-based microcontroller devices. Based on experimental results, a comparative analysis proves the effectiveness and the advantages of the MPC algorithm compared to PI controller.
