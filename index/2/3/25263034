Traditionally, computer software development courses have produced projects with small numbers of homogeneous users requiring limited maintenance and which run on a single platform as opposed to products which are distributed to large numbers of diverse users, run on multiple platforms, and which are upgraded and re-released many times. The NSF/ILI-IG grant with the university match provided funding to establish a software product development laboratory in an effort to provide students with the product development experience that many will need upon graduation.This paper discusses the concept for, the goals and subgoals of, and the first year's evaluation of the Product Development Laboratory.
