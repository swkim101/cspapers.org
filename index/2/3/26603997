Being busy builders, many who research operating system design principles are given little opportunity to write down their results and experience, or to meet and discuss them. Thus the unusual success of the first Symposium on Operating Systems Principles at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in October, 1967. Thus, we hope, the success of this, the second symposium.These Proceedings constitute the permanent record of the Second Symposium on Operating Systems Principles. The papers cover a wide range of topics, including general design principles, new ideas and new approaches to old ideas, and performance evaluation.
