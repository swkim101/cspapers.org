The BER performance for ultra-wide band (UWB) outdoor communication is investigated. By using the impulse response of multipath channels, the BER performance for binary pulse amplitude modulation (BPAM) communications over the radio UWB system is evaluated. Numerical results have shown that the multi-path effect caused by moving vehicles in the outdoor environment has a great impact on BER performance. Rake receivers are used to improve the outage probability.
