The authors propose a centipede type multi-legged walking robot, which has ten legs or over. Since the centipede type walking robot has more legs than other type robots, a centipede type walking robot transports a heavier payload than an other type robot. The walking sequence of this robot is different from conventional multi-legged walking robot that has a half cycle difference between the front and rear neighbor legs. A lateral pair of legs makes a unit, and a unit follows the movement of the front neighbor unit with a quarter delay of the walking cycle. Thus, this robot walks with statically stable condition. This robot also differs from conventional walking robots that have a controller to control movement of whole robot legs. This centipede type walking robot has computers for each pair of legs. These computers control legs and communicate the front and rear neighbor computers. No computer of these computers controls the whole robot. All legs without the head pair of legs follow the movement of the front neighbor legs with quarter walking cycle delay, then the whole robot walks with static stability.
