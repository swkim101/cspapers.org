Many matchmaking applications help people find Mr./Ms. Right from people they might never meet. However, people usually tend to have a crush on someone in their daily life, such as classmates or colleagues. A big problem is: How to express love to your crush without hurting your original friendship? In response, we develop a mobile application, CrushList, to help people create a loving relationship with those around them based on an anonymous matching mechanism using mobile numbers as the user IDs. This is effective and efficient because mobile numbers are easy to access from one's mobile phone and the mobile contacts are usually those already known or met in one's daily life. The CrushList users can manage a crush-list by adding the mobile numbers of their crushes. Only when two users are in the crush-list of each other the system will notify both of them. Otherwise, a user always keeps anonymous to his/her crush.
