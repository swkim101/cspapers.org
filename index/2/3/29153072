However, as with any supervised learning method, neural network based methods for this task cannot work well when the training data comes from a different domain than the test data. On the other hand, some rule-based unsupervised methods have shown to be robust when applied to different domains. In this work, we use rule-based unsupervised methods to create auxiliary labels and use neural network models to learn a hidden representation that works well for different domains. When this hidden representation is used for opinion target extraction, we find that it can outperform a number of strong baselines with a large margin.
