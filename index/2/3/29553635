We look at the essential thinking skills students need to learn in the introductory computer science course based on object-oriented programming. We create a framework for such a course based on the elementary programming and design patterns. Some of these patterns are known in the pattern community, others enrich the collection. Our goal is to help students focus on mastering reasoning and design skills before the language idiosynchracies muddy the water.
