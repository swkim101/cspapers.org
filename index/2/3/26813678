More and more today, people are engaging in conversations via email, blogs, discussion forums, text messaging and other social media. A person may want to archive these conversations and later retrieve information about what was discussed, or analyze a conversation in real-time. What topics are covered in these conversations? What opinions are people expressing? Have any decisions been made? Have action items been assigned? This tutorial will present various natural language processing (NLP) techniques that can help answer these questions, thus creating numerous new and valuable applications that can support people in more effectively participating in these conversation. The tutorial is based on a book that we have recently published, Methods for Mining and Summarizing Text Conversations.
