We present interactive software designed to support students' exploration of concepts involving Huffman coding. This software illustrates the association between binary codewords and paths in a Huffman tree, the greedy algorithm that is used to construct an optimal tree, and the use of the tree in the decoding process. It allows the user to control the input upon which the code is built, to step forward and backward through an animation of the algorithm process for constructing a tree, and to choose data to encode or decode. We have used this software with students in an introductory computing principles course, a first-year data structures course, and an upper-level algorithms course. The software is publicly available as a Java applet at http://cs.slu.edu/~goldwasser/demos/huffman.
