This article demonstrates a bendable 256-bit organic memristor in a crossbar array fabricated from a composite of fullerene organic semiconductor and polymer matrix. Electrical measurements indicated that the memristor cell can be reversibly switched at a voltage pulse of -4 or 4 V for 1 Î¼s. The operating mechanism was attributed to the charge storage of fullerene. The memristor exhibited highly reliable with the stable retention time characteristics with a large on/off current ratio of five orders of magnitude at 0.5 V. These obtained results suggest that the memristor based on fullerene can be utilized for storing information in bendable electronics.
