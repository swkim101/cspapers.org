Identity-Based encryption is an asymmetric encryption system where identifiers such as email addresses, server names or phone numbers, can be used as public keys. Originally proposed by Adi Shamir in 1984, the first practical algorithm became available in 2001. Since then IBE has not only generated huge interest in academia, it has seen wide-scale adoption in industry, is used by hundreds of thousands of users and is in the process of being standardized by the IEEE.In this talk we will give an overview of the state of IBE, and reflect on what led to its rapid success. Unlike many encryption protocols, IBE is a new cryptographic paradigm that can not be built from existing encryption algorithms. As a new primitive, IBE directly solves some of the existing problems with classic public key systems. Specifically it enables the use of short-lived public keys, removes the overhead of certificate management and enables keys to be centrally managed. As a result IBE systems require less state and are much more lightweight and scalable than traditional PKI systems.In this talk we will give an overview over the IBE algorithms and standardization activities. We will describe a secure email systems based on IBE, and by examining the example of a live enterprise deployment of IBE discuss advantages and differences to traditional PKI.
