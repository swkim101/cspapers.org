As a semiconductor company devoted to the production of high volume custom IC's, AMI views the world differently than systems houses and most other semiconductor houses. With standard product semiconductor manufacturers we share the goal of keeping the part price as low as possible, however our circuit complexity is less and our need to quickly get the product to a customer is greater. With the systems houses we share the need for quickly getting the part to production, but our larger volumes make the chip cost (and therefore minimizing its size) of paramount importance.
 VLSI represents a significant chip design challenge that requires an advanced design automation (DA) system. A typical VLSI device of 200,000 gates and 106 transistors moves the chip design problem from the circuit level to the system level and requires that chip design be viewed as a system design problem.
 VLSI design demands a hierarchical design approach with tools for each level of abstraction in the hierarchy. As it will not be possible for one chip designer to design the entire device, the task must be divided among members of a design team to benefit from parallel activity to minimize development span times.
 We see the 1980s as broken up into two segments-the early 1980s, when the work started on physical design tools in the late '70s will bear fruit, and the late '80s when a shift will occur away from physical design tools toward front-end tools to help the system designer cope with greatly increased density and complexity. All these tools must be glued together by the much touted hierarchical design style.
