This paper describes a practicum-seminar course which the author taught at the University of Colorado during the spring and summer of 1974. This course contained a number of salient features which made it an interesting experiment and a unique learning experience for all involved. The broad goals of the seminar were:
 a) to introduce participants to system design and software engineering techniques and to provide practical experience in the use of these techniques;
 b) to design and implement a flexible, human oriented student registration and scheduling system.
 This paper presents background and discussion of the project and the seminar. A class syllabus is given showing topics which were covered, and advantages and disadvantages of this type of educational experience are discussed.
