This is a full-day tutorial on building and validating test collections. The intended audience is advanced students who nd themselves in need of a test collection, or actually in the process of building a test collection, to support their own research. Not everyone can talk TREC, CLEF, INEX, or NTCIR into running a track to build the collection you need. The goal of this tutorial is to lay out issues, procedures, pitfalls, and practical advice.
