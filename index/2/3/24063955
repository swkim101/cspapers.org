The OpenFabrics Alliance develops transport-agnostic open-source software for InfiniBand and Ethernet fabrics. The first release of this software was just released, supported by a growing community of HPC vendors, research institutions, and Linux distributions, and promises to provide a core foundation for future RDMA development for accelerating applications using next-generation fabrics.The meeting will consist of:1. Technical Leads of the OpenFabrics Enterprise Working group presenting the history and currente status of OpenFabrics. 2. Discuss potential direction for OpenFabrics, soliciting input from real-world end users. 3. Opportunity for HPC researchers and end users to directly discuss how to use RDMA and OpenFabrics to optimize application performance.
