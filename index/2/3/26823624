Outline • Uncertainty and uncertain data, where and why? • Models for uncertain and probabilistic data • (coffee break) • OLAP on uncertain and probabilistic data • Mining uncertain and probabilistic data • Tools: querying uncertain and probabilistic data – Indexing uncertain and probabilistic data – Ranking queries and spatial queries • Summary and discussion • Uncertainty is often caused by our limited perception and understanding of reality – Limited observation equipment – Limited resource to collect, store, transform, analyze, and understand data • Uncertainty can be inherent in nature – How much do you like/dislike McCain and Obama? • Sensors are often used to collect data • Ideal sensors – Ideal sensors are designed to be linear: the output signal of a sensor is linearly proportional to the value of the measured property – Sensitivity: the ratio between output signal and measured property • Sensitivity error: the sensitivity differs from the value specified • Offset (bias): the output of a sensor at zero input • Nonlinearity: the sensitivity is not constant over the range of the sensor • Dynamic error: deviation caused by a rapid change of the measured property over time • Drift: the output signal changes slowly independent of the measured property – Long term drift: a slow degradation of sensor properties over a long period • Noise: random deviation of the signal varying in time • A sensor may to some extent be sensitive to properties (e.g., temperature) other than the one being measured • Dynamic error due to sampling frequency of digital sensors
