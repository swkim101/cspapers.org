One of the major perceived barriers to the adoption of Classroom Response Systems, a.k.a. "clickers", is limited interactivity. Students using dedicated clicker hardware are often only able to provide basic multiple choice or simple numeric responses. The accessibility and flexibility of smartphones make them an intriguing platform for managing some of the shortfalls of traditional classroom response systems. This approach not only leverages a resource that a growing number of students already own, but also aims to enhance the effectiveness of the system by tapping into the robust interaction capabilities that these devices afford. This poster will describe a smartphone implementation of a classroom response system and discuss efforts to extend the basic clicker interaction model.
