In recent years satellite mobile communications systems and market have entered into the era of maturation. Systems like Iridium and Global Star are technically considered as state of the art. This research paper is the result of a feasibility study of utilizing the low earth orbit, Iridium satellite network for the data transfer. The findings of this research, also demonstrate the performance and reliability of the satellite link. A system of data transfer is developed according to a set of specifications, along with the selection of a suitable satellite link. This data collection system is realized in such a way, that there is software which interfaces the PC of the data transmitting station, with the Iridium satellite constellation; a similar system configuration is present at the data receiving station
