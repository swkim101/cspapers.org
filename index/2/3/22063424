As we embrace this new era of multicore and heterogeneous processors, we find ourselves ill-equipped to leverage the full potential of increasing parallelism. There are no widely-adopted parallel programming languages. With massive datasets, the growing importance of sensor-based systems, and increasingly large data models the I/O wall is looking more daunting than the memory wall. Current high-end software technology is not easily used by non-sophisticated developers.
