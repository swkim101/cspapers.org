We present an integrated method for record clustering and reorganization which can be applied to any set of queries whose frequencies of request are known. The clustering algorithm works by splitting and merging current clusters and, furthermore, produces a new assignment of these clusters to pages in secondary storage. The reorganization algorithm is an on-line, incremental procedure for allocating the records to their new physical locations such that the number of pages swapped in and out of the memory buffer is as small as possible.
