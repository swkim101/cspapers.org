Given that the two other invited lectures in this conference are on such remote areas as "Quantum Computation" and "Algorithmic Game Theory," and given the diversity of other topics represented in the program, it makes sense to ask if the STOC/FOCS community is still one.Indeed, the program chair has asked me to respond to this question.In the talk I'll try to illustrate, with a few (of many) examples, how the presence of such diversity in our community and conferences was actually responsible for important progress in specific areas of research, why I find these a natural and expected phenomena, and why I expect this trend to continue.
