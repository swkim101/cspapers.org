The Mj√∏lner project is a major Scandinavian effort to develop a programming environment for object-oriented languages. As part of this project we have implemented a user interaction toolkit. The toolkit is programmed in SIMULA#8482; and is built on the X Window System.#8482; The main goals of our work have been to exploit the coroutine concept for event handling, and to show the benefits of using compiled object-oriented languages for this type of software. The result is an efficient system with a simple, yet flexible, design featuring a powerful unification of process-driven and procedure-driven programming styles.
