The Database Design Tool prototype is being developed in the IMPRESS project (Esprit project 6355). The IMPRESS project started in May 1992 and aims at creating a low-level storage manager tailored for multimedia applications, together with a library of efficient operators, a programming environment, high-level design tools and methodology. The DDT is part of this last effort. 
 
The project focuses on the field of Technical Information Systems, where there is a need for tools supporting modeling of complex objects. Designers in this field usually use incremental design or step by step prototyping, because this seems to be best suited for users coping with complexity and uncertainty about their own needs or requirements. The IMPRESS DDT aims at supporting the database design part of this process.
