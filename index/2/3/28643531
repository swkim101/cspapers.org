The goal of the Impact project is to study the impact that software engineering research has had upon software development practice. The reasons for doing this include: identifying the sorts of contributions that have had substantial impact, determining the research modalities that have been relatively more successful, and anticipating the directions that software engineering research might most effectively pursue, based upon its history and positioning. Impact project research will be held to the highest standards of scrupulous scholarship. It is expected to be useful to the software engineering research and development communities, as well as to other academic disciplines, government funding agencies and the public at large in helping with the objective assessment of the software engineering community's record of achievement.
