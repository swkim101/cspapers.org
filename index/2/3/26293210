This paper proposes the method that applies Genetic Algorithm (GA) to Cognitive Radio (CR) system. Because of optimization purpose, a two-dimensional structure is used for chromosome's implementation. Combined with Fitness Objective Evaluation (FOE) standard, two kinds of GA are considered: Conventional GA (CGA) applied with multi-objective fitness approach and Non-dominated Sorting GA (NSGA) with Pareto-optimal sorting fronts. These kinds of GA's implementation will show a good view about the performance of CR engine in the process to find out the optimal solution. In order to enable dynamic spectrum access (DSA), this approach will attempt to minimize power consumption, transmission error, and interference caused by a radio wireless system.
