Teaching courses in logic and systems design is not complete unless the students are able to design a logic system as a part of their course work. A project on the design of an asynchronous computer system is presented in this paper. This system is microprogrammed and has no master clock to time the micro operations. The computer designed has sixteen machine instructions, 2K core memory, and a microcomputer with 256 word ROM.
