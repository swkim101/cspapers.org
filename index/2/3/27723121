This paper presents a novel haptic mouse system as a new human computer interface, which has a force feedback capability. A proposed haptic mouse can reflect 1 dof grabbing force as well as 2 dof translation force which can simulate more realistic virtual experience. Five-bar mechanism has been adapted to realize the 2 dof translation force feedback, and double prismatic joint type of mechanism has been used to implement the grabbing force feedback. Wire-driven mechanism is mainly used for actuation to reduce the backlash as well as to provide back-drivability. In addition, haptic rendering algorithm for the proposed haptic mouse have been developed to give feelings of weight, shape and surface texture. By adding haptic information to the visual and audio information, the haptic mouse system is expected to be useful by presenting more realistic interaction in e-commerce in the future.
