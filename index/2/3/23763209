This paper describes aspects of an experience setting up a new computer science curriculum in a small four year liberal arts college. Despite previous experience setting up such a program in an engineering environment, and the fact that in retrospect the problems seems obvious, the nature of problems encountered surprised the author. He caused himself and others both discomfort and hard work because he did not perceive fundamental causes sufficiently quickly and clearly, and hopes others working with liberal arts colleagues on curriculum development will find the ideas presented here helpful.
