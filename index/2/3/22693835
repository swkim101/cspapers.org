From his twin perspectives as a career-long telecommunications engineer and Chairman of one of the UK's largest electronics companies, Sir David Brown will reflect on whether and when the New Economy, seemingly so long coming, will finally arrive. He will begin by exploring how the prospect of everything being digital; everyone having broadband; and intelligence being everywhere is changing our understanding of mobility. Then he will comment on the economic effects of that changed understanding under three headings - the macroeconomy, microeconomy and socioeconomy - before suggesting the criteria we might use to decide when the New Economy has arrived.
