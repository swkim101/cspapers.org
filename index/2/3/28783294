The EUscreen initiative represents the European television archives and acts as a domain aggregator for Europeana, Europe's digital library, which provides access to over 20 million digitized cultural objects. The main motivation for the initiative is to provide unified access to a representative collection of television programs, secondary sources and articles, and in this way to allow students, scholars and the general public to study the history of television in its wider context. This paper explores the EUscreen activities related to novel ways to present curated content and publishing EUscreen metadata as Linked Open Data.
