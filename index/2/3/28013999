Regular cost functions offer a toolbox for automatically solving problems of existence of bounds, in a way similar to the theory of regular languages. More precisely, it allows to test the existence of bounds for quantities that can be defined in cost monadic second-order logic (a quantitative variant of monadic second-order logic) with inputs that range over finite words, infinite words, finite trees, and (sometimes) infinite trees.
