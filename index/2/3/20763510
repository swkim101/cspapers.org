There are many services provided via the network. Now that hardware is much powerful, and operating systems are better for dealing with multi-task processing. In the past, there are many services provided by many hosts, but they can be integrated in one host only. For example, when there are multiple network services by the same host, they are usually distributed by different ports if they share the same IP. This means that the users need to designate the specific port to use the specific service. Users need to know the IP and the port of the service, but in fact they do not need to know. And besides, it is always forbidden to change the port arbitrarily because it is usually impossible to give everyone notices. A network protocol is proposed in this paper. WAN services lookup protocol (called WSLP) can look up services for some hosts. Therefore, when some client want to use some network service in some host, predefined or default parameters are not necessary. It will know how to communicate with some port by WSLP support. It is flexible for clients and services, and matches the trends of zero configurations. Fewer static parameters are more integration of software services.
