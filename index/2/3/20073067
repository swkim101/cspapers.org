The so-called "Dropout" training scheme is one of the most powerful tool to reduce over-fitting. From the statistic point of view, Dropout works by implicitly imposing an L2 regularizer on the weights. In this paper, we present a new training scheme: Shakeout. Instead of randomly discarding units as Dropout does at the training stage, our method randomly chooses to enhance or inverse the contributions of each unit to the next layer. We show that our scheme leads to a combination of L1 regularization and L2 regularization imposed on the weights, which has been proved effective by the Elastic Net models in practice.We have empirically evaluated the Shakeout scheme and demonstrated that sparse network weights are obtained via Shakeout training. Our classification experiments on real-life image datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that Shakeout deals with over-fitting effectively.
