The discovery promotes us to seek low-rank and doubly stochastic similarity matrix, we then propose an unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction method, called Unsupervised Large Graph Embedding (ULGE). ULGE starts with similar idea as LPP, it adopts an efficient approach to construct similarity matrix and then performs spectral analysis efficiently, the computational complexity can reduce to O(ndm), which is a significant improvement compared to conventional spectral based methods which need O(n^2d) at least, where n, d and m are the number of samples, dimensions and anchors, respectively. Extensive experiments on several public available data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.
