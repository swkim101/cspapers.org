At the previous SHARE Design Automation Workshop a general description of the then current activities of the MIT Computer-Aided Design Project was given. The principal activities which were outlined were: (1) The cooperative AED-1 Project in which visiting staff programmers from industry join with our MIT staff in the research and development of advanced compiler and language processing techniques to serve as the foundation for a total Computer-Aided Design System for man-machine problem solving, (2) Studies of mixed verbal and graphical language processing by the uniform techniques of the Algorithmic Theory of Language. Since that time extensive progress has been made in both of these areas.
