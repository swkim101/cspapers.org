Several modular processes are used to build relationships between a) two-dimensional regions and boundaries in a segmented image, and b) the hypothesized surfaces, volumes and objects of a three-dimensional world. A variety of bottom-up and top-down strategies coordinate the processes of SHAPE, PERSPECTIVE, SHADOW, and OCCLUSION to construct these relationships in the VISIONS system.
