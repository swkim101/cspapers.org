This paper describes the problems faced while using Kimmo's two-level model to describe certain Indian languages such as Tamil and Hindi. The two-level model is shown to be descriptively inadequate to address these problems. A simple extension to the basic two-level model is introduced which allows conflicting phonological rules to coexist. The computational complexity of the extension is the same as Kimmo's two-level model.
