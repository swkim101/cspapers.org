Attracting computer science students in a liberal arts setting serves to enhance the background and breadth of the class of professional programmers. There is a segment of the student population that is talented and artistic, but may not be aware of the interplay between computer science and the arts or computer science and mathematics and the sciences. Students are acculturated in a visual, interactive, and interdisciplinary world. This BOF will provide a platform for a discussion on how multimedia can be integrated in beginning level computing courses. Discussions will focus on attributes of conventional and unconventional first languages and explore a liberal arts approach to integrate disciplines both scientific and artistic. We envision discussions relevant to (a) mathematicians visualizing processes using multimedia and algorithms, (b) physicists using game programming to explore physical and virtual worlds, (c) computer scientists and behavioral scientists collaborating on responsive systems, (d) musicians, artists, and computer scientists creating computational art. The audience is expected to consist of faculty looking at nontraditional approaches to a first course in programming. Faculty with an aim to attract students to computer science studies will find this discussion useful. Those who feel their curriculum to be too narrowly focused and wish to broaden their curriculum to include the humanities and interdisciplinary approaches to computer science will find like-minded peers to communicate with.
