Selected mapping (SLM) is a well-known technique to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). SLM generally requires the side information for each OFDM symbol, which leads to decrease the transmitting efficiency. In addition, false side information detection degrades the bit error rate performance significantly. In this paper, we propose a novel SLM scheme without any side information by devising a phase rotation and simple scrambler detection in the receiver. Computer simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves excellent performances in terms of both PAPR reduction and BER.
