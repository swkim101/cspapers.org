While most existing works assign a single dominant emotion to each image, we address the sentiment ambiguity by label distribution learning (LDL), which is motivated by the fact that image usually evokes multiple emotions. Two new algorithms are developed based on conditional probability neural network (CPNN). First, we proposed BCPNN which encodes image label into a binary representation to replace the signless integers used in CPNN, and employ it as a part of input for the neural network. Then, we train our ACPNN model by adding noises to ground truth label and augmenting affective distributions. Since current datasets are mostly annotated for single-label learning, we build two new datasets, one of which is relabeled on the popular Flickr dataset and the other is collected from Twitter. These datasets contain 20,745 images with multiple affective labels, which are over ten times larger than the existing ones. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art works on our large-scale datasets and other publicly available benchmarks.
