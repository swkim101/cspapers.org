The ORES is an ESPRIT III project (no. P7224) that develops a demonstrator Temporal Database Management System (TDBMS). The ORES TDBMS will support the efficient and user friendly representation and manipulation of temporal knowledge and it will be developed as an extension of the relational database management system INGRES. The ORES project will result in a general purpose TDBMS [1], the development of which is based on a practical and yet theoretically sound approach. More specifically, the overall objectives of the ORES project are: i) to develop a formal foundation for temporal representation and reasoning, ii) to develop a temporal query language that will be upwards consistent with SQL2, iii) to develop models, techniques and tools for user friendly and effective definition, manipulation and validation of temporal database applications, and iv) to evaluate the ORES environment using a hospital case study [2].
