In this paper, we aim to develop a travelogue service to discover and convey various travelogue digests, in form of theme locations and geographical scope to their readers. In this service, theme locations in a travelogue are the core information to discover. Due to the inherent ambiguity of location relevance, we explore the textual (e.g., surrounding words) and geographical (e.g., geographical relationship among locations) features of locations to perform location relevance classification for theme location discovery. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on collected travelogues to evaluate the performance of our location relevance classification technique and demonstrate the effectiveness of the travelogue service.
