To date, the adoption of content-based Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) solutions in the practice of information services remains rather limited. While state-of-the-art DIR prototypes have been recently announced [1], real-world applications are largely confined to Web meta-searchers and appear to make little use of the rich array of techniques reported in the literature. We argue that a major obstacle to the uptake of DIR solutions is the lack of a development and deployment infrastructure built around open application frameworks and standard formats, languages, and protocols. Developments outside the DIR field have rallied some consensus around query protocols, but true application frameworks for DIR remain unavailable and developers are forced to either home-grow solutions or to repurpose simulation code intended for ad-hoc research evaluations. In this paper, we report on the ongoing design and implementation of an application framework for DIR.
