In this paper a program for generating the model of industrial robots in a symbolic form is presented. The program, called DYMIR, derives the motion equations of robots here considered as a chain of rigid bodies connected by suitable single degree-of-freedom (DOF) joints. This is transparent to the user and allows the symbolic calculation of dynamical models until twelve DOF and may take into account elasticity and transmission losses at the joints.
