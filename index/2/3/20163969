Many of these operations are known to induce tractability of any language they preserve. We focus on the meta-problem: given a language G, decide if G has a polymorphism with nice properties. We design an algorithm that decides in polynomial-time if a constraint language has a conservative Mal'tsev polymorphism, and outputs one if one exists. As a corollary we obtain that the class of conservative Mal'tsev constraints is uniformly tractable, and we conjecture that this result remains true in the non-conservative case.
