In this article the injection locking effect in terahertz (THz) resonant tunneling diode (RTD) oscillators is studied using a circuit simulation method. The simulation model is implemented in a popular simulator called Keysight ADS for ease of use and effective investigation. The locking phenomenon is successfully observed. Pulling range, locking range, locking conditions and influence of antenna resistance on locking range of the effect are carefully discussed. We found that locking range is wide, locking effect can be occurred at a relatively low injected power and injection locked RTD THz oscillator array is feasible.
