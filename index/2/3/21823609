We propose a robust pointing detection with virtual shadow representation for interacting with a public display. Using a depth camera, our shadow is generated by a model with an angled virtual sun light and detects the nearest point as a pointer. The position of the shadow becomes higher when user walks closer, which conveys the notion of correct distance to control the pointer and offers accessibility to the higher area of the display.
