The evolution of packet switching network technology over the past ten years has been strongly influenced by the dramatic growth of these networks. The ability to control and manage large networks has required many innovations and has been most successful where the growing network itself has provided the mechanisms needed for network management.
This discussion will cover the increasing use of decentralization and parallel operation of functions required to monitor the network, to remotely test and maintain subscriber facilities, to collect billing and statistical data, and to distribute and install new software. Specific problems which require special attention in large network management will be covered; these include time synchronization, routing optimization, and network security.
The SL-10 packet switching system from Northern Telecom is referenced through this discussion as an example of a system which has built on the facilities and technology of the network switching equipment to provide the management function. Since all of the attributes of capacity, availability, reliable communication, configuration flexibility, and security are the same for both packet switching subscribers and network management, using a common base provides real advantages.
The discussion will show how the exclusive use of network terminal interfaces, virtual circuits, and X.25 host interfaces for all management data transfer functions provides the required function with virtually unlimited growth potential. Support of both packet switching and management functions on the same base of processor, storage devices, and software, further extends the benefits of commonality.
