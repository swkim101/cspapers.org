This paper presents experiences with creating a computer simulator as a student project in a CS1 course. Each student writes the simulator using C++ during the last ten weeks of the course. The project consists of a simulated memory, and simple CPU simulator including a machine language. Additionally, students implement an assembly language and a simple high-level language with associated compiler. The course has no programming prerequisite and can be taken to fulfill a general education requirement or as the first course for students majoring in computer science or information systems. Integrating such a project in an entry level course has a number of benefits as well as challenges. The project acts as a vehicle that engages students in a breadth of computer science topics, leading into discussions of theoretical considerations, languages, and computing devices. The project components provide an active learning environment. Students are introduced to numbering systems, number conversions, and numeric representations. The computer architecture components include introductions to main memory, CPU, and memory access techniques. The transition from and motivations for, the utilization of machine languages, assembly languages and high-level languages are demonstrated with the implementation of the project. Beginning students are given opportunity to practice programming and problem solving on a project of significant complexity. The biggest challenge is organization. Management of such a project requires a well-defined plan.
