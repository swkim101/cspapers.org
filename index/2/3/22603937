As software engineering advances, new software engineering programs continue to emerge in universities around the world and existing ones are continually being updated. These programs face myriad challenges such as incorporating new software engineering technologies, recruiting and retaining qualified faculty, attracting students, leveraging new technologies for remote teaching, integrating related disciplines such as systems engineering, and, of course, deciding what basic content to include in their courses. The recently published Graduate Software Engineeing 2009 "GSwE2009" (http://www.gswe2009.org) presents a model and guidelines to help faculty address those challenges. Both ACM and IEEE approved and endorsed GSwE2009 in 2009.
 The panel will debate approaches to developing master's programs in software engineering in general and GSwE2009 in particular. It will consider experiences, challenges, and criticisms of GSwE2009.
