In a relational system, a database is composed of base relations, views, and snapshots. We show that this traditional approach can be extended to different classes of derived relations, and we propose a unified data definition mechanism for centralized and distributed databases. 
 
Our mechanism, called DEREL, can be used to define base relations and to derive different classes of views, snapshots, partitioned and replicated data. DEREL is intended to be part of a general purpose distributed relational database management system.
