Semantic localization refers to the process of finding one's location with respect to visible or identifiable objects in the scene instead of finding position coordinates. In this research, we use textual signs and their geographical relationships inside a building as semantic signatures to design an infrastructureless indoor navigation system without a site survey. We propose a computer vision-based approach, which takes as an input a floor plan image and automatically infers the floor graph. The constructed graph is then used to estimate the shortest path, which is a sequence of store names, that the user needs to pass to reach her destination.
