We introduce SESENA 2013, the fourth in a series of workshops devoted to software engineering for sensor network applications. The workshop took place in San Francisco (USA) on May 21, 2013, in conjunction with the 35th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). The goal was to bring together research from both the field of software engineering (SE) and wireless sensor networks (WSN) to engender exchange and discussion on shared research goals and agendas.
