PRTV [6] is a research prototype interactive data base. It is intended for use on its own or as part of a specialist system. The principle objectives are to provide: a) high level flexible data support, b) functional extensibility and c) reasonable efficiency. The prototype is also designed as a method of generating and testing ideas in a wider data base research programme.
