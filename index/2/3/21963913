This paper proposes a new idea for grading multiple-choice test which is based on a camera with reliability and efficiency. The bounds of the answer sheet image captured by the camera is first allocated using Hough transform and then skew-corrected into the proper orientation, followed by the normalization to a given size. Next, the tick mark corresponding to the answer for each question can be recognized by allocation of the mask which wraps the answer area. The experimental results showed that the proposed system has achieved significant improvement in performance in terms of accuracy, reliability, and elapsed time compared with those of the conventional optical mark recognition (OMR) systems. The proposed system also demonstrated that it can also achieve high accuracy of 99.7% while using non-transoptic answer sheet paper with lower cost.
