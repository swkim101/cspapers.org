When it comes to educating children, we may agree that it makes no sense to teach them to write before they have mastered the alphabet. Yet, it is common for CS instructors to forge ahead with the next topic even though some students have failed to gain the necessary understanding of the current topic. The tightly integrated nature of CS topics often makes this "forward progress" turn into no progress at all for those students. We propose an individualized approach to CS instruction where students progress to more advanced concepts only after they have demonstrated proficiency in prerequisite topics. We use a constructivist model of individualized instruction supported by specialized materials and a support system of instructor and peers: core Montessori components. In our case, the specialized materials are realized in a "living textbook" which incorporates scaffolded lessons delivered to students at the appropriate time based on their individual progress and also integrates a social communication network between students, peers, and the instructor (guide). Maria Montessori said that "our aim is not only to make the child understand ... but to enthuse them to their innermost core." Our prior work focused on giving our students motivating materials and creating a "Comfort Zone of Proximal Development." Combining this with Montessori methods, we believe we can help all students succeed in Computer Science, some at a slower pace and others exploring more concepts than we previously dreamed possible. We will explore the details of this approach in our (en)lightening talk.
