This paper presents an analysis of the dynamic performance of a non-redundant robotic manipulator while in contact with a fixed environment, i.e., a rigid wall. This work extends an earlier performance characterization, the dynamic capability hypersurface, which described a manipulator's ability to accelerate and apply forces at the end-effector, given the limitations on the manipulator's motor torques. The proposed extension includes an analysis of end-effector motion constraints and friction forces and moments associated with environmental contact. This analysis is applied to a PUMA 560 manipulator.
