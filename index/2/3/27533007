Walking principle of biped robot is clarified with ZMP (zero moment point) concept, friction constraint, and inverted pendulum model in this paper. The stable walking condition is derived out with ZMP constraint, friction constraint, and inverted pendulum model. With this result, the nature that the biped walking is in fact a continually acceleration and deceleration motion is presented and its walking velocity can be adjusted by controlling landing point. The desired ZMP trajectory is given out based on derived stable walking condition, and the motion parameters of biped robot, such as walking stride, period, and their restriction are investigated. The approach used in this paper is expected to extend to analyze the motion of running and jump robot.
