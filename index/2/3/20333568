The goal of the Paradise project is to apply object-oriented and parallel database technology to the task of implementing a parallel GIS system capable of managing extremely large (multi-terabyte) data sets such as those that will be produced by the upcoming NASA EOSDIS project [Car92]. The project is focusing its resources on algorithms, processing, and storage techniques, and not on making new contributions to the data modeling, query language, or user interface domains.At the outset, we organized the Paradise project as two phases. The goal of first phase was to produce a client-server version of Paradise. The second phase of the project is to add support for tertiary storage and extend the software to run on clusters of workstations and "shared nothing" multiprocessors [Sto86]. Phase one of the project is now complete and has produced a usable, client-server version of the system whose performance and functionality is comparable to other integrated GIS systems [DKL+94].
