According to the statistics, people upgrade smartphones at every two years, which means tremendous number of phones will be left unused. In this paper, we propose a method to use Android-based smartphones as wireless sensors for environmental monitoring. Although the idea of using smartphones as a wireless sensor sounds naive, the previous approaches were un-practical because of its limited battery life. In this paper, we exploit the Linux kernel boot mode on Android devices to extend the battery life drastically. Unlike normal mode, power consumption in the kernel mode is minimum but still it is possible to access to all the sensors in principle. In this paper, we measure the power consumption of Nexus5 while booting, running and shutting down Android OS / Linux kernel and estimate the battery life assuming a duty cycle. The results show that utilizing the Linux kernel can extend the battery life up to 10.9 times when the sensing interval is 3 minutes.
