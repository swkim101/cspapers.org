Detecting regularities between complex events in temporal graphs is critical for emerging applications. This paper proposes graph temporal association rules (GTAR). A GTAR extends traditional association rules to discover temporal associations for complex events captured by a class of temporal pattern queries. We introduce notions of support and confidence for GTARS and formalize the discovery problem for GTARS. We show that despite the enhanced expressive power, GTARS discovery is feasible over large temporal graphs. We develop an effective rule discovery algorithm, which integrates event mining and rule discovery as a single process, and reduces the redundant computation by leveraging their interaction. Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and scalability of the algorithms. Our case study also verifies that GTARS demonstrate highly interpretable associations in real-world networks.
