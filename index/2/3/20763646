This demo submission presents a set of tools and an extended framework with API for enabling the semantically empowered enrichment of online video with Web content. As audiovisual media is increasingly transmitted online, new services deriving added value from such material can be imagined. For example, combining it with other material elsewhere on the Web which is related to it or enhances it in a meaningful way, to the benefit of the owner of the original content, the providers of the content enhancing it and the end consumer who can access and interact with these new services. Since the services are built around providing new experiences through connecting different related media together, we consider such services to be Connected Media Experiences (ConnectME). This paper presents a toolset for ConnectME - an online annotation tool for video and a HTML5-based enriched video player - as well as the ConnectME framework which enables these media experiences to be generated on the server side with semantic technology.
