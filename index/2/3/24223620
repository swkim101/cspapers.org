The emerging field of mobile sensing has engaged computer scientists from a variety of existing communities, such as, mobile systems, machine learning and human computer interaction. Each community approaches the challenges of mobile sensing research with its own unique perspective. The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum to discuss the state of the art in mobile sensing and promote increased cooperation and interaction among the participating research communities.
