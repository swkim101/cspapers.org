Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are networks where the nodes are mobile, communicating via wireless link, operating without fixed infrastructure and each node act as a router (forwarding the in transit packets) as well as an end host. The movement of nodes is different in different scenario depending upon applications. Several routing protocols have been proposed by researchers for mobile ad hoc networks. They perform different in different scenarios. The mobility model is one of the main aspects for testing the performance of MANETs routing protocols. We evaluate the performance of multiple routing protocols (DSDV, DSR, OLSR and AODV) using most common mobility models ( random walk, random direction, random way point) for mobile ad hoc networks. We draw the conclusions at the end from the results which will provide the idea of using routing protocol in implementation according to the mobility characteristics of underline scenario. Also we elaborate the weakness and advantages of these routing protocols.
