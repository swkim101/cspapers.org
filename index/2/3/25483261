NoC based SoC FPGAs are a promising technology for high performance embedded systems because they provide a good balance between performance, rapid time to market, cost and flexibility. The reconfigurability aspect of FPGAs allows FPGA platforms to adapt themselves to the various processing requirement of applications. On the other hand, many applications are designed in such a way that their quality level can be adjusted to match the processing capability of hardware platforms. In this paper, we consider the problem of mapping quality adjustable applications onto heterogeneous NoC-based dynamically reconfigurable platforms under resource constraints while ensuring the maximum overall quality of service (QoS) of the applications. The parameters such as resource usage efficiency, processing time, communication overhead and quality of service will be considered in the mapping. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is very flexible and can accommodate more applications than existing solutions on the same platform.
