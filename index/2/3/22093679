Autonomous control of magnetically-actuated miniature robots enables greater versatility and complexity in function but has so far been a challenge to implement. In this paper, we present closed-loop position feedback control of a miniature origami robot utilizing its integrated magnet and an array of Hall effect sensors, enabling the robot's actuation, detection, and locomotion to be initiated from outside its body. An array of 33 Hall effect sensors arranged in repeated triangles cover a range of 60 mm by 75 mm, enabling position detection of the robot with average error of 0.995Â±0.520 mm. The robot's speed response to applied magnetic field was characterized, and a controller was designed to actuate the robot dependably. We demonstrate autonomous movement of the robot along preplanned paths and the viability of magnetic detection and actuation.
