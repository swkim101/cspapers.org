I present algorithms for automated long-term behavior prediction which can recognize when a simulation has run long enough to produce a representative behavior sample, characterize the behavior, and determine whether this behavior will continue forever, or eventually terminate or otherwise change its charader. I have implemented these algorithms in a working program which does longterm behavior prediction for mechanical devices.
