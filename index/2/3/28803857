The performance gap between microprocessors and secondary storage is still a limitation in today's systems. Academia and industry are developing new technologies to overcome this gap, such as improved read-write head technology and higher storage densities. One promising new technology is probe-based storage[1]. Characteristics of probe-based storage include small size, high density, high parallelism, low power consumption, and rectilinear motion. We have created a probe-based storage simulation model, configurable to different design points, and identify its sensitivity to various parameters.
