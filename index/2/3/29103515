Many problems in knowledge acquisition, such as image labeling, still rely on extensive human input and intervention. In order to attract people to invest the necessary time into such tasks, rewarding incentives and motivation mechanisms have been employed. While recruting "human cycles" for such tasks is difficult, online games manage to attract plenty of attention (due to the fact that they provide inherent incentives, such as fun and competition). This workshop focuses on games that embed various knowledge acquisition tasks into the context of online games, with the end goal of attracting the sufficient manual labor.
