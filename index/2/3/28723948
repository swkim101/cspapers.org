The focus of this paper is on the processes that control access to shared resources in concurrent systems. Processes that access a shared resource send access requests to the controller of the shared resource which in turn services requests based on such criteria as the conditions enabling the requests, the fairness specified, etc. In this paper we examine the structure of resource controllers, in particular, we show how resource controllers manifest themselves in Ada. Our prime motivation for this work is to develop schemes by which controllers with complex resource control policies can be implemented using the tasking constructs of Ada. To enable the verification of Ada resource controllers, we provide a temporal semantics for the tasking constructs as well as for the resource controller components.
