In this half-day tutorial, we will introduce the ARTSI "Robotics Roadshow-in-a-Box (RRIB)", a single point resource for those getting started in robotics outreach. The RRIB is a kit which contains robots, software and prepared materials for providing robotics workshops for middle and high school students that focuses on showing computer scientists as problem solvers and not just programmers through activities with a larger context. The RRIB fills a need for materials that are accessible to those who may have limited knowledge of robotics or limited experience in middle school outreach, whether that is undergraduate students or faculty researchers who might have limited outreach experience or preparation time. Laptop Required.
