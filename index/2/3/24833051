In this paper I have attempted to point out some ways in which an instructor can sensitize students to the human-computer interface aspect of programming. By discussing this topic at the introductory level, students are made aware early on both of how important this aspect of programming is and, at the same time, how difficult and time-consuming it is to produce quality interface.
 Most of the suggestions for lecture or discussion presented here can be covered fairly briefly, without taking too much time away from the discussion of the syntax and semantics of the programming language or languages being covered in the course. Just how much time is devoted to the topic of interface is, of course, at the discretion of the instructor. The suggestions for project assignments also require small additions or modifications to the traditional programming assignments. Furthermore, these ideas can be incorporated into more advanced courses. As the students' programming abilities increase and they are able to produce more and more complex code, the dimensions for evaluation of user interface can be broadened.
 None of the foregoing is meant to imply that it would not be desirable to have students take a course specifically devoted to issues in human-computer interface. It would certainly be appropriate for students to pursue this topic in depth, and a special course such as the one outlined by Shneiderman [6], would be excellent. The important goal at the introductory level is to make students aware that user interface is an important aspect of good programming. If they gain this awareness at the outset, it will pervade their thinking so that one does not have to correct their orientation later in the curriculum, or later still, after they begin their professional career.
