Recent advances in the joint processing of images have certainly shown its advantages over the individual processing. Different from the existing works geared towards co-segmentation or co-localization, in this paper, we explore a new joint processing topic: co-skeletonization, which is defined as joint skeleton extraction of common objects in a set of semantically similar images. Object skeletonization in real world images is a challenging problem, because there is no prior knowledge of the objects shape if we consider only a single image. This motivates us to resort to the idea of object co-skeletonization hoping that the commonness prior existing across the similar images may help, just as it does for other joint processing problems such as co-segmentation. Noting that skeleton can provide good scribbles for segmentation, and skeletonization, in turn, needs good segmentation, we propose a coupled framework for co-skeletonization and co-segmentation tasks so that they are well informed by each other, and benefit each other synergistically. Since it is a new problem, we also construct a benchmark dataset for the co-skeletonization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that proposed method achieves very competitive results.
