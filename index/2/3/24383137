Computer Science majors come from various interdisciplinary backgrounds. Some have had programming jobs in industry; others are just normal students following a normal course schedule. Teaching students, with various educational and job backgrounds, presents problems of a technical and a personal nature. Structured programming with its incumbent radicalism is not normal for either group, and is not readily accepted by either group. Both groups view it with suspicion.An instructor's job is to alleviate confusion by showing students how to accomplish this technique. He also has a responsibility to set programming standards and enforce them strictly. In addition, he has the obligation of verifying the readability and maintainability of student programs. The programming classroom shouldn't solely be a problem solving class; it should stress and demand these other aforementioned features.This tutorial will stress technical aspects of structured programming, enforcing standards, verifying readability, and making students realize the importance of deadlines.
