Given a set of points <i>P</i> ⊂ <i>R</i><sup><i>d</i></sup> and value ∊ > 0, an ∊-core-set <i>S</i> ⊂ <i>P</i> has the property that the smallest ball containing <i>S</i> is an ∊-approximation of the smallest ball containing <i>P</i>. This paper shows that any point-set has an ∊-core-set of size [2/∊]. We also give a fast algorithm that finds this core-set. These results imply the existence of small core-sets for solving approximate <i>k</i>-center clustering and related problems. The sizes of these core-sets are considerably smaller than the previously known bounds, and imply faster algorithms; one such algorithm needs <i>O</i>(<i>dn</i>/∊ + (l/∊)<sup>5</sup>) time to compute an ∊-approximate minimum enclosing ball (1-center) of <i>n</i> points in <i>d</i> dimensions. A simple gradient-descent algorithm is also given, for computing the minimum enclosing ball in <i>O</i>(<i>dn</i>/∊<sup>2</sup>) time. This algorithm also implies slightly faster algorithms for computing approximately the smallest radius <i>k</i>-flat fitting a set of points.
