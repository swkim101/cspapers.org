Forming and exploring complex objects is at the heart of a variety of emerging web applications. Historically, existing work on complex objects has been developed in two separate areas: composite item retrieval and team formation. At the same time, emerging applications that harness the wisdom of crowd workers, such as, document editing by workers, sentence translation by fans (or fan-subbing), innovative design, citizen science or journalism, represent complex crowdsourcing, in which an object may represent a complex task formed by a set of sub-tasks or a team of workers who work together to solve the task. The goal of this tutorial is to bridge the gap between composite item retrieval and team formation and define new research directions for complex crowdsourcing applications
