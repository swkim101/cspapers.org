Moving Target Defense(MTD) provides a promising solution to reduce the chance of weakness exposure by constantly changing the target's attack surface. Though lots of MTD technologies have been researched to defend network attacks, there is little systematic study on security assessment of MTD. This paper proposes a novel method to quantify the security of MTD system which based on three factors: Vulnerability Entropy, Attack Entropy and Attenuation Entropy. This assessment model provides a theoretical and practical guidance for building MTD system and improving MTD technology.
