A key challenge for the Chinese educational system is the development of a CS1 course for non-major college students that can meet the unique environment in our country. In mainland China, CS1 is required of all freshmen at their first semester, approximately 7 million freshmen per year. We have named this CS1 course "Fundamentals of University Computer Science" to reflect our ambitions to bring our students to the cutting edge of information technology and society. Over the past few years, many Chinese universities have advanced and experimented with their ideas for introducing computational thinking into CS1, one of the most important core courses. In this BOF session, we want share our ideas and concrete solutions and to engage in dialogue with our international colleagues in order to enrich and improve our approach. This BOF Session is sponsored by the ACM China Subcommittee on Education.
