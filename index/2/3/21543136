Recent industry changes, including multi-core processors, cloud computing, and GPU programming, increase the need to teach parallelism to CS undergraduates. But few CS programs can afford to add new courses or greatly alter syllabi, and the large parallelism body of knowledge relates to many courses. Participants in this BOF will share incremental approaches for adding parallelism to undergraduate CS curricula, where students study parallel computing in brief units. This networking event/ brainstorming session/ swap meet will bring together: " people with sharable parallelism expository readings, hands-on exercises, tech support ideas, etc.; "people wishing to include such materials in their courses; and" people curious about incremental approaches to teaching parallel computing.
