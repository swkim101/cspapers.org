In this paper we introduce the concepts of multi-level machines and of multi-level dynamic programung. These machines are well suited for the difficult continuous speech recognition problem because firstly, they permit the integration of several knowledge sources, secondly, they allow an optimal search based on dynamic programmng and thirdly, they can deal with semantic constraints. Furthermore these semantic constraints have the interesting property to be dynamic, i.e. they can be modified easily by the speech recognition system itself. The important consequence of this property is that the multi-level machines presented in this paper have a potential selfleaminy hability.
