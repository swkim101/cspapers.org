The aim of this research paper is to critically analyze one of the integrated WLAN-cellular network architecture which third generation partnership project (3GPP) has also included in its release 6 i.e. generic access network (GAN) formally called unlicensed mobile access (UMA). This article analyzes the limitations of the above mentioned solution and present an architecture for future heterogeneous networks using a novel hybrid approach of network discovery, where the network will broadcast the updated network information using cell broadcast center (CBC) to the mobile station/user equipment (MS) and the MS may also enquire from the network the additional information regarding the available networks, as opposed to centralized technique used in the existing cellular networks. The proposed solution suggests a network information repository (NIR) embedded in the core network, being populated with information of all the available radio access networks (RANs) in a specific location. The information obtained from NIR will help the MS to identify the network elements ahead of time and communicate with these elements in advance. This will help the MS to fetch the general information about the available networks and select the desired network ahead of time and thus seamless connectivity/ handover will be possible for the end user.
