In the last decades, many measures and metrics have been proposed with the goal of automatically providing quantitative rather than qualitative indications over researchers' academic productions. However, when evaluating a researcher, most of the commonly-applied measures do not consider one of the key aspect of every research work: the collaborations among researchers and, more specifically, the impact that each co-author has on the scientific production of another. In fact, in an evaluation process, some co-authored works can unconditionally favor researchers working in competitive research environments surrounded by experts able to lead high-quality research projects, where state-of-the-art measures usually fail in trying to distinguish co-authors from their pure publication history. In the light of this, instead of focusing on a pure quantitative/qualitative evaluation of curricula, we propose a novel temporal model for formalizing and estimating the dependence of a researcher on individual collaborations, over time, in surrounding communities. We then implemented and evaluated our model with a set of experiments on real case scenarios and through an extensive user study.
