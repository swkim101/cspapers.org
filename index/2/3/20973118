We present a novel force-limitation algorithm to protect fragile robot actuation and transmission systems (like tendon-driven systems) from early wear-out. Inspired by human muscle fatigue, we model artificial actuator fatigue by integrating applied forces over time, gradually limiting applicable forces when fatigue increases. The algorithm is applied to protect from long-term tendon wear-out on our Shadow Dexterous Hands as well as to restrict grasping forces for compliant grasping in unknown environments. In grasping experiments the efficiency of various grasp-force limitation approaches are compared to each other, including one exploiting tactile-based slip detection.
