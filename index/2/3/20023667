This paper describes a transportable natural language interface to databases, augmented with a knowledge base and inference techniques. The inference mechanism, based on a classical expert system's type of approach, allows, when needed, to automatically convert an Input query into another one which is "semantically close". According to RESEDAS theory, "semantically close" means that the answer to the transformed query Implies what could have been the answer to the original question. The presented system Integrates natural language processing, expert system and knowledge representation technology to provide a cooperative database access.
