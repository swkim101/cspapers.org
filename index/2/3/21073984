Thin-film transistor (TFT) circuits are important for flexible electronics which are promising in the area of wearable devices. However, most TFT technologies only have unipolar devices and the process variation and defective rate are relatively high, which impose challenges to TFT circuit design. In this paper, we propose a novel logic array based on pseudo-CMOS logic to address the problem of unipolar TFT circuit design. A multi-layer interconnect architecture and wire routing methodology are presented to improve the routability and meanwhile the area efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed logic array reduces more than 80% area compared with transistor level scheme.
