The flexibility and expressiveness of eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) allows the specification of a wide range of policies in different access control models. However, XACML policies are often verbose and, thus, prone to errors. Several tools have been developed to assist policy authors for the verification and analysis of policies, but most of them are limited in the types of analysis they can perform. In particular, they are not able to reason about predicates of non-boolean variables and, even if they do, they do it inefficiently. In this paper, we present the X2S framework, a formal framework for the analysis of XACML policies that employs Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) as the underlying reasoning mechanism. The use of SMT not only allows more fine-grained analysis of policies, but it also improves the performance of policy analysis significantly.
