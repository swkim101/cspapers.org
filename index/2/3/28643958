The use of semantics and semantic technologies for search and retrieval has attracted interests both from academia and industry in recent years. What is now commonly known as Semantic Search is in fact a broad field encompassing ideas and concepts from different areas, including Information Retrieval, Semantic Web and database. This is the fourth edition of the Semantic Search workshop which aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from various communities, to provide a forum for dissemination, discussion, and for the exchange and transfer of knowledge related to the use of semantics for search and retrieval. This year's workshop will continue to push and promote efforts towards an evaluation benchmark for Semantic Search systems.
