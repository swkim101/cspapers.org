This workshop provides participants with hands-on approaches to teaching common algorithms in an AP Computer Science A context, but common in CS1 in general. Teachers will explore strategies for teaching students: how to introduce commonly used algorithms to students; how to have students problem solve using hands-on techniques; how to determine which algorithm to use provided a program specification; write and modify the algorithm; and interpret the result of an algorithm. Together, participants will be looking at the commonly taught and assessed algorithms in first semester computing courses, especially those found on the AP Computer Science A assessment. A set of example free response questions from the AP Computer Science A assessment will be examined to identify how these algorithms are used and modified in solutions.
