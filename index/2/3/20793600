The JRockit Java virtual machine has a built-in capability to produce recordings of the runtime behaviour of an application environment. It is a light-weight system with a very low performance cost, which can give valuable insights as to how the JVM and application interact in production. The JRockit Runtime Analyzer (JRA) is a tool for analyzing these recordings by graphic visualization.
