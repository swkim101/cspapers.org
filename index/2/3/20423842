Why is change in academia so difficult? What risks and pitfalls await? How can we approach change so that it does not depend solely on our efforts or end when we are no longer there to maintain it? In this collaborative, interactive workshop, we will explore these questions and craft strategies to create sustainable change in computing curricula. This workshop is for those who want to create curricular change in their home departments, catalyze interdisciplinary curricula, or otherwise inspire innovation in teaching and learning at a scale that goes beyond a single classroom. Prereading (available online) will be expected. The workshop will end with the creation of concrete action plans. Laptop optional.
