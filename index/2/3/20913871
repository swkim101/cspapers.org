We present our experiences evaluating the power-performance tradeoffs of a sensornet network protocol on a power-aware testbed. We characterize the power draw of the entire network while running the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP), as a function of low-power-listening interval. We find that message transmission counts are poor predictors for energy consumption on the CC2420 radio, that CTP routinely creates energy hotspots in the routing tree, and that conclusions based on protocol evaluation performed without low-power listening enabled provide little insight about the same protocol performance using low-power listening.
