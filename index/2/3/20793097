Requests from local industries led to the need for new curricula in Computer Science at the University of South Carolina at Spartanburg. The faculty discovered that the body of courses outlined in Curriculum 78 could be manipulated into alternative curricula, while leaving the standard ACM major intact. Indeed, the ACM curriculum includes exactly half of the “technical” courses required in the DPMA Model Curriculum. Thus, by using Curriculum 78 as a base, it is possible to implement a number of specialized degree programs without creating new courses and adding the new faculty required to teach them.
