When debugging programs, we often assume the debugger itself is correct. However, when it is not, it becomes hard to find bugs or lets developers search for bugs that are not even present. We thus propose a new approach to automatic testing of debuggers, inspired by differential testing of compilers. Our approach generates debugger actions to exercise the debugger and records a trace during the debugging session. By comparing traces of different debuggers against each other, we find deviating behavior and bugs. We evaluate our approach on the JavaScript debuggers of Firefox and Chromium and find 16 previously unreported bugs, four of which are already confirmed and fixed.
