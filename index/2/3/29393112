In conjunction with an earlier paper, this step toward machine design based on the structure of nested-declaration pure-procedure multiple-activity algorithms describes: the declaration, flow-of-control, and some data-addressing mechanisms of such algorithms; the dynamic Saguaro-Garden data-access-providing structure of their Records of Execution ; and implementation in a segmented environment.
