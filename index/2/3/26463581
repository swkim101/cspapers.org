The strategy recognizes that social scientists have exceptional educational needs and unfavorable budgetary constraints. A series of workshops is proposed to reduce curriculum redundancy and avoid the costly "on demand" mode of consultation that has developed in most computer centers. An example of a workshop is provided.
