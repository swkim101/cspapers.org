Software-defined radio (SDR) is a self-contained, embedded software system with hardware components and real-time constraints. SDR is the basis for many of today's wireless communications systems. Because SDR combines basic digital signal processing, circuitry, and software elements, it is the perfect project for multi-disciplinary, undergraduate teams. This paper explains both the SDR system created by computer science and engineering undergraduates at Grove City College and how SDR projects can help undergraduates acquire the skills to succeed on multidisciplinary teams.
