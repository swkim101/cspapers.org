This paper describes the current status of the PSI program synthesis system. It allows program specification dialogues using natural language, traces and examples from which a high-level program model is acquired. This model is then refined into an efficient implementation of the program. PSI consists of several modules including a parser-interpreter, trace and examples inference expert, dialogue moderator, program model builder, coder and efficiency expert.
