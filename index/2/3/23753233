Tools to support and improve the learning and teaching of programming have been developed, used and researched for many years. Yet, sometimes it seems we are still faced with exactly the same problems we were trying to tackle a decade ago, or two decades ago.
 In this talk I will look back on educational software tools, through very subjective blinkers, and present a highly personal slice of the history of some of these efforts. This is followed by an attempt to speculate about the future. Where my crystal balls fail me, I will simply stipulate wishes, requirements and challenges always much easier than presenting facts. Overall, I hope that some current trends in educational software tools emerge.
