The best structure for a first course in software engineering is unclear. First, because what should be taught has not been firmly established to the general satisfaction of those involved. Second, providing a realistic environment to motivate belief in the utility of the practices involved is difficult.
 A strategy which provides the motivation to understand and develop the tools of software engineering is presented. The strategy also effectively requires a form of peer review. The motivating mechanism is the “sale” of software modules between class participants.
