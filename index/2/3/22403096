Computer security deals with the managerial procedures and technological safeguards applied to computer hardware, software, and data to assure against accidental or deliberate unauthorized access to and the dissemination of computer system data. Computer privacy, on the other hand, is concerned with the moral and legal requirements to protect data from unauthorized access and dissemination. The issues involved in computer privacy are therefore political decisions regarding who may have access to what and who may disseminate what, whereas the issues involved in computer security are procedures and safeguards for enforcing the privacy decisions. The motivations for security and privacy can be found in the desire for secrecy in military affairs, for nondisclosure in industrial applications, and for information-sharing in modern society. These motivations have become particularly acute where computers are used since computers play a major and important role in processing and storing of information. This paper discusses computer privacy and data security. Other issues such as operational security, physical security, hardware security, and operating system security are discussed in [1,2,3] and will not be included here.
