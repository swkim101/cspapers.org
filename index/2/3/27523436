While previous work suggests that multiple goals can be addressed by a nominal expression, there is no systematic work describing what goals in addition to identification might be relevant and how speakers can use nominal expressions to achieve them. In this paper, we first hypothesize a number of communicative goals that could be addressed by nominal expressions in task-oriented dialogues. We then describe the intentional influences model for nominal expression generation that attempts to simultaneously address the identification goal and these additional goals with a single nominal expression. Our evaluation results show that the intentional influences model fits the nominal expressions in the COCONUT corpus as well as previous accounts that focus solely on the identification goal.
