Evaluating the impact of an article is a significant topic and has attracted extensive attention. Citation-based assessment methods currently face a limitation, i.e. the anomalous citations patterns still remain poorly understand. To remedy this drawback, we propose a Positive and Negative Conflict of Interest (COI)-based Rank algorithm, named PNCOIRank, to acquire positive COI, negative COI, positive suspected COI and negative suspected COI relationships. We investigate the citation relationships by the following scholarly factors: citing times, the interval of citing time, collaboration times, the interval of collaboration time, and team of citing authors with the purpose of weakening the COI relationships in citation network. A weighted PageRank is finally constructed and employed, with HITS algorithm to assess the impact of articles. Through experiments on American Physical Society (APS) dataset, we show that PNCOIRank significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of recommendation intensity.
