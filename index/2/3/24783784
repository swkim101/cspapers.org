Optical Multi-Input and Multi-Output (O-MIMO) is considered as an effective solution in order to achieve high performance for Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems. However, O-MIMO systems are faced with the impact of Inter-Channel Interference (ICI) which results in system performance decrease. In this paper, a novel Index-based Optical Spatial Modulation (IOSM) is proposed to remove ICI and increase spectrum efficiency for indoor VLC systems applying O-MIMO. In our proposed scheme, the signals are DC biased for intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) and a Maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder decision to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. Computer simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms previously proposed spatial modulation schemes in O-MIMO systems.
