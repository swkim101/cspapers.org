The toroidal microcavity laser based on high-concentration erbium-doped silica-alumina glasses, which was developed by molten method using CO2-laser beam, is presented in detail. Average erbium ion concentrations were in the range from 2500 to 3000 ppm and an output lasing power as high as -5.0 dBm is obtained from toroidal microcavities with equatorial diameters in the range 90-140 mum. The advantages of toroidal cavity are followings: Q-factor of the cavity is increasing in comparison with spherical cavity and number of whispering-gallery modes (WGM) is decreased. Controlling lasing wavelength and number of lasing mode was possible by changing the distance between the tapered optical fiber and the toroidal cavity. The very narrow line-width of laser spectra may be useful for photonic sensor.
