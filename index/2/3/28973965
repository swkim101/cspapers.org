Approximately 10% of computer science and engineering majors have a disability of some kind. Those with disabilities are more likely to drop out of the major than those without disabilities. This BOF will bring together those who are interested in improving the success of these students. Strategies will be shared among the participants of the BOF to help each other do a better job of including these students in our classes and research projects.
