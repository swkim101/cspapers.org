The ability to design logic produce will continue to lag the ability to produce them until design tools emerge from the stone age. IC process technology has evolved with suprising predictability over the last decade, and probably will continue to do so. How will we practically design logic circuits at the mega-transistor level? Or will Cartesian logic be our only recource?
