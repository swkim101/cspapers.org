However, their accuracy degrades significantly for partial-to-partial matching due to the lack of minutiae. Optical fingerprint sensor can capture very high-resolution fingerprints (2000dpi) with rich details as pores, scars, etc. These details can cover the shortage of minutiae insufficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel matching algorithm for such fingerprints, namely Deep Joint KNN-Triplet Embedding, by making good use of these subtle features. Our model employs a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with a well-designed joint loss to project raw fingerprint images into an Euclidean space. Then we can use L2-distance to measure the similarity of two fingerprints. Experiments indicate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.
