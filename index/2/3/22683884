Six-degree of freedom (DOF) inertial measurement units (IMUs) are widely used for attitude estimation. However, such systems' accuracy is limited by the accuracy of calibration of bias, scale factors, and non-orthogonality of sensor measurements. This paper reports a stable adaptive estimator of measurement bias in six-DOF IMUs and preliminary simulation results employing a commercially available IMU comprising a 3-axis fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) with a 3-axis micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer. A stability proof of the adaptive estimator and preliminary numerical simulation results are reported. The simulation results for a rotating IMU configuration are promising, and further experimental evaluation and extension of the algorithm for the case of a translating IMU configuration typically found on moving robotic vehicles are needed.
