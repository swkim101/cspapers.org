The Java language, in less than a year, has caused an explosion of interest in the commercial and academic communities. Many universities have already introduced Java into their undergraduate curriculum and many more are planning to do so, or are considering the possibility. The rate at which this has happened is virtually unprecedented and the underlying reasons have not been clearly expounded. This seminar will draw on the attendees experience and knowledge in order to attempt to clarity the reasons for the academic (and commercial) interest in Java and subsequently to explore its suitability for various areas of the C.S. Curriculum.
