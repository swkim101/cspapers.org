However, there exists two major bottlenecks: (1) directly learning discrete hashing codes is an NP-hardoptimization problem; (2) the complexity of both storage and computational time to build a graph with n data points is O(n2). To address these two problems, in this paper, we propose a novel yetsimple supervised graph based hashing method, asymmetric discrete graph hashing, by preserving the asymmetric discrete constraint and building an asymmetric affinity matrix to learn compact binary codes.Specifically, we utilize two different instead of identical discrete matrices to better preserve the similarity of the graph with short binary codes. We generate the asymmetric affinity matrix using m (m << n) selected anchors to approximate the similarity among all training data so that computational time and storage requirement can be significantly improved. In addition, the proposed method jointly learns discrete binary codes and a low-dimensional projection matrix to further improve the retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments on three benchmark large-scale databases demonstrate its superior performance over the recent state of the arts with lower training time costs.
