In this paper, we establish criteria for the optimality of routing and flow control solutions. More precisely, we investigate the convexity of the network delay function in closed queueing networks and show it exists in single chain networks. Then we derive the derivative of the network delay function with respect to relative throughput and show it can be easily obtained from the MVA algorithm. Finally, we propose a closed-network version of the FD algorithm to find the exact optimal routing solution in single chain closed queueing networks. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of the optimization algorithm.
