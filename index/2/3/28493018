Hyperlink analysis has been widely investigated to support the retrieval of Web documents in Internet search engines. It has been proven that the hyperlink analysis significantly improves the relevance of the search results and these techniques have been adopted in many commercial search engines, e.g. Google. However, hyperlink analysis is mostly utilized in the ranking mechanism of Web pages only but not including other multimedia objects, such as images and video. In this project, we propose a modified Multimedia PageRank algorithm to support the searching of multimedia objects in the Web.
