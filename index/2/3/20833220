This workshop introduces participants to an informal writing process that promotes student engagement and critical thinking with easily-assessed, low-stakes assignments. Unlike the formal writing typically used in software development or capstone courses to demonstrate knowledge, informal writing supports student learning (i.e., writing as thinking). Participants will use the Prioritize, Translate, and Analogize (PTA) Process in a model assignment; discuss how it works; and use it to develop a writing assignment. Participants will receive materials for the workshop assignment, samples of prompts employing the PTA process in a variety of courses, and other support materials. Participants are encouraged to bring an assignment idea to develop at the workshop. The workshop is intended for computer science instructors who want to learn about strategies for integrating writing in their courses to engage students and improve their critical thinking while limiting time for instruction and evaluation. No laptop is required.
