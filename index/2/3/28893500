Self-folding is capable of forming complex three-dimensional structures from planar sheets. However, existing self-folding machines cannot generate large forces or bear high loads. In contrast, traditional robots are expected to operate under large loads but these robots are generally dense, resulting in heavy machines with relatively low strength-to-weight ratios. In this paper, we present a new self-folding technique that is meter-scale and load-bearing. We demonstrate the design and fabrication of both structural beams and pneumatically actuated joints. We model and measure the stiffness and strength of self-folded structural beams. Finally, we integrate these results into a robotic arm that weighs 0.3 kg and can lift up to 1.0 kg. These results indicate that functional, load-bearing, self-folding robots are possible.
