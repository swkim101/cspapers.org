In recent years, as network information technology has increasingly advanced, there is a growing trend of people using electronic devices. With the rise of social network services (SNSs), people are using SNSs more frequently, SNSs have gradually replaced many traditional methods of contacting, such as sending e-mails, typing text messages, or chatting on the phone. However, current commercially-available SNSs pair strangers randomly and they are unable to conduct further understandings on particular subjects. In order to solve this problem, this study introduces the small-world phenomenon and the concept of network density to implement "Want You" SNS, this system can calculate on how many people it takes to get to know the stranger one would like to know, and presents the calculated results to the user. Moreover, our questionnaire administered to participants of the study found that Want You is a fairly useful SNS for the public, as it allows users to see the correlations between strangers in social networks and increases the success rate of meeting strangers through correlations to expand interpersonal relationships.
