Learning from positive and unlabeled data frequently occurs in applications where only a sub-set of positive instances is available while the rest of the data are unlabeled. In such scenarios, often the goal is to create a discriminant model that can accurately classify both positive and negative data by modelling from labeled and unlabeled instances. In this study, we propose an adaptive sampling (AdaSampling) approach that utilises prediction probabilities from a model to iteratively up-date the training data. Starting with equal prior probabilities for all unlabeled data, our method “wraps” around a predictive model to iteratively update these probabilities to distinguish positive and negative instances in unlabeled data. Subse-quently, one or more robust negative set(s) can be drawn from unlabeled data, according to the likelihood of each instance being negative, to train a single classiﬁcation model or ensemble of models.
