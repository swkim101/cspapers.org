Pex4Fun (pexforfun.com) is a web-based serious gaming environment for teaching computing at many levels, from high school all the way through graduate courses. Unique to the Pex4Fun experience is a cloud-based program evaluation engine based on dynamic symbolic execution and SMT-solving, which provides customized feedback to the student and automated grading for the teacher. Thus, Pex4Fun connects teachers, curriculum authors, and students in a social experience, tracking and streaming progress updates in real time. In particular, Pex4Fun finds interesting and unexpected input values that help students understand what their code is actually doing. The real fun starts with coding duels where students write code to implement a teacher's specification. Pex4Fun finds any discrepancies in behavior between the student's code and the specification. Then based on the reported discrepancies, the student improves his or her code towards the specification. Pex4Fun can be used to develop interesting, engaging, and demanding class materials on mathematics, algorithms, programming languages, or problem solving in general. A teacher can use an integrated wiki to author these class materials for students to work through. This workshop involves creating and teaching course materials at Pex4Fun. Participants should bring a laptop computer. The intended audience includes all levels of CS educators who are interested in integrating educational technology in their teaching environments.
