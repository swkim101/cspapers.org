The problematic is to study the management of a hybrid energy system, depending on demand, dedicated to self-governing houses. Energy can be supplied by a photovoltaic panel, a wind turbine and a diesel generator and it can be stored in batteries. The study of this type of systems requires a good control strategy and an effective management. The main objective of this study is to develop a reliable management model and to simulate the hybrid system of a house located in MonastirTunisia, with different domestic loads, such as a washing machine, freezer, refrigeratorâ€¦ A system of energy management that can adjust, optimize and adapt the consumption to the available energy resources while satisfying the request is then examined. Thus, to study the problem of energy management and reduce energy consumption and production of greenhouse gases, the definition off an analysis tool on MATLAB/SIMULINK has allowed the covering of load demand in an optimized manner using the optimal system chosen by HOMER.
