The research described here is aimed at unresolved problems in both natural language generation and natural language interfaces to database systems. How relevant information is selected and then organized for the generation of responses to questions about database structure is examined. Due to limited space, this paper reports on only one method of explanation, called "compare and contrast". In particular, it describes a specific constraint on relevancy and organization that can be used for this response type.
