The Teaching Artificial Intelligence as a Laboratory Science (TAILS) project is designed to develop a new paradigm for teaching introductory artificial intelligence (AI) concepts by implementing an experimental approach modeled after the lab sciences. In the Basic and Informed Search module of TAILS students learn about various search algorithms by first observing how each algorithm searches a map, watching the construction of the corresponding search tree as the path planning proceeds. Once students understand the differences between algorithms, they proceed to exercises. Students are provided a version of the program with the search algorithm replaced by a comment that guides the students through the process of implementing each algorithm and testing it with the existing application. This enables the students to focus on the AI aspect of the coding without requiring them to also develop the user interface. This poster describes the search module and assessments and presents preliminary results.
