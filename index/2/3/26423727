Good oral communication skills are essential for success in the workplace. Burge [3] recently highlighted the need to create a curriculum-wide program emphasizing communication skills. We have implemented a curriculum that provides communication skills instruction and practice at each level of the computer science major. Here we present a description of the coursework emphasizing formal presentation and small group communication skills. We also share findings from a survey of alumni showing their perception of communication preparation. Even in our program that provides significant opportunities for communication skill development, the majority of alumni felt that additional instruction should be integrated into the major curriculum.
