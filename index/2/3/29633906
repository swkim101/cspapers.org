We have discovered what we believe is an essential design problem for medical expert systems, that of controlling the amount and the type of information which the system requests from the user. This problem is inherent in medical expert systems because of the nature of the distribution of clinical states and the nature of the training and background of physicians. The problem also exists for human consultants, and a complete and general solution for computer systems is probably not achievable. However, several techniques show promise for reducing the magnitude of the problem in various clinical domains.
