The present paper proposes a new method for color image demosaicing. This method separates luminance from chrominance and allows luminance to be extracted directly from known pixel values. Since interpolation for missing pixels is applied only to chrominance channels, it can reduce artifacts. Moreover, in chrominance channels the proposed method tries to interpolate pixels along edges. As consequence, edges are better preserved in the demosaiced image and false colors, which are a popular problem in demosaicing, are correctly eliminated. Comparisons with other algorithms show satisfying performances of our method in both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Another advantage of the proposed method relates to its low computational complexity, which can facilitate hardware implementation.
