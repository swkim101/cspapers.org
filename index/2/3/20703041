Semantic Web Information Systems (SWIS) are Web Information Systems that use Semantic Web technologies. Hera is a model-driven design methodology for SWIS. In Hera, models are represented in RDFS and model instances in RDF. The Hera Presentation Generator (HPG) is an integrated development environment that supports the presentation generation layer of the Hera methodology. The HPG is based on a pipeline of data transformations driven by different Hera models.
