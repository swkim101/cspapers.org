Recent advances show that robustness is a better measure of solution quality than traditional metrics such as flexibility. This paper introduces the Robust Execution Problem for finding maximally robust dispatch strategies for general probabilistic temporal planning problems. While generally intractable, we introduce approximate solution techniques â€” one that can be computed statically prior to the start of execution with robustness guarantees and one that dynamically adjusts to opportunities and setbacks during execution. We show empirically that our dynamic approach outperforms all known approaches in terms of execution success rate.
