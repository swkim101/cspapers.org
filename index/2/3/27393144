In this paper we propose a method of non-contact stirring. Ultrasonic waves have been studied for various applications. However, devices using ultrasound have been devised only to specialize in one role up to now. In recent years, we aim at generalization of aerial ultrasonic equipment used for various applications such as tactile presentation and super directional speaker, and propose applications closely our real life.
