In this paper, finite element method and factorial analysis were applied to build the empirical model for phase propagation constant of lightwave in defected-core photonic crystal fiber. By combing both methods, we were able to provide complete analysis of phase propagation constant as a function of fiber's structure. The empirical model was also used to optimize a salt solution sensor system using defected-core photonic crystal fiber in term of sensing resolution.
