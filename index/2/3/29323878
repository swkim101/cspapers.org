Spreadsheet systems have changed the way the world perceives and deals with computers. In an attempt at maintaining the positive elements of spreadsheets while overcoming some of their limitations, we have developed FINANZ, a computational environment for developing financial planning systems. FINANZ contains a form-based user interface construction system, which allows the creation of advanced user interfaces without the need for conventional programming. It uses constraint based programming for the representation of knowledge about the application domain. Its layered architecture (based on object-oriented knowledge representation) supports the modification and extension of the system and the dynamic generation of explanations.
