As robots become more pervasive and ubiquitous in the lives of humans, they become increasingly involved in everyday tasks formerly executed by humans. Humans should expect robots to take on tasks to simplify our lives, by working with humans just as other humans do, in normal organizations and societies. This labor specialization allows humans more comfort, time or focus on higher level desires or tasks. To further this unification of relationships, the defined line between humans and other non-humans must become more indistinguishable. This ever increasing degree of indistin-guishability provides we care less about who or what executes a task or solves a goal, as long as that entity is capable and available. In this paper, we propose a model and a simple example implementation which minimizes the strict line between humans, software agents, robots, machines and sensors (HARMS) and reduces the distinguishability between these actors.
