COMPUTER SCIENCE & CHI AT AARHUS UNIVERSITY Empowering Users has been a major topic at the Computer Science Department since the mid seventies, and from then on collaboration with users have played an important role; both in numerous empirical projects and as one of the major themes of our theoretical research. Within the Computer Science Department the people doing this work are the members of The System Work Group. The Department was established around 1970, and its research and teaching covers all major computer science topics. The Department is part of the Natural Science Faculty at Aarhus Universityâ€”but most of our work goes beyond the limits of traditional Natural Science.
