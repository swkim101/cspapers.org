We focus on Cyclostationary spectrum sensing technique in order to increase the spectrum efficiency which will become essential for cognitive radios. Static allocation of the frequency spectrum does not meet the growing demands of current wireless technology that's why spectrum sensing and dynamic allocation will become indispensible part of future wireless networks. Cognitive radio can sense the spectrum and detect the idle frequency bands which are allocated to primary users, if not; secondary users can be allocated unoccupied frequency bands in order to avoid any interference. Our primary goal is to develop efficient way of sensing holes for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems for spectrum sharing regimes. Using Cyclostationary features we are able to detect primary user. Here Cyclostationary features for primary user detection are exploited through AWGN communication channel with various noise levels. We have considered an OFDM system and exploited its parameters to examine how it relates to primary user detection and its detection probability with various different noise levels is calculated.
