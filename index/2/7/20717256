Discrete mathematics lies at the heart of the discipline of computing and represents one of the few bodies of knowledge with consistent content in our young and changing curriculum. We offer a model of a full-year, two-course experience of discrete structures with the initial course taught by computer science faculty and the second course taught by faculty in mathematics. We argue for the strengths gained in multiple and repeated exposure to the rich set of core topics and for the initial course to occur in the first year rather than the traditional advice to "take calculus". In particular, we present a model of collaboration with mathematics faculty that provides computer science students with an enriched breadth and depth of exposure while helping small departments to handle the constraints in scheduling.
