We present a novel class of attacks against capacitive touchscreens, which are common in devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. The attack we named TOUCHFLOOD aims to scatter touch events, alternating the selection of buttons on a screen. The key idea of TOUCHFLOOD is to intentionally cause a malfunction by injecting intentional noise signals from an external source. This paper describes the attack as well as the experimental results that clarify the conditions for successful attacks. The demo videos of the experiments using a smartphone are available at https://goo.gl/56G79e.
