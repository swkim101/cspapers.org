The present report suggests and investigates a model of the two-legs walking. The walking apparatus is simulated by a heavy rigid body sypplied with a pair of multilink legs. The algorithm for solving the problem of the two-legs walkingis composed. A number of the problems on construction of the two-legs walking are solved and analysed within the framework of the suggested algorithm.
