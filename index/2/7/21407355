In this paper, a quadrotor optimal coverage planning approach in damaged area is considered. The quadrotor is assumed to visit a set of reachable points following the shortest path while avoiding the no-fly zones. The problem is solved by using a two-scale proposed algorithm. In the first scale, an efficient tool for cluttered environments based on optimal Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) approach, called multi-RRT∗ Fixed Node (RRT∗FN), is developed to define the shortest paths from each point to their neighbors. Using the pair-wise costs between points provided by the first-scale algorithm, in the second scale, the overall shortest path is obtained by solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Genetic Algorithms (GA). Taking into consideration the limited onboard energy, a second alternative based on the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is used. This latter is solved using the savings heuristic approach. The effectiveness of this proposed two-scale algorithm is demonstrated through numerical simulations and promising results are obtained.
