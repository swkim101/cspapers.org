This paper is concerned with the problem of reliably maintaining synchronization in redundant systems. While many such systems have been built, little work has been done on formalizing their requirements. The terms necessary to quantify the problem and general synchronizer specifications are given. To illustrate their use and point out issues in synchronization, a synchronizer is advanced and three detailed examples of its use are given. These are a single fault tolerant clock and a TMR microcomputer system synchronized first predominately with hardware, then with software.
 Because it was felt a practical paper might be of greater interest than a more theoretical one, only a subcase of the general synchronization problem is solved.
