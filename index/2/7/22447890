The World Health Organization predicts that by the year 2030, depression and other mental illnesses will be the leading disease burden globally. The rapid penetration and advancement of mobile phones and technology have given rise to unprecedented opportunities for close collaboration between computation researchers and mental health practitioners. The intersection between wearable computing, design of naturalistic observation experiments and statistical causal inference offers promising avenues for developing technologies to help those in mental distress; yet human factors inquiry and design are often the missing ingredients in this powerful mix. This second inter-disciplinary workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers in mental health, computation and causal inference to come together under the much needed auspices of human-centric design, towards the development and deployment of new technologies mental health technologies and interventions.
