This paper describes what is probably the largest data base to date for music research, specifi- cally a file of the opening melodies (known as incipits) of Renaissance Italian polyphonic pieces, each assigned a discrete serial number along with Information on composer, title, genre, source, and the researcher's initials. The file is open to all musicologists and is structured to permit additions, changes, or deletions of incipits or whole compositions, from all repertories of Western music, past and present. The music representation (DARMS) used for encoding and entering melodies into the data file is briefly described as well as the special music typography for the line printer unique to this project, which has been developed to print melodies in different arrangements and formats. With this data base and its I/O capabilities, it is possible to print camera-ready copy for book publications as well as maintain a computer file at Binghamton which is accessible to researchers. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of areas needing further research, including the use of interactive display terminals, a network for use by scholars, and mathematical studies of melody as wave form.
