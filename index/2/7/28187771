A model for correct program behavior commonly and often implicitly assumed by programmers is that of sequential consistency, which guarantees that all memory accesses execute atomically and in program order. An alternative programmerâ€™s model, weak ordering, offers greater performance potential, especially for highly parallel shared memory systems. Weak ordering was first defined by Dubois, Scheurich and Briggs in terms of a set of constraints for hardware, which are not necessary for its intuitive goal.
