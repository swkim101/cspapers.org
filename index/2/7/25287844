This paper presents a generalized multi-stage Bayesian approach for an unmanned aerial vehicle to estimate the location of a mobile target. The major hardware components of the proposed approach are a camera with a fisheye lens and another camera with a normal lens and a pan/tilt unit. With wide angle of view (AOV), the fisheye lens camera first detects the bearing of the target, and the PT camera next captures the target in its AOV. The recursive Bayesian estimation steadily locates the target in a globally defined space. The paper also proposes a multi-stage detection method for the fisheye lens camera. The level of confidence is defined in association with the probability of detection (POD) for each detection technique, and the fisheye lens enables continuous detection by gradually increasing the POD. The observation likelihood is finally derived from the POD in a generalized manner. The proposed approach was applied to the detection of a mobile target by a multi-rotor helicopter, and results have demonstrated the effectiveness of both the proposed multi-stage Bayesian approach and multi-stage fisheye lens detection method.
