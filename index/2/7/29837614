The development of a personalized approach to medical care is now well recognized as an urgent priority. This approach is particularly important in oncology, where it is well understood that each cancer diagnosis is unique at the molecular level, arising from a particular and specific collection of genetic alterations. Furthermore, taking a personalized approach to oncology may expedite the treatment process, pre-empting therapeutic decisions based on fewer data in favor of treatments targeted to an individual's tumor. This directed course may be key to survival for many patients who are terminal or have failed standard therapies.
