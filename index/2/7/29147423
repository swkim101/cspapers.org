Presented Is an implemented program understanding system called CAN. CAN relies on a meta-interpretation process which brings to light two new concepts concerning meta-interpretation of recursive programs: vicious circles and constructive induction. These notions express CAN's ability to extract from program code classes of data for which Interpretation of the code would not stop, and in general, to relate classes of data with abstract values and environments.
