Today there is widespread application of digital control circuitry in a wide range of products. This paper describes a simulation system in which the designer of these control circuits can interact with his design ideas before they are implemented in hardware.
 The Digitial Control Simulation System (DCSS) is a digital design description language with a set of programs to generate and execute a simulation program. The main use of this system (with an appropriate hardware interface) is the testing of, and possibly on-line simulation of, the control of a system being designed and constructed.
