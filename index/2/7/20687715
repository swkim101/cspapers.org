In this paper, we study fuzzy dependencies among attributes, between the attributes and methods in a fuzzy object class basing on approximate semantic. Similarly in the precise/fuzzy relational database, we present the definition of fuzzy attribute dependency, fuzzy method dependency and the inferences rules of it on object-oriented database model with fuzzy information and uncertainty.
