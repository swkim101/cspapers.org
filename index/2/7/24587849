Vehicle security has been receiving a lot of attention from both the black hat and white hat community of late. Research in this area has already led to the fabrication of different attacks, of which some have been shown to have potentially grave consequences. Vehicle vendors and original equipment manufacturers (OEM)s are thus presented with the additional responsibility of ensuring in-vehicular communication level security. In this poster paper, we present a framework, which allows any individual to write, test, and store exploit scripts which could then be run by any interested party on in-vehicular networks of commercial vehicles like trucks and buses.
