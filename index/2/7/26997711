This paper presents a detailed background of the simulation and kinematics of 3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Parallel Manipulators (PMs). In this work, the recent literature about the kinematic analysis, kinematic synthesis, workspace, singularity and velocity and acceleration analyses of various kinds of parallel manipulators are reviewed. This survey also focuses on the development of PMs. The various approaches adopted in the kinematic analyses are reviewed and their adoptions in the PMs are discussed. The novel design and analysis perspectives of 3-DOF parallel manipulators in general are recommended
