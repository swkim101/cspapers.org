We summarize the results of our NSF funded exploration of interdisciplinary computing, including the following points: Interdisciplinary computing spans fields as diverse as visual art, music, the humanities and social sciences, health sciences, pure science, engineering, and mathematics. No field of inquiry in the 21st century extends its knowledge without the influence of computing.[1-4]; A bifurcation is occurring: at some institutions this climate of interdisciplinary work is nurtured, while at others it is thwarted by lack of motivation, resource limitations or simple inaccessibility.; Interdisciplinary computing is inherently collaborative between computing specialists and specialists in other fields. It is not merely pair-wise: computational-X or Y-informatics, but often the collaboration draws from a number of fields.; An important question is what is the breadth and depth of knowledge and skill required to engage in this work. Who needs to know what? What is the language of discourse? How is a methodology established and accepted, and how is subsequent work evaluated?; The mundane concerns of intellectual ownership, boundaries on the discipline (e.g. silos), professional advancement, financial support, and institutional buy-in can diminish the pure intellectual joy that is evident in existing interdisciplinary work.; Impediments are encountered in making the effective collaborations that are essential for the advancement of all the disciplines. The computing disciplines are essential to and also dependent on nearly all other branches of intellectual discovery. [5-6]
