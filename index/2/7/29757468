The Institute for Realtime Computer Systems and Robotics of the University of Karlsruhe is currently developing the autonomous mobile assembly robot KAMRO. The system consists of a mobile platform with an omnidirectional wheel drive and a superstructure on which two assembly robots are mounted. The sensor system of KAMRO is divided into three functional parts which support the assembly of a product by two arms, the docking of the vehicle and the autonomous navigation. To solve the three tasks, the use of a multisensor system is necessary, combining cameras, distance, approach and tactile sensors. The concept of elementary operations forms the framework for the integration of the sensors into the control system of the mobile robot. In this paper the sensor data processing and various elementary operations of the autonomous mobile assembly robot are described in more detail.
