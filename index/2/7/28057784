In this paper, we introduce a new two mode division (de) multiplexer with optical properties of broad bandwidth, high mode conversion efficiency that is built on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. By using an asymmetric directional coupler in the form of an MZI structure, mode (de)multiplexer from the fundamental mode TE0 and the firstorder mode TE1 can be achieved by numerically analysis. Performance analysis of the proposed device is carried out numerically. Simulation results by using three dimension beam propagation method (3D-BPM) incorporated with effective index method (EIM) show high performance of the device with operation efficiency larger than 98% (i.e., insertion loss less than 0.1 dB) in the range Â±1 nm around the wavelength of 1550 nm.
