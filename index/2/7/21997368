ISSTA is at its twelfth edition. Also this year, researchers from academy and industry have contributed with many interesting studies and experience reports in software analysis and testing. We --- the ISSTA partakers- have (or at least believe to have) clear ideas about which are the problems to be solved, which are the real challenges, and probably each of us has already settled an agenda of the next steps to take for solving them looking ahead to the next ISSTA edition.Are we doing right? Do we know which are the real issues in the field? Is our research addressing relevant points, or just aesthetic questions? Do, and how much, industrial users ---the ISSTA addressees- value our papers and our achievements?This panel will address such questions by grouping a set of managers from different industries around a table and asking their opinions. As the above questions are very general, in the intent to tackle the theme in a concrete way, we will trigger the discussion by looking at the research results in terms of their potential impact in their respective enterprises. We would like to know which are currently the costs of testing and analysis activities in their industries, which are the items summing up such costs, and how we ISSTA researchers could help improving them.
