This paper discusses a new routing program. The program initially partitions a printed circuit board into regions called saturated zones. These saturated zones are subsequently merged by routing into larger and larger saturated zones until the final combination yields a routing for the entire board. The algorithm gains efficiency and effectiveness from the fact that restricted sets of wires are considered in parallel.
