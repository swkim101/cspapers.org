Machine learning is all about making predictions; language is full of complex rich structure. Structured prediction marries these two. However, structured prediction isnâ€™t always enough: sometimes the world throws even more complex data at us, and we need reinforcement learning techniques. This tutorial is all about the how and the why of structured prediction and inverse reinforcement learning (aka inverse optimal control): participants should walk away comfortable that they could implement many structured prediction and IRL algorithms, and have a sense of which ones might work for which problems.
