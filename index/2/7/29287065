We present a new way to derive dissipative, optimizing dynamics from the Lagrangian formulation of mechanics. It can be used to obtain both standard and novel neural net dynamics for optimization problems. To demonstrate this we derive standard descent dynamics as well as nonstandard variants that introduce a computational attention mechanism.
