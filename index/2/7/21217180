ABSTMCT Most software engineering textbooks advocate hands-on software development experience as an integral part of any effective software engineering course. Research has shown that a majority of the undergraduate software engineering courses being taught include a project component. However, most introducto~ software engineering texts offer little information on how to manage student projects. Specifically, they do not indicate the existence of various organizational alternatives for such project-intensive courses, and, thus, they do not offer comparative analyses of corresponding benefits and costs.
