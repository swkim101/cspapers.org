In this paper, a compact design for bandwidth enhancement of microstrip antenna is present. A basic rectangle microstrip is selected to research. The ground element of the proposed antenna is taken in the form of Defected Ground Structure (DGS). The antenna is based on substance Duroid RO4700JXR and is fed by a feeding microstrip line. The results of a fabricated antenna have an agreement with simulation results with wide bandwidth and good return loss.
