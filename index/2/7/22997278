In this paper, we consider the problem of interference mitigation in GNSS navigation. In this work, we introduce the novel concept of multi-beamforming as our approach to multi-channel receiver design in order to enable dynamic tracking of satellite vehicles within the field of view. Special attention is given to beamwidth control. The receiver is equiped with two stages of operation. In the first stage, the beamwidth is widen for searching satellites while interference sources are suppressed. In the second stage, multiple-beam scheme is used to track satellites for the robustness of the system under interference environment. The characteristics of the proposed system model is demonstrated using computer simulations.
