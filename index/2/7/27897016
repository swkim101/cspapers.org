We developed a smartphone-based monitoring system to allay the anxiety of elderly people and that of their relatives, friends and caregivers by unobtrusively monitoring an elderly person's activities of daily living. A smartphone of the elderly person continuously recognizes indoor-outdoor activities by using only built-in sensors and uploads the activity log to a web server. By accessing the server, relatives etc. at remote locations can browse the log to make sure the elderly person is safe and sound. We conducted an evaluation experiment and confirmed that the proposed system had practical recognition accuracy and satisfied the users' needs.
