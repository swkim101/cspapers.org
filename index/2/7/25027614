Software m-engineering consists of enabling the migration, modification and/or documentation of existing software regardless of the state of the software and of its documentation. Typically, the software to be reengineered implements functionality that is of critical importance but was implemented a long time ago using outdated technology. It contains dead code, redundancies, inconsistencies, and its structure has been obscured by years of patching. It is unreliably documented and hard to maintain because of its brittleness, the difficulty in finding people willing to maintain it, and the fact that no one is left with an understanding of the whole system.
