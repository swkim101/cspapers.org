Forward-chaining productions have been used to implement some of the most significant expert systems. However, most forward chaining production languages make no provision for dealing with lexical imprecision. This paper briefly presents a language which supports fuzzy matching between condition patterns and facts in working memory. Then discussion is focussed on what part should be played in conflict resolution by the relative truth-values of fuzzily matched production instantiations.
