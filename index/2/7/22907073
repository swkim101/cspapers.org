In this paper, we propose an effective design and implementation of a versatile embedded multimedia live streaming decoder system based on TI's DM814x processor, which can not only decode video live streams of various video codecs(H.264, MPEG-4, etc.), audio live streams of various audio codecs(AAC, MP3, G.711, etc.), but also demultiplex (demux) MPEG-2 TS, decode video stream and audio streams inside, all streams carried over RTP after the stream servers are contacted by RTSP URLs. Those decoded live raw streams are displayed out through the attached HDMI, HD-SDI, NTSC, and line-out interface of the embedded decoder. The S/W architecture, protocol handling and buffer management of the proposed embedded decoder system are studied carefully and explained here in some detail. Currently, our implementation is observed to work properly. However, synchronization among video, audio, and associated (meta) data at the decoding and displaying are not precisely achieved and still are under development, whose results will be reported later.
