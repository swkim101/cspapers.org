The unified approach algorithm to control a mobile robot is useful in simplifying path planning and inverse kinematics by considering a mobile platform as hypothetical joints. Applying the damped least square method by using the Jacobian prevents the divergence of the joint angle. However, it is possible to violate the nonholonomic constraint on mobility by distorting the Jacobian. In robot manipulation, the end-effector position error due to a violation of the constraint can be fatal, because such an error can damage a nearby object or the robot itself. In this paper, we propose a method that strictly guarantees nonholonomic constraints on a mobile manipulator. We also propose a compensation technique for faster convergence of the position and orientation of the end effector. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was confirmed through simulations.
