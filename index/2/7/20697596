Highly dynamic vehicular networks use long-range radio technologies such as DSRC, WiMAX, and Cellular networks to maintain connectivity. Multipath TCP offers the possibility to combine these radio technologies to improve network performance, allow robust handoffs, and maintain vehicle connectivity at all times. The proliferation of mobile devices with dual interfaces and the manufacturers' interest to make their vehicles smarter and more competitive create the ideal scenario for MPTCP on VANETs. In this paper, we study the performance of MPTCP on two VANET scenarios: Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Vehicle, (V2V) under distinct velocities.
