Connectivity is at the heart of the future Internet-of-Things (IoT) infrastructure, which can control and communicate with remote sensors and actuators for the beacons, data collections, and forwarding nodes. Existing sensor network solutions cannot solve the bottleneck problems near the sink node; the tree-based Internet architecture has the single point of failure. To solve current deficiencies in multi-hop mesh network and cross-domain network design, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed "edge router" incorporates these two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both high-throughput Internet and resilient sensor coverage throughout the community.
