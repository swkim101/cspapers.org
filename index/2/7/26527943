Notwithstanding the latest buzzwords (grid, cloud, utility computing, SaaS, etc.), large-scale computing and cloud-like deployment are the fastest growing computing infrastructures today. How exactly they will look like tomorrow is still for the markets to decide, yet one thing has already been identified: clouds have new, untested deployment, associated adversarial models and vulnerabilities and hence a very different threat landscape. It is essential that our community becomes involved in shaping the future security of cloud computing. The CCSW workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in all security and privacy aspects of cloud-centric and outsourced computing.
