The proliferation of on-line courses and the continued emphasis on student team projects in both on-line and oncampus courses demands that faculty use tools to manage the courses and teams both efficiently and effectively. Students often comment that their team experience is usually not a pleasant one. If students are going to be required to be on a project team then the team assignment should be set up as a project and managed accordingly. On-line student teams are even more challenging in that often times the team members never actually meet face-toface and have little if any personal interaction with the faculty member. It becomes imperative that faculty members have set up an infrastructure to support the monitoring of these on-line team projects as well as the overall course requirements.
