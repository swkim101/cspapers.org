The IEEE/CS/DASS Electronic Model Working Group (EMG) is using data modeling methodologies to analyze the interoperability of existing exchange formats for electronic product data. The operational philosophy of the EMG is that a conceptual schema for shared product data can serve as a meta-language and foundation for CAE/CAD/CIM data integration.
