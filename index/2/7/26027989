Experience using and implementing the language Poplar is described. The major conclusions are: Applicative programming can be made more natural through the use of built-in iterative operators and post-fix notation. Clever evaluation strategies, such as lazy evaluation, can make applicative programming more computationally efficient. Pattern matching can be performed in an applicative framework. Many problems remain.
