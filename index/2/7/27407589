Neurophysiological architecture using 3D integration technology offers a high device interconnection density as well as fast and energy efficient links among the neuron and synapses layers. In this paper, we propose to reconfigure the Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) to serve as the neuronal membrane capacitors that map the membrane electrical activities in a hybrid 3D neuromorphic system. We also investigate new methodology that could significantly enhance the TSV capacitance to achieve a high efficiency of signal processing through membrane. An optimal CAD framework is designed to optimally utilize such TSV devices, and resolve the signal-integrity issues arising at fast data rates during massively parallel data transmissions. The electrical performance of the 3D neuromorphic chip is compared against the ones of the 2D counterpart design to demonstrate the advantages of our design and methodology.
