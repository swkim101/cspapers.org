Service-learning enables computer science and engineering students to apply and refine their technical skills, learn new soft skills, and make a contribution to their community. At the University of South Florida we have organized a group of computer science and engineering students, called the CSE Volunteers, to provide IT support to the Hillsborough County School District. In spring 2005 over 7% of our undergraduate students voluntarily served in this program. While the work is fairly low-level, the experience for the students and school district has been very positive. Future directions include quantitative assessment, tackling projects of greater complexity, seeking corporate funding, and applying this program to help recruit new students to the major.
