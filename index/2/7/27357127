Progress of microelectronics, DSP, integrated sensors and RF CMOS causes a paradigm shift in the ICT world referred to as the “post-PC” era when wearable computing augments our consciousness, protects our health and globally connects people and things. Designing such systems differs radically from designing CPU architectures. The art will be to design a diversity of cheap, energy efficient, yet programmable platforms that can be configured over the Internet and communicate with humans through non-keyboard interfaces. It requires a grand convergence of previously separated domains such as programmable/reconfigurable multi-processor architectures with embedded software, broadband radio, MEMS and biosensor interfaces. We’ll discuss challenges to design technology and to the skills of future system engineers as well as to their education.
