Quadrotors that navigate through unknown, cluttered environments have only recently begun to emerge following the development of small form-factor sensing and computing hardware and computationally efficient collision avoidance algorithms. Computation time of planning algorithms has significantly decreased in part to using local information as opposed to using a global map for collision avoidance. Safe planning with local information, however, restricts the direction of travel to remain within the perception system's field-of-view (FOV). The vehicle's motion becomes more constrained with body-mounted narrow FOV sensors, reducing vehicle maneuverability and speed. This work presents a relaxed-constraint Model Predictive Control framework that allows motions outside the perception FOV with guaranteed safety. The key aspect of this approach is the ability to safely choose a motion primitive generated in the past. Simulation and hardware results shows the new framework improves time to goal and flight path efficiency in environments with varying levels of clutter.
