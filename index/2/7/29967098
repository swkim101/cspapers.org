Sub-half-micron process technologies are creating a fundamentalshift in the problems faced by IC designers andfabricators.As geometries shrink, signal integrity (SI)and noise play a critical role in determining IC performance.Without accurate interconnect data and detailednoise analysis tools, designers cannot assess the quality oftheir designs and/or new processes.This panel will offer designers an opportunity to understandthe complex analysis and design issues that surroundthe noise and signal integrity problem.
