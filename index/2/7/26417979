Alumni connect an institution to the world beyond its doors. Alumni can help students in many ways, from providing new perspectives on core computer science concepts to providing opportunities for work and experiential learning. Students can envision themselves following in alumni footsteps, and many alumni are eager to help students with whom they share an alma mater. Some computer science departments benefit from having their alumni nearby, while others—especially those far away from concentrations of computing and information technology businesses—must find ways to engage alumni from afar.
