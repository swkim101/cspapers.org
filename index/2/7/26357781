This paper presents an anticipative robot kinematic limitation avoidance algorithm for collaborative robots. The main objective is to improve the performance and the intuitivity of physical human-robot interaction. Currently, in such interactions, the human user must focus on the task as well as on the robot configuration. Indeed, the user must pay a close attention to the robot in order to avoid limitations such as joint position limitations, singularities and collisions with the environment. The proposed anticipative algorithm aims at relieving the human user from having to deal with such limitations by automatically avoiding them while considering the user's intentions. The framework developed to manage several limitations occurring simultaneously in three-dimensional space is first presented. The algorithm is then presented and detailed for each individual limitation of a spatial RRR serial robot. Finally, experiments are performed in order to assess the performance of the algorithm.
