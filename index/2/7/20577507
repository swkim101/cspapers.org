A framework for the support of temporal data is developed. The concept of a time sequence is introduced and shown to be an important fundamental concept for representing the semantics of temporal data and for efficient physical organization. The properties of time sequences that allow the treatment of such sequences in a uniform fashion are discussed. These properties are exploited in order to design efficient physical data structures and access methods for time sequences. Operations over time sequences are described and their power to manipulate temporal data are shown. 11 refs., 4 figs.
