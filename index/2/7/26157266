In the past few years there have been significant advances in both the computational and graphics capabilities of micro-computers. In graphics the standard (for the IBM compatible world) has advanced from the Computer Graphics Adapter (CGA) through the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) to the present Video Graphics Array (VGA). With the multiple color capability of the VGA, images can be constructed which use graphics shading algorithms. This allows us to teach more advanced concepts in introductory courses and even to teach some topics in advanced courses using these machines. In this paper I will discuss how these hardware improvements have allowed for changes in our introductory graphics course and also our experience in teaching an advanced course using these machines.
