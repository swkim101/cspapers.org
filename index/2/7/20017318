Foreign Objects and Debris (FODs) must be removed from runways. Under the necessity of automatic continuous survey, we are investigating a new FOD detection system based on MilliMeter Wave (MMW) radar system connected by Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) lines. This RoF radar project is also interested in beam steering antennas such as phased array antennas. This paper describes a concept of a diode grid reflector antenna. We also introduce a phase evaluation system to measure the phase of reflected wave from the circuit boards in W band. The validity of the system is confirmed to compare between simulation and measurement. Moreover, we measured diode test boards to change the phase of reflected wave. As a result, we find that it is possible to change the reflection phase using switching diodes.
