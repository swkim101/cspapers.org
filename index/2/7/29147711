A robot assistive device is presented aimed for training and evaluation of standing-up in impaired people. The robot device is designed as a 3 DOF mechanism supporting the subject under the buttocks. The device is driven by an electrohydraulic servosystem capable to operate in a position or in force control mode. The evaluation of the standing-up assistive device was accomplished in rising trials of a paraplegic subject. In the experiments the position control approach was employed. The results proved that the device can be efficiently used for training and evaluation of standing-up maneuver. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed which generates the reference value of the man/machine interaction force to be tracked by the robot force controller. The simulation results proved an adequate and robust performance. In this manner, the novel robot device can be utilized in the "robot driven" or the "patient driven" standing-up training.
