Existing methods assume that the manifold constructed from the data is smooth, but they lack the ability to model skeleton structures from noisy data. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel probabilistic structured learning model to learn the density of latent embedding given high-dimensional data and its neighborhood graph. The embedded points that form a smooth skeleton structure are obtained by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Our analysis shows that the resulting similarity matrix is sparse and unique, and its associated kernel has eigenvalues that follow a power law distribution, which leads to the embeddings of a smooth skeleton. The model is extended to learn a sparse similarity matrix when the graph structure is unknown. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on various datasets by comparing them with existing methods.
