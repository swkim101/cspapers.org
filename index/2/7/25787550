Commerce search engines allow users to discover products, learn about them, and, importantly, make purchases. Commerce search is a challenging problem --- one that is very different to conventional text and web search. In this talk, we discuss what makes commerce search hard, how eBay has solved some of these problems, and what challenges eBay faces in the next generation of its search technologies. We also discuss the recent release of eBay's Cassini engine, share facts and figures about its scale, and outline the progress eBay has made in ranking and relevance for commerce search.
