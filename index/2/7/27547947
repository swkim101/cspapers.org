A new field in distributed computing, called Ambient Intelligence, has emerged as a consequence of the increasing availability of wireless devices and the mobile networks they induce. Developing software for such mobile networks is extremely hard in conventional programming languages because the network is dynamically defined. We demonstrate a new distributed programming language named AmbientTalk, a research vehicle to experiment with expressive high-level language constructs for Ambient-Oriented Programming.
