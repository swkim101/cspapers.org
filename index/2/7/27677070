Simple approaches can be used for basic mapping -assigning a class for each table and an instance variable for each column, managing relationships manually -but these do not scale well as complexity and performance requirements increase. A particular difficulty is that object applications must often deal with preexisting relational schemas designed for other purposes. Mapping these schemas into objects may require a great deal of flexibility.
