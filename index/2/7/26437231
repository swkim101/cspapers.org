The purpose of the special parasession on "Interactive Man/Machine Discourse" is to discuss some critical issues in the design of (computer-based) interactive natural language processing systems. This panel will be addressing the question of how the purpose of the interaction, or "problem context" affects what is said and how it is interpreted. Each of the panel members brings a different orientation toward the study of language to this question. My hope is that looking at the question from these different perspectives will expose issues critical to the study of language in general, and to the construction of computer systems that can co~nunicate with people in particular. Of course, the issue of the influence of "problem context" is separable from the issue of how one might get a computer system to take into account the effects of this context (and, yes, even whether that is possible). My hope is that those on the panel who are concerned with the construction of computer-based natural language processing systems will address some of the issues of "how" and that all of the panelists will consider the prior questions of what effects there are and what general principles underlie how the "problem context" influences a dialogue. ples. There is no taxonomy of function (as I've used the word). How might such a taxonomy be constructed and used?
