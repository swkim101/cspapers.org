A new research area is emerging in human-computer interaction, that of building and studying computer supported meeting environments. These environments contain one or more personal workstations, a large display screen at the front of the room, and a software system which integrates the input from each of the workstations. Beyond these similarities, the computer supported meeting environments differ dramatically, as do the meetings that take place using them.
