In this article we investigate the properties of the frequency distribution of numbers on the Web. We work with a part of the Common Crawl dataset comprising 3.8 billion Web documents and a recent dump of the English language Wikipedia. We show that, like words, numbers on the Web follow a Power law distribution, and obey Benford's law of first-digits. We show and explain regularities in the distribution, and compare the regularities in Common Crawl to those in Wikipedia. The comparison stresses which patterns in the frequency distributions follow from human thought.
