We propose a new type of printing system that incorporates sensors in a handheld printer to reflect in real time user intent in the results of printing on paper. This system achieves two key functions: "real-time embellishment" for altering printed content by reading user hand movements by pressure and optical sensors, and "local transcription" for selecting content to be output by tracing existing content on paper with a linear camera. We performed experiments to measure the accuracy of both techniques and evaluate their usefulness.
