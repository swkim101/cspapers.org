During the development of electronic products, engineering changes cannot normally be avoided. An effective method of handling EC's using the PRIMUS system is described. The basic features are a central database used in interactive mode and the possibility of storing all states of a design at the same time. The increase of data is by about 10%, but the savings in computer time are more than 50% in the design correction loops.
