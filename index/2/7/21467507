Ambient intelligence, ubiquitous and networked robots, cloud robotics, are new research hot topics that start to gain popularity among the robotics community. They enable robots to acquire richer functionalities and open the way for the composition of a variety of robotic services with three functions: semantic perception, reasoning and actuation. This paper introduces the recent challenges and future trends of these topics.
