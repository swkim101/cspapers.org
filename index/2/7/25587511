We present a model of morphological processing which directly encodes prosodic constituency, a notion which is clearly crucial in many widespread morphological processes. The model has been implemented for the Australian language Warlpiri and has been successfully interfaced with a syntactic parser for that language (Brunson, 1986). We contrast our approach with approaches to morphological parsing in the KIMMO framework.
