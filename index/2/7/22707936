Sensitivity of noncoherent synchronous hybrid direct sequence (DS)/frequency hopping (FH) multiple access communication system capacity is analyzed. System operates through the channel with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and employs differential phase shift keying modulation (DPSK) with random DS code sequence and frequency hopping pattern. System capacity, defined as total number of possible simultaneous users in the system, is found to be function of DS code length, number of hopping frequencies, signal to noise ratio and acceptable bit error rate. Sensitivity of the system capacity to changes in these system variables is investigated. System capacity is found to be most sensitive to DS code length while signal to noise ratio and number of hopping frequencies affect the system capacity to lesser degrees
