SPEC HPG has been creating benchmarks for comparing HPC systems. Currently they have a benchmark suite based on OpenMP (SPEC OMP) and another based on real applications supporting multiple parallel paradigms (SPEC HPC2002). SPEC is now in the process of developing a benhcmark based on MPI applications. This new suite is expected to measure MPI, CPU, compiler, memory bandwidth and interconnect performance. The BOF will focus on SPEC HPG benchmarks and will introduce the new SPEC MPI2006 benchmark.
