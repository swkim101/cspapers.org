The better we meet the interest of our community, the better we can help bringing ourselves up-to-date with the latest and greatest in and around software engineering. To this purpose, ICSE 2011 for the first time featured technical briefings, an all-day venue for communicating the state of topics related to software engineering, thus providing an exchange of ideas as well as an introduction to the main conference itself.
