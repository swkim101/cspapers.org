This paper presents several approaches for piezoactuators in motion control over a large dynamic range (cm to nm). The devices include monolithic two-degree-of-freedom actuators with mechanical amplification, stick-slip actuators and 6-DOF designs of micro-positioners. Closed loop feedback is of course necessary for good performance. All the proposed solutions have been realized and experimental results are discussed, application examples in scanning probe microscopy and biology are shortly presented.
