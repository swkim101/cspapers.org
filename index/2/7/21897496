During the postwar heyday of physics, C.P. Snow, wrote a short article entitled "The Two Cultures" (1954). There he pointed out the growing division between the 'science culture" and the "non-science (literary) culture." He observed that scientists basically had no understanding of - - nay, even any concern for -- literary culture, and vice versa. He pointed out the profound loss to society that was resulting from this dichotomy. Namely, creativity often arises in the interchange of ideas. Sadly, the two cultures were so polarized, even then, that Snow felt that little real dialogue took place between members of the two cultures.
