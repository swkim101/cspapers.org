In previous works on modeling of space manipulators, the satellite base or spacecraft is assumed to be at one end of the chain and the robot end-effector at the other. In this paper, a general model allowing any link on a floating kinematic chain to be either the spacecraft or the end-effector is developed and characterized. Properties discovered in the past about space manipulators are generalized to these systems with "non-specific" reference links.<<ETX>>
