The primary focus of design automation for VLSI in the 80's will not be the development of sophisticated new design tools, but rather the development of design methodologies which can utilize effectively 108 transistors/chip. Computer aids will be developed to support the management of these design methodologies, both for relatively simple synthesis tasks as well as the verification of circuits as they are generated.
 At the present time it is not clear which design methodology will be the most successful for any particular class of applications of VLSI. For this reason, design systems should be developed in a flexible manner to allow easy reconfiguration as new approaches to the design process emerge. The structure of one such system is shown in Fig. 1. In this approach the design tools are applied to the hierarchical data base under the control of a supervisory program, or shell, which can be reconfigured and adapt the system as new tools are added, or as the data base and/or representations of the design are altered. In this way, the designer observes the minimum perturbation as the system is updated.
