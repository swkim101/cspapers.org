This type of planning is interesting, for instance, in smart home environments which contain various sensors and robots to provide services to the inhabitants. Requests for information, for instance from an activity recognition system, should cause the smart home to configure itself in such a way that all requested information will be provided when it is needed. This paper addresses temporal configuration planning in which information availability and goals are linked to temporal intervals which are subject to constrains. Our solutions are based on constraint-based planning which uses different types of constraints to model different types of knowledge. We propose and compare two approaches to configuration planning. The first one models information via conditions and effects of planning operators and essentially reduces configuration planning to constraint-based temporal planning. The second approach solves information dependencies separately from task planning and optimizes the cost of reaching individual information goals. We compare these approaches in terms of the time it takes to solve problems and the quality of the solutions they provide.
