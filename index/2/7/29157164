We firstly define landscape experiences, perceived enjoyment from landscape as motivators for running, by public natural area and traffic density. Based on landscape experiences, we categorize locations into 3 types (natural, leisure, traffic space) and set them with different basic weight. Real-time context factors (weather, season and hour of the day) are involved to adjust the weight. We propose a multi-attributes method to recommend routes with weight based on MVT (The Marginal Value Theorem) k-shortest-paths algorithm. We also use a landscape-awareness sounds algorithm as supplementary of landscape experiences. Experimental results improve that SenseRun can enhance running experiences and is helpful to promote regular physical activities.
