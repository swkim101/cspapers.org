A simple model that considers the flexibility of constrained manipulators by introducing a set of equivalent springs is proposed. On the basis of the model, the authors derive a controller, which compensates the vibrations of the contact force. For measuring the vibrations and the contact force, accelerometers and a force sensor are used. Output signals of the sensors are fed back to the driving motors for controlling the position of the end-effector and the contact force. Experimental results are shown.
