A design optimization procedure of a noise-vibrationharshness (NVH) problem of a complicated vehicle structure is presented by assuming the acoustic pressure does not affect the structural vibration. The steady-state dynamic behavior of the vehicle is calculated from the frequency response finite element analysis, while the sound pressure level within the acoustic cavity is calculated from the boundary element analysis. A reverse solution process is employed for the design sensitivity calculation using the adjoint variable method. The adjoint load is obtained from the acoustic boundary element re-analysis, while the adjoint solution is calculated from the structural dynamic re-analysis. The evaluation of pressure sensitivity only involves a numerical integration process over the structural part where the design variable is defined. A design optimization problem is formulated and solved, where the structural weight is reduced while the noise level in the passenger compartment is lowered.
