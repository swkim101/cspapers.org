Due to the highly distributed nature and special basic conditions such as limited resources, implementing and maintaining a sensor network application is a tedious task. In this demonstration we present a service-oriented operating system for sensor nodes and a framework that allows a composition of services on the nodes. We show how sensor network applications can be composed and modified by using different services.
