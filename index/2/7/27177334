This paper describes methods for sensing the reaction forces acting on the foot and on the sole of a humanoid robot during walking. A force sensor is described, which utilizes sensors at each of four corners of the foot to measure the center of pressure during walking. A tactile sensor was also constructed from pressure conductive rubber sandwiched between upper and lower electrode arrays positioned at right angles to each other. This sensor provides information about the force distributions acting on the sole of the foot. Results are presented of measurements of the force distribution acting on the sole of the foot during walking of a humanoid robot on a flat surface and over thin objects on the floor.
