Designing a new sensor board is costly, especially for a production in a small quantity. By modularizing common functionalities, a large portion of the sensor board can be reused. In this work, we propose an Extension Board, a sensor board which is modularized into 3 parts. Power module, and MCU and RF module are shared, and only sensing module is redesigned for each sensor board. Diverse sensing modules are produced. The process was simple and inexpensive.
