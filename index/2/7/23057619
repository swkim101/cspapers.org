A power- and delay-efficient routing algorithm and emergency-efficient protocol for ubiquitous wireless sensor networks of silver town is presented. For this protocol, the fixed nodes (without any limited resources) are established to one point which can communicate with one-hop to both the sink node and the mobile sensor nodes in the dark region (in which mobile sensor nodes can not communicate to the sink node). The fixed nodes are operated like the fixed cluster header. Our protocol is simulated by using the simulation program for wireless sensor networks. The simulated life time of our routing algorithm is longer than those of LEACH-C and multi-hop and the simulated time delay of our routing algorithm is 1.5 times as fast as one of LEACH-C.
