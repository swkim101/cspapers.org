INTRODUCTION RPP (Reduced Programming Prototype) is a system that a.l10WSinterface designers to prototype user interfaces with little or no programming by allowing interactive definition of interface objects, flow of control, constraints between objects, and an interface to the application [1]. As the designer specifies the user interface, RPP builds and maintains a formal graph representation of the interface, called IRGs (Interface Representation Graphs), which is used to check consistency and completeness of the prototype. At any time the designer can convert the IRG to source code with calls to the X and Motif libraries which are compiled and linked with application code to produce an executable prototype.
