This paper presents performance results from work done on Sunâ€™s WildFire system. WildFire is a codename for a prototype shared memory multiprocessor developed by Sun MicrosystemsTM consisting of up to four unmodified Sun EnterpriseTM x000 series symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs). A goal of the WildFire system is to evaluate the effectiveness of leveraging large SMPs in the construction of even larger systems. We have conducted several performance experiments with a shared memory parallelized finite difference solver. Our work demonstrates the key features of the WildFire system, including automatic page migration and read/write replication. Our results show that the dynamic page migration algorithms used by the WildFire system are effective in automatically optimizing data placement at runtime. Performance comparisons between the WildFire system and currently available SMPs show that the system exhibits good scalability characteristics, and actually outperforms SMPs on this particular application.
