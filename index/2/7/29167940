To handle this problem, we aim to learn a more robust object representation for visual tracking. In particular, the tracked object is represented with a graph structure (i.e., a set of non-overlapping image patches), in which the weight of each node (patch) indicates how likely it belongs to the foreground and edges are also weighed for indicating the appearance compatibility of two neighboring nodes. This graph is dynamically learnt (i.e., the nodes and edges received weights) and applied in object tracking and model updating. We constrain the graph learning from two aspects: i) the global low-rank structure over all nodes and ii) the local sparseness of node neighbors. During the tracking process, our method performs the following steps at each frame. First, the graph is initialized by assigning either 1 or 0 to the weights of some image patches according to the predicted bounding box. Second, the graph is optimized through designing a new ALM (Augmented Lagrange Multiplier) based algorithm. Third, the object feature representation is updated by imposing the weights of patches on the extracted image features. The object location is finally predicted by adopting the Struck tracker. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art tracking methods on two standard benchmarks, i.e., OTB100 and NUS-PRO.
