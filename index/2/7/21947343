Convolutional neural network (CNN) finds applications in a variety of computer vision applications ranging from object recognition and detection to scene understanding owing to its exceptional accuracy. There exist different algorithms for CNNs computation. In this paper, we explore conventional convolution algorithm with a faster algorithm using Winograd's minimal filtering theory for efficient FPGA implementation. Distinct from the conventional convolution algorithm, Winograd algorithm uses less computing resources but puts more pressure on the memory bandwidth. We first propose a fusion architecture that can fuse multiple layers naturally in CNNs, reusing the intermediate data. Based on this fusion architecture, we explore heterogeneous algorithms to maximize the throughput of a CNN. We design an optimal algorithm to determine the fusion and algorithm strategy for each layer. We also develop an automated toolchain to ease the mapping from Caffe model to FPGA bitstream using Vivado HLS. Experiments using widely used VGG and AlexNet demonstrate that our design achieves up to 1.99Ã— performance speedup compared to the prior fusion-based FPGA accelerator for CNNs.
