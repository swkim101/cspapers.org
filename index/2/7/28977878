It is frequently suggested that computer science curricula are generated in a vacuum with little or no regard for the “real-world needs” of the student's ultimate employer. Furthermore, the question has recently been raised whether computer science programs should prepare their graduates to be “tool users” or “tool builders.”
 The panel, composed of distinguished representatives from industry and Government, will relate their past experience with computer science graduates and will address their immediate personnel needs (i.e., areas of required expertise for new employees). Each panel member will then present his candid view of the proposed updates to “Curriculum '68” currently being prepared by ACM's Curriculum Committee on Computer Science.
