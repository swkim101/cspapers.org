A general method for the inference of recursive functions (programs) from examples of computations is described. It is based on the so called algebraic semantics of recursive program schemes and in this paper mainly applied to the representation and induction of infinite concepts and recursive action sequences (which are of importance for problem solving and hierarchical planning). Additionally, the use of recursive program schemes leads to a new principle of generalization in the sense that families of structures or classes of programs could be treated simultaneously and that already existing solutions of old problems could be transferred to new problems which have to be solved.
