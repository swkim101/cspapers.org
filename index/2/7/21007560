This paper is concerned with the integration and control of UAVs and wireless sensor networks, an approach that is useful in isolated areas where communication between ground nodes might be difficult. We present the preliminary design for a fixed-wing aircraft carrying a wireless sensor node which acts as a mobile gateway for information gathering. Experiments were conducted using a low cost UAV platform to measure the range and amount of data that can be exchanged between ground-based and airborne nodes. Field test results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and the viability of a combined UAV air and ground wireless sensor network.
