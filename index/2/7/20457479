In this work, we propose a framework to deal with cross-modal visuo-tactile object recognition. By cross-modal visuo-tactile object recognition, we mean that the object recognition algorithm is trained only with visual data and is able to recognize objects leveraging only tactile perception. The proposed cross-modal framework is constituted by three main elements. The first is a unified representation of visual and tactile data, which is suitable for cross-modal perception. The second is a set of features able to encode the chosen representation for classification applications. The third is a supervised learning algorithm, which takes advantage of the chosen descriptor. In order to show the results of our approach, we performed experiments with 15 objects common in domestic and industrial environments. Moreover, we compare the performance of the proposed framework with the performance of 10 humans in a simple cross-modal recognition task.
