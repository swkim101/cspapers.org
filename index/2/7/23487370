In this paper, a pulse time modulation method named MxN-ary chaotic pulse-width-position modulation (CPWPM) is proposed in order to provide a significant improvement of bit rate and security for digital communications. Analysis of schemes for modulator and demodulator as well as theoretical evaluation of bit error rate (BER) in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is presented. Performance of the proposed method is verified by means of simulation results.
