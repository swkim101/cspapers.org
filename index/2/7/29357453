The main goal of this PhD thesis is to propose and implement a methodology for the construction of programs based on the SCOOP model, and for modular reasoning about their correctness and liveness properties. In particular, the set of correctness rules that guarantee the absence of data races will be refined and formalized; an augmented type system will be proposed to enforce these rules at compile time. Furthermore, an efficient methodology for deadlock prevention, avoidance, detection, and resolution will be developed. A working implementation of SCOOP will be provided. It will take into consideration the proposed mechanisms and serve as a basis for further refinements of the model.
