The Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) of ABET has proposed new, outcomes-based criteria to accredit programs under the commission’s jurisdiction. These programs include computer science, information systems, and information technology. The criteria follow the new structure of so-called “general criteria,” components of criteria that apply to any computing program accredited by CAC, and “program criteria” for each specific disciplinary area, to supplement the general criteria. The “general –program” criteria structure was introduced at last year’s SIGCSE, but the outcomes-based approach now under consideration is new and significantly different from both current criteria and those discussed last year. This session will discuss the new criteria, including both the proposed general and program criteria, and the timetable for implementation of the new criteria. Feedback to the proposed criteria is being sought.
