The goal of the 3rd BooksOnline Workshop is to bring together researchers and industry practitioners in information retrieval, digital libraries, e-books, human computer interaction, publishing industry, and online book services to foster progress on addressing challenges and exploring opportunities around large collections of digital books and complementary media. Towards this goal, the workshop programme consists of contributions both from academia and industry, including two keynote talks: James Crawford from Google Books and John Mark Ockerbloom from the University of Pennsylvania.
