This report deals with the design, implementation and evolution of programming language designed specially for the teaching of Algorithmic Processes. In the first section two alternative approaches to the teaching of this first course in Computer Science are described. Next the authors state their basic hypothesis: that a programming language may be custom-designed for a given flow chart language with ensuing benefit. A flow chart language is chosen and described in detail with several examples of complete problems solved in flow chart form, Next the programming language is described and the problems solved in the previous section with flow charts are now coded in this programming language. Several simplifying features of the programming language are described. This programming language is now being utilized in a college classroom situation in order to evaluate its effectiveness as a teaching tool. A brief description of its current use and the means of its evaluation are presented in the last section.
