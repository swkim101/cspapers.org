Requirements for future data base systems are developed from the perspective of the user of a networked workstation who naturally deals with compound objects. Objects considered include full text, diagrams, maps, sound recordings, images from film and video and of art objects, spreadsheets, etc. Searching requirements and strategies over multi-objects are also considered. The context of such data base systems is the library, in its electronic or digital version. Comments are presented with respect to the digital learning environment of the future. Current related projects at Berkeley are described.
