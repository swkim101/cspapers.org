This session is for anyone currently using Alice Level 2 and/or Alice Level 3, or those exploring the possibility of using Alice in their curriculum. The discussion leaders and attendees will share teaching strategies, tips, and techniques with each other and those new to Alice. This is an opportunity to share assignments and pointers to web sites to access instructional materials, such as syllabi, student projects, exams, and other resources. There will be a special emphasis on the new Alice 3 to Java textbook and accompanying support materials, how Alice supports the transition to Java, and mapping Alice 2 and Alice 3 curriculum standards and guidelines.
