In this demonstration, we present a novel system of building control and simulation focused on the integration of the physical and virtual worlds. Actuations and schedules can be manifested either in a physical space or in a virtualization of that space, allowing for more natural interactions with simulations and easier transferring of schedules and configurations from the simulated virtual environment to a real-world deployment. We provide an implementation using a widely used game engine (Unity 3D) and sMAP (Simple Measurement and Actuation Profile), a developed time series database and metadata store.
