To obtain an efficient open-loop control strategy for robots under uncertainty, the statistical and a priori informations about the random parameters and disturbances of the underlying mechanical system and its environment are taken into account for off-line programming. The influence of our open-loop strategy on the online feed-back control is compared with that of other open-loop strategies.<<ETX>>
