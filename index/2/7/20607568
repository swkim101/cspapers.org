This paper describes the network implementation for SELF, Sensorized Environment for Life, which the authors are developing. SELF is an experimental sensorized environment to support healthcare. All sensors are embedded in the environment cleverly so human in SELF may not care for being monitored from the environment. To construct such an environment and make use of the information from sensors, every sensor should be connected with the others and, consequently, they should form a sensor network. In this paper, the outline of SELF itself is described briefly but not discussed in detail. The focus of this paper is the aspects of this sensor network in SELF.
