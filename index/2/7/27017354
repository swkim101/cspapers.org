The method iteratively recovers the point correspondence and estimates the spatial transformation between two point sets. The correspondence is established based on existing local feature descriptors which typically results in a number of outliers. To achieve an accurate estimate of the transformation from such putative point correspondence, we formulate the registration problem by a mixture model with a set of latent variables introduced to identify outliers, and a prior involving manifold regularization is imposed on the transformation to capture the underlying intrinsic geometry of the input data. The non-rigid transformation is specified in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and a sparse approximation is adopted to achieve a fast implementation. Extensive experiments on both 2D and 3D data demonstrate that our method can yield superior results compared to other state-of-the-arts, especially in case of badly degraded data.
