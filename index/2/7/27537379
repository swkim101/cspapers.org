Computer and Information Science Departments are usually organized, as was the one at The Ohio State University, by combining already existing courses in computer programming and applications from other departments into one department and adding a few extra courses. This paper is a report concerning how this was done at Ohio State and how the Department has developed since. Suggestions are also included for the organization of new departments at other schools. The report has been arranged in four main sections: a description of the development of the department at Ohio State, a unifying philosophy of the field, a description of the Ohio State undergraduate curriculum in Computer and Information Science, and suggestions for new curricula at other schools.
