This paper studies the problem of discovering the structured knowledge representation of binary nat-ural language relations. The representation, known as the schema, generalizes the traditional path of predicates to support more complex semantics. We present a search algorithm to generate schemas over a knowledge base, and propose a data-driven learning approach to discover the most suitable representations to one relation. Evaluation results show that inferred schemas are able to represent precise semantics, and can be used to enrich manually crafted knowledge bases. 1
