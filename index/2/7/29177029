Cloud computing is a dominant trend in computing for the foreseeable future; e.g., major cloud operators are now estimated to house over a million machines each and to host substantial (and growing) fractions of our IT and web infrastructure. CCSW is a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss the implications of this trend to the security of cloud operators, tenants, and the larger Internet community. CCSW welcomes submissions on new threats, countermeasures, and opportunities brought about by the move to cloud computing, with a preference for unconventional approaches, as well as measurement studies and case studies that shed light on the security implications of clouds.
