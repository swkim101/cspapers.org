Hardware Support for Object-Oriented SystemsMario Wolczko, University of Manchester, England
When the performance penalty of object-oriented systems ismentioned, a common response is to blame antiquated hardwaredesigns for not supporting object-oriented languages as theydeserve, To what extent can the performance gap betweenconventional languages and object-oriented languages be closedusing hardware? What architectural changes benefit object-orientedsystems, and by how much?
There have been many attempts to make hardware that bettersupports object-oriented programming. This tutorial describes thesesystems, and the extent that they have succeeded or failed in theiraims. These systems include SOAR, Rekursiv and MUSHROOM, as well assome features from mainstream architectures such as SPARC. Issuescovered include: choice of instruction set, design of the memorysystem including caches and virtual memory hardware, scaleability,use of parallelism, and hardware/software trade-offs.
A common misconception is that if something is implemented inhardware then it must be fast. One aspect of the tutorial is toshow that there are limits to what hardware support can achieve.However, better hardware can reduce the cost of some languagefeatures, such as dynamic binding, and can make a system morescaleable.
