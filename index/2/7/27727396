Over the past few years, Proximity-based People Discovery (PBPD) services, typically known as Nearby Friends,have been increasingly popular among geosocial apps. Unlike many unsuccessful predecessors which directly pinpoint users' exact locations on the map, PBPD services provide coarse-grained (discretized) proximity information, such as "Jennifer is within 2 miles," striking a useful balance between privacy and functionality. Considering PBPD's business potential, many companies including Facebook have been trying to promote this feature and instill the perception in mobile users that coarse-grained proximity information is innocuous to share. Here, we propose a novel positioning attack which can locate end-users of PBPD services with high precision using only coarse-grained (discretized) proximity information. This attack requires neither specialized hardware nor server-side collusion and can be easily automated. Based on this attack, we design and implement Geosocial Positioning System (GsPS) and show that GsPS can effectively locate users with high precision (10m) in a matter of a few minutes under real-world settings, and is capable of performing effective city-scale scanning and long-term profiling at low costs. The public and the social network industry should therefore be aware of the potential risk introduced by this attack and consider use of PBPD services with caution.
