Stottler Henke Associates Inc.'s Object-Oriented Design Learning Environment (OODLE) is an early prototype intelligent tutoring system aimed at teaching object-oriented design skills by coached practice with realistically complex design problems. OODLE's pedagogical approach is based on the instructional practices of Craig Larman, author of Applying UML and Patterns.
