Pharmaceutical industries which are intended for the packaging of different tablets in a strip of blister need to make sure that the tablets are free from defects before letting them go into the packing box. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an efficient, reliable and cost effective supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system for detection and removing of unwanted tablet(s) strips. The system detects defective tablets by capturing image of a batch of tablets and performs morphological analysis over it. If a defective tablet is found, the system is smart enough to trace in which strip the defective tablet would be present after cutting of batch and hence instructing the remote terminal unit (RTU) to remove that strip. The status of the whole process at the completion of every order is sent to master terminal unit (MTU) which generates and saves the log file on MS-EXCEL, and is also able to send the log file to main server via electronic mail.
