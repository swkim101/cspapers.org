The Chinese Spring Festival travel season (Chunyun) has been called the largest annual human migration in the world with approximately 3.6 billion trips in 2014. Understandably, all forms of transportation are stressed at or near saturation during this period and many people, especially lower-income individuals fail to get to their destinations. We present CountryRoads, a ridesharing system to address the transportation shortage during Chunyun. The CountryRoads system collects users' route information, and matches drivers and passengers as an online bipartite matching problem based on the proximity of the passenger's origin and destination and the route of the driver. The system is evaluated during four Chunyun periods from 2012 to 2015 with up to 17272 users and forms 4777 ridesharing tuples in 2015.
