The present paper describes and discusses a proposed M.S. program in Computer Science prepared by the author for the New Curriculum Committee in Computer Science. Although the paper includes many suggestions and comments made by members of the committee, it still does not necessarily represent a final version of the proposed program, and, indeed, one of the motivations for including it at this SIGCSE symposium is to elicit further comments and suggestions.
