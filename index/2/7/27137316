The Master of Science Biomedical Engineering Program at California State University uses class team projects to provide students with practice in interdisciplinary team problem solving. LabVIEW, with its rapid prototyping and interactive capabilities, provides valuable support for these projects. The use of LabVIEW in these class projects has attracted medical and industrial collaborators, and has made possible the successful completion of projects within a semester or just a few weeks that previously would not have been considered feasible, and has led to master's theses and research and development activities.
