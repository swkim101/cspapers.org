Modern smartphones are equipped with a wide variety of sensors including GPS, WiFi and cellular radios capable of positioning, accelerometers, magnetic compasses and gyroscopes, light and proximity sensors, and cameras. These sensors have made smartphones an attractive platform for collaborative sensing (aka crowdsourcing) applications where phones cooperatively collect sensor data to perform various tasks. Researchers and mobile application developers have developed a wide variety of such applications. Examples of such systems include BikeTastic [4] and BikeNet [1] which allow bicyclists to collaboratively map and visualize biking trails, SoundSense [3] for collecting and analyzing microphone data, iCartel [2] which crowdsources driving tracks from users to monitor road traffic in real time, and Transitgenie [5], which cooperatively tracks buses and trains.
