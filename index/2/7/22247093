The twisted string actuator is an actuator that is gaining popularity in various engineering and robotics and applications. However, the fundamental limitation of actuators of this type is the uni-directional action, meaning that the actuator can contract but requires external power to return to its initial state. This paper proposes 2 novel passive extension mechanisms based on buckling effect to solve the uni-directional issue of the twisted string actuator. The proposed mechanisms are mechanically simple and compact and provide a nearly-constant extension force throughout the operation range. The constant force can fully extend the twisted string actuator with minimal loss of force during contraction. The designed mechanisms are evaluated in a series of practical tests, and their performances are compared and discussed.
