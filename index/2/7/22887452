Linked Data has been widely adopted over the last few years, with the size of the Linked Data cloud almost doubling every year. However, there is still no well-defined, efficient mechanism for querying such a Web of Data. We propose a framework that incorporates a set of optimizations to tackle various limitations in the state-of-the-art. The framework aims at combining the centralized query optimization capabilities of the data warehouse-based approaches with the result freshness and explorative data source discovery capabilities of link-traversal approaches. This is achieved by augmenting base-line link-traversal query execution with a set of optimization techniques. The proposed optimizations fall under two categories: metadata-based optimizations and semantics-based optimizations.
