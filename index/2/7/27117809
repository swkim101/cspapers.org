Embedded system design and optimization play an important role in the development trend of embedded technology. This paper presents a new approach to design and optimize embedded systems in the design phase based on Pareto multi-objective optimization. We defined two Domain Specific Languages and developed the framework that is to design the architecture model and the component diagram of embedded systems. And we integrated the code generation technology called Text Template Transformation Toolkit to this framework to generate parameters from models automatically. Then we also do multi-objective optimization to select the best trade-off configuration of the embedded system architecture and the best hardware-software partition based on the Pareto principle and Genetic Algorithm.
