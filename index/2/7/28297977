High school and CS0 computer science students often begin class having no computing education beyond studying office suite programs. Teaching digital audio, a ubiquitous application, allows an authentic and engaging context for the teaching of computer science principles as outlined at http://www.csprinciples.org. In particular, it demonstrates the interconnection of computer science with physics, mathematics, and audio engineering. Do you teach digital audio or music technology? Are you interested in teaching these subjects? In this BOF we will discuss digital audio in computer science CS0 classes.
