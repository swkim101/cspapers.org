AS part of our long-term research into techniques for information retrieval from natural language data bases, we have developed over the past few years a natural language interface for data base retrieval [1,2]. In developing this system, we have sought general, conceptually simple, linguistically-based solutlons to problems of semantic representation and interpretation. One component of the system, which we have recently redesigned and are now implementing in its revised form, involves the generation of responses. This paper will briefly describe our approach, and how this approach simplifies some of the problems of response generation.
