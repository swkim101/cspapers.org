An introductory database course is well established within computer science curricula. Instructors in this course are challenged to select a subset of possible topics to cover and emphasize and also to design appropriate assignments to help students master those topics. As theories regarding effective educational practice continue to emerge and become known, we also seek to invigorate our courses by including some of these newer techniques.
 Contributing Student Pedagogy is an umbrella term that refers to a family of techniques that involves finding ways for students to become directly involved in the production of course content utilized by other students. Students not only make use of content provided by other students, but they come to view that content as valuable. This paper reports on initial efforts to incorporate an assignment based on contributing student pedagogy into a standard database course. Several iterations took place, with improvements made between the first and second iterations. Plans for future iterations are included and implications, not only for the database course, but other Computer Science courses, are discussed.
