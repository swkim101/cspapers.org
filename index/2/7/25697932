This paper is a result of research conducted in the last two years to improve government Computing Systems in developing countries. Various methods were used to introduce and establish Computing Systems in developing countries without any systematic approach. However, many of the governments in these countries soon realized the need for a central agency to regulate and monitor Computing Systems and their usage. Many factors contributed to the decisions made in creating a central government computing agency.
