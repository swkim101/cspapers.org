Have you read any of the common reads for SIGCSE 2016? Now's your chance to talk about them! Two books: The Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady's Primer by Neal Stephenson (Bantam Spectra, 1995) and Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie (Orbit, 2013) as well as two short stories: "A Logic Named Joe" by Will F. Jenkins (Street and Smith, 1946) and "Seven Years from Home" by Naomi Novik (Clarksworld Magazine, 2014) were proposed at the end of the 2015 conference. If you're interested in science fiction, whether on a personal, academic, or pedagogical level, come join us in this BoF and discuss one or more of the two books and two stories. We'll provide potential topics and discussion questions targeting how to incorporate these books into a CS course, but the discussion will be open. The BoF will close with a discussion of potential books for the 2017 conference.
