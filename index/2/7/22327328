In this tutorial we will survey how ideas emanating from the machine learning literature have found applications in the performance evaluation domain. Traditionally, the performance evaluation community devises models that bring insights and tradeoffs focusing on specific features of a given application. The machine learning community, in turn, is focused towards finding patterns using general-purpose tools such as Hidden Markov Models. In the past few years, there was a surge of machine learning techniques applied to solve performance evaluation problems. The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate a few of such applications which are founded on Markov chains. We consider graphs properties metrics based on random walks and Hidden Markov models for prediction. Random walks on graphs: given a graph, which might represent the connections between users in a social network, the correlation matrix between movies or the links between webpages, how to infer its properties? In answering this question, in this tutorial we cover the concepts of node centrality (e.g., PageRank) and spectral clustering metrics (e.g., clustering based on mean time to absorption). Hidden Markov models and prediction: given a time series, how to parameterize a model that allows us to predict future values of the series? Answering this question is relevant for inferring, for instance, channel delay and loss characteristics and for traffic modeling and workload generation. We will survey applications of HMMs, highlighting the power of HMMs as predictors of performance metrics. Our main objective in this tutorial is not to cover the details of any method and applications. Instead, our intent is to emphasize the application of machine learning concepts taking examples from different domains and with theoretical basis founded on Markov chain theory.
