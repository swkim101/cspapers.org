Traffic safety is an important problem for autonomous vehicles. The development of Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) dedicated to reducing the number of fatalities and the severity of road accidents is an important and an active research area. Recently, most TSR approaches of machine learning and image processing have achieved advanced performance in traditional natural scenes. However, there exists a limitation on the accuracy in road sign recognition and on time consuming. This paper proposes a real-time algorithm for shape classification of traffic signs and their recognition to provide a driver alert system. The proposed algorithm is mainly composed of two phases: shape classification and content classification. This algorithm takes as input a list of Bounding Boxes generated in a previous work, and will classify them. The traffic sign's shape is classified by an artificial neural network (ANN). Traffic signs are classified according to their shape characteristics, as triangular, squared and circular shapes. Combining color and shape information, traffic signs are classified into one of the following classes: danger, information, obligation or prohibition. The classified circular and triangular shapes are passed on to the second ANN in the third phase. These identify the pictogram of the road sign. The output of the second artificial neural network allows the full classification of the road sign. The algorithm proposed is evaluated on a dataset of road signs of a Tunisian database sign.
