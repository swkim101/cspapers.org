People spend up to one-third of lives asleep, and healthy sleep habits can make a big difference in their quality of life. But in modern society, many people have unhealthy sleep diaries and suffer from various sleep disorders, which may result in irregular mood fluctuations or even mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. We propose the Emotion-Aware Smart Tips (EAST), a novel approach that could help to inform users about their irregular emotional states with smart tips to improve their sleep qualities. EAST aims at helping users keep healthy sleep schedules and emotional states by providing smart tips through a novel model that combines multivariate regression, random forest, and neural network to quantify the relations between sleep patterns and emotional states. Prototype implementation and initial experiments of EAST in mobile phones have demonstrated its desired functionality and practicality for real-world deployment.
