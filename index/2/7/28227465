The topic of women in computer science has recently been getting more and more attention. The special issue of the SIGCSE Bulletin inroad (Volume 34, Number 2, published in June 2002) is one of the milestones that indicate this trend. However, a review of this special issue reveals that though the topic is examined from different angles, only one paper addresses it from an international point of view. By presenting statements derived from four countries on four different continents, our panel aims to highlight the topic from this multinational perspective. Throughout the discussion with the audience we hope to identify common interests and to check whether an international agenda with respect to the topic can be formulated.
