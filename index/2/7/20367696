Traditionally, automatic IC layout programs have been constrained to produced designs in which cells are placed in rows.
 The resulting chips are typically too large, compared to manual layout, to be used for high-volume production. FLOSS uses a new approach &emdash; automatic packing of a manually-generated sketch &emdash; to achieve chip area that is competitive with manual layout.
