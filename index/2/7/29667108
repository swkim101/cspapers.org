Indiana University provides powerful compute, storage, and network resources to a diverse local and national research community every day. IU's facilities have been used to support data-intensive applications ranging from digital humanities to computational biology.For this year's bandwidth challenge, several IU researchers will conduct experiments from the exhibit floor utilizing the resources that University Information Technology Services currently provides.Using IU's newly constructed 535 TB Data Capacitor and an additional component installed on the exhibit floor, we will use Lustre across the wide area network to simultaneously facilitate dynamic weather modeling, protein analysis, instrument data capture, and the production, storage, and analysis of simulation data.
