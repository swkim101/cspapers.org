How do students learn computer science? Successful students climb a ladder of learning and meta-learning. Not only do they learn content, but also they gain proficiency with new processes that aid their learning. Each learner takes her/his own path, of course, but the beginning CS student must clear a number of hurdles that we can identify and help them with. In programming, for example, one might struggle with the leap from visual programming to text programming, or from using well-designed integrated tutorials while learning one language, to the chaos of the Internet when learning another. Numerous ongoing efforts in computer science education and professional development [5, 6] have contributed to tremendous increases in the numbers of students studying computer science at all levels. These efforts have included academic innovations as well as partnerships with industry, government, and non-profit organizations [7]. Expanded access means that more students have the opportunity to study computer science, but also that the diverse needs of many new learners need to be understood and addressed.
