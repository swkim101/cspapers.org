Follower partial band jamming is recognized as the most efficient strategy to deteriorate the performance of frequency hopping (FH) systems with M-ary frequency shift keying (MFSK) modulation. In this paper, a pilot-aided parallel jamming cancelation (PJC) scheme that uses a two-element array is proposed for both follower jamming rejection and symbol detection in slow FH/MFSK systems over slow frequency-flat fading channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PJC scheme outperforms the ML-based scheme [1], the traditional ML approach, and the sample matrix inversion (SMI) method [2] over a wide signal-to-jamming ratio (SJR) range.
