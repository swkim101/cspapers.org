Game development programs are being added to computer science departments as either a track, minor, or major in post-secondary institutions across the United States. These programs are being developed with little published quantitative or qualitative research on what such programs should entail. The quantitative research in this pilot study defines qualifications sought when hiring game developers for positions in industry. Using cross-sectional data, qualifications from job advertisements were coded, categorized, and then subcategorized and weighted totals were calculated based on skills being either required or desired. Weighted totals in each subcategory were compared and ranked. The top 10 qualifications are provided, along with a breakdown of rankings of all subcategories within each category. Subcategories of Languages and Tools/Environments are also discussed briefly to highlight key qualifications in each.
