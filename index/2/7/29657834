The aim of this paper is to provide some details about the inference procedures of RESEDA, an "intelligent" Information Retrieval system using techniques borrowed from Knowledge Engineering. A RESEDA prototype has been operational for over a year : amongst its characteristics are a "case grammar" like knowledge representation language, intensive use of temporal data, use of the notion of "type", automatic generation of logical links, etc. First, the paper makes it clear what is meant in RESEDA by "level zero inference". Subsequently, it provides an informal description of the two kinds of high level inference operation, relying on information in the rule base, that are implemented in the system : these are known as "transformations" and "hypotheses". Finally, the article describes in some detail the computational structure of the "machines" which enable RESEDA's inference engine to execute this type of high level operation.
