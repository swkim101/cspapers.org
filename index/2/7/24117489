SUMMARY This special session will present a historical review of SIGCSE's role in curriculum issues and trace the evolution of teaching materials in computer science. When SIGCSE was formed 40 years ago, there were no curriculum guidelines. In fact, there was no agreed upon definition of computer science. SIGCSE pioneers will trace the history of curriculum guidelines and teaching materials and discuss SIGCSE's relation to other computer related education associations from their own perspective.
