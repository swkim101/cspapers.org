This paper draws on the parallels between the current period and other periods of historic change in journalism to examine what is new in today's world of social media and what continuities there are with the past. It examines the changing relationship between the public and the press and how it is being continuously reinterpreted. It addresses the questions of whether we are the beginning or end of a process of revolutionary media change.
