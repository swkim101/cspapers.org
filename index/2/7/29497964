The goal of the workshop is to build a forum for researchers from academy and industry to investigate challenging and innovative research issues in the subject, which combines Affective Interaction within ubiquitous environment and to explore creative concepts, theories, innovative technologies and intelligent solutions. Potential participants may come from communities of ubiquitous computing, intelligent computing, brain computer interaction, affective computing, neuroergonomics, cognitive neuroscience etc. in order to present their state-of-the-art progress and visions on the various overlaps across those disciplines. In this proposal, we describe the detailed purpose, topics, and format of this workshop on "Ubiquitous Affective Awareness and Intelligent Interaction".
