has been the major communications vehicle for SIGCSE members since 1969. Educators have used it as a place to share their course materials, their research, and their experiences. SIGCSE has used it as a way to keep in touch with members and inform them about events and activities. This session will address the role of the SIGCSE Bulletin in the life of SIGCSE and computer science education. Panel members will discuss its origins, its growth over the years, and its involvement in computer science and information systems education. An overview of the types of articles published will be given, with reference to the evolution of the industry over that time period. This session is a Special Event being held to celebrate and commemorate the 21'st birthday of SIGCSE.
