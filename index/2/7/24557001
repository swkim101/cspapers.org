Given a collection of basic customer demographics (e.g., age and gender) andtheir behavioral data (e.g., item purchase histories), how can we predictsensitive demographics (e.g., income and occupation) that not every customermakes available?This demographics prediction problem is modeled as a classification task inwhich a customer's sensitive demographic y is predicted from his featurevector x. So far, two lines of work have tried to produce a"good" feature vector x from the customer's behavioraldata: (1) application-specific feature engineering using behavioral data and (2) representation learning (such as singular value decomposition or neuralembedding) on behavioral data. Although these approaches successfullyimprove the predictive performance, (1) designing a good feature requiresdomain experts to make a great effort and (2) features obtained fromrepresentation learning are hard to interpret. To overcome these problems, we present a Relational Infinite SupportVector Machine (R-iSVM), a mixture-of-experts model that can leveragebehavioral data. Instead of augmenting the feature vectors of customers, R-iSVM uses behavioral data to find out behaviorally similar customerclusters and constructs a local prediction model at each customer cluster. In doing so, R-iSVM successfully improves the predictive performance withoutrequiring application-specific feature designing and hard-to-interpretrepresentations. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the predictiveperformance and interpretability of R-iSVM. Furthermore, R-iSVM can co-existwith previous demographics prediction methods to further improve theirpredictive performance.
