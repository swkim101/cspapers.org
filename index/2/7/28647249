To accomplish successfully the complex future mission in civilian and military scenarios, robotic helicopters need to have controllers that exploit their full dynamic capabilities. The absence of high-fidelity simulation models has prevented the use of well established multivariable control techniques for the design of high-bandwidth full-flight-envelope control systems. Existing model-based controllers are of low bandwidth and cover only small portions of the vehicle's flight envelope. In this paper we present the results of the synergistic use of high-fidelity integrated modeling strategies, robust multivariable control techniques, and classical gain scheduling for the rapid and reliable design of high-bandwidth full-flight envelope controllers for robotic helicopters. We implemented and flight tested a gain-scheduled H/sub /spl infin// loop-shaping controller on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Yamaha R-50 robotic helicopter. During the flight tests, the CMU R-50 flew several high-speed maneuvers. We believe that our modeling/control approach quickly delivers controllers that exploit the full dynamic capabilities of the airframe and thus are ready to be used by higher level navigation systems for complex autonomous missions.
