The field of hardware testability is an active, wellestablished part of the engineering of modern computer systems. However, only recently have technologies for software testability began to be developed. These technologies focus on accessing the aspects of software that improve or depreciate the ease of testing. As both the size of implemented software and the amount of effort required to test that software increase, so will the importance of soflware testability y technologies in influencing the software design process. Providing future developers the necessary tools to build testable software designs is a critical part of this field, This panel will discuss ongoing research and development of software testability technologies. A variety of viewpoints are represented: academic and industrial, approaches based on both control and data abstractions, testability technology producers and those who have applied such technologies on the problems of real systems. The structure of the panel will be a series of “viewpoint” presentations (approximately 5-7 minutes per panelist), followed by questions from the audience.
