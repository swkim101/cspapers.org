Several times in the past few years we have held BoF sessions about teaching web programming at the college level. Our feedback indicates that the most valuable aspect of the past sessions was simply to get everyone together for an exchange of ideas and information, so this will be the focus of the session again. We'd like to bring together two groups of web programming instructors: Newcomers who have not yet taught this material before (or are just starting) and want to soak up information, and veterans who have now taught it and have insights to share with the group. Newcomers can ask questions about materials, languages and technologies to use, what works and what doesn't, and so on. Veterans can share tips from the classroom and helpful resources. We can also discuss the latest technologies such as HTML, ECMAScript/JavaScript, iPhone/iPad, Android, and web application frameworks such as Node.js, Rails, AngularJS, and more.
