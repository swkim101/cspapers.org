Despite the recent advancements in graph partitioning techniques and algorithms, achieving static load balancing in agent-based epidemiological applications is challenging. Input to these simulations is a large agent-location bipartite graph that is highly complex and non-uniform. In this paper, we compare several static load distribution schemes, including our custom strategies, for partitioning a class of bipartite graphs. Computations over such graphs happen between classes of nodes in phases. Our performance evaluations on a 768 core system show that our lower-overhead custom load balancing strategy achieves a 2-fold increase in strong scaling performance compared to the default Round Robin data distribution.
