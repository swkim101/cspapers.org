Fault-tolerant group recommendation systems based on subspace clustering successfully alleviate high-dimensionality and sparsity problems. However, the cost of recommendation grows exponentially with the size of dataset. To address this issue, we model the fault-tolerant subspace clustering problem as a search problem on graphs and present an algorithm, GraphRec, based on the concept of α-ß-core. Moreover, we propose two variants of our approach that use indexes to improve query latency. Our experiments on different datasets demonstrate that our methods are extremely fast compared to the state-of-the-art.
