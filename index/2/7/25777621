Finding just the right example to answer a question can be difficult for CS1 students and teachers. For this to work well there must be an intuitive interface coupled to an appropriate set of focused examples. The examples then provide the scaffolding to enable students' discovery. CFX (C For eXample) provides the needed easy-to-use web based interface.A small pilot study showed that students using CFX could find answers to their programming questions in roughly half the time it took using a textbook. Freely distributed as open source software under the GNU General Public License [4], CFX can be used as a database authoring tool to capture a set of examples. Once the content is established, the interface as well as the data can be automatically exported to a standalone dynamic interface, using static, non-database content.The development of this system has been sponsored in part by NSF's CCLI program, with sample content developed in conjunction with McGraw-Hill.
