Social and Community Intelligence (SCI) represents an emerging area that aims at revealing individual/group behaviors, social interactions as well as community dynamics by mining the digital traces left by people while interacting with cyber-physical spaces. The digital traces are generated mainly from three information sources: Internet and Web applications, static infrastructure, mobile devices and wearable sensors. In this workshop we hope to get people from different disciplines together to share their visions and insights on how to tackle the challenges faced by SCI, such as participatory sensing, heterogeneous data fusion, intelligence extraction, privacy issues, and so on.
