A three-part study was designed to document Internet use in scholarly research, using the Annual SIGIR Conference Proceedings from 1997 through 1999. The results suggest an increasing trend toward electronic self-publishing. Furthermore, while electronic availability did not insure that one would be cited, the most highly cited articles were available on the "free" web. The study also found that electronic availability has not, in most cases, decreased the length of time between publication and citation.
