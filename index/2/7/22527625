A prototype Prolog system has been developed for online bibliographic retrieval. Most online bibliographic retrieval systems may be characterized by queries based on the occurrence of keywords and by databases consisting of possibly millions of records. Such systems have very fast response times but generally lack any deductive reasoning capability.
An expert system for online bibliographic retrieval, developed in Prolog, would provide enhanced retrieval capabilities through the application of deductive reasoning. Such a system would permit knowledge-type queries to be asked in addition to the traditional keyword-type of queries.
A concern with using Prolog to perform an online search of a million-record data base is that the response time would be unacceptable. In order to overcome this drawback two alternatives are examined: a special-purpose hardware device and an extended Prolog capability.
