As developers address the shift towards multi-core processors they are encountering the challenges of debugging hybrid applications that are both multi-threaded and multi-process. Hybrid applications, which share memory among threads on a node but pass messages over the network from node to node, face the challenges of both deadlocks and race conditions. This talk will describe how to tackle these kinds of problems with the precise thread level control afforded by TotalView. Scientists and developers can use these tools and techniques to develop crucial insight into their application and quickly identify and resolve bugs.
