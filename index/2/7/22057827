How can CS faculty at liberal arts colleges better communicate with colleagues and the public about the value our institutions offer? Liberal arts colleges play an important role in undergraduate CS education. Liberal arts skills are widely valued in the tech industry, many liberal arts undergraduates go on to earn Ph.D.s in STEM, and many of the educational innovations presented at SIGCSE are developed by liberal arts faculty. Yet, our colleagues at research universities often misunderstand what we do at liberal arts colleges. And while we see the liberal arts and computer science as supporting each other, the popular media tends to portray them as diametrically opposed. These misconceptions limit our opportunities to attract new students and colleagues, as well as opportunities to contribute to public discourse about the important role of information technology in our society. In this BoF, we aim to collaboratively develop communication strategies for individual participants and for the liberal arts CS community as a whole.
