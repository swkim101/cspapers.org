This poster presents an overview of and the performance results of recent I/O advancements in the parallel CMAQ framework. These optimizations were developed as part of a collaboration between the EPA and Sandia National Laboratories. netCDF provides a portable file format and an easily understood API, but it does not support concurrent writes by multiple processes. In a cluster environment, this leaves two basic options: create a file per process or funnel all the data through a single node. Neither of these options are optimal. Using a slightly modified API, parallel-netCDF (pnetCDF) enables high performance parallel I/O using the MPI-IO collective I/O optimizations while maintaining the netCDF file format. We have created a thin wrapper around pnetCDF that makes it simple for users to enable the new parallel I/O features at compile time. Using parallel I/O has improved the write performance of the CMAQ air-quality modeling code by up to 48%.
