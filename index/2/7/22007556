Teaching Object-Oriented Programming and DesignJames C. McKim Jr., Hartford Graduate Center
A course in object-oriented programming and design orientedparadigm, namely that it promotes reuse, should address the claimsmade for the object- models the problem space, facilitatesmaintenance, incorporates changes easily, and shortens thedevelopment lifecycle. One way (perhaps the only way) for studentsto test such claims is to build a small but high quality product aspart of the course.
This tutorial shows how to have students in a conventionalcomputer science program build such a product, and addresses suchissues as how to pick good projects, whether and how studentsshould work together in teams, how to keep students on schedule,and how to divide a project into a sequence of deliverables withinthe context of a one semester course.
The tutorial also describes how to scale back the approach sothat students in short courses, common in industry, can get maximumbenefit in the limited time that is allowed.
