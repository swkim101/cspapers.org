People who design and develop web product need interdisciplinary knowledge and skills from various fields. Thus in most Chinese vocational colleges, students are lack of a completed experience to fulfill employers' needs before they leave colleges. In this paper, we propose a project-based approach to design the course, in which students unify business, product design and development theories into one project practice to build the web product. Over different stages and increasingly complexity, students learn how to interact with customers, build project management skills, design product with business mind instead of focusing on design aesthetics and developing programming skills only.
