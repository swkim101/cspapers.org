If, in particular, the dynamics of a system of interconnected rigid bodies is determined by a series of static solutions to a set of geometric constraints, the methods described here will allow one to determine the motion of the system in a way suited for use on computer/display hardware. In other cases, i.e., those in which a time-energy analysis is required for solution, more sophisticated algorithms are necessary.
