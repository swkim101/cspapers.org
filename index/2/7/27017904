In this paper, a method for co-evolving morphology and controller of a real biped walking robot is proposed using evolutionary computation. Although certain control theories exist, such as zero moment point (ZMP) compensation, these theories assume humanoid robot morphology is given in advance. Thus, engineers have to design a control program for a priori designed morphology. If morphology and locomotion are considered simultaneously, we do not have to spend time with trial-and-error. The detailed model of morphology is used for morphology in which the characteristics of the servo module are considered. As the controller, pattern generators are used. The biped walking robot which can walk the longest distance are designed with a two step genetic algorithm. As a result, the detailed model of the robot which can walk the longest distance is generated from limited size of chromosomes.
