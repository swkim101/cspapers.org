We consider in this paper the k-cut problem. Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph and let c(.) be a nonnegative capacity function defined on E. A k-cut in G is a partitioning of V into non-empty subsets V1, . . . , Vk. An edge e belongs to the k-cut if its endpoints belong to different subsets of the partition V1,.. . ,Vk. The minimum k-cut problem asks for a k-cut that minimizes the sum of the capacities of the edges belonging to it. We formulate a linear program for the minimum kcut problem. Our main result is that the integrality gap of this linear program is at most 2. We give an elegant proof of this result using geometric arguments. The dual problem of our linear programming formulation is (weak) tree packing. For k = 2 (minimum cuts), the dual is precisely a packing of spanning trees subject to edge capacity constraints. Our result yields an alternative proof to a fractional version of a theorem by Nash-Williams [3] stating that the number of trees that can be packed in a graph is at least half the capacity of a minimum cut. Saran and Vazirani [4] gave a ( 2 2/k)approximation algorithm for the k-cut problem. Their algorithm is combinatorial; it finds successive minimum cuts until a k-cut is found. P r e l i m i n a r i e s : A distance function d on a set V is called a semimetric if: (i) d(i, j ) = d(j, i) for all i, j E V. (ii) d(i,i) = O. (iii) d(i , j ) < d(i,k) + d(j ,k) for all i , j , k E V. We call (V,d) a distance space. A distance space (V, d) is called an ultrametric [2] if it satisfies for all i , j , k E V, d( i , j ) _4 max{d( i ,k ) ,d( j ,k )} . Let (V, d) and (W, d ~) be two distance spaces. Then, (V, d) is said to be isometrically embcddable into (V', d ~) if there exists a mapping ~ from V to V ~ such that for all i , j E V, d(i , j ) = d'(~p(i),~(j)). Given a subset S C V, define a cut semimetric 5s as follows. For all i , j E V, 5s( i , j ) = 1 if i e S and j it S. Otherwise, 5s( i , j ) = O. We denote by t~n the distance space induced by vectors in R m, where distance is with respect to the Ll-norm.
