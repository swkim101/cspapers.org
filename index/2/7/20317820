There is a tight upper bound on the order (the number of vertices) of any d-regular graph of diameter D, known as the Moore bound in graph theory. This bound implies a lower bound D0(n, d) on the diameter of any d-regular graph of order n. Actually, the diameter diam(Gn,d) of a random d-regular graph Gn,d of order n is known to be asymptotically "optimal" as n → ∞. Bollobas and de la Vega (1982) proved that diam(Gn,d) = (1 + o(1)) D0(n, d) = (1 + o(1)) logd−1 n holds w.h.p. (with high probability) for fixed d ≥ 3, whereas there exists a gap diam(Gn,d) − D0(n, d) = Ω(log log n). In this paper, we investigate the gap diam(Gn,d) − D0(n, d) for d = (β + o(1)) nα where α ∈ (0, 1) and β > 0 are arbitrary constants. We prove that diam(Gn,d) = ⌈α−1⌉ + 1 holds w.h.p. for such d. Our result implies that the gap is 1 if α−1 is an integer and d ≥ nα, and is 0 otherwise. One can easily obtain that diam(Gn,d) ≤ ⌈α−1⌉ + 1 holds w.h.p. by using the embedding theorem due to Dudek et al. (2017). Our critical contribution is to show that diam(Gn,d) ≥ ⌈α−1⌉ + 1 holds w.h.p. by the analysis of the distances of fixed vertex pairs.
