This paper studies the problem of multiuser selection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relay networks. In the literature, existing studies consider multiuser selection for relay networks having homogeneous terminals/users (each is equipped with one antenna). Unlike the existing studies, this paper is concerned with the problem of multiuser scheduling in two-way relay networks using space division multiple access (SDMA) for heterogeneous multiuser transmissions. Numerical simulation results show that using block-diagonalization (BD) precoding and greedy user selection can facilitate heterogeneous multiuser relay transmissions which offer higher system capacity than homogeneous multiuser relay transmissions.
