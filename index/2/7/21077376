Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication, taking place in the frequency bands between 30 and 300 GHz, is widely considered to be a key-enabler of future Fifth Generation (5G) Cellular Communication Systems, which will be deployed starting by the year 2020 and will provide a capacity increase up to a factor of 10,000 compared to existing network infrastructures. Main drivers for this upcoming network vision include new spectrum resources and dense network infrastructures, both building on the additional resources provided by mmWave bands. While unused mmWave spectrum opportunities are still available in some regions, it is a fact that incumbents are already taking substantial portions of the spectrum in certain areas. In the framework of this paper, Licensed Shared Access (LSA) Spectrum Sharing technology is proposed to be used as a key enabler in such cases, i.e. for managing Quality of Service (QoS) guaranteed access for future 5G cellular systems, where incumbents are maintain priority access rights to mmWave spectrum.
