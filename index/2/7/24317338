Heterogenous chip multiprocessors (Het-CMPs) offer a combination of large Out-of-Order (OoO) cores optimized for high singlethreaded performance and small In-Order (InO) cores optimized for low-energy and area costs. Due to practical constraints, CMP designers must choose to either optimize for total system throughput by utilizing many InO cores or maximize single-thread execution with fewer OoO cores. We propose Mirage Cores, a novel Het-CMP design where clusters of InO cores are architected around an OoO in a manner that optimizes for both throughput and single-thread performance. The insight behind Mirage Cores is that InO cores can achieve near-OoO performance if they are provided with the dynamic instruction schedule of an OoO core. To leverage this, Mirage Cores employs an OoO core as an optimal instruction schedule generator as well as a high-performance alternative for all neighboring InO cores. We also develop intelligent runtime schedulers which orchestrate the arbitration and migration of applications between the InO cores and the central OoO. Fast and timely transfer of dynamic schedules from the OoO to InO allows Mirage Cores to create the appearance of all OoO cores to the user using underlyingIn-Order hardware. Overall, with an 8 InO per OoO configuration, Mirage Cores can achieve on average 84% of the performance of a CMP with 8 OoO cores, a 28% increase relative to current systems, while conserving 55% of energy and 25% of area costs. We find that we can scale the design to around 12 InOs per OoO before starvation for the OoO starts to hamper system performance.CCS CONCEPTS• Computer systems organization → Multicore architectures; Heterogeneous (hybrid) systems; • Hardware • Chip-level power issues;
