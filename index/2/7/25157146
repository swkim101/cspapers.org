Combining light-weight visual and inertial modalities for motion capturing has been popular in robotics researches. There exist scale ambiguity, inaccurate pose estimation with little or no baseline, incremental drifts over time in visual-inertial fusion. Thus, in this paper, we propose a robust motion capturing method based on the multi-joint kinematic chain using monocular visual-inertial sensors. Our method is able to recover monocular visual scale through the joint geometry constraint. Additionally, we take inertial pre-integration to assist visual outlier removal using Maximum A Posteriori method. Ultimately, the kinematic chain model is leveraged to constrain the associated multiple visual-inertial estimation drifts during long time tracking. In the experiments, we conduct multi-joint capturing on a robotic arm. The quality of motion reconstruction is evaluated by comparing the estimated results with the measurements from an optical motion tracking system OptiTrack.
