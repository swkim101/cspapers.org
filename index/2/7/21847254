Hyperspectral imaging is a useful technique for various computer vision tasks such as material recognition. However, such technique usually requires an expensive and professional setup and is time-consuming because a conventional hyperspectral image consists of a large number of observations. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of one-shot hyperspectral imaging using faced reflectors on which color filters are attached. The key idea is based on the principle that each of multiple reflections on the filters has a different spectrum, which allows us to observe multiple intensities through different spectra. Our technique can be implemented either by a coupled mirror or a kaleidoscope geometry. Experimental results show that our technique is capable of accurately capturing a hyperspectral image by using a coupled mirror setup which is readily available.
