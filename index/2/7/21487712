Panelists will report on the work of the ACM Education Board's ad hoc committee to revise and update the Small College curriculum recommendations published by ACM in 1973. The revised report's completion is expected by the end of 1983.
 A preliminary report will be given which addresses topics including suggested curriculum content, resources needed, implementation problems, and other matters of concern to small colleges attempting to develop and/or maintain a viable computer science program. Audience response will be welcome to provide input to the committee.
