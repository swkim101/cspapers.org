A computer graphics course is extremely hardware system dependent, even more than most computer science courses. To produce high quality graphics images requires a high resolution system with extensive color capability and a fast cpu. Fortunately, the computer graphics capabilities of inexpensive systems have continued to increase. As this trend continues we need to consider changing the way we teach our computer graphics courses. In this paper I discuss a major shift in my teaching methods in the past year. Whereas, previously my students developed their own programs to create images, I have switched to the use of the Pixar RenderMan graphics package in the second graphics course and use it at the end of the first graphics course. I will discuss the rational for this change, mine and the students' experiences with it, and future planned modifications of the courses.
