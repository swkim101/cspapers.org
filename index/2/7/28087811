This paper proposes a reliable an energy efficient routing protocol for transmitting periodic packets on industrial wireless sensor networks. For reliable transmission of periodic packets, the proposed protocol chooses the path has highest end-to-end packet reception rate (e2e_PRR) to transmit data packets. Also, a mechanism is used to reduce the number of control packets. The simulation result has shown that the proposed protocol has a better performance in terms of reliability and control packet overhead than the previous routing protocols.
