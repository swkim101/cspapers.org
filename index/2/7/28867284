Many inductive logic programming systems have operators reorganizing the program so far inferred, such as the intra-construction operator of CIGOL. At the same time, there is a similar reorganizing operator, called the "folding rule," developed in program transformation. We argue that there are advantages in using an extended folding rule as a reorganizing operator for inductive-inference systems. Such an extended folding rule allows an inductive-inference system not only to recognize already-learned concepts, but also to increase the efficiently of execution of inferred programs.
