A newly developed teaching technique designed to help students produce error free code using a block-structured flowcharting method, a block-structured pseudocode, and an implementation language is presented [1]. The posters illustrate how block structure, once established, is maintained in the pseudocode and into an implementation language. The flowcharting method was developed at Draper Labs in connection with the Apollo Program [2].
