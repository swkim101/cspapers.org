Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and documentation projects provide excellent learning opportunities for students. In the context of active learning, FOSS is particularly interesting in providing transparent meritocracies that allow students to observe and contribute as part of their learning. This panel will present four different perspectives on student involvement in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects. These perspectives will cover: (a) different ways that students can contribute to FOSS projects beyond coding, (b) an industry perspective on student involvement in FOSS projects, (c) how Humanitarian FOSS can provide a welcoming environment for student learning, and (d) barriers to faculty involvement and how such barriers can be overcome.
