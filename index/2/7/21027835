In the literature, automatically recognizing lexical entailment for word pairs deeply relies on words' contextual representations. However, as a "prototype" vector, a single representation cannot reveal multifaceted aspects of the words due to their homonymy and polysemy. In this paper, we propose a supervised Context-Enriched Neural Network (CENN) method for recognizing lexical entailment. To be specific, we first utilize multiple embedding vectors from different contexts to represent the input word pairs. Then, through different combination methods and attention mechanism, we integrate different embedding vectors and optimize their weights to predict whether there are entailment relations in word pairs. Moreover, our proposed framework is flexible and open to handle different word contexts and entailment perspectives in the text corpus. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that our approach significantly improves the performance of automatic RLE in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods.
