It is desired to find the values of certain system parameters which maximize some performance criterion. Using standard experimental design techniques, one runs an initial set of experiments which explore the system's response surface. Subsequently, the data are smoothed, and a hill climbing technique is used to locate the maximum. This technique was employed successfully to tune the parameters in an experimental version of the VM/370 scheduler.
