If a student to machine response falls outside a predetermined range during computer based instruction, then some off line procedures (or an ignore command) must be invoked. This observation points out that student to machine response is generally that of a multiple choice format with a perhaps large, but still finite, list of possible responses. In this paper we will discuss the uses of information theory and the Bayesian philosophy of probability to evaluate student to machine responses when there is a well defined set of possible answers.
