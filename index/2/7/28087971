With a growing awareness of the importance of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX) Design and Research in industry, many departments are examining ways to integrate this topic into their curriculum. What are the best ways to do this? Should HCI and UX be integrated into existing courses such as event-driven programming or mobile computing? Or should it be a separate course that integrates visual design, psychology and ergonomics? How important is this topic to students looking for internships and entry-level jobs? At what levels should these topics be taught in the curriculum? This is important as there is a growing demand in industry for User Experience specialists due to an increased focus on software quality and product success. A major complaint of employers is that this skill is lacking in many college graduates. Teaching computing students how to incorporate UX into the design and development process helps to address this critical need. This BOF will let participants share their ideas and learn from their peers. This is particularly relevant as the HCI Knowledge Area of the IEEE/ACM CS Curriculum 2013 is currently being developed. In fact, the chair of the HCI Knowledge Area (Sally Fincher) is seeking real examples of how HCI is taught in curricula across a variety of institutions and settings. After the BOF, we will share a summary of our BOF discussion with the chair.
