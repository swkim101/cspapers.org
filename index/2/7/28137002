A number of trends over the last twenty years have brought the prospect of instant computer power to the ordinary man and woman to near fruition. The arrival of interactive computing coupled with developments in the communications field have enabled man and computer to converse both at high speed and at long distance. Furthermore the decreasing cost of microprocessor hardware has made the acquisition of a computer or remote computer access, affordable by most establishments and many ordinary people. A need exists therefore, to develop usable software interfaces or man-computer dialogues to support this equipment.
 This abstract reports on an experiment which was carried out as part of a research project /5/ to investigate the use which was made of a computer access system, developed by the author, to provide local information to the public.
