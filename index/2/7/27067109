In this paper we introduce a high level nonprocedural language Form Operation by Example (FOBE) to manipulate forms in office systems. The form data model is selected as the basis for the user interface. The idea of query-by-example is applied to forms. A precise semantics definition of the language is given. FOBE has a predetermined structure. It combines the advantages of procedural and nonprocedural languages. We believe that it is user-friendly and sufficiently powerful for office environments.
