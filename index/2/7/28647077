In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of reducing the communication load in distributed model predictive control (DMPC) for mobile robots. The key idea is to project the predicted state trajectory onto a grid resulting in an occupancy grid prediction. This approach has the advantage of utilizing continuous optimization methods while only quantized information is exchanged. We consider non-holonomic mobile robots to numerically and experimentally investigate the proposed method.
