We consider a two-user non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA) communication channel with an iterative multi-user receiver. It is known that NOMA provides performance gains over conventional orthogonal-multiple-access, but it comes at the cost of increased decoder complexity. Moreover, the decoder complexity varies with fraction of duration in which the users' transmissions overlap using NOMA. For this scheme, we present a hardware-friendly implementation of an LDPC-code-based multi-user-detector (MUD). We also present a MATLAB-based high-level design-automation tool that generates hardware descriptions of different NOMA-receivers. Results indicate that the simplified MUD design results in significant area and power savings with negligible impact on performance.
