This paper informally describes the capabilities of a teachable analogy-based language-independent natural language acquisition System known as PUS. Its language comprehension is intended to resemble that of pre-achool children in certain significant aspects. It can be taught, through examples, to understand and acquire the situational aspects (i.e., physical objects, agents, their senaori-motor properties and spatial relations) described in a text. It has no built-in knowledge of English or the domain of discourse. Neither it infers any formal grammar of English.
