Given a set of n hyperplanes hi . . . . , hn E R d the hyperplane depth of a point P E R d is the minimum number of hyperplanes that a ray from P can meet. The hyperplane depth of the arrangement is the maximal depth of points P not in any h~. We give an optimal O(nlogn) deterministic algorithm to compute the hyperplane depth of an arrangement in dimension d = 2. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n a n d S u m m a r y Given a set S -{ h l , . . . , h n } of n the dep th of x E R is defined to be real numbers, (1.1) d ( x ) = min(]{h~ _ x}[, ]{hi ~ x}[), and may be thought of as the "size" of the smallest halfline containing x. A median is a point of maximal depth ([(n + 1)/2]) and may be found in O(n) time. There are many situations for example in Stat is t ics where multivariate generalizations of ranks and order statistics are useful, and several proposals for depth in R a have been made [2], [71. In one of the most familiar ones [14], we are given a set S = { P 1 , . , P n } of n points in R d. The depth, or Tukey depth of x E R d is defined as the minimal number of points of S that must be in a closed halfspace containing x. A median is a point of maximal depth. When d = 1 this notion agrees with the depth in (1.1). It is a well known consequence of Helly's Theorem (e.g.,[6]) that a Tukey median always has depth at least [n/(d + 1)]. Matou~ek [10] has described an algorithm for d = 2 that finds a median in t ime O(n(logn)5). Cole, Sharir and Yap also gave an O(n(logn) 5) algorithm [5], which was further improved by Cole [3] to O(n(logn)3). ~ p u t e r Science. Rutgers University tComputer Science. Rutgers University Recently, Rousseeuw and Hubert [11] proposed an interesting, new notion of depth for R d. Given a s e t S = { h i , . . . , hn} o fn hyperplanes in R d, they defined the hyperplane depth of a point x E R d to be (1.2) 5(x) = min ( r (x ,u ) ) , u:llull=l where r(x,u) is the number of hi E S that meet the ray {x + tu, t > 0} through x in direction u. A median is a point of maximal depth. When d = 1, (1.2) agrees with the usual definition of dep th in (1.1). Hyperplane depth was motivated by problems in robust regression. Using a familiar po in t /hyperp lane dual i ty transformation, the hi dualize to n da ta points in R d and x, to a h y perplane meant to fit the data. The "regression depth" of x in is the minimum number of da ta points x meets in a rotation-to-vertical; this corresponds exactly to the hyperplane depth of x in the original problem. Hyperplane depth has a t t racted much recent interest. On the combinatorial side it was just shown [1] that like the Tukey median, the hyperplane median must have depth at least fn / (d + 1)]; the lower bound is sharp, a t ta ined when the hi are duals of n points on the moment curve in R d. Other interesting combinatorial questions remain open. On the computat ional side. a main quest ion is to determine the complexi ty of selection computing points of given depth, or of maximal depth. We use the unit cost RAM model. The hyperplanes in S part i t ion R d into a complex of O ( n d) c o n v e x cells, called the arrangement of S, and wri t ten A(S) . It i s clear that every point in a cell has the same depth. The depth of the arrangement, 5(A(S)) is the depth of the deepest cell. The task therefore is to compute 8(A(S)), and a witness point of tha t depth, or to find a cell of given depth k _< d(A(S)) .
