We propose a new system to enable the real painting experience on digital platform and extend it to multi-strokes for different painting needs. In this paper, we describe how the FlexStroke is used as Chinese brush, oil brush and crayon with changes of its jamming tip. This tip has different levels of stiffness based on its jamming structure. Visual simulations on PixelSense jointly enhance the intuitive painting process with highly realistic display results.
