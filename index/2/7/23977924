In knowledge graph embedding models, the margin-based ranking loss as the common loss function is usually used to encourage discrimination between golden triplets and incorrect triplets, which has proved effective in many translation-based models for knowledge graph embedding. However, we find that the loss function cannot ensure the fact that the scoring of correct triplets must be low enough to fulfill the translation. In this paper, we present a limit-based scoring loss to provide lower scoring of a golden triplet, and then to extend two basic translation models TransE and TransH, separately to TransE-RS and TransH-RS by combining limit-based scoring loss with margin-based ranking loss. Both the presented models have low complexities of parameters benefiting for application on large scale graphs. In experiments, we evaluate our models on two typical tasks including triplet classification and link prediction, and also analyze the scoring distributions of positive and negative triplets by different models. Experimental results show that the introduced limit-based scoring loss is effective to improve the capacities of knowledge graph embedding.
