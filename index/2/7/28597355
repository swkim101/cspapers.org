An introductory computer science course is presented which uses new techniques appropriate for a liberal arts college. Students learn standard topics by means of a series of guided labs in which they are active participants. The students learn to question, analyse, and construct examples, thereby acquiring the means for further inquiry and understanding. Irrelevant stumbling blocks are minimized in the hope that the positive learning process will be something they continue on their own.
