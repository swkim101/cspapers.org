The Object Database Management Group (ODMG) is a consortium of object-oriented DBMS vendors that have developed a standard interface for their products, ODMG-93. The standard includes a common architecture and deftition for an object-oriented DBMS, a common object model with an object deftition language, a common object query language, and standardized progr amming language bindings, cumently for C++ and Smalltalk. An object-oriented DBMS (by ODMGâ€™S defiition) provides programming language bindings with direct, transparent persistence for data structures, in contrast to the embedded language bindings used in most DBMSS. The common object model allows data to be shared across programming languages. This model incorporates object Ills, encapsulation, methods, frost-class types, multiple inheritance, relationships, lists, sets, bags, arrays, and many other features.
