A description is given of a circuit analysis program which was modified specifically for operation in a conversational time-sharing environment.
 Program features which facilitate communication and interaction between the engineer and the computer include:
 1) Input from a remote terminal with complete language checking routines which allow input errors to be detected and corrected immediately, without aborting the run.
 2) Automatic tab to column 7 by means of an asterisk (*).
 3) File management capability within the program, permitting automatic storage of correct input cards for future runs. Input from a previously written and stored file is also possible.
 4) Editing capability: the data in a file may be listed, changed, or deleted line by line.
 5) Selective output capability, permitting selection of up to 12 random branch or node output variables.
 Furthermore, graphical output is available both “on-ilne”, or on the line printer for “batch” jobs.
 The program will handle circuits up to 40 nodes and 120 branches; it requires 22,000 24-bit words of memory (66K Bytes) when segmented into five links.
 An on-line demonstration will be presented at the conference site using a “2741” terminal, with Data-Phone connected to the Perkin-Elmer Time-Sharing Computer in Norwalk, Connecticut.
