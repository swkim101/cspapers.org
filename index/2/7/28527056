Communication failures may occur because of residual hardware or software implementation flaws, operator errors, transmission noises and transient or permanent machine failures. For packet switched network operation, some means are necessary to detect the errors and to analyze the phenomena to identify the causes of the errors, since, generally, it is almost impossible to predict errors or to implement systems without errors or failures. This paper describes general aspects of communication protocol analysis, protocol analysis technologies for CCITT X.25 and the protocol analyzer to be used in DDX packet switched network operation.
