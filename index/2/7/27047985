We present efficient geometric algorithms for several problems of approximating an n-vertex polygonal path with angle constraints in the d-D space for any fixed d âªˆ 2, improving significantly the corresponding graph- theoretic solutions based on known techniques (e.g., by (nearly) a factor of n for d = 2, 3). As a key step in our solutions, we formulate and solve an interesting problem called off-line ball exclusion search (OLBES), that may be of interest on its own.
