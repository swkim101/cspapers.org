The reflex-like feedback control similar to a spinal reflex of the human muscular control system is applied to the tendon-driven manipulator. The reflex-like control is realized by the state feedback of driving force, joint angle and angular velocity. The effects of the reflex-like control are discussed by an analysis of a linearized model and the simulation of a nonlinear system. It is found that the reflex-like feedback is effective in stabilizing the system and in reducing the interaction.<<ETX>>
