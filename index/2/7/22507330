The use of two arms simplifies manipulatory tasks such as assembly of an object from large parts which cannot be handled by one arm. This paper describes the control method for coordination of two arms. As fundamental tasks, the parallel transfer task and the rotational transfer task are considered. More complex tasks are accomplished by using these two modes simultaneously. The control of motor torque of each joint is adopted instead of joint position control. The wrist force sensor is used in order to measure the interactive force between two arms.
