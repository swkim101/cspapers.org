The Urban Archivist Application is designed to capture Urban Artwork and its associated metadata from around the world. The Application itself is available for mobile platforms and has a web-interface for viewing the data. Urban Archivist allows users to take photos of urban art they may find while out in the field on research. Once these photos are gathered, the application will automatically grab all the associated metadata from the image and populate those field within the application, minimizing user error. The user will then enter their own findings regarding the image and may upload it to the central database. This art and its associated metadata is instantly available to view by any individual using either the web or mobile Urban Archivist interface. Furthermore, we want to be able to build a dataset large enough to explore and contribute to the realms of machine learning and virtual reality. The goal of this research project is to implement something that has been done prior, while adding modern technological options available to increase the research opportunities for Computer Science and Humanitarian scholars. Preliminary tests via the prototype confirmed the project's ability to achieve this goal.
