Too often, attempted change and change planning suffers from inadequate insight, coordination, and involvement. Decision makers frequently get caught up in power/political contests, utilize and are impacted by cognitive (Anderson, 1991) or organizational (Grudin, 1991) structures and procedures that hinder beneficial cooperation/participation, and focus excessively on visible technology end-states and inadequately on business and human processes, underlying infrastructure, and enabling intermediate-states. Hence, resulting change, if achieved at all, is often change without readiness, buy-in, or gain.
