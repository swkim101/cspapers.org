Reduced crossbar switches (RXBSs) with crosspoints between N2 and N(N-1)/2, where N is the switch size, were investigated from an architectural point of view. Conventional RXBSs have been created by removing parts of 2Ã—2 switching cells from crossbar switches, while maintaining the switches' planar structure and wide-sense nonblocking property. In this paper, we consider an extended class of RXBSs that has a 3D structure or a rearrangeably nonblocking capability. We introduce such new RXBSs and discuss their performance.
