Since 1973, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, through the Bureau of the Census, has conducted a yearly nationwide survey of housing. Data on a wide range of topics are collected during face to face interviews with over 190,000 individuals. Plainly, the Annual Housing Surveys represent one of the largest longitudinal general social and economic data collection efforts ever undertaken.Due to changing policy and substantive interests, as well as government requirements, the interview schedules have changed significantly from year to year. Since the great potential for data from the Annual Housing Survey is in longitudinal analysis, it is necessary to have common variable definitions and consistent formats.To accomplish this, we have developed and implemented a system which includes: 1) documentation of the variables, questionnaires, and files across all years and surveys; 2) files created using one homogeneously defined data structure; 3) a simple system to produce custom user files; 4) a method to easily produce routine custom analyses and tabulations using the data.We have applied the relational model to create a small data base which documents the interview schedules, files and variable definitions. From this we produce up to date documentation and computer programs which are used to update the Annual Housing Survey data base, to handle custom file requests, and to perform analyses.
