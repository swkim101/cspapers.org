In the research on spectrum sensing, many works focus on TV bands, in which primary user signals follow digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T) standard. However, DVB-T2 is the next generation of this standard. Some characteristics of the primary signal are changed including the pilot pattern and the cyclic prefix (CP). This issue results that the existing sensing algorithms based on the characteristics of DVB-T are not suitable for DVB-T2 signal, or become complex. In this paper, we propose a new sensing algorithm for DVB-T2 signal based on the first preamble symbol of DVB-T2 frame. We derive analytical forms for the detection. The detector works well at the SNR of -10dB with the false alarm of 0.01, with very short sensing time (0.224ms) and with all configurations of DVB-T2. Moreover, we propose a sensing scheme based on this algorithm for practical cognitive radio systems.
