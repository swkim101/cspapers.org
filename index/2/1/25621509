Person re-identification is a challenge in video-based surveillance where the goal is to identify the same person in different camera views. In recent years, many algorithms have been proposed that approach this problem by designing suitable feature representations for images of persons or by training appropriate distance metrics that learn to distinguish between images of different persons. Aggregating the results from multiple algorithms for person re-identification is a relatively less-explored area of research. In this paper, we formulate an algorithm that maps the ranking process in a person re-identification algorithm to a problem in graph theory. We then extend this formulation to allow for the use of results from multiple algorithms to make a consensus-based decision for the person re-identification problem. The algorithm is unsupervised and takes into account only the matching scores generated by multiple algorithms for creating a consensus of results. Further, we show how the graph theoretic problem can be solved by a two-step process. First, we obtain a rough estimate of the solution using a greedy algorithm. Then, we extend the construction of the proposed graph so that the problem can be efficiently solved by means of Ant Colony Optimization, a heuristic path-searching algorithm for complex graphs. While we present the algorithm in the context of person reidentification, it can potentially be applied to the general problem of ranking items based on a consensus of multiple sets of scores or metric values.
