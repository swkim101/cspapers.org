In a lossless bandpass filter, the amplitude response function is determined by a certain number of coordinate points. For a given order and class of filter function the number of finite and infinite attenuation points is uniquely determined. Displaying the amplitude response with its selected set of coordinate points, this function may be varied by shifting the points with a light pen. Subsequent computation and display of the group time delay function facilitates a compromise between both response requirements. The process is applied to the example case design of a 12th order IF filter for color television receivers.
