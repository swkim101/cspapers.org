Instructors of introductory Computer Science coursesoften look for new pedagogical tools to help studentslearn concepts like recursion, bg-oh notation, abstractio~and sorting. Whether these concepts are introduced attheendof the first Computer Science course or duringthe second, students often encounter difficulty inmastering them. Since these concepts are interwovenwith many subsequent topics, failure to master themcompletely can make it difficult for students to continuetheir study of computer science.In this paper the authors relate an approach toreinforcing key topics such as recursion, big-oh notation,abstraction, and sorting. This approach--adding a shortScheme unit to the CS2 course--yields additional benefits,all compatible with
