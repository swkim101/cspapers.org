BACKIS is a system of computer aids that is being used by physical designers and draftsmen engaged in the laying out of multilayer printed wire backplanes and high density digital circuit packs at Bell Laboratories. BACKIS has a central data base called the Interconnection File (IF) which is manipulated by means of a general purpose data management system. The application programs of BACKIS run against this central file in an IBM 360/370 environment.
