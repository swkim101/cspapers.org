We describe results from an ongoing project that considers question types and document features and their relationship to retrieval techniques. We examine eight document features from the top 25 documents retrieved from 74 questions and find that lists and FAQs occur in more documents judged relevant to task-oriented questions than those judged relevant to fact-oriented questions.
