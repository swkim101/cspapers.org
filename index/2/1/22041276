Synthetic collections of XML documents can be useful in many applications, such as benchmarking (e.g., Xmark [4], XOO7 [2]) and algorithm testing and evaluation. We present ToXgene, a template-based tool for facilitating the generation of large, consistent collections of synthetic XML documents. ToXgene was designed with the following requirements in mind: it should be declarative, to speed the data generation up; it should be general enough to generate fairly complex XML content and it should be powerful enough to capture the most common kinds of constraints in popular benchmarks. Preliminary experimental results show that our tool can closely reproduce the data sets for the Xmark and the TPC-H benchmarks [6]. The ToXgene Template Specification Language (TSL) is a subset of the XML Schema notation augmented with annotations for specifying certain properties of the intended data, such as probability distributions, the vocabulary for CDATA content, etc. We use XML Schema as the basis for TSL not only because it is a W3C standard, but also because it provides a more detailed description of XML documents than DTDs; in particular, it allows the specification of datatypes. We note that our tool gives the user total control over the data to be generated; thus, it is intended for the cases when the user knows the structure of the data she wants and requires the data to conform to this structure (however, we note that the structure does not have to be regular). The main features of our tool are:
