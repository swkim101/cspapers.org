The first edition of SAPS (in 2004) focused on the development of tools to automate software engineering processes with support for security. Our focus in this edition will be on the tools to automate processing, validation and monitoring of security requirements, both during development and during operation of the system. Security and reliability issues are rarely considered at the initial stages of software development. The erroneous consideration of security technology as supplementary, and the lack of integration of security engineering techniques within software engineering processes have very negative consequences. Approaches integrating security issues in software engineering processes are especially relevant to SAPS. Good security measures can fail due to errors in design or implementation. Therefore, automated tools are essential for the analysis and deployment of secure systems. Comprehensive approaches, encompassing all phases of development are encouraged. Furthermore, in the near future, the increasing dynamism, heterogeneity and complexity of emerging computing paradigms and environments such as grid computing, mixed-mode systems or ambient intelligence, along with the disappearing notion of system boundaries introduced by these paradigms, will make it impossible for security engineers to foresee all possible situations that may arise during system operation, therefore increasing the need for automated support for the processing of security.
