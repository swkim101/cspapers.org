There is the concern that despite many promising production concepts, organizational models and development of new technologies during the last decades, the mining industry faces a large gap between expectations and real implementation [1]. There is also the realization that increased automation, combined with an ever tougher global competition, will lead large industrial companies to rely on a lean organization with multi-skilled workers capable of managing multiple areas of the business, with technology and work built around ‘autonomation’, where people and machines cooperate [2]. In this respect therefore, process automation and remote operation technologies in automated work will enable smarter, and more integrated automated work systems. The expectation here is to make the automated work system of the future become a substantially different place to that of today. Yet, there prevails the problem of how to model such intelligent production systems of the “future automated work systems” for them to become enablers for learning and collaboration across organizational borders. Abrahamsson et al. [3] has observed that even if the idea of a holistic perspective on production systems is commonplace in most research areas of today, there is a true challenge in multidisciplinary research that reconnect the research fields and their theories, methods, ideas and results. This, on the one hand, reinforces the prevailing problem of developing a holistic work organization model to guide the future integration of the deep-mining companies’ technical, organizational and human systems. On the other hand, it reinforces the challenge of developing deep-specialized knowledge in areas associated with each of these systems (i.e. technical, organizational and human) that could contribute towards the attainment of a visualized (or hypothesized) automated work system of the future (i.e. an Intelligent-work system) as it will be highlighted in the section below.
