The communications industry is on the brink of a revolution, as evidenced by almost daily newspaper articles on cable TV, wireless phones, and “information highways”. Just as CAD/CASE applications have had a profound effect on the database community in the 80s, so are network applications likely to in the 90s. This tutorial explores the crucial role that databases play in wide-area communications networks. Wide area communications networks have been around for a long time. Ad hoc application-specific solutions have been adopted for data management. With rapid changes the communications industry is currently undergoing, and exponential growth in traffic volume, such “hard-wired” solutions are no longer acceptable, and generic database software is desired. However, traditional databases do not provide all the features required in networks, as we discuss below. There are three major layers at which it is relevant to consider database needs in a large network: network operation, network management, and network services. Database requirements differ between the three, and we consider each in turn.
