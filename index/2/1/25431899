Rewriting logic semantics provides an environment for defining new and existing languages. These language definitions are formal and executable, providing language interpreters almost for free while also providing a framework for building analysis tools, such as type checkers, model checkers, and abstract interpreters. Large subsets of several existing object-oriented languages have been defined, while a new research language, KOOL, has been created as a platform for experimenting with language features and type systems. At the same time, new tools and formalisms aimed specifically at programming languages are being developed.
