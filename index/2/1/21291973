Discovery, the process under which parties to legal cases must reveal documents relevant to the disputed issues is a core aspect of trials in the United States, and a lesser but important factor in other countries. Discovery on documents stored in computerized systems (known variously as electronic discovery, e-discovery, e-disco, EDD, and ED) is increasingly the major factor in discovery, and has become a multi-billion dollar industry. I will discuss the basics of e-discovery, the scale and diversity of the materials involved, and the economics of identifying and reviewing potentially responsive material. I will then focus on three major IR areas of interest: search, supervised machine learning (including text classification and relevance feedback), and interface support for manual relevance assessment. For each, I will discuss technologies currently used in e-discovery, the evaluation methods applicable to measuring effectiveness, and existing research results not yet seeing commercial practice. I will also outline research directions that, if successfully pursued, would potentially be of great interest in e-discovery applications. A particular focus will be on areas where researchers can make progress without access to operational e-discovery environments or "realistic" test collections. Connections will be drawn with the use of IR in related tasks, such as enterprise search, criminal investigations, intelligence analysis, historical research, truth and reconciliation commissions, and freedom of information (open records or sunshine law) requests.
