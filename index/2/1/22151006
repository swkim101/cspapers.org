Participants will learn how to install Scratch, the Xbox Kinect libraries, and the software that integrates the two. The participant will then practice basic Scratch programming, and then learn how to program Scratch when connected to an Xbox Kinect. Five programming challenges will be given to participants, ranging from easy to difficult. During these activities, the participants will experience the excitement of using their bodies (instead of a mouse and keyboard) as the program controller. Discussions will be held to think about human-computer interactions, standard interaction models, etc., as well as how to help students engage more deeply with computer programming activities. Participants will work in teams of 3 or 4 using participant-supplied laptops running Windows 7.
