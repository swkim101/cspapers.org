This paper describes a method of translating a predicate-argument structure of a verb into that of an equivalent verb, which is a core component of the dictionary-based paraphrasing. Our method grasps several usages of a headword and those of the def-heads as a form of their case frames and aligns those case frames, which means the acquisition of word sense disambiguation rules and the detection of the appropriate equivalent and case marker transformation.
