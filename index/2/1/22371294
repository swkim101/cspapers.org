The pipeline stall in distributed-controlled coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays is a major source stumbling performance. This work presents a Triggered-Issue and Triggered-Execution (TITE) paradigm motivated from the Triggered Instruction Architecture (TIA) which converts control and data dependencies into predicate dependencies as triggers for spatial parallelism. TITE separately triggers the issuing and execution of instructions to further relax the predicate dependencies in TIA. Triggered dual instructions and tag forwarding are proposed to minimize pipeline stalls of both intra and inter-processing elements. Experiments show that TITE improves performance, energy efficiency, and area efficiency by 21%, 17%, and 12%, respectively, compared with TIA.
