In this paper, we propose a complete scheme to control a mirror, using a visual servoing scheme, using lines as a set of visual features. Considering the equations of the projection of the reflection of a lines on a mirror, this paper introduces the theoretical background that allows to control the mirror using visual information. Experiments using a mirror mounted on the end-effector of a 6 d.o.f robot validate the proposed approach.
