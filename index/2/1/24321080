We have heard much discussion, in recent years, about various contexts for teaching Computer Science. One that does not get a lot of attention, but frankly deserves more, is the notion of using word games -- in which language plays a predominant role -- to teach Computer Science. There is a plethora of clever and simply fun games that can be used to illustrate almost any concept that arises in CS1 and CS2. We would like to start a conversation with other SIGCSE attendees who are interested in these very entertaining, algorithmically stimulating games, and see what techniques they use, and what successes they have had, in incorporating them into the classroom.
