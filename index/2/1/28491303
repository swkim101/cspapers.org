Operating systems security is relatively new area. Most Operating Systems were designed without adequate attention to security since the primary concerns were economic. In this paper we present a new architecture that facilitates the design of secure time-shared Operating Systems. This approach differs from others that rely on verification to achieve security. In the proposed architecture, encryption is used to enforce the security policies.
