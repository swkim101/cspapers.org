Falls are a significant problem for the elderly living independently in the home. Many falls occur due to household objects left in open spaces. We present KinSpace, a system that uses real-time depth data and human-in-the-loop feedback to adjust its understanding of the open space of an environment. We present results showing the effectiveness of our underlying technical solutions in identifying open spaces and obstacles. The results for both lab testing and a small deployment in an actual home show over 80% accuracy for open space detection and 70% accuracy in obstacle detection even in the presence of many real world issues.
