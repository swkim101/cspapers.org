Cross-Device User Linking is the task of detecting same users given their browsing logs on different devices (e.g., tablet, mobile phone, PC, etc.). The problem was introduced in CIKM Cup 2016 together with a new dataset provided by Data-Centric Alliance (DCA). In this paper, we present insightful analysis on the dataset and propose a solution to link users based on their visited URLs, visiting time, and profile embeddings. We cast the problem as pairwise classification and use gradient boosting as the leaning-to-rank model. Our model works on a set of features exacted from URLs, titles, time and session data derived from user device-logs. The model outperforms the best solution in the CIKM Cup by a large margin.
