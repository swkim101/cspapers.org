Oracle's corporate mission is to enable the Information Age through network computing, a vision of broader access to information for all and the empowerment and increased productivity that can result. The technology implications of the network computing vision are ubiquitous access via low-cost appliances to smaller numbers of larger databases, accessed via professionally managed networks compliant with open internetworking protocols. The latest release of the Oracle data server, Oracle8, provides new technology for management of very large databases containing rich and user-defined data types, and is continuing to evolve to make it economically beneficial to store all forms of digital information in a database.
