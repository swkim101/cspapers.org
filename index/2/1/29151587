Understanding user interests and expertise is a vital component toward creating rich user models for information personalization in social media, recommender systems and web search. To capture the pair-wise interactions between geo-location and user's topical profile in social-spatial systems, we propose the modeling of fine-grained and multi-dimensional user geo-topic profiles. We then propose a two-layered Bayesian hierarchical user factorization generative framework to overcome user heterogeneity and another enhanced model integrated with user's contextual information to alleviate multi-dimensional sparsity. Through extensive experiments, we find the proposed model leads to a 5\textasciitilde13% improvement in precision and recall over the alternative baselines and an additional 6\textasciitilde11% improvement with the integration of user's contexts.
