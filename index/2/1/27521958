We show that the class of properties of programs expressible in propositional temporal logic can be substantially extended if we assume the programs to be <i>data-independent.</i> Basically, a program is data-independent if its behavior does not depend on the specific data it operates upon. Our results significantly extend the applicability of program verification and synthesis methods based on propositional temporal logic.
