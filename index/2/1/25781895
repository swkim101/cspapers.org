Traditional Web page clustering algorithms use the full-text in the documents to generate feature vectors. Such methods often produce unsatisfactory results because there is much noisy information, such as decoration, interaction, and advertisement, in Web pages. The varying-length problem of the Web pages is also a significant negative factor affecting the performance. In this paper, we investigate the use of several summarization techniques to tackle these issues when clustering Web pages. Compared with the full-text representation of the Web pages, our experimental results indicate that our proposed approach effectively solves the problems of noisy information and varying-length, and thus significantly boosts the clustering performance.
