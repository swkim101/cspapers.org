This paper presents the new World Wide Web search engine called “Fast Speculative Search Engine JJ that uses speculative execution on multiprocessor systems to shorten the total time to retrieve information from the WWW. The proposed search engine predicts the user’s next queries and initiates the searches with the predicted queries before receiving them to accelerate narrowing the search space. This kind of speculation is classified as the data value speculation [2], which are mainly studied as the scheme to extract the instruction level parallelism in a processor. However, there have been no systems that adopt such speculation on multiprocessor systems. We have implemented the fast speculative search engine using the data speculation on the EM-X[4] which is shown in Fig.l(l). The EM-X, which consists of 80 processors, is a highly parallel computer which can tolerate communication latency by using low latency communication and multithreading. The peak performance of the EM-X is 1.6 GIPS / 3.2GFLOPS and the point to point network throughput is 37.2 MB/s. On the EM-X,
