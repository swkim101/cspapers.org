Empirical studies of adaptive annotation in the educational context have demonstrated that it can help students to acquire knowledge faster, improve learning outcomes, reduce navigational overhead, and encourage non-sequential navigation. Over the last 8 years we have explored a lesser known effect of adaptive annotation -- its ability to significantly increase student engagement in working with non-mandatory educational content. In the presence of adaptive link annotation, students tend to access significantly more learning content; they stay with it longer, return to it more often and explore a wider variety of learning resources. This talk will present an overview of our exploration of the addictive links effect in many course-long studies, which we ran in several domains (C, SQL and Java programming), for several types of learning content (quizzes, problems, interactive examples). The first part of the talk will review our exploration of a more traditional knowledge-based personalization approach and the second part will focus on more recent studies of social navigation and open social student modeling.
