However, the existing STR algorithms are useless for negative table constraints. In this work, we propose a novel STR algorithm and its improvement, which work on negative table constraints. Our preliminary experiments are performed on some random instances and a certain benchmark instances. The results show that the new algorithms outperform GAC-valid and the MDD-based GAC algorithm.
