A majority of engineering students are apprehensive about the first courses they take in which they are expected to solve differential equations. Fluid mechanics in aeronautical engineering is perhaps the most difficult engineering specialty from the point of view of differential equations. For this reason, aeronautics instructors should become familiar with and use techniques which make the solutions to differential equations less frightening to the students. Versatile computer techniques to demonstrate the characteristics of solutions to differential equations and the effect of boundary conditions on their solutions are currently available for student use. Several of the computational techniques not requiring an extensive computer background are discussed.
