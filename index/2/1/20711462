In this paper, a new physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme is proposed for multiple-input multiple-output two-way relay networks where all network nodes, including two terminal nodes and the relay node, are equipped with multiple antennas. Spatial division multiplexing (SDM) technique is used at the two source nodes to increase transmission rate while the physical-layer network coding based on channel quantization (CQ-PNC) is used at the relay node to achieve diversity gain. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms significantly both of the previous channel quantization based PNC (CQ-PNC) and SDM-PNC schemes.
