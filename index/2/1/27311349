Solving a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) by Maintaining Arc Consistency (MAC) [Sabin and Freuder, 1994] has been one of the most widely-used methods. Since Arc Consistency (AC) is enforced at every node in a search tree, its efficiency is critical to the whole algorithm. We propose a new MAC algorithm based on AC-3.1 [Zhang and Yap, 2001] in which the AC component is capable of starting from where it left off in its previous execution with low overhead. It has the following properties: (1) O(ed) worst-case time complexity in any node and any branch of the search tree; (2) O(ed) space complexity; (3) the ability to avoid a type of redundant constraint check called a negative repeat; (4) no recomputation and maintenance of its internal data structures upon backtrack.
