High performance cluster usage, based on multi-core and multi-processor servers, is rapidly growing. The main propose is to increase the application performance, but not all of the application can benefit from this technology for now. The session will exploit the new architecture and the requirements not only from the application perspective, but also from the cluster design perspective. Is there a need to increase the interconnect links from each server to answer the throughput capabilities? What will fit the new environment more, non-offload or fully-offload interconnects?The session will consist of:Discussion on the multi-core usage and acceptances throughout the HPC segments, from enterprise to personal.Discussion on the proper interconnect model. How many ports are needed per core? Transport offload or CPU offloads?An example of future usage - virtual vehicle design will be outlined.
