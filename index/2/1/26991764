Event recommendation has become an important issue in event-based social networks (EBSN). In this paper, we study how to exploit diverse relations in an EBSN as well as individual history preferences to recommend preferred events. We first construct a hybrid graph consisting of different types of nodes to represent available entities in an EBSN. The graph uses explicit relations as edges to connect nodes of different types; while transferring implicit relations of event attributes to interconnect the event nodes. After executing the graph random walking, we obtain the candidate events with high convergency probabilities. We next extract a user preference from his attended events to further compute his interest similarities to his candidate events. The recommended event list is then obtained by combining the two similarity scores. Data sets from a real EBSN are used to examine the proposed scheme, and experiment results validate its superiority over peer schemes.
