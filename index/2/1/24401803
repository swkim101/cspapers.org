.NET Language Integrated Query (LINQ) is based on the philosophy that querying should be native to your object-oriented programming language. LINQ allows you to write queries in a uniform way in your programming language itself, taking full advantage of strong typing and tool support. Any data source provider can plug into the LINQ framework, allowing it to be queried from within any .NET programming language in a strongly typed, uniform way. This demo focuses on querying in C#. We show the strongly typed querying experience across in-memory collections, relational databases and XML documents.
