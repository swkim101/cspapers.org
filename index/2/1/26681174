In this paper, we aim to directly measure a CS4HS workshop's participating teachers' ability to synthesize CSTA computational thinking core concepts into actionable lesson plans for courses in their current teaching repertoire. Participants were expected to present a lesson plan on the final day of the workshop, highlighting the integration of their classroom curriculum with computing and computational thinking skills. We present our evaluation rubric, used to rate the teachers effective use of the computational thinking core concepts in their lesson plans, and describe how our method of evaluation may more accurately gauge the overall impact that CS4HS workshops have on their participants.
