Each year a small group of computer science educators are selected to become chairs of their departments. This experience is often referred to as "losing the lottery." The panelists have a different view. We believe that department chairs make important contributions to the success of their departments. Department chairs help new faculty develop as educators and professionals. Department chairs help to create an environment where students and faculty can enjoy their work and be productive. Department chairs can facilitate curriculum development and change, thereby helping keep the department's offerings current.The panelists have experience in a variety of educational environments. All have served as department heads. All have had to deal with the normal problems that department heads deal with - recruiting new faculty, obtaining funds for equipment, getting adequate funds for faculty salaries, acquiring technical support personnel, dealing with rapid increases in the number of majors, arranging teaching schedules, assisting with grant proposals, etc.Most department chairs have little or no guidance as they begin their tenure. This panel is an attempt to alleviate this problem. The panelists believe that their experiences can help new department chairs adjust to the multiple and sometimes conflicting demands of their new job.
