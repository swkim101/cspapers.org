Requirements Engineering begins to attract attention as a trump letting a project succeed and software improve its reliability. There already exist a lot of research results in requirements engineering area, and they seem to be helpful for practitioners. However, it is not so easy to use such research results because most of them do not provide stable and scalable tool support. One of the reasons is that tasks in requirements engineering highly depend on human decisions and/or insights and it seems to be hard to achieve such tasks systematically and automatically. Of course, we can find several tools to support requirements engineering process. For example, there is a survey of requirements management tools in INCOSE site [1]. Tools for goal oriented requirements analysis can be found in [2] and [3]. One of the common points of such tools is they are really helpful to achieve human-centric tasks in requirements engineering. Therefore, we have to explore what kinds of systematic or automatic support could be provided to improve humancentric tasks in requirements engineering. That is the reason why we plan this workshop. In this workshop, participants will explore tools to support requirements processes: e.g. requirements elicitation, requirement specification, requirements validation, or requirements management.
