Modelling plays a vital and pervasive role in software engineering: it provides means to manage complexity via abstraction, and enables the creation of larger, more complex systems. Search-based software engineering (SBSE) offers a productive and proven approach to software engineering through automated discovery of near-optimal solutions to problems, and has proven itself to be effective on a wide variety of software-and systems engineering problems. CMSBSE 2013 was a forum allowing researchers from both communities to meet, discuss synergies and differences, and present topics related to the intersection of search and modelling. Particular goals of CMSBSE were to highlight that SBSE and modelling have substantial conceptual and technical synergy, and to identify and present opportunities in which they can be combined, whilst also aiming to grow the community working in this area.
