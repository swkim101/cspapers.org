For lecturers who are used to presenting face-to-face, facilitating online classes through a virtual classroom interface proposes several new challenges. At the same time the affordances of the media offer many opportunities to improve the quality of students' learning. This paper outlines the pedagogical lessons derived from convening a first year introductory programming unit through a series of twelve, two-hour online classes. General virtual classroom strategies as well as those particular to computer science are described. Approaches to developing students' virtual classroom competencies, approaches to groupwork, and the implications of virtual classrooms for professional development and research are also discussed.
