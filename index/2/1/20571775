Increasing amounts of data have made the use of machine learning techniques much more widespread. A lot of research in machine learning has been dedicated to the design and application of effective and efficient algorithms to explain or predict facts. The development of intelligent machines that can learn over extended periods of time, and that improve their abilities as they execute more tasks, is still a pending contribution from computer science to the world. This weakness has been recognised for some decades, and an interest to solve it seems to be increasing, as demonstrated by recent leading work and broader discussions at main events in the field [Chen et al., 2016]. Our research is intended to help fill that gap.
