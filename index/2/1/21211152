Few, if any, pedagogical practices exist for helping students embrace best practices in writing software documentation, particularly source code comments. Although instructors often stress the importance of good commenting, two problems exist. First, it can be difficult to actually define these best practices, and second, it can be difficult to grade or assess students' application of such methods/practices. This Birds-of-a-Feather session focuses on capturing for dissemination a concrete list of code commenting best practices used by the attendees as they teach their classes.
 We will aim to facilitate the development of commenting best practices by collecting the experiences and suggestions of the BOF attendees into a concrete list of practices and initiatives (and we plan to post this to our publicly accessible project wiki). Additionally, we plan to report on our progress in creating and deploying the COMTOR system, an NSF-funded project that supports feedback to students and grading capabilities for instructors of student source code comments.
