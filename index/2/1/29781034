The joint parameters of redundant manipulators are prerequisite data for effective dynamics control. An identification method via fuzzy theory and Genetic Algorithm has been presented to study modular redundant robots. The Genetic Algorithm is used in the fuzzy optimization expecting to obtain global optimal solutions. Experimental modal analysis and Finite Element Method have been exploited in dynamics modeling. The joint parameters of a 9-DOF modular redundant robot have been identified. Active vibration control has been approached to a simplified 4-DOF modular manipulator by DOF reduction to the 9-DOF modular manipulator.
