In this paper, we present the Wikitop system to automatically generate topic trees from the input text by performing hierarchical classification using the Wikipedia Category Network (WCN). Our preliminary results over a collection of 125 articles are encouraging and show potential of a robust methodology for automated topic tree generation.
