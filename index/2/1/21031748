Much has been written and spoken about the capabilities of emerging designs for Local Area Networks (LAN's). The objective for this panel session was to gather together companies and agencies that have brought LAN's into operation. Questions about the performance of LANs have piqued the curiosity of the computer/communications community.
 Each member of the panel briefly described his or her LAN installation and workload as a means of introduction to the audience. Questions about performance were arranged into a sequence by performance attributes. Those attributes thought to be of greatest important were discussed first. Discussion on the remainder of the attributes continued as time and audience interaction permitted.
