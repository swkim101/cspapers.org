Half-duplex energy harvesting (EH) amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relaying (TWR) significantly improves spectral and energy efficiency, excellently satisfying stringent requirements of 5G (Fifth-Generation) mobile communication networks. The current paper proposes an outage probability analysis framework for such relaying over Nakagami-m fading channels. Toward this end, we first derive an exact outage probability expression and then verify its validity by computer simulations. Eventually, it is used to demonstrate system performance behaviors in key operation parameters.
