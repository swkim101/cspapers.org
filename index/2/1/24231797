At the University of Guelph there has been a single significant introductory computer science course. Approximately 50% of the University's full time undergraduate students have taken this course during their academic career. Sectioning and enrollment has generally been done without regard to academic program or semester in school.
 An examination of the past two years' results was performed utilizing the records of 1,350 students. Negligible correlations were found between a student's sex, academic program or semester in school when posed against the students' grades (both final and by grade component). All three results are contrary to the normal implicit assumptions regarding competitiveness between sexes, academic programs and student experience in a computer science course.
