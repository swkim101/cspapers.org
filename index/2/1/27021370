For Internet-based tele-robotic systems (Internet robots), the most challenging and distinct difficulties are associated with Internet transmission delays, delay jitter and not-guaranteed bandwidth availability, which might lead to dramatic performance degradation or even instability. In this paper, a new approach to dealing with these problems is explored and implemented. Specifically, a rate-based end-to-end transport protocol is developed for real-time data transmission and an adaptive control scheme is developed to control the robot remotely. A mobile robot teleoperation system, ArtBot-I, is developed to verify and test the solutions. In the experiments, the users successfully guided a Pioneer-2 mobile robot through a laboratory environment remotely via the Internet using a web browser.
