Software-reliability-engineered testing (SRJZT) is testing of software-based systems that employs reliability objectives and profiles of system use to speed testing while ensuring the necessary reliability. SRET is unique in giving testers more power to ensure the necessary reliability in minimum delivery time and cost. It increases tester productivity and reduces test time, as compared to nonengineered testing. It improves customer satisfaction, reducing the risk of angry users. SRJ3T is a standard, proven practice [l].
