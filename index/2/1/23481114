This paper introduces the concept of testing students' microcomputer skills through direct computer use. Techniques are discussed which make it feasible for the instructor to grade the disk and printout that are produced by each student. The process can be generally applied to testing many different skill areas, and has been effectively used for tests on DOS and utilities, wordprocessing, spreadsheet work, and data base. Practical examples of test creation and grading of spreadsheet tests are presented. Further developments of the technique are suggested.
