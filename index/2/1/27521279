1. SUMMARY The session, which is being held on the occasion of SIGCAS’ 40 Anniversary, will provide a historical perspective on curricular efforts to address the profound social and ethical impact of the rapid development of computer technology since its widespread deployment in the 1960’s. Presenters, who represent veteran and newer members of SIGCAS, are in the process of developing a variety of innovative approaches to incorporating computer ethics and social impact issues into their computer science curricula, and will discuss their efforts to engage students in the study of the larger context of computing. Audience members will be encouraged to contribute experiences and ideas, and to learn how their involvement in SIGCAS can further the development of curriculum in this area.
