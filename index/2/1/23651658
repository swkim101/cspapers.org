This report describes the author's experience using commercially-available, video-based, multimedia training courses to teach undergraduate computer science courses. The multimedia courses were used as the primary teaching vehicle in an entry-level COBOL course and a junior-level systems analysis course. They were also used to supplement the discussion of direct access file design in a data structures course.
