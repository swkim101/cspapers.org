Sensorian is an add-on sensor shield that transforms the Raspberry Pi into an IoT platform. This academic project has been successfully funded through a Kickstarter campaign. The product has been developed and 400 boards have already been shipped. The objective of this demo is not to sell the shield at SIGCSE 2016, but rather to tell the story of the Sensorian shield and demo how students can build on this open source project and learn to tinker with software and hardware technologies. It can be used for a variety of courses, from introducing programming IoT applications in CS1 to Linux and embedded systems.
