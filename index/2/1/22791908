In the near future that many of the computing concepts we currently teach at the college level will be taught in the near future (some are doing it already) at the high school level. From our experience we are convinced that this can be done, but substantial changes will have to be made in the ways in which programming concepts are taught.
 In subsequent sections of this paper describe the original direction of our proposal, how we had to change it, and where we see it going in the future. As we continue to work with our colleagues in the secondary schools, we have developed an important feedback loop. They have been convinced of our sincerity in assisting them. Therefore, they have been very free and open with their comments and their criticisms. This in turn has given us a tremendous opportunity to continuously revise and our material. As a result, we are convinced of the validity of our approach.
