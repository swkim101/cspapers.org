Although now 20 years old, only recently has the concept of technical debt gained some momentum and credibility in the software engineering community. The goal of this fourth workshop on managing technical debt is to engage researchers and practitioners in exchanging ideas on viable research directions and on how to put the concept to actual use, beyond its usage as a rhetorical instrument to discuss the fate and ailments of software development projects. The workshop participants presented and discussed approaches to detect, analyze, visualize, and manage technical debt, in its various forms, on large software-intensive system developments.
