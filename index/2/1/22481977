Supporting a workforce that can create, not simply consume, computing technology requires a shift in pedagogy toward problem solving in a gender neutral, culturally and ethnically diverse community. It requires an authentic learning environment in which students solve real problems as a collaborative community with their peers from other disciplines. We report on three pedagogical approaches, namely student selected projects in a CS course, a multidisciplinary project-based course, and courses that partner across disciplines that provide on-demand content.
