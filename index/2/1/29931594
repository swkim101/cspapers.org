A computer program has been developed for producing automatically the set of approximately 200 open web steel joist designs required by a fabricator. Chord members are assumed to be cold formed from steel strip. An objective of the design process is to minimize the total steel requirements of the fabricator while keeping to a reasonable number the different sizes of steel strip which must be stocked. Output information includes chord member sizes and properties, web and end diagonal rod sizes, weld proof loads, maximum loads permitted by deflection limitations, and joist weights for various span lengths.
 Detailed documentation of the design basis for joists is produced by another program. The output of this program is suitable for submission to review committees or engineers who require detailed calculations. Detailing dimensions for shop use in cutting materials are produced by a third program.
