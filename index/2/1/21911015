The purpose of this paper is to discuss some approaches for achieving more meaningful relationships between degree programs at the college level in Computer Science and the needs of industry. Nothing is more encouraging to most students than to know that their academic preparation will enhance their future life styles and future employment opportunities. Also, probably nothing is more depressing to a person than perhaps being a hungry, competent, and unemployed expert in an academic area where employment opportunities are nonexistent.
 The balance between knowledge attributed to real world experiences and academic theory is a crucial issue. Either type of knowledge is hollow without the other component. Mr. Jack Jackson, who is an Instructor for the American Airlines Academy amply describes an “experience” as being - when something is happening to you and you wish it were happening to someone else. Many schemes have been used to simulate real world electronic data processing experiences in the classroom situation. Some of these schemes have proven very successful. However, most employers will not consider this as what they mean when they ask a prospective employee “Do you have any experience?”. The remarks in this paper are directed toward the employer's definition.
