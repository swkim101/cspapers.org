HONS (Hybrid Open Networking Stack) is a system which can service diverse types of sensor nodes as a single network. By defining open packet format of IEEE 802.15.4 standard, it can form low-power multi-hop network of diverse sensors. HONS system is composed of routers and wireless sensor nodes. Routers are motes with wired power and form the basic backbone of the multi-hop network. Wireless sensor nodes are motes powered by battery, and operate in a lower-power mode, and are attached to the multi-hop network formed by routers.
