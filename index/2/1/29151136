To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel co-clustering method named bilateral k-means algorithm (BKM) for fast co-clustering. Different from traditional k-means algorithms, the proposed method has two indicator matrices P and Q and a diagonal matrix S to be solved, which represent the cluster memberships of samples and features, and the co-cluster centres, respectively. Therefore, it could implement different clustering tasks on the samples and features simultaneously. We also introduce an effective approach to solve the proposed method, which involves less multiplication. The computational complexity is analyzed. Extensive experiments on various types of data sets are conducted. Compared with the state-of-the-art clustering methods, the proposed BKM not only has faster computational speed, but also achieves promising clustering results.
