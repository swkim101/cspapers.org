The deployment of autonomous and semi-autonomous robots is likely to increase dramatically over the next decade. Recent autonomous vehicle prototypes illustrate both the rapid progress of the underlying technology and the commercial possibilities of robotics. The next few years are likely to see increased interest in robotics among both students and employers. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source software framework for developing robotics applications. It has become a standard platform with a wide range of supported robots and a vibrant software ecosystem. This workshop will provide a hands-on introduction to ROS. Participants will have the opportunity to write ROS-based Python programs to control a Turtlebot educational robot. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of using ROS in an undergraduate robotics course. The workshop is intended for CS educators with an interest in teaching robotics. Laptops will be provided. No experience with ROS or Python is required.
