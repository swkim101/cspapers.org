We will present an interactive rapid prototyping platform which allows collaborative analysis of ongoing simulations to optimize products or carry out experiments. Our approach is to integrate the simulation, analysis and physical prototype or experiment into one consistent environment to not only analyse a problem but also modify and thus optimize the product we are simulating. By using parallel high performance computers, we can obtain high quality simulation results with interactive response times. We are using advanced visualization techniques like direct volume rendering, Virtual- and Augmented Reality to visualize the simulation results.Physical objects provide easy to use user interfaces to interact with both the simulation and the analysis of the simulation results. Virtual environments provide high quality visualization at scale 1:1 and allow for collaborative analysis of the results.We will demonstrate the applicability of our approach with an interactive air-flow simulation in urban planning.
