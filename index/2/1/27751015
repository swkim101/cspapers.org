The DyBM, however, is defined only for binary valued data, without any nonlinear hidden units. Here, in our first contribution, we extend the DyBM to deal with real valued data. We present a formulation called Gaussian DyBM, that can be seen as an extension of a vector autoregressive (VAR) model. This uses, in addition to standard (explanatory) variables, components that captures long term dependencies in the time series. In our second contribution, we extend the Gaussian DyBM model with a recurrent neural network (RNN) that controls the bias input to the DyBM units. We derive a stochastic gradient update rule such that, the output weights from the RNN can also be trained online along with other DyBM parameters. Furthermore, this acts as nonlinear hidden layer extending the capacity of DyBM and allows it to model nonlinear components in a given time-series. Numerical experiments with synthetic datasets show that the RNN-Gaussian DyBM improves predictive accuracy upon standard VAR by up to 35%. On real multi-dimensional time-series prediction, consisting of high nonlinearity and non-stationarity, we demonstrate that this nonlinear DyBM model achieves significant improvement upon state of the art baseline methods like VAR and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks at a reduced computational cost.
