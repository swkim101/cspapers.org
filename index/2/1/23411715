Board games provide a natural context for the use of basic data structures and search algorithms taught in a typical introductory CS sequence. Unlike traditionally used programming assignments where students implement the actual game, we provide the game "engine" and ask the students to implement player strategies. The engine graphically displays the current state of the game and cyclically calls the individual player strategies to perform their moves. The students need to apply the same algorithms as if programming the rule checker for the game. And with the added strategy component, the project becomes open-ended, leaving space for continued improvements and experimentation. The poster describes the game we used last academic year, Quoridor by Mirko Marchesi and published by Gigamic Games. The goal of this game for two or four players is to move a piece from one side of a 9x9 grid board to another side, while placing walls that lengthen the opponents' paths to their destinations. The poster discusses Quoridor's relevance for basic data structures and algorithms, for example, breadth-first search. It then elaborates on the possibilities introduced by adding strategies into the picture, including an end-of-term tournament. Supported by the NSF, award ID 1044721.
