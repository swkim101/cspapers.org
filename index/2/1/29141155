Multicore processors are now the standard CPU architecture, and parallel and distributed computing (PDC) is in the CS2013 core curriculum [9]. It is now the task of CS educators to begin creating pedagogical materials that will help their students understand PDC concepts. In this paper, we present TSGL (the thread-safe graphics library), a C++11 library that safely supports multithreaded graphics. We also present several multithreaded visualizations that illustrate how TSGL can be used to visualize the Parallel Loop design pattern, and present evidence that TSGL can improve student mastery of this parallel abstraction.
