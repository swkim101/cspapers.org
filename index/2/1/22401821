Increasingly the practice of computing involves legal issues. Patenting algorithms, domain name poaching, and “re-using” HTML and graphics from web sites all raise questions in the domain of intellectual property law (which includes patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks). In the classroom, computer science educators often confront questions that have legal ramifications.
To many computer scientists, the legal system seems arbitrary and impenetrable, just as software development is obscure to many lawyers. But each discipline has its own axioms and goals, its own culture and approach to solving problems. Moreover, each discipline has been largely successful in meeting its goals, despite such problems as frivolous, costly lawsuits on one side and unstable, bloated software on the other.
The goal of this seminar is to give computer science faculty a framework for answering students' questions and debunking the most egregious misconceptions about intellectual property issues.
