We experience haptic feedback on a wide variety of devices in the modern day, including cellphones, tablets, and smartwatches. However haptic alerts can quickly become disruptive rather than helpful to a user when multiple devices are providing feedback simultaneously or consecutively. Thus in this paper, we propose an intercommunicating, turn-based local network between a user's devices. This will allow a guaranteed minimal time span between device alerts. Additionally, when multiple devices provide a notification-based haptic alert, devices often produce different feedback due to the varying materials they are placed on. To address this, our framework allows devices to self-regulate their levels of haptic responses based on the material density of the surface they are placed on. This allows the framework to enforce a uniform level of haptic feedback across all the surface-device combinations. Finally, we will also utilize this common network to eliminate redundant alerts across devices.
