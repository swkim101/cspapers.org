The inexpensive Arduino makes for an attractive embedded platform in introductory courses. Its many variants, open source tools, and well-established hobbyist community support a staggering breadth of possible uses. In this workshop, we concentrate on block-based programming of the Arduino, providing a smooth path for Scratch programmers to expand into the wider world of sensors, actuators, and embedded systems. The MUzECS curriculum is designed to be an inexpensive replacement for the costly final robotics module of Exploring Computer Science (ECS), but also has clear applicability to Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) and even college undergraduate courses. The session will introduce the Arduino Leonardo board, detail various "shield" extensions that are available, and present the tools and resources needed for high school or college instructors to get started. Demonstration activities will focus on ECS-style lessons that build programmable musical instruments. Laptop required.
