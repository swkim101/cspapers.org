As I leaf through my own "ACL (Historical)" file (which, I am frightened to observe, goes back to the Fourth Annual Meeting, in 1966), and focus in particular on 1977, when I was President, it strikes me that pretty much everything significant that happened in the Association that year was the work of other people. Don Walker was completing the mammoth task of transferring all of the ACL's records from the East Coast to the West, paying off our indebtedness to the Center for Applied Linguistics, and in general getting the Association onto the firm financial and organizational footing which it has enjoyed to this day. Dave Hays was seeing to it that the microfiche journal kept on coming, and George Heldorn Joined him as Associate Editor that year to begin the move toward hard copy publication. That was the year when we hitched up our organizational pants and moved our Annual Meeting back to the Spring, after some years when it had been in the Fall. Jonathan Allen and his Program Committee coped admirably with the challenge of putting on an Annual Meeting program less than six months after the last one. The culinary staff at the Foundry Restaurant in Georgetown provided a banquet that I still remember as delicious.
