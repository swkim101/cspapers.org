For bicycle and motorcycle riders, visibility is a constant concern for safe riding. For the designer, minimizing additional demands on the rider's attention is just as crucial when the device will be used while operating a vehicle, especially a bicycle or motorcycle. This riding glove uses common sensors to recognize a small set of hand gestures used by riders and then actuates appropriate LED patterns for enhanced gesture visibility. The configuration of LEDs translates the gesture to an illuminated directional chevron, extending functionality into the night hours. By equipping the device to recognize existing hand gestures, activation of directional LED signals is simplified allowing the rider to focus on riding while the glove responds to and extends the visibility of the rider's hand gestures. This context awareness allows the device to cooperate with the rider, rather than asking the rider to interact with the device.
