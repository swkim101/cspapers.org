In this paper, we described a new developed life-size humanoid robot. A purpose of the developed robot is to realize continuous operation for a long time and to improve an action autonomously. we considered three aspects of robustness, mechanical robustness, functional robustness and robustness of an action. Mechanical robustness was confirmed by the experiment that the robot fell down without mechanical failures and continued to work after falling down by using hard points. Functional robustness was designed to use power cable and to wear a suit which can be changed by required functionality. Robustness of an action was achieved as a standing up action using “StateNet”, which realized autonomous error recovery. Finally, we present a methodology to develop a humanoid robot platform which can continue to work in the real world.
