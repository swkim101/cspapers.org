In this paper, a Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) design is proposed with simultaneous actuator and sensor faults. The main idea of FTC is an automatically compensation of the fault to remain the close-loop stability of system. The proposed approach is composed of two stages. The first stage enables to separate the actuator and sensor faults based a Luenberger observer and bond graph linear fractional transformation. The second stage a new design of fault tolerant control enables to compensate the fault. Finally, simulation results using a DC motor example show the efficiency of the proposed methodology.
