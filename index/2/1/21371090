We present a framework - AWSense - for eased sensing data collection from an Apple Watch wearable device. The framework eases the access, transmission and export of sensing data from the device. This data comprises: heart rate, raw acceleration, and computed device motion. In our demo, we present sample applications built on top of this framework to show its capabilities, of real-time presentation and recording of the sensing data.
