This paper discusses the content and impact of a new first-year experience (FYE) course for at-risk students in the Computer Science and Engineering department at Shippensburg University, a mid-sized teaching university. The initial results from the new course are quite promising: DFW rates (grade of D, grade of F, and withdrawal) for the first and second semesters were cut in half and retention rates were dramatically improved.
