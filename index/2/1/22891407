This paper describes the implementation of a classical geometric control problem within the Scilab environment. The basic primitives are based on Slicot routines and the algorithm uses standard linear algebra tools available in Scilab. The paper discusses various tests which should be performed on the data to prove the existence of a solution. In a second stage a feedback, meeting the stability constraints is calculated
