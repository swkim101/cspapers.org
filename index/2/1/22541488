We recall that the Dyck language on the alphabet of 2n letters X = {x1,...,xn,x1,...,xn} is the equivalence class of the empty word 1 ε X@@@@ modulo the Thue congruence generated on X@@@@ by the 2n relations xixi = xixi = 1 i ε {1,...,n}. Indeed for all n ε X@@@@ the equivalence class of n modulo this congruence is a non ambiguous algebraic (ie. context-free) language, the complement of which is also a non ambiguous algebraic language. The same situation is true for the congruence generated on X@@@@ by the n relations xixi = 1 i ε {1,...,n}. The author convinced himself that many other congruences have the same property [Ni 1], and undertook the task of finding them systematically. Here is presented a part of the results of this undertaking. An important family of congruences is brought to light which have interesting decidability properties: in the constructions leading to these decidability properties we used as a guide line the nice paper of Mac Naughton [McN]. Sufficient conditions are given in order that the equivalence classes (and their complements) of such a congruence be an algebraic language. We do not study in this paper the properties of these languages, this will be done elsewhere [Ni 2].
