This paper describes an NSF-funded initiative involving 600 underrepresented high school students and 60 teachers designed to introduce underrepresented students to the numerous and varied career opportunities in the computing sciences, prepare them to succeed in college degree programs, and prepare their teachers to be effective in the computer science class room. The initiative has five components: 1) CyberTech I (Principles of Computing): An online introductory course for second-semester sophomores, 2) CyberTech II: A twenty day on-campus intense summer programming experience between the sophomore and junior year, 3) CT Games: A junior year video game programming experience to apply the programming knowledge gaining in CyberTech II, 4) AP Computer Science (using Java 5 as the programming language) taken during the senior year, and 5) training workshops for teachers to prepare them to teach computer programming. The overarching goal is to prepare students for a college-level degree program in the computing sciences by having them successfully complete the AP Computer Science course and exam while teaching the soft skills, such as team work, oral communication and problem solving necessary in a professional career. Additionally, role models from various industry sectors are utilized to introduce students to the exciting career opportunities in the computing sciences.
