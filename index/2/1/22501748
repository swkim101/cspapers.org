SIGCSE's special projects grant program provides small grants to SIGCSE members to carry out computing education projects whose results generalize to the whole computing education community. This session is a "showcase" for five recent grant projects: a MIPS simulator extended into FPGA hardware, a study of informal learning of computing, software engineering learning modules for the visually impaired, a study of student projects in computing, and curriculum resources for computer security.
