There are only a handful of software cost estimation tools that are in general use today. The authors, or representatives, of the most “popular” tools were presented with a common problem to analyze as basis for comparison. In this context, each was asked to address their analysis approach, input parameters used, parameters not used, and results generated. This paper contains the statement of the problem and a summary of the results which will be discussed at the panel session.
