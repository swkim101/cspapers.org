This research concerns the relationship between distance accuracy and positioning accuracy for robotic manipulators. We propose an approach for calibration and verification of the positioning accuracy based on a polynomial approximation to the workspace. Utilizing singular value decomposition a method is developed for distance error compensation. Computed results show that the distance accuracy and positioning accuracy of the robot can be improved by use of the proposed technique. The technique is illustrated for a PUMA 560 industrial robot.<<ETX>>
