Time has strong influence on web search. The temporal intent of the searcher adds an important dimension to the relevance judgments of web queries. However, lack of understanding their temporal requirements increases the ambiguity of the queries, turning retrieval effectiveness improvements into a complex task. In this paper, we propose an approach to classify web queries into four different categories considering their temporal ambiguity. For each query, we develop features from its search volumes and related queries using Google trends and its related top Wikipedia pages. Our experiment results show that these features can determine temporal ambiguity of a given query with high accuracy. We have demonstrated that a Multilayer Perceptron Networks can achieve better results in classifying temporal class of queries in comparison to other classifiers.
