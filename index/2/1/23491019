We have been fortunate in having the opportunity to work with IBM in the field testing and final debugging of a computer program for the analysis of large space frames (FRAN). We are also pleased that M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory sponsorship enabled us to develop and contribute the subroutine (CHECK) which provides a static check at every joint in the structure.
 This presentation consists of three parts:
 1. A description of FRAN; this will include a brief resume of both the structural theory involved and of the method of solution used by the program.
 2. The method by which other structural types can be treated as space frames for the purpose of analysis.
 3. A discussion of the application of these methods in the analysis of a large antenna consisting of a 120 ft diameter reflector shell and its supporting structure.
