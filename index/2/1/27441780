However, analysis dictionary learning (ADL), as a major branch of DL, has not yet been fully exploited in classification due to its poor discriminability. This paper presents a novel DL method, namely Discriminative Analysis Dictionary Learning (DADL), to improve the classification performance of ADL. First, a code consistent term is integrated into the basic analysis model to improve discriminability. Second, a triplet constraint-based local topology preserving loss function is introduced to capture the discriminative geometrical structures embedded in data. Third, correntropy induced metric is employed as a robust measure to better control outliers for classification. Then, half-quadratic minimization and alternate search strategy are used to speed up the optimization process so that there exist closed-form solutions in each alternating minimization stage. Experiments on several commonly used databases show that our proposed method not only significantly improves the discriminative ability of ADL, but also outperforms state-of-the-art synthesis DL methods.
