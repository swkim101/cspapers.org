 
 ARTY is a week-long program for middle school students to teach them programming of robots and allow them to express themselves artistically. It was started in 2013 and ran its fourth edition in 2016. We describe the ideas behind the inception of this program, its curriculum, our experiences during the 2016 workshop and challenges/future directions for the program. Our primary intent in this paper is to convey the program curriculum and its design, including the way in which robots can be viewed as vehicles for artistic expression. Some results from a brief attitudinal survey that was administered before and after the workshop are also included along with a discussion of outcomes assessment and issues.
