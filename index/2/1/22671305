The Global Arrays (GA) toolkit provides a global address space programming model to MPI applications. GA library allows programmers to distribute data while maintaining the type of global index space and programming syntax similar to what is available when programming on a single processor. The goal of GA is to free the programmers from the low level management of communication and allow them to deal with their problems at the level at which they were originally formulated. The compatibility of GA with MPI makes it possible to use distributed and global views of the data in the same application. The variety of applications that have been implemented using Global Arrays attests to the attractiveness of using higher level abstractions to write parallel code. The tutorial will provide an overview of GA toolkit, its applications, and compare GA to related programming models such as UPC, Co-Array Fortran, and X10.
