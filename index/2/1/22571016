A modern automotive design contains over a hundred microprocessors, several cyber-physical modules, connectivity to a variety of networks, and several hundred megabytes of software. The future is anticipated to see an even sharper rise in complexity of this electronics, with the imminence of driverless vehicles, the potential of connected automobiles within a few years, and work towards seamless integration of automobiles with smart cities and infrastructure systems. Security is a fundamental challenge in the design of automotive systems. Unfortunately, security considerations in automotive systems are complicated by two factors: (1) need for real-time mitigation against in-field threats; and (2) in-field configurability and extensibility of security features. This paper examines the trade-offs between security countermeasures, real-time requirements, and in-field configurability needs for modern automotive systems. We discuss the current state of the practice in automotive security architecture, as well as gaps and challenges that need to be addressed for a viable security solution in future.
