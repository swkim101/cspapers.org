This paper proposes a double-sided printed dipole linear array antenna with high gain, low sidelobe level (SLL) for IEEE 802.11ac outdoor applications. In this work, to gain low SLL, a series fed network, which has the output powers being proportional to the Chebyshev weight distribution, has been proposed. The radiating elements used to construct the array are double-sided printed dipoles (DSPD) and each single element is equally distributed on the feed network. Furthermore, to increase the directivity of the antenna, Yagi antenna theory is applied by adding driven elements above every single element and a reflector is constructed at the back of the proposed structure. The simulated results show that the proposed array antenna can operate at 5 GHz with a bandwidth of 211 MHz (5.393 GHz–5.604 GHz). The gain and SLL acquired are 17.5 dBi and −26.0 dB at the frequency of 5.5 GHz, respectively.
