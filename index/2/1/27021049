Existing test process assessment and improvement models intend to raise maturity of an organization with reference to testing activities. Such process assessments are based on ldquowhatrdquo testing activities are being carried out, and thus implicitly evaluate process quality. Other test process measurement techniques attempt to directly assess some partial quality attribute such as efficiency or effectiveness some test metrics. There is a need for a formalized method of test process quality evaluation that addresses both implicitly and partially of these current evaluations. This paper describes a conceptual framework to specify and explicitly evaluate test process quality aspects. The framework enables provision of evaluation results in the form of objective assessments, and problem-area identification to improve the software testing processes.
