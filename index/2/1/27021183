This SIGCSE special session provides an opportunity for new researchers in CS education to learn the elements of successful computing education research of different types through a series of exemplar projects. Specifically, this session reports on the findings and example, successful CS education research projects that were discussed and presented at ICER 2016 UP (Understanding and Propagating) CS Ed Research Workshop, sponsored by the National Science Foundation. One goal of the session is to provide a way for proposers of computing education research to ensure that they have well identified education research questions and evaluation mechanisms that are appropriate for the proposal (exploratory vs. design & implementation) according to the Department of Education guidelines. The ICER Workshop was designed to focus exactly on this goal and report to the community.
