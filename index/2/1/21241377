Autonomous legged robots will be required to handle a wide range of tasks in complex environments. While a lot of research has focused on developing their abilities for periodic locomotion tasks, less effort has been invested in devising generalized strategies for dynamic, non-periodic movements. Motion design approaches are frequently enlisted in the form of teleoperation or predefined heuristics in such scenarios. We employ a realistic simulation of the hydraulically actuated HyQ2Max quadrupedal system for investigations on two distinctive tasks: rearing and posture recovery. We present a whole-body optimization methodology for non-periodic tasks on quadrupedal systems. This approach delivers solutions involving multiple contacts without the need for predefined feet placements. The results obtained show the potential of optimization approaches for motion synthesis in the context of complex tasks.
