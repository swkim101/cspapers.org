Internationalization of computer science education involves incorporating awareness, knowledge and skills of professional life in a global environment. Through an NSF CPATH1 grant we have established a Pacific Rim community of computer science departments, high tech industry and international programs exploring a new model of computer science education that focuses on the knowledge, skills and competencies necessary for professional success and leadership in a global context. This paper describes our progress in building an international community of computer science educators, as well as our efforts in curricular innovation and establishment of international summer schools. Internationalization of computer science education will help attract the best and brightest students and broaden the appeal of computer science to a much more diverse population. Computer science will be seen as a pathway to a career not in an isolated cubicle but in the wide-open world.
