The amount of social media data dealing with medical and health issues increased significantly in the last couple of years. Medical social media data now provides a new source of information within information gaining contexts. Facts, experiences, opinions or information on behavior can be found in the Medicine 2.0 or Health 2.0 and could support a broad range of applications. This workshop is devoted to the technologies for dealing with social- and multi media for medical information gathering and exchange. This specific data and the processes of information gathering poses many challenges given the increasing content on the Web and the trade off of filtering noise at the cost of losing information which is potentially relevant.
