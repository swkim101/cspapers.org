Computer literacy, according to Richard Austing (1), is a major category of computer science education. Although computer literacy potentially involves the greatest number of people, achieving an ongoing program presents computer educators with formidable problems. My concern is with the concept of “functional” computer literacy, that is, a level of computer literacy expected of everyone living in a computer society. Functional computer literacy can be developed by implementing a curriculum for junior and senior high school students. Two requirements for achieving a computer literacy curriculum are 1) to develop a philosophy which is both “computer” and “literacy” and 2) to identify minimum requirements for being computer literate.
