In this paper, we introduce and investigate a new robust blind video watermarking. Unlike some existing methods based on spatial domain watermarking techniques, the even-odd quantization algorithm is applied in our paper to embed all bit plane images decomposed from a single watermark image into only selected robust Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of 8Ã—8 blocks from a host video. As a result, our method not only has high capacity of embedded information but also obtains high quality of watermarked video. Moreover, in order to obtain the security, a secret key is used to scramble embedded blocks and the watermark image is extracted without the host video. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is robust against attacks of compression and addition of noise.
