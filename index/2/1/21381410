We have extended the well-known Emulab network testbed software to support both fixed and mobile wireless sensor devices. Mobility is achieved through remotely-controlled robots. We have deployed this software in public production use for the research and education communities. The current temporary testbed is in a 60 square meter indoor area. It contains six robots and 25 fixed Mica2 motes with serial programming boards, 10 of which also have full sensor boards. The robots carry an Intel Stargate with an X-Scale 400MHz CPU running Linux, an 802.11a/b/g wireless Ethernet card, and a Mica2. A much larger testbed is contemplated. Robot motion can be scripted using the ns language or interactively controlled from a Java applet Webcam views integrated into the applet ease remote access. A high-precision (1cm) localization system provides precise positions of robots (and thus wireless antennae). Users have full control over the wireless devices on each robot, and can install custom software on the Stargate and mote. To provide users with precise, real-time robot control, we extended the core of Emulab with three new components. The robot control daemon, robotd, maneuvers robots to user-specified positions based on input from visiond, and
