SealTest is a Java library for generating test sequences based on a formal specification. It allows a user to easily define a wide range of coverage metrics using multiple specification languages. Its simple and generic architecture makes it a useful testing tool for dynamic software systems, as well as an appropriate research testbed for implementing and experimentally comparing test sequence generation algorithms.
