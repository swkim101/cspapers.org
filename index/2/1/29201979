Robotic systems that are soft or incorporate soft actuators are well suited for operation in unstructured environments and for safe interactions with fragile objects. The majority, however, are tethered or burdened with bulky payloads of pumps and compressors. In a recent article we presented a sealed, inflated actuator composed of fluidically connected membrane dielectric elastomer actuators capable of large, repeatable, and stable deformations. Each membrane could switch between two identical volumes, and maintain its shape when an applied voltage was removed. Here we extend our previous work by simulating and demonstrating asymmetric stable deformations. In an experimental two-membrane setup, the membranes experience large and significantly different area strains of >100% and >550% when transitioning between stable states. With the addition of more membranes, this asymmetry can increase the number of discrete stable membrane sizes, allowing more complex control when later implemented in a mechanism.
