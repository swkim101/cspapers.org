Cluster Storage and File System TechnologiesTo meet the demands of increasingly hungry cluster applications, cluster-based distributed storage technologies are now capable of delivering performance scaling 10's to 100's of GB/sec. This tutorial will examine current state-of-the-art high performance file systems and the underlying technologies employed to deliver scalable performance across a range of scientific and industrial applications.The first half of the tutorial provides an in-depth description of the core features common across most high-performance file systems; including details of datapath design, decoupled and scalable metadata operations, data layout techniques, failover techniques, scalable reconstruction, storage interfaces and security. The second half describes the design trade-offs found in both open-source and commercial solutions including Lustre, GPFS, Parallel NFS and Panasas.
