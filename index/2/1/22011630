Designing and representing control algorithms is challenging in swarm robotics, where the collective swarm performance depends on interactions between robots and with their environment. The currently available modeling languages, such as UML, cannot fully express these interactions. We therefore propose a new, Behaviour-Data Relations Modeling Language (BDRML), where robot behaviours and data that robots utilise, as well as relationships between them, are explicitly represented. This allows BDRML to express control algorithms where robots cooperate and share information with each other while interacting with the environment.
