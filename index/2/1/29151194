We consider a setting in which people possess different skills and compatibility among these individuals is captured by a social network. Here, we assume a collection of tasks, where each task requires a specific set of skills, and yields a different profit upon completion. Active and qualified individuals may collaborate with each other in the form of teams to accomplish a set of tasks. Our goal is to find a grouping method that maximizes the total profit of the tasks that these teams can complete. Any feasible grouping must satisfy the following three conditions: (i) each team possesses all skills required by the task, (ii) individuals within the same team are social compatible, and (iii) each individual is not overloaded. We refer to this as the Team Grouping problem. Our work presents a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the problem, and propose a LP-based approximation algorithm to tackle it and its variants. Although we focus on team grouping in this paper, our results apply to a broad range of optimization problems that can be formulated as a cover decomposition problem.
