In this paper, we report our experience in teaching software development to Computer Science undergraduate students using acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) and the acceptance testing tool EasyAccept. A typical software design course in a Computer Science curriculum has been modified to include project assignments with executable analysis, which gives students more focus on meeting requirements, boosts confidence in the code being written and results in increased software correctness. We evaluate the benefits of the approach and give suggestions on how to cope with its limitations.
