Tele-operation in the presence of environmental constraints is a well-studied problem, where the difficulties of the transparency-stability trade-off have been elucidated by several important studies. While at the state-of-art, passivity-based stabilizers appear to provide the best insight and command over this problem, recent work by our group has proposed an alternative approach, which consists in measuring and replicating the master's limb endpoint impedance on the slave robot in real-time. Tele-impedance control offers advantages in certain conditions, e.g. where master-slave communications are low quality. However, force feedback remains necessary when visual feedback is impaired or transparency and telepresence in the remote environment is of major concern. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to achieve the Tele-Impedance with Force Feedback (TIFF) so as to have a seamless control scheme that subsumes the performance advantages of both, while still guaranteeing stability and transparency. Experimental results illustrate the potential of the proposed technique in addressing the drawbacks of the two concepts.
