 
 The CP conference is the annual international conference on constraint programming. It is concerned with all aspects of computing with constraints, including theory, algorithms, environments, languages, models, systems, and applications such as decision-making, resource allocation, scheduling, configuration, and planning. The CP community is very keen to ensure it remains open to interdisciplinary research at the intersection between constraint programming and related fields. Hence, in addition to the usual technical and application tracks, the CP 2016 conference featured thematic tracks: Computational Sustainability, CP and Biology, Preferences, Social Choice and Optimization, and Testing and Verification. In this overview, we highlight several remarkable papers that have been selected by the senior program committee and papers with the most innovative methods and techniques, and a very high potential for applications (in our opinion).
