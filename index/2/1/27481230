The ASE Doctoral Symposium is a one day forum that seeks to bring together PhD students working on foundations, techniques, tools and applications of automated software engineering and give them the opportunity to present and to discuss their research with researchers in the ASE community in a constructive atmosphere. Specifically, the symposium aims to provide a setting whereby students receive feedback on their research and guidance on future directions from a broad group of advisors, foster a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research, and contribute to the conference goals through interaction with other researchers and conference events
