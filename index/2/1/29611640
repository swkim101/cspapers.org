There are several dimensions along which verbalization responds to context, resulting in individual and social differences in conversational style. Style, as I use the term, is not something extra added on, like decoration. Anything that is said must be said in some way; co-occurrence expectations of that "way" constitute style. The dimensions of style I will discuss are:1. Fixity vs. novelty2. Cohesiveness vs. expressiveness3. Focus on content vs. interpersonal involvement.
