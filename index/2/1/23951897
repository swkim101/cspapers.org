Bootstrapping efforts and scalability issues hinder large-scale deployment of indoor navigation systems. We present FollowUs, an easily-deployable (bootstrap-free) and scalable indoor navigation system. In addition to robust navigation through real-time trace-following, FollowUs integrates cloud services to process and combine traces at large scale. It can also leverage optional floor plans to further enhance navigation performance. We designed and implemented FollowUs, including a mobile app and cloud services on Azure, and validate its real-world usability.
