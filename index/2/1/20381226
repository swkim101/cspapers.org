Mosaic, a hypermedia information browser for the World-Wide Web, has become popular within the past year, and the number of sites are expected to increase even further. One use of Mosaic by Computer Science educators is for legacy projects, i.e. student projects that will contribute to the educational efforts of future students in the course. For the resulting hypermedia documents to be useful, a design methodology is needed that promotes consistency in use and navigation. The instructor may also take on the role of editor of a hypermedia document and ensure that the document is correctly formatted and connected, and consistent. Students enrolled in a human-computer interaction course at Georgia State University have been required to develop legacy projects using Mosaic. Experiences in developing these projects are discussed, and recommendations based on these experiences are presented.
