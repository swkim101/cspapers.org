Mathematics has been called “the critical filter” for entrance into most scientific professions — a filter through which many female students do not pass and one which may also be screening out members of ethnic minorities. Changes in the mathematics pre-requisites for computer science courses form a major difference between Curriculum 78, the recommendations of the ACM Committee on Curriculum for the undergraduate program in computer sciences, and its predecessor, Curriculum 68.
 Two questions deserve careful consideration in light of changes in secondary preparation, increasing demand for computer science graduates, and a new focus on educating women and minorities:
 1) Will Curriculum 78 bring about significant changes in the student profile of those who graduate in computer science?
 2) Will changes in mathematics requirements lead to the opening of new opportunities for certain groups of students?
