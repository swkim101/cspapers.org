Smartphones are now equipped with high-performance processors to meet the increasing complexity of apps. However, these processors drain the battery quickly, which has become a major concern for Smartphone users. The latest big.LITTLE multicore architecture provides new energysaving facilities in addition to traditional DVFS technique. But this mechanism has not been well exploited by current Smartphones. In this paper, we propose a framework that records the performance demands for repetitive app usage scenarios, and adjusts the big.LITTLE processor to an energy-efficient configuration for subsequent executions of these scenarios. We implemented our framework on Android Smartphones, and the experiments achieve 30% energy saving on average without compromising user experience.
