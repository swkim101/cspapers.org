There has been a staggering increase in the volume of information exchanged over the Internet and the amount of personally identifiable information present online. Additionally, legislative mandates, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, aim at monitoring organizational behavior and communication, and require organizations to safe keep all written corporate communication, thus creating huge repositories of information, most of which must be access-restricted. IT carries the primary responsibility for ensuring that private digital information does not become public, through the implementation of access-security measures, together with constant monitoring to ensure that even authorized users behave responsibly and ethically. This situation requires CS educators to introduce students to data privacy and the ways to protect users' privacy.
 We designed a privacy module, consisting of three lessons incorporated into a data mining course. The module aims at introducing students to privacy issues and legislations and the methods and technologies currently in use to protect privacy. The intended audience for this module is senior CS majors, with a working knowledge of database systems and basic data mining techniques. The module first presents students with an overview of privacy concepts and laws and regulations to protect it. Students are then introduced to data privacy-enhancing data manipulation methods as well as secure privacy preserving computation. Upon completion of this module, it is anticipated that students will acquire a good understanding of the concept of privacy, privacy laws and regulations and will become knowledgeable of the computational techniques used for preserving privacy in data mining.
