The design of large computers using LSI techniques requires relatively large numbers of different designs in relatively small quantities. The paper describes a system of designing integrated circuits rapidly and reliably in this environment using the Uncommitted Logic Array (Master Slice) approach. An integrated design, validation and production system has been developed from logical input to pattern generator tape production which takes away the need for knowledge of Silicon Layout techniques from the integrated circuit designer
