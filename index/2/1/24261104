The Web has involved diverse media services, such as blogs, photo/video/link sharing, social networks, and microblogs. These Web media react to and affect realworld events, while the mass media still has big influence on social activities. The Web and mass media now affect each other. Our use of media has evolved dynamically in the last decade, and this affects our societal behavior. For instance, the first photo of a plane crash landing during the "Miracle on the Hudson" on January 15, 2009 appeared and spread on Twitter and was then used in TV news. During the "Chelyabinsk Meteor" incident on February 15, 2013, many people reported videos of the incident on YouTube then mass media reused them on TV programs. Large scale collection, analysis, and visualization of those multiple media are strongly required for sociology, linguistics, risk management, and marketing researches. We are building a huge scale Japanese web archive, and various analytics engines with a large-scale display wall. Our archive consists of 30 billion web pages crawled for 14 years, 1 billion blog posts for 7 years, and 15 billion tweets for 3 years. In this talk, I present several analysis and visualization systems based on network analysis, natural language processing, image processing, and 3 dimensional visualization.
