An important part of the total job required for designing and building computers is the error detection and diagnostic process. This paper explains the Error Latch Trace (ELT) Program developed at the IBM Laboratory in Endicott, N.Y. It describes a process and a method for automatically obtaining diagnostic error domains from the design data base. The ELT process provides the diagnostic group a key step toward full use of Design Automation.
