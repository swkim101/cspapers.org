KT encodes commonsense knowledge (CK) about entities and relations in a cross-classified Ontology and a database of generic (prototypical and inherent) information. The verb Ontology combines linguistic and psycholinguistic classification. The generic information for verbs encodes typical associations with actions and events. This knowledge base is useful for word-sense disambiguation, inferencing without scripts, discourse reasoning, and post-verbal PP attachment.
