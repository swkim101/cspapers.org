It is impractical for natural language parsers which serve as front ends to large or changing databases to maintain a complete in-core lexicon of words and meanings. This note discusses a practical approach to using alternative sources of lexical knowledge by postponing word categorization decisions until the parse is complete, and resolving remaining lexical anthiguities usiug a variety of informatkm available at that time.
