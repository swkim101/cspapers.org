In this paper, motivated by effectively classifying linked data (e.g. Web pages, tweets, articles with references, and biological network data) where a group structure exists over the whole dataset and links exist between specific samples, we propose a joint sparse representation model that combines group sparsity and graph sparsity, to select a small number of connected components from the graph of linked samples, meanwhile promoting the sparsity of edges that link samples from different groups in each connected component. Consequently, linked samples are selected from a few sparsely-connected groups. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that the joint sparsity model outperforms traditional group sparsity model and graph sparsity model, as well as the latest group-graph sparsity model.
