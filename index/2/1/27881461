Existing malware analysis platforms leave detectable ﬁn-gerprints like uncommon string properties in QEMU, signatures in Android Java virtual machine, and artifacts in Linux kernel proﬁles. Since these ﬁngerprints provide the malware a chance to split its behavior depending on whether the analysis system is present or not, existing analysis systems are not sufﬁcient to analyze the sophisticated malware. In this paper, we pro-pose N INJA , a transparent malware analysis framework on ARM platform with low artifacts. N INJA leverages a hardware-assisted isolated execution environment Trust-Zone to transparently trace and debug a target application with the help of Performance Monitor Unit and Embedded Trace Macrocell. N INJA does not modify system software and is OS-agnostic on ARM platform. We implement a prototype of N INJA (i.e., tracing and debugging subsystems), and the experiment results show that N INJA is efﬁcient and transparent for malware analysis.
