Despite the technological advances and progress in the industrial systems, the fault diagnosis of the system remains a very important task. Indeed, an effective diagnosis contributes to the improvement of the reliability and also to the decrease in maintenance costs. This paper presents an approach to diagnosis of hybrid systems thanks to the use of the Bond Graph, of Observer and Timed Automata. This approach allows to detect and locate not only simple faults but also multiple faults, to minimize repair time and to provide a reliable diagnosis and easily interpretable despite the complexity of the equipment. The proposed approach is validated by simulation tests to a two tanks hydraulic system.
