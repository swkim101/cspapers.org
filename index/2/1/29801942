Users of current computer systems have to deal with several major problems with applications, such as: a lack of consistency across applications, which demands learning a new interface for each new application (even on systems that specify interface standards); a lack of consistency even within applications, so that similw tasks have to be handled in different ways; a low-level of integration between applications, so that documents can cnl y be imported across applications at a very low level, losing structural information: and inflexibility, demanding that tne user operate in the way dictated by the application designer.
