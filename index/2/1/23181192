The paper centers upon the implications of technical analytical methodologies, especially those which are computer-based, for public policy-making. A generalized analysis of the lack of suitable educational and experiental background of most public policy-makers is presented, and it is suggested that this lack makes it difficult for such officials to adequately evaluate technical analyses. Means to ameliorate this problem are discussed, and a model of policy-maker/computer methodology interface is presented. The example used is based on a computer simulation model and related methodologies which are presently developed for HUD to study New Town fiscal and economic viability.
