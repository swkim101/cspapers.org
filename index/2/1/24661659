For the last fifteen years, research explored the hardware, software, sensing, communication abstractions, languages, and protocols that could make networks of small, embedded devices---motes---sample and report data for long periods of time while unattended. Today, the application and technological landscapes have shifted, introducing new requirements and new capabilities. Hardware has evolved past 8 and 16 bit microcontrollers: there are now 32 bit processors with lower energy budgets and greater computing capability. New wireless link layers have emerged, creating protocols that support direct interaction with users, but introduce novel limitations that systems must consider. Programming language advances have led to the ability to write system kernels that guarantee safety and reliability while maintaining low overhead. The time has come to look beyond optimizing networks of motes. We look towards new technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Cortex M processors, and capable multi-process operating systems, with new application spaces such as personal area networks, and new capabilities and requirements in security and privacy to inform contemporary hardware and software platforms. It is time for a new, open experimental platform in this post-mote era.
