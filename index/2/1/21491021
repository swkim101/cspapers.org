In this paper, we develop a novel 3D object recognition algorithm to perform detection and pose estimation jointly. We focus on analyzing the advantages of the 3D point cloud relative to the RGB-D image and try to eliminate the unpredictability of output values that inevitably occurs in regression tasks. To achieve this, we first adopt the Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) to encode the point cloud and extract low compact discriminative feature via unsupervised deep learning network. This approach can not only eliminate the dense scale sampling for offline model training but also reduce the distortion by mapping the 3D shape to the 2D plane and overcome the dependence on color cues. Then, we train a Hough forests to achieve multi-object detection and 6-DoF pose estimation simultaneously. In addition, we propose a robust multilevel verification strategy that effectively reduces the unpredictability of output values which occurs in the hough regression module. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach provides effective results comparable to the state-of-the-arts.
