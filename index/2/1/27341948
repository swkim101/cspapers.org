Service learning is an educational paradigm in which students take part in community service [4]. In service-learning projects, students apply the knowledge and skills they have gained in the classroom to the real-world problems of community-based, nonprofit organizations. The panel members will discuss their experiences with service-learning projects. They will share some of the challenges, seek audience comments for ongoing research studies, and highlight the opportunities service learning provides students.
