There is a tremendous need for computer science in every discipline; however, our K-12 institutions seem reluctant to alter traditional teaching methods and curriculum in order to include computing concepts at an early age. Therefore, most students are not exposed to computer science until they reach college. In this BOF, I'd like to explore what can be done to help introduce more young people to this exciting discipline, as well as encourage educators and administrators to incorporate computer science curriculum in their schools. As a leader in my children's school for the "Hour of Code" initiative, I was able to witness firsthand how children as youg as four and as old as high school seniors are hungry for more when it comes to programming. During this talk, we will explore what can be done from this point to encourage schools, teachers, and administration to continue (or begin) our youth's knowledge and experience with programming. As a nation, the United States is failing in the proper instruction of our children in the field of computer science. While employment for computer related fields is rising, and knowledge of the discipline is necessary no matter what the ultimate field of study or occupation of the student, only about two thirds of the states within the United States have computing education standards for grade levels K-12 (http://www.acm.org/runningonempty/roemap.html). As an educator (and a mother) I find this disturbing. A good work was begun by "Code.org" this past December, with more than 15 million students logging in to the site and working through the tutorials there. How can we promote and continue this initiative in our local schools and encourage up to date requirements for our students.
