In this work, we propose a 3-D model, called MESUA (Model for Electromagnetic Scattering of Urban Areas), to characterize the electromagnetic field scattered by an urban area consisting of a group of buildings for two radar configurations, monostatic and bistatic. This model is basically based on a combination of Ray-Tracing technique and the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD). The analysis frequency is in X-band (8-12 GHz), but can be applied in Ku-band (26-40 GHz). It is useful not only in clarifying the mechanisms of ray propagation through an observed area but also in evaluating magnitude and phase of any point in the far-field zone. After validated the model with numerical and experimental results, we will apply it to detect a canonical target (i.e. a car) represented by a parallelepiped inside an urban area (i.e. a crossroad).
