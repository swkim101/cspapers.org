An important issue arising from P2P applications is how to accurately and efficiently retrieve the required Web services from large-scale repositories. This paper resolves this issue by organizing services in the overlay combining the Semantic Service Link Network and the Chord P2P network. A service request will first be routed in the Chord according to the given service operation names and keywords. Then, the same request will be routed in the Semantic Link Network according to the service link type and semantic matching. Compared with previous P2P service discovery approaches, the proposed approach has two advantages: (1) produce more accurate and meaning results when searching for particular services in a P2P network; and (2) enable users and peers to discover services in a more flexible way.
