We developed and deployed a wireless sensor network for monitoring seismoacoustic activity at Volcán Reventador, Ecuador. Wireless sensor networks are a new technology and our group is among the first to apply them to monitoring volcanoes. The small size, low power, and wireless communication capabilities can greatly simplify deployments of large sensor arrays and are very attractive for this application domain. This project is a follow-on to our previous infrasonic sensor network deployed at Volcán Tungurahua, also in Ecuador, in July 2004 [1].
