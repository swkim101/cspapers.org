We describe a virtual interactive surface technology based on a projector-camera system connected to a mobile device. This system, named mobile surface, can project images on any free surfaces and enable interaction in the air within the projection area. The projector used in the system scans a laser beam very quickly across the projection area to produce a stable image at 60 fps. The camera-projector synchronization is applied to obtain the image of the appointed scanning line. So our system can project what is perceived as a stable image onto the display surface, while simulta neously working as a structured light 3D scanning system.
