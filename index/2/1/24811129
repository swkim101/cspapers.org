Estimation of 3D object position is a crucial step for a variety of robotics and computer vision applications including 3D reconstruction and object manipulation. When working in microscale, new types of visual sensors are used such as Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Nowadays, micro- and nanomanipulation tasks, namely components assembly, are performed in teleoperated mode in most of the cases. Measuring object position and orientation is a crucial step towards automatic object handling. Current methods of pose estimation in SEM allow recovering full object movement using its computer-aided design (CAD) model. If the model is not known, most methods allow to estimate only in-plane translations and rotation around camera optical axis. In the literature, SEM is considered as a camera with parallel projection or an affine camera, which means image invariance to z-movement and bas-relief ambiguity. In this paper, authors address the problem of measuring full 3D rotation of the unknown scene for uncalibrated SEM without additional sensors. Rotations are estimated from image triplets by solving a spherical triangle from fundamental matrices only, without need of intrinsic calibration, allowing to avoid parallel projection ambiguities. The presented results, obtained in simulation and on real data, allow validating the proposed scheme.
