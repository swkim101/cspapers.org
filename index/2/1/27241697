Computer-related learning experiences at the City College School of Architecture have been developed over the past four years based on a four-level scheme of progressively greater knowledge and ability to apply computers to design problems.
 All students in the School gain a rudimentary understanding of computer use through occassional lectures and demonstrations. A small group may elect a computer-aided design course in the fourth year while approximately twenty may elect a graduate elective sequence in advanced topics in the fifth year. Resources available include a full range of hardware and numerous software packages and programs.
