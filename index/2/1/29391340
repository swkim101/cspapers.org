It is our pleasure to welcome you to ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP Performance 2016, the 13th Joint International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems. This joint gathering occurs every three years, bringing together the flagship conferences of ACM SIGMETRICS and the IFIP Working Group 7.3 into a forum that attracts top quality papers in performance evaluation. 
 
This year's program includes papers on topics that have been the foundation of our communities, including queueing, network resource allocation, and performance measurement. As we have seen over the last couple of years, some topics in particular have come to the forefront, such as graph theory and social networks, learning, energy optimization, memory systems, and network economics. We received 208 submissions, of which 28 were accepted into the program as full papers, a highly competitive acceptance rate of 13.5%. Additionally, 24 papers were accepted as poster presentations, and appear in abbreviated form in the proceedings. 
 
The paper review process was as in previous years, starting with a first round where each paper was assigned to three reviewers. An online discussion period followed where some papers received up to two additional reviews. The Program Committee then met in person on Feb 13, 2016 at Columbia University in New York. After an entire day of intense deliberation, the committee selected 28 papers to be included as full papers in the program.
