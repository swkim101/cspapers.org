Users can sketch a cartoon character through multitouch screens and then hum songs, which will drive the cartoon character to dance to create a lively animation. In technical realization, we apply the mechanism of acoustic driving in which AniDraw extracts time-domain acoustic features to map to the intensity of dances, frequency-domain ones to map to the style of dances, and high-level ones including onesets and tempos to map to start, duration and speed of dances. AniDraw can not only stimulate usersâ€™ enthusiasm in artistic creation, but also enhance their esthetic ability on harmony.
