This paper presents a strengthened algorithm for temporal reasoning during plan recognition, which improves on a straightforward application of Allen's reasoning algorithm. This is made possible by viewing plans as both hierarchical structures and temporal networks. As a result, we can show how to use as constraints the temporal relations explicitly given in input to improve the results of plan recognition. We also discuss how to combine the given constraints with those prestored in the system's plan library to make more specific the temporal constraints indicated in the plans being recognised.
