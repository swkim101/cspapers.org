SpeechSkimmer is an interactive system for quickly browsing and finding information in speech recordings. Skimming speech recordings is much more difficult than visually scanning images, text, or video because of the slow, linear, temporal nature of the audio channel. The SpeechSkimmer system uses a combination of (1) time compression and pause removal, (2) automatically finding segments that summarize a recording, and (3) interaction techniques, to enable a speech recording to be heard quickly and at several levels of detail.
