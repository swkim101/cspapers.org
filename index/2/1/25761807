Unit tests can be significantly sped up by running them in parallel over distributed execution environments, such as the cloud. However, manually setting up such environments and configuring the testing frameworks to effectively use them is cumbersome and requires specialized expertise that developers might lack. We present Cloud Unit Testing (CUT), a tool for automatically executing unit tests in distributed execution environments. Given a set of unit tests, CUT allocates appropriate computational resources, i.e., virtual machines or containers, and schedules the execution of tests over them. Developers do not need to change existing unit test code, and can easily control relevant aspects of test execution, including resource allocation and test scheduling. Additionally, during the execution CUT monitors and publishes events about the running tests which enables stream analytics. CUT and videos showcasing its main features are freely available at: https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/testing/cut/
