In Japan, the necessity of saving energy is rising due to the nuclear accident caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011. Reduction of energy usage is required due to rapid increases in electricity consumption due to the scorching summer heat in recent years. The common ways to provide information on energy consumption mainly occur through "visualization" of information. On the contrary, olfactory stimulation can be performed while working, and it is effective also when the degree of arousal is low. This study considers applications on the basis of the concept of "smellization" of information using olfactive stimulation. In this paper, we introduce the configuration and operation examples of a system developed for evoking public energy conservation behavior using smell.
