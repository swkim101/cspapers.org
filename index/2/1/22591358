The activity of Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) generates much data. Although there are few, if any, database system products with features that attend to the requirements of CASE environments, there is a flurry of research work in the database field to develop technology to meet these requirements. The purpose of this paper is to raise the level of awareness in the software engineering community about this research on database systems for design applications. It describes technical problems and proposed solutions, and provides an extensive bibliography.
