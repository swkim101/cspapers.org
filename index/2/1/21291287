Collaborative Information Seeking/Retrieval (CIS/CIR) has given rise to several challenges in terms of search behavior analysis, retrieval model formalization as well as interface design. However, the major issue of evaluation in CIS/CIR is still underexplored. The goal of this workshop is to investigate the evaluation challenges in CIS/CIR with the hope of building standardized evaluation frameworks, methodologies, and task specifications that would foster and grow the research area (in a collaborative fashion).
