When following too many users on microblogging services, information overload occurs due to increased and varied communication activity. Users then either leave, or employ coping strategies to continue benefiting from the service. Through a crawl of 31 684 random users from Twitter and a qualitative survey with 115 respondents, it has been determined that by using lists as an information management coping strategy (filtering and compartmentalising varied communication activity), users are capable of following more users and experience fewer symptoms of information overload.
