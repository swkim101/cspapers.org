We present a Semantic Feature Analysis based mobile application and paired web application, which have been developed in order to facilitate speech and language therapy with a Person with Aphasia (PWA). The goal of this research is to streamline current speech and language therapy practices, by enabling rapid data entry, aggregation and remote analysis. The mobile application has been developed in Objective C and is targeted at iPad users, though a smaller hand-held version may be developed in future. The paired web application has been built using standard Flex components, while its transition to a Javascript/HTML5 version is planned. The developed system has been trialled clinically on two occasions with a small number of participants, the intention of which was to investigate the potential for the delivery of Semantic Feature therapy programs in both domestic and clinical settings. These trials also offered the opportunity to gauge the reaction of the participants towards the presence of a novel mobile technology, as well as assessing the attitudes of carers and speech and language professionals towards the use of the device in question.
