CSNET is the acronym for the Computer Science Research Network, a project supported by NSF to provide advanced computer network services to the computer research community. CSNET is a "logical net" -- a high-level communication environment spanning several physical nets, including the ARPANET, Phonenet, and Telenet. This paper reviews the history, the goals, the organization, the components, and the status of CSNET.
