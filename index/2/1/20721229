Equivalent Transmission Path (ETP) model based BER map method was proved to be used in fast estimating Bit Error Rate (BER) of Single-Input Single-Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (SISO-OFDM) system, where the delay spreading exceeds the guard interval. In this paper, we propose a scheme using BER map method to calculate BER of Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) OFDM system with application to MRC diversity at the reception. The simulation results show that, the proposed scheme is able to be used in estimating BER characteristic very accurately not only for SISO-OFDM system but also for SIMO-OFDM system.
