This paper proposes a driver assistance system with a collaborative control framework between the human driver and a Collision Avoidance System (CAS) for vehicles on the road while considering the driver drowsiness status. Driver drowsiness detection is performed with two inputs: driver's facial data from a camera mounted in front of the driver and steering wheel data from the car controller system. We use the driver's drowsiness state as an input to the collaborative control framework in which the CAS algorithm runs in parallel with the human control and only intervenes under certain situations to assist the human driver. Experiments were performed on a simulated vehicle driving testbed to evaluate our drowsiness detection system and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative control framework.
