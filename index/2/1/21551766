In this paper, we propose a novel, spatial co-location mining algorithm which automatically generates co-located spatial features without generating any non-clique candidates at each level. Subsequently our algorithm is more efficient than other existing level-wise co-location algorithms because no cliqueness checking is performed in our algorithm. In addition, our algorithm produces a smaller number of co-location candidates than the other existing algorithms.
