A prototype information retrieval system for lawyers, Justus, has been developed on a Sun workstation to run in a Guide hypertext environment. The hypertext database is created automatically by Justus from machine readable versions of the ordinary printed texts, ideally the publisher's typesetting tapes. The database incorporates primary legal sources, such as statutes and cases, and secondary sources, such as textbooks and a dictionary. Initially, the lawyer may select any document in the system. From this initial document, he may access any other document, or part of any other document, to which reference is made. Reference selection is by a pointing device, such as a mouse. There is no limit on the number of selections that can be made, and no restrictions on the path through the system.
