Applying state-of-the-art technology, we identified effector DN T cells as contributors to pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the skin of patients with psoriasis. After the definition of T cell phenotypes within the CD4+, CD8+ and DN T cell compartments, we are aiming to i) define signature cytokine expression patterns in effector T cells in health and disease, and ii) determine molecular mechanisms orchestrating T cell lineage determination. As mentioned above, effector T cells also reflect a key contributor to inflammation and tissue damage in SLE. Thus, research in (more easily accessible) samples from psoriasis patients may guide future directions and developments in SLE.
