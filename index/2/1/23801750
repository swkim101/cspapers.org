We introduce CyberProf, a robust software package which utilizes the full capabilities of a World Wide Web server as an intelligent human-computer interface for grading, creating, and presenting educational course materials. Students can solve course problems presented with text, graphics, animations, and sound on the Web and can receive instant feedback from a sophisticated grading package which makes use of the latest complex systems data analysis tools to handle ambiguous input in an intelligent manner. Fully integrated lecture notes and help files are hyperlinked to assist the student in solving an exercise. Instructors can make use of built-in problem set and lecture notes editors to create an entire online course customized for their needs. Early results of the system are promising. In the first university course in which CyberProf was used, class attendance rates were significantly higher, dropout rates were lower, and grade distributions were higher when compared to figures from the same course in previous semesters.
