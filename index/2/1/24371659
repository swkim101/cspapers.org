Precisely evaluating the accuracy of worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis tools through benchmarking is inherently difficult and in general involves a significant amount of manual intervention. In this paper, we address this problem with ALADDIN, a tooling framework that enables fully-automated evaluations of WCET analyzers. To provide comprehensive results based on benchmarks with known WCETs, ALADDIN incorporates the GENE benchmark generator. Our demonstration shows how ALADDIN evaluates two state-of-the-art WCET analyzers: the commercial tool aiT and the open-source tool PLATIN.
