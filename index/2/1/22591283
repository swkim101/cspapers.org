The limitation of beam scanning in a Uniform Linear Array (ULA) is determined as a maximum range of scanning; within that the sidelobe of the pattern still not be exceed the certain level. There are some calculations for this purpose by numeric method; these are convenient for some practical applications. This paper presents a new approach to calculate the above limitation by analytical method. The simple analytical formula is obtained and the comparison of derived results by two methods is presented.
