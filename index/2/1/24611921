The contents generated from different data sources are usually non-uniform, such as long texts produced by news websites and short texts produced by social media. Uncovering topics over large-scale non-uniform texts becomes an important task for analyzing network data. However, the existing methods may fail to recognize the difference between long texts and short texts. To address this problem, we propose a novel topic modeling method for non-uniform text topic modeling referred to as self-adaptive sliding window based topic model (SSWTM). Specifically, in all kinds of texts, relevant words have a closer distance to each other than irrelevant words. Based on this assumption, SSWTM extracts relevant words by using a selfadaptive sliding window and models on the whole corpus. The self-adaptive sliding window can filter noisy information and change the size of a window according to different text contents. Experimental results on short texts from Twitter and long texts from Chinese news articles demonstrate that our method can discover more coherent topics for non-uniform texts compared with state-of-the-art methods.
