In helicopter satellite communications, the periodic blockage of the received signal and the carrier frequency fluctuation are the most important problems. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-detection time diversity combining scheme with accurate automatic frequency controller (AFC) for helicopter satellite communications. In the proposed scheme, a novel AFC tracks and removes the carrier frequency fluctuation due to Doppler shift exactly, and the in-phase combining of the time diversity signal is performed before the coherent detection. Results of computer simulation show that the proposed scheme improves the BER performance of the previous post-detection combining scheme.
