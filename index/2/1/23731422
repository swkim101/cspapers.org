A big challenge in studying file and storage systems is discovering interrelationships between multiple performance metrics. It is difficult to analyze and interpret this abstract collection of multidimensional performance data using traditional non-visual techniques. This project presents a visualization technique to convert storage controller performance data into an image that domain experts can use for exploring, discovering, comparing, validating, accounting, monitoring, identifying faults, and studying the effects of adjusting different performance parameters. We present an algorithm that visualizes storage controller's performance metrics along a traditional 2D grid or a linear space-filling spiral. We use graphical "glyphs" (simple geometric objects) that vary in color, spatial placement and texture properties to represent the attribute values contained in a data element to form visual structures.
