We demonstrate an oral scientific simulation and its visualization based on E-science. This oral scientific application will become an essential key component for medical and dental clinic in the near future because Bio-Medical simulations will provide a clinical index considering a prognostic of a disease. In this case, it was shown that the physical theory of sound production of speech sound, sibilant. However, it is difficult to acquire the computational and storage resources in the hospitals. Our E-science infrastructure enables scientists and clinicians to achieve the advanced information produced by simulations. As the result of this phase implementation for Bio-Medical simulation on E-science infrastructure, we could extract the scientific findings about the oral science. Moreover, this infrastructure can be used more generally because of the divided architecture between applications and E-science infrastructure.
