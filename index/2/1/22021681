This paper introduces material computation to offload computing from machine to material, in the process of creating shape-changing output. It contains the explanation on the mechanism of transformation, the concept of material computation, the summary and analysis of literature research within and beyond the HCI field, the interaction loop integrating material computation, and my own practice in material computation technics and applications.
