The aim of this paper is to combine the Bond Graph energy-flow modeling and the VHDL-AMS signal-flow modeling language for the simulation and the prototyping of modern switch-mode power converters. The proposed approach was used to model a specific test case, consisting of a Buck converter with a mixed-signal PWM regulator. The causal structure of bond graph paradigm provides the basis for the convergence of the equation system of the model. We present a library package of methodic and semi-automated design of simulation models for the visual signal-flow simulator SystemVision. The primary simulation result shows a good accuracy.
