Some concepts of the functional organisation of the sensory systems in men and animals are considered, that can serve as a basis for design of artificial sensory systems for robots. The paper describes a human tactile system, a device simulating the tactile function, algorithms for form recognition by sense of touch and the results of the experiments with such an artificial tactile system
