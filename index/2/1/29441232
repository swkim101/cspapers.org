This paper describes a project conducted during the summer of 1981 at the University of Central Florida. Through the Governor's Office of the State of Florida, funds were identified for several state universities to support gifted high school students in summer programs. Such Governor's Programs for gifted students have been done in a number of other states before, most notably Virginia (see [1] and [2]), but this was only the second such program in the State of Florida, and the first at the University of Central Florida. High school students were selected from the surrounding geographic area on the basis of high school grades, preliminary SAT scores, and teacher recommendations. The thirty or so students chosen all had excellent credentials. Students were rising seniors or juniors in high school, and the program lasted six weeks with the students housed in dormitories on campus.
