To manage the increasing amount of RDF data, an RDF repository should provide not only necessary scalability and efficiency, but also sufficient inference capabilities. In this paper, we propose a native RDF repository, System, to pursue a better tradeoff among the above requirements. System takes the hypergraph representation for RDF as the data model for its persistent storage, which effectively avoids the costs of data model transformation when accessing RDF data. In addition, a set of efficient semantic query processing techniques are designed. The results of performance evaluation on the LUBM benchmark show that System has a better combined metric value than the other comparable systems.
