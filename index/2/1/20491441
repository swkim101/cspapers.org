This work introduces a novel refresh mechanism that leverages reuse information to decide which blocks should be refreshed in an energy-aware eDRAM last-level cache. Experimental results show that, compared to a conventional eDRAM cache, the energy-aware approach achieves refresh energy savings up to 71%, while the reduction on the overall dynamic energy is by 65% with negligible performance losses.
