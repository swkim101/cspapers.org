Our daily urban experiences are the product of our perceptions and senses, yet the complete sensorial range is strikingly absent from urban studies. Sight has been historically privileged over the other senses and urban studies. However, smell and sound have also a huge influence over how we perceive places, they impact our behavior, attitudes and health. Yet, city planning is concerned only with a few bad smells and with limiting noise levels. We propose a new way of capturing nuanced sensorial perceptions of cities from data implicitly generated by social media users and of producing detailed sensorial maps of our cities.
