The Planning Council on Computing in Education and Research is developing a national network to facilitate the sharing of computing resources among colleges and universities in the United States. The low initial volume of traffic and the widespread dispersion of users and suppliers make it desirable to obtain communication services through a packet switching common carrier. Increases in volume and technological developments may eventually make it attractive to use dedicated leased circuits for certain high-volume portions of the traffic, but it is likely that primary reliance will continue to be placed on common carriers providing packet switching or dial-up services.
