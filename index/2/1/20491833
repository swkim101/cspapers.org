Tuskegee Institute installed an IBM 1620 in October 1961. Over the next several years as demand required, the system was expanded from the original 20K to 60K then to disk. The original acquisition was made possible with a NSF grant.
 in June 1972, with the assistance of a NSF grant, among others, Tuskegee Institute was able to install a Hewlett-Packard 2000F Time Sharing system. With the ability to use the system from any part of of the campus, service to the various schools and departments is staggering. Engineering has increased it's use but it accounts for only 30% of the current use of the system.
