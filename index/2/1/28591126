Smalltalk Card Game (SCG) is an activity using index cards for learning object-oriented thinking. In its name, 'Smalltalk', does not represent a kind of computer language but the literal meaning of the word-- polite conversation about ordinary subject, especially at social occasions. It is because the game is based on 'rules of conversation' that we use in our daily lives. The SCG was designed to teach Object-Oriented (OO) concepts in a bottom-up approach. Participants can experience and understand OO concepts in an evolutionary way by extending basic rules of game without using terminologies or previous knowledge on objectoriented programming.
