Unsupervised semantic segmentation in the time series domain is a much-studied problem due to its potential to detect unexpected regularities and regimes in poorly understood data. However, the current techniques have several shortcomings, which have limited the adoption of time series semantic segmentation beyond academic settings for three primary reasons. First, most methods require setting/learning many parameters and thus may have problems generalizing to novel situations. Second, most methods implicitly assume that all the data is segmentable, and have difficulty when that assumption is unwarranted. Finally, most research efforts have been confined to the batch case, but online segmentation is clearly more useful and actionable. To address these issues, we present an algorithm which is domain agnostic, has only one easily determined parameter, and can handle data streaming at a high rate. In this context, we test our algorithm on the largest and most diverse collection of time series datasets ever considered, and demonstrate our algorithm's superiority over current solutions. Furthermore, we are the first to show that semantic segmentation may be possible at superhuman performance levels.
