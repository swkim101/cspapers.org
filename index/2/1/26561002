A new approach to general netlist design rule checking is presented, which has been successfully applied to design for testability rule checking and electrical rule checking. The core of the checker is an interpreter, which performs operations of a set-based calculus. In combination with hierarchy preprocessing by expansion and netlist pattern matching, the interpreter approach is discussed. The implementation and the results achieved are outlined. >
