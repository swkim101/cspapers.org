Compliant end effectors in robotics are an important prerequisite for the field of object manipulation and environment interactions. However, current manipulators are usually stiff position-controlled systems, generating the need to add compliance. In this work, we present Forward Dynamics Compliance Control (FDCC), a new threefold control concept that realizes Cartesian compliance through combining Admittance, Impedance and Force Control into one control strategy. We close the control loop only through a force-torque sensor, allowing a system independent and decoupled configuration of the end effector compliance. As a key component in FDCC, we leverage forward dynamics simulations of a virtual model to directly map Cartesian inputs to joint control commands, leading to excellent stability in singularities. Experiments on three different robotic manipulators verify the key advantages of this approach.
