Multicodes have been demonstrated to provide performance gains of up to 25 percent. Present multicode identification techniques rely on frequency of occurrence and sequence length alone. This research extends previous work by presenting a multicode identification algorithm based on the frequency of occurrence and the optimization potential of the sequence.
