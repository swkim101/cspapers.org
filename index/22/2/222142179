Many real-world situations allow for the acquisition of additional relevant information when making an assessment with limited or uncertain data. However, traditional ML approaches either require all features to be acquired beforehand or regard part of them as missing data that cannot be acquired. In this work, we propose models that perform active feature acquisition (AFA) to improve the prediction assessments at evaluation time. We formulate the AFA problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and resolve it using reinforcement learning (RL). The AFA problem yields sparse rewards and contains a high-dimensional complicated action space. Thus, we propose learning a generative surrogate model that captures the complicated dependencies among input features to assess potential information gain from acquisitions. We also leverage the generative surrogate model to provide intermediate rewards and auxiliary information to the agent. Furthermore, we extend AFA in a task we coin active instance recognition (AIR) for the unsupervised case where the target variables are the unobserved features themselves and the goal is to collect information for a particular instance in a cost-efficient way. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves considerably better performance than previous state of the art methods on both supervised and unsupervised tasks.
