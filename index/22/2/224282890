Bootstrapping is an established tool for examining the behaviour of offline information retrieval (IR) experiments, where it has primarily been used to assess statistical significance and the robustness of significance tests. In this work we consider how bootstrapping can be used to assess the reliability of effectiveness measures for experimental IR. We use bootstrapping of the corpus of documents rather than, as in most prior work, the set of queries. We demonstrate that bootstrapping can provide new insights into the behaviour of effectiveness measures: the precision of the measurement of a system for a query can be quantified; some measures are more consistent than others; rankings of systems on a test corpus likewise have a precision (or uncertainty) that can be quantified; and, in experiments with limited volumes of relevance judgements, measures can be wildly different in terms of reliability and precision. Our results show that the uncertainty in measurement and ranking of system performance can be substantial and thus our approach to corpus bootstrapping provides a key tool for helping experimenters to choose measures and understand reported outcomes.
