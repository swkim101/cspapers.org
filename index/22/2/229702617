WebAssembly is a new programming language built for better performance in web applications. It defines a binary code format and a text representation for the code. At first glance, WebAssembly files are not easily understandable to human readers, regardless of the experience level. As a result, distributed third-party WebAssembly modules need to be implicitly trusted by developers as verifying the functionality requires significant effort. To this end, we develop an automated classification tool WASim for identifying the purpose of WebAssembly programs by analyzing features at the module-level. It assigns purpose labels to a module in order to assist developers in understanding the binary module. The code for WASim is available at https://github.com/WASimilarity/WASim and a video demo is available at https://youtu.be/usfYFleTy0U.
