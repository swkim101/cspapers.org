The evolution of radio access networks poses significant challenges to the transport networks, including backhaul and fronthaul systems. Ultra-dense small-cell networks in high frequency bands are being considered promising solutions. For beyond 2020 networks, frequency bands up to 100 GHz can be considered for achieving the target increase of 1000 times in the throughput to end users. The deployment of ultra-dense small cells in high frequency bands requires a massive deployment of mobile transport networks. In addition, stringent requirement of low latency sets significant constraints on the transport systems. An analog waveform transmission of mobile signals, especially of those in the millimeter-wave bands, over the transport links would be very attractive to reduce the latency, data rate, and simplify antenna sites. However, for transporting radio signals to a huge number of antenna sites, the use of only fiber-optic transport links will not be sufficient due to the difficulty in the installation of fiber cables, especially in ultra-dense urban areas. An orchestration of different transmission technologies, including wired and wireless systems, would be very important to facilitate the deployment of ultra-dense small cells in future mobile networks. In this paper, we introduce an orchestration of fiber-optics, free-space optics, millimeter-wave, and hybrid systems for high-speed and flexible transmission of mobile signals. We present examples of proof-of-concept demonstrations for each system, indicating that the proposed systems can meet the performance requirements of future mobile signals.
