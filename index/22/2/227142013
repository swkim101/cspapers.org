The expansion of Cognitive Radio (CR) was ﬁrst impacted by the advent of Software Defined Radio (SDR). SDR provides the reconﬁgurability needed to switch from one standard to another. In this context and because it will reduce the size of the software to be downloaded, parameterization is an active research topic and appears as a keystone of SDR. Thereby, this paper points out an Extended Reconﬁgurable Linear Feedback Shift Register Based (ER-LFSR) structure, which can realizes several front rank operations of multi mode CR transceivers. Focused on OFDMbased Air Interfaces, the selected approach was to deﬁne a range of operations applying like-looking structures. In so doing, we specify two parameterizable structures to fulﬁll functions such as Pseudo Random Sequence Generators, Scrambling, Convolutive Coding, Cyclic coding, Reed-Solomon Coding or Reed-Solomon decoding.
