In this paper, we propose a novel multiple description coding (MDC) method to operate at network edges for robust video transmission. The proposed MDC method, named VVC-MDC offers benefits of both the new H.266 Versatile video coding (H.266/VVC) and Distributed video coding (DVC) standards, which can provide not only higher performance compared to the traditional MDC methods but also effective scheme for the error resilience. At the encoder, the proposed VVC-MDC coder encode the source video sequence into two descriptions including odd and even subsequences and then transmit these descriptions to the receiver. At the receiver, our proposed MDC decoder is designed using a novel WynerZiv (WZ) coding introduced in the DVC to provide a high image quality for the video sequence. Unlike the conventional MDC methods, the redundant data in our proposed MDC can be effectively controlled based on the WZ coding scheme. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a wide range of tradeoffs between coding efficiency and error resilience, and provide much better H.266/VVC peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance than other conventional MDC methods.
