Entity retrieval has received increasing research attention. The recent progress in deep and machine learning techniques provides powerful tools for developing effective entity-centered solutions. This workshop series provides a platform where interdisciplinary studies of entity retrieval and learning can be presented, and focused discussions can take place. We also organize a shared task related to entity retrieval. The 3rd International Workshop on EntitY Retrieval and lEarning (EYRE 2020) was a half-day workshop co-located with the 29th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2020) as a virtual event in Ireland.
