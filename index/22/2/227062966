In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) relay system under imperfect channel state information (CSI). We propose using multiple antennas at the source and destination to increase the signal-to-noise (SNR) gain of the primary channel, thus improving the systemâ€™s security performance. Exact closed-form expression of the secure outage probability (SOP) and secrecy capacity (SC) are derived and verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. A close match between the theoretical and simulation results confirms the accurateness of our mathematical analysis. We show that the SOP decreases while the SC increases as the average SNR is higher. Furthermore, the saturated minimum and maximum values highly depend on the number of antennas at source and destination, the degree of imperfect CSI, and the location of eavesdropper.
