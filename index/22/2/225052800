Natural disasters including earthquakes, tsunamis, and anthropogenic disasters, such as wildfires, are dynamic situations requiring constant monitoring as numerous hazards are constantly emerging that hinder humanitarian efforts and create deadly conditions for rescue workers and victims. Now, with humanity facing a pandemic, it becomes even more vital to provide health care workers and first responders with low-cost and robust methods to protect themselves and help stop the spread of a disease that is ravaging our lives and economies. There are high expectations that Artificial Intelligence will be the game changing technology that will make sense of the plethora of disparate sources of data being collected about individuals, communities and the environment and that it will help solve all of these problems. Meanwhile, coupling AI with robotics is anticipated to be the foundation for a future contactless society that will mitigate the spread of diseases and keep us healthier. However, AI is not a box that can magically produce these solutions and building trustworthy AI comes with many challenges. This talk will discuss those challenges and explore some of the pathways forward to best utilize AI and its promise to advance robotics to conquer societal challenges.
