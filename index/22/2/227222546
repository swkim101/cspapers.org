DAC brings together designers, EDA developers, analysts, marketers, consultants, managers, executives, professors and students. This makes it a great place to meet others who are working on the same and related problems, to learn about new developments, to meet people who use what you develop or develop what you use, to learn about needs and trends and to renew old friendships. It is an exciting and fast-paced week where the benefits are limited only by your desire, and time.The technical program presents the latest developments in EDA tools and design methodologies. Power management is the major emphasis this year - in papers, a panel, Monday's tutorial and the hands-on tutorial. Other hot topics are: deep submicron issues, embedded system design and verification and the design of complex, high-performance ASICs. New this year are 5 papers covering highlights from ISSCC.The keynote speakers are Sir Robin Saxby, Chairman of ARM Holdings plc, who will look to the future, and Professor Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, who will look back over DAC's 40 years. DAC fullconference registrants will receive a DVD containing 40 years of DAC proceedings.Over 190 companies will be at DAC this year, 25 of them making their debut.
