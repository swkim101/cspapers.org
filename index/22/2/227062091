A reflectarray antenna of 441 unit-cells with dimensions of 112.5 mm x 112.5 mm is proposed in this paper. The unit-cell consists of a cross and a square ring. The reflectarray is illuminated by a horn antenna at the center-feed and 25 degrees offset-feed with the 3 GHz bandwidth (from 26.5 GHz to 29.5 GHz) for N257 band/5G. The shadow area of the reflectarray antenna is improved by the 25 degrees offset-fed structure with a peak gain of 26.4 dBi satisfied with the 5G base station antenna requirement.
