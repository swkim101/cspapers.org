Despite their elegant formulation and lightweight memory cost, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) suffer from known representational limitations. In particular, the single flow learned by NODEs cannot express all homeomorphisms from a given data space to itself, and their static weight parametrization restricts the type of functions they can learn compared to discrete architectures with layer-dependent weights. Here, we describe a new module called neurally-controlled ODE (N-CODE) designed to improve the expressivity of NODEs. The parameters of N-CODE modules are dynamic variables governed by a trainable map from initial or current activation state, resulting in forms of open-loop and closed-loop control, respectively. A single module is sufficient for learning a distribution on non-autonomous flows that adaptively drive neural representations. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that N-CODE circumvents limitations of previous models and show how increased model expressivity manifests in several domains. In supervised learning, we demonstrate that our framework achieves better performance than NODEs as measured by both training speed and testing accuracy. In unsupervised learning, we apply this control perspective to an image Autoencoder endowed with a latent transformation flow, greatly improving representational power over a vanilla model and leading to state-of-the-art image reconstruction on CIFAR-10.
