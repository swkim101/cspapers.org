There is an increasing interest in developing text-based relational reasoning systems, which are capable of systematically reasoning about the relationships between entities mentioned in a text. However, there remains a substantial performance gap between NLP models for relational reasoning and models based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which have access to an underlying symbolic representation of the text. In this work, we investigate how the structured knowledge of a GNN can be distilled into various NLP models in order to improve their performance. We first pre-train a GNN on a reasoning task using structured inputs and then incorporate its knowledge into an NLP model (e.g., an LSTM) via knowledge distillation. To overcome the difficulty of cross-modal knowledge transfer, we also employ a contrastive learning based module to align the latent representations of NLP models and the GNN. We test our approach with two state-of-the-art NLP models on 13 different inductive reasoning datasets from the CLUTRR benchmark and obtain significant improvements.
