In this paper, we study the localization problem under non-Gaussian noise. In particular, we consider systems that can be represented by a state transition and a measurement component. The state transition indicates how the system evolves given a control variable. The measurement component compares, for a given state, the received and predicted measurements. Here we consider a radio based range sensor which is the primary source of non-Gaussian noise in the system. We solve the problem using a MHE (Maximum Horizon Estimator) with a correntropy similarity metric. Given a time window, the MHE seeks the best set of states that explains the system for the received measurements. Moreover, the main advantage of a MHE is that it allows the re-estimation of past states. Additionally, the correntropy is a similarity metric that, given the amount of error in the estimation, behaves as L2, L1 or L0 norms and has been successfully used in many applications under non-Gaussian noise. We evaluate our proposed method using both simulated and real data. The results show that correntropy is able to work well in comparison with other methods in presence of impulsive noise.
