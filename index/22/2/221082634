The structured sparsity-inducing (cid:96) 1 , ∞ -norm, as a generalization of the classical (cid:96) 1 -norm, plays an important role in jointly sparse models which select or remove simultaneously all the variables forming a group. However, its resulting problem is more difﬁcult to solve than the conventional (cid:96) 1 -norm constrained problem. In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm for Euclidean projection onto (cid:96) 1 , ∞ -norm ball. We tackle the projection problem via semismooth Newton al-gorithm to solve the system of semismooth equations. Meanwhile, exploiting the structure of the Jacobian matrix via LU decomposition yields an equivalent algorithm which is proved to terminate after a ﬁnite number of iterations. Empirical studies demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solver and is promising for the optimization of learning problems with the (cid:96) 1 , ∞ -norm ball constraint.
