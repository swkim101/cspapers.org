We present Akamai DNS, one of the largest authoritative DNS infrastructures in the world, that supports the Akamai content delivery network (CDN) as well as authoritative DNS hosting and DNS-based load balancing services for many enterprises. As the starting point for a significant fraction of the world's Internet interactions, Akamai DNS serves millions of queries each second and must be resilient to avoid disrupting myriad online services, scalable to meet the ever increasing volume of DNS queries, performant to prevent user-perceivable performance degradation, and reconfigurable to react quickly to shifts in network conditions and attacks. We outline the design principles and architecture used to achieve Akamai DNS's goals, relating the design choices to the system workload and quantifying the effectiveness of those designs. Further, we convey insights from operating the production system that are of value to the broader research community.
