Current UHF RFID systems suffer from two long-standing problems: 1) miss-reading non-line-of-sight or misoriented tags and 2) cross-reading undesired, distant tags due to multi-path reflections. This paper proposes a novel system, NFC+, to overcome the fundamental challenges. NFC+ is a magnetic field reader, which can inventory standard NFC tagged objects with a reasonably long range and arbitrary orientation. NFC+ achieves this by leveraging physical and algorithmic techniques based on magnetic resonance engineering. We build a prototype of NFC+ and conduct extensive evaluations in a logistic network. Comparing to UHF RFID, we find that NFC+ can reduce the miss-reading rate from 23% to 0.03%, and cross-reading rate from 42% to 0, for randomly oriented objects. NFC+ demonstrates high robustness for RFID unfriendly media (e.g., water bottles and metal cans). It can reliably read commercial NFC tags at a distance of up to 3 meters which, for the first time, enables NFC to be directly applied to practical logistics network applications.
