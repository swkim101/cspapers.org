While developing and operating software-intensive systems various concerns must be considered. Concerns like quality properties, domain, and lifecycle phase may differ from one project to another. Currently different languages and tools are required for modeling and analyzing these concerns. This results in enormous effort for model creation and maintenance. In this paper, we present a vision of tailored quality modeling and analysis by clearly separating several concerns using modular metamodels and tooling. Â© 2018 Universitat zu Koln.
