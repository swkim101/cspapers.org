In recent years, IF-This-Then-That (IFTTT) services are becoming more and more popular. Many platforms such as Zapier, IFTTT.com, and Workato provide such services, which allow users to create workflows with “triggers” and “actions” by using Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). However, the number of IFTTT recipes in the above platforms increases much slower than the growth of Web APIs. This is because human efforts are still largely required to build and deploy IFTTT recipes in the above platforms. To address this problem, in this paper, we present an automation tool to automatically generate the IFTTT mashup infrastructure. The proposed tool provides 5 REST APIs, which can automatically generate triggers, rules, and actions in AWS, and create a workflow XML to describe an IFTTT mashup by connecting the triggers, rules, and actions. This workflow XML is automatically sent to Fujitsu RunMyProcess (RMP) to set up and execute IFTTT mashup. The proposed tool, together with its associated method and procedure, enables an end-to-end solution for automatically creating, deploying, and executing IFTTT mashups in a few seconds, which can greatly reduce the development cycle and cost for new IFTTT mashups.
