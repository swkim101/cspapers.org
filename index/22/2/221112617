We prove that a random $d$-regular graph, with high probability, is a cut sparsifier of the clique with approximation error at most $\left(2\sqrt{\frac 2 \pi} + o_{n,d}(1)\right)/\sqrt d$, where $2\sqrt{\frac 2 \pi} = 1.595\ldots$ and $o_{n,d}(1)$ denotes an error term that depends on $n$ and $d$ and goes to zero if we first take the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and then the limit $d \rightarrow \infty$. This is established by analyzing linear-size cuts using techniques of Jagannath-Sen '17 derived from ideas from statistical physics and analyzing small cuts via martingale inequalities. We also prove that every spectral sparsifier of the clique having average degree $d$ and a certain high "pseudo-girth" property has an approximation error that is at least the "Ramanujan bound" $(2-o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$, which is met by $d$-regular Ramanujan graphs, generalizing a lower bound of Srivastava-Trevisan '18. Together, these results imply a separation between spectral sparsification and cut sparsification. If $G$ is a random $\log n$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, we show that, with high probability, $G$ admits a (weighted subgraph) cut sparsifier of average degree $d$ and approximation error at most $(1.595\ldots + o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$, while every (weighted subgraph) spectral sparsifier of $G$ having average degree $d$ has approximation error at least $(2-o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$.
