Game-theoretic methods make it possible for designers to design solutions that are robust against complicated conditions, however, these methods are often specific to the problems they investigate. This work introduces the Game-Augmented Robust Simulated Annealing Teams (GARSAT) framework, a game-theoretic agent-based architecture that generates solutions robust to variation, and models problems with elementary information, making it easily extendable. The platform was used to generate designs under consideration of a multidimensional attack. Designs were produced under various adversarial settings and compared to designs generated without considering adversaries to validate the model. The process successfully created robust designs able to withstand multiple combined conditions, and the effects of the adversarial settings on the designs were explored.
