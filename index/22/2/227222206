This paper presents an innovative approach to estimate the unknown parameters of a wound-rotor induction machine. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that estimated values converge to exact machine parameter values without any condition on the sufficiently richness of the input voltage. The algorithm is tested in simulation and compared to the recursive least squares method. Results show a superior performance for the proposed identification method. The converge to exact values is extremely fast.
