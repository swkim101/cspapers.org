Despite the current diversity and inclusion initiatives in the academic community, researchers with a non-native command of English still face significant obstacles when writing papers in English. This paper presents the Langsmith editor, which assists inexperienced, non-native researchers to write English papers, especially in the natural language processing (NLP) field. Our system can suggest fluent, academic-style sentences to writers based on their rough, incomplete phrases or sentences. The system also encourages interaction between human writers and the computerized revision system. The experimental results demonstrated that Langsmith helps non-native English-speaker students write papers in English. The system is available at https://emnlp-demo.editor. langsmith.co.jp/.
