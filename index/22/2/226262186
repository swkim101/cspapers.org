Contextual embeddings are proved to be overwhelmingly effective to the task of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) compared with other sense representation techniques. However, these embeddings fail to embed sense knowledge in semantic networks. In this paper, we propose a Synset Relation-Enhanced Framework (SREF) that leverages sense relations for both sense embedding enhancement and a try-again mechanism that implements WSD again, after obtaining basic sense embeddings from augmented WordNet glosses. Experiments on all-words and lexical sample datasets show that the proposed system achieves new state-of-the-art results, defeating previous knowledge-based systems by at least 5.5 F1 measure. When the system utilizes sense embeddings learned from SemCor, it outperforms all previous supervised systems with only 20% SemCor data.
