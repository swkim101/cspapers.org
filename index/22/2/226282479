This paper proposes a systematic solution that uses an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to aggressively and safely track an agile target. It properly handles the challenging situations where the intent of the target and the dense environments are unknown. Our work is divided into two parts: target motion prediction and tracking trajectory planning. The target motion prediction method utilizes target observations to reliably predict its future motion. The tracking trajectory planner follows the hierarchical workflow. A target informed kinody-namic searching method is adopted as the front-end, which heuristically searches for a safe tracking trajectory. The back- end optimizer then refines it into a spatial-temporal optimal trajectory. The proposed solution is integrated into an onboard quadrotor system. We fully test the system in challenging real-world tracking missions. Moreover, benchmark comparisons validate that the proposed method surpasses the cutting-edge methods on time efficiency and tracking effectiveness.
