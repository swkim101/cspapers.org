This paper presents AIRMOCHI, a tool that provides remote access and control of apps by leveraging a mobile platform's publicly exported accessibility features. While AIRMOCHI is designed to be platform-independent, we discuss its iOS implementation. We show that AIRMOCHI places no restrictions on apps, is able to handle a variety of scenarios, and imposes a negligible performance overhead. https://youtu.be/rhPz2Hs4Ius https://github.com/nkllkc/air_mochi
