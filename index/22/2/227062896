This paper proposes a design of low profile, wideband 3D metamaterial artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) structure synthesized genetic programming (GP) algorithm. Metallic 3D patterns are created in four corners of a substrate layers and the patterning in the unit cell is admitted to extending into unit cells, thus achieving a high frequency response with much smaller unit cell size and thickness. This research has been successfully designed with the reflection phase ±90° with the bandwidth of the AMC metamaterial is 9.5 – 10.5GHz with the center frequency of 10 GHz (0° reflection phase). This work shows the great potential of the application with anti-reflection surfaces and low-radar cross section (RCS) platforms.
