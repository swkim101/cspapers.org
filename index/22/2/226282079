Different environments pose a great challenge to the outdoor robust visual perception for long-term autonomous driving, and the generalization of learning-based algorithms on different environments is still an open problem. Although monocular depth prediction has been well studied recently, few works focus on the robustness of learning-based depth prediction across different environments, e.g. changing illumination and seasons, owing to the lack of such a multi-environment real-world dataset and benchmark. To this end, the cross-season monocular depth prediction dataset and benchmark, SeasonDepth, is introduced to benchmark the depth estimation performance under different environments. We investigate several state-of-the-art representative open-source supervised and self-supervised depth prediction methods using newly-formulated metrics. Through extensive experimental evaluation on the proposed dataset and cross-dataset evaluation with current autonomous driving datasets, the performance and robustness against the influence of multiple environments are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. We show that long-term monocular depth prediction is still challenging and believe our work can boost further research on the long-term robustness and generalization for outdoor visual perception. The dataset is available on https://seasondepth.github.io.
