Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to automatically answer natural language questions via well-structured relation information between entities stored in knowledge graphs. When faced with a complex question with compositional semantics, query graph generation is a practical semantic parsing-based method. But existing works rely on heuristic rules with limited coverage, making them impractical on more complex questions. This paper proposes a Director-Actor-Critic framework to overcome these challenges. Through options over a Markov Decision Process, query graph generation is formulated as a hierarchical decision problem. The Director determines which types of triples the query graph needs, the Actor generates corresponding triples by choosing nodes and edges, and the Critic calculates the semantic similarity between the generated triples and the given questions. Moreover, to train from weak supervision, we base the framework on hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with intrinsic motivation. To accelerate the training process, we pre-train the Critic with high-reward trajectories generated by hand-crafted rules, and leverage curriculum learning to gradually increase the complexity of questions during query graph generation. Extensive experiments conducted over widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
