 This paper demonstrates the use of the polynomial chaos-based Cokriging (PC-Cokriging) on various simulation-based problems, namely an analytical borehole function, an ultrasonic testing (UT) case and a robust design optimization of an airfoil case. This metamodel is compared to Kriging, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), polynomial chaos-based Kriging (PC-Kriging) and Cokriging. The PC-Cokriging model is a multi-variate variant of PC-Kriging and its construction is similar to Cokriging. For the borehole function, the PC-Cokriging requires only three high-fidelity samples to accurately capture the global accuracy of the function. For the UT case, it requires 20 points. Sensitivity analysis is performed for the UT case showing that the F-number has negligible effect on the output response. For the robust design case, a 75 and 31 drag count reduction is reported on the mean and standard deviation of the drag coefficient, respectively, when compared to the baseline shape.
