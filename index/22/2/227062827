In this paper, we present a solution to design a simulation model for mobile node with multiple radio interfaces in mobile ad-hoc wireless networks (MANET). This solution extends the mobile node architecture in NS2 network simulator to allow analysis and evaluation of the performance of multichannel mobile ad-hoc wireless networks. Simulation results show that the effectiveness of multi-radio mobile node model. Network performance with new mobile node architecture is greatly improved as the number of wireless interfaces increased.
