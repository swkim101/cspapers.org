Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng for Nonstationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning approaches.
