Transportation using wheelchair is one of the most frequent transportation methods at home, medical and nursing care facilities. Wheelchairs are designed to be operable by passengers but often require assistance, and wheelchair assistance is a heavy burden. In order to quantitatively evaluate the physical burden of the caregiver when operating the wheelchair, it is necessary to analyze the characteristics of the force applied to the wheelchair when the caregiver operates the wheelchair. On the other hand, the optimal posture index of the caregiver when operating a wheelchair is not known, and the operation posture differs depending on the caregiver. Therefore, in this study, we compare the posture and the mechanical characteristics of multiple caregivers to operate a wheelchair, and consider the posture of the caregiver.
