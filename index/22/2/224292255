In this demo, we present SEBDB, a novel blockchain database that integrates immutability and transparency properties of blockchain with modeling and query ability of relational database. In summary, SEBDB has the following advantages: First, it adopts the linked structure and full replication of data among multiple participants to guarantee immutability and transparency. Second, it introduces the relational model to blockchain without introducing extra overhead, based on which relational queries are supported. SEBDB supports SQL-like language as the general interface to support convenient application development, in which intrinsic operations are re-defined and re-implemented to suit for blockchain platform. Third, it supports rich verifiable queries based on the proposed authenticated index, thin clients can participate in the system regardless of limitations of storage, network, and computing resources. We demonstrate the usability and scalability of SEBDB using a donation system.
