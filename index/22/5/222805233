While there is an enormous amount of information online for making decisions such as choosing a product, restaurant, or school, it can be costly for users to synthesize that information into confident decisions. Information for users' many different criteria needs to be gathered from many different sources into a structure where they can be compared and contrasted. The usefulness of each criterion for differentiating potential options can be opaque to users, and evidence such as reviews may be subjective and conflicting, requiring users to interpret each under their personal context. We introduce Mesh, which scaffolds users to iteratively build up a better understanding of both their criteria and options by evaluating evidence gathered across sources in the context of consumer decision-making. Mesh bridges the gap between decision support systems that typically have rigid structures and the fluid and dynamic process of exploratory search, changing the cost structure to provide increasing payoffs with greater user investment. Our lab and field deployment studies found evidence that Mesh significantly reduces the costs of gathering and evaluating evidence and scaffolds decision-making through personalized criteria enabling users to gain deeper insights from data.
