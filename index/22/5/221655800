This paper presents a novel online framework for safe crowd-robot interaction based on risk-sensitive stochastic optimal control, wherein the risk is modeled by the entropic risk measure. The sampling-based model predictive control relies on mode insertion gradient optimization for this risk measure as well as Trajectron++, a state-of-the-art generative model that produces multimodal probabilistic trajectory forecasts for multiple interacting agents. Our modular approach decouples the crowd-robot interaction into learning-based prediction and model-based control, which is advantageous compared to end-to-end policy learning methods in that it allows the robotâ€™s desired behavior to be specified at run time. In particular, we show that the robot exhibits diverse interaction behavior by varying the risk sensitivity parameter. A simulation study and a real-world experiment show that the proposed online framework can accomplish safe and efficient navigation while avoiding collisions with more than 50 humans in the scene.
