This paper presents the computing system design in our commercial autonomous vehicles, and provides a detailed performance, energy, and cost analyses. Drawing from our commercial deployment experience, this paper has two objectives. First, we highlight design constraints unique to autonomous vehicles that might change the way we approach existing architecture problems. Second, we identify new architecture and systems problems that are perhaps less studied before but are critical to autonomous vehicles.
