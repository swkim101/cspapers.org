We reformulate the Wasserstein Discriminant Analysis (WDA) as a ratio trace problem and present an eigensolver-based algorithm to compute the discriminative subspace of WDA. This new formulation, along with the proposed algorithm, can be served as an efﬁcient and more stable alternative to the original trace ratio formulation and its gradient-based algorithm. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm under the self-consistent ﬁeld framework, which is crucial but missing in the literature. As an application, we combine WDA with low-dimensional clustering techniques, such as K-means, to perform sub-space clustering. Numerical experiments on real datasets show promising results of the ratio trace formulation of WDA in both classiﬁcation and clustering tasks.
