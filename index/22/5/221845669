We propose an online incremental learning approach through teleoperation which allows an operator to partially modify a learned model, whenever it is necessary, during task execution. Compared to conventional incremental learning approaches, the proposed approach is applicable for teleoperation-based teaching and it needs only partial demonstration without any need to obstruct the task execution. Dynamic authority distribution and kinesthetic coupling between the operator and the agent helps the operator to correctly perceive the exact instance where modification needs to be asserted in the agentâ€™s behaviour online using partial trajectory. For this, we propose a variation of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for updating original model through mini batches of the modified partial trajectory. The proposed approach reduces human workload and latency for a rhythmic peg-in-hole teleoperation task where online partial modification is required during the task operation.
