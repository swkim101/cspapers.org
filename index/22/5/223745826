Across the world, government websites are expected to be reliable sources of information, regardless of their view count. Interactions with these websites often contain sensitive information, such as identity, medical, or legal data, whose integrity must be protected for citizens to remain safe. To better understand the government website ecosystem, we measure the adoption of https including the "long tail" of government websites around the world, which are typically not captured in the top-million datasets used for such studies. We identify and measure major categories and frequencies of https adoption errors, including misconfiguration of certificates via expiration, reuse of keys and serial numbers between unrelated government departments, use of insecure cryptographic protocols and keys, and untrustworthy root Certificate Authorities (CAs). Finally, we observe an overall lower https rate and a steeper dropoff with descending popularity among government sites compared to the commercial websites & provide recommendations to improve the usage of https in governments worldwide.
