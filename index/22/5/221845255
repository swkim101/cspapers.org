Traditional solar trackers often adopt motors to automatically adjust the attitude of the solar panels towards the sun for maximum power efficiency. In this paper, a novel design of solar tracker for the ocean environment is introduced. Utilizing the fluctuations due to the waves, electromagnetic brakes are utilized instead of motors to adjust the attitude of the solar panels. Compared with the traditional solar trackers, the proposed one is simpler in hardware while the harvesting efficiency is similar. The desired attitude is calculated out of the local location and time. Then based on the dynamic model of the system, the angular acceleration of the solar panels is estimated and a control algorithm is proposed to decide the release and lock states of the brakes. In such a manner, the adjustment of the attitude of the solar panels can be achieved by using two brakes only. Experiments are conducted to validate the acceleration estimator and the dynamic model. At last, the feasibility of the proposed solar tracker is tested on the real water surface. The results show that the system is able to adjust 40Â° in two dimensions within 28 seconds.
