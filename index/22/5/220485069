Human motion prediction is a task where we anticipate future motion based on past observation. Previous approaches rely on the access to large datasets of skeleton data, and thus are difficult to be generalized to novel motion dynamics with limited training data. In our work, we propose a novel approach named Motion Prediction Network (MoPredNet) for few-short human motion prediction. MoPredNet can be adapted to predicting new motion dynamics using limited data, and it elegantly captures long-term dependency in motion dynamics. Specifically, MoPredNet dynamically selects the most informative poses in the streaming motion data as masked poses. In addition, MoPredNet improves its encoding capability of motion dynamics by adaptively learning spatio-temporal structure from the observed poses and masked poses. We also propose to adapt MoPredNet to novel motion dynamics based on accumulated motion experiences and limited novel motion dynamics data. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance over state-of-the-art methods in motion prediction.
