The recent advances in mobile devices have allowed them to run spatial sensing algorithms such as Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Visual-SLAM). However, the resource requirements of Visual-SLAM prevents long-operation of such algorithm on mobile devices. We demonstrate Edge-SLAM [2], a system that adapts edge computing into Visual-SLAM through a split architecture. Edge-SLAM offloads the compute-intensive modules of Visual-SLAM to the edge without losing accuracy. Our experiments show that Edge-SLAM architecture reduces the use of computation and memory resources on mobile devices and keeps it constant. Thus, enabling long-operation of Visual-SLAM along with other applications services on mobile devices.
