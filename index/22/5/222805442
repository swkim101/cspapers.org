Aiming for the creation and development of taste media, a taste display was developed in this study that can reproduce tastes measured using taste sensors. By performing iontophoresis on five gels, which contain dissolved electrolytes that reproduce the five basic tastes, the quantity of ions that contact the tongue was controlled. A tasteless gel was added, so that the sum of the currents flowing in the six gels could be kept constant, ensuring a uniform amount of stimulation on the tongue. The measured tastes could be successfully reproduced through calibration, in which the indicated taste levels were matched with the taste-sensor measurements. Furthermore, video-editing software was adapted to edit taste information as well as recorded audio and video. In addition, effector and equalizer prototypes were built that can not only reproduce the recorded tastes in their original states but also adjust the tastes to match individual preferences.
