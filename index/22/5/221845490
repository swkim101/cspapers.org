This paper proposes a muscle-like SMA (Shape Memory Alloy) actuator with an active cooling system for efficient response. An SMA coil spring is embedded into a stretchable coolant vascular for soften structure of robots. In order to design a flexible, lightweight, and fast-response soft actuator with the SMA coil spring and coolant circulation system, a modeling based approach has been conducted. Analysis of coolant effects has been conducted in aspects of heating speed, cooling speed, and energy consumption based on both theoretical and empirical studies. From thermomechanical and heat transfer model between SMA and coolant, the actuation times in the case of heating and cooling phase have been estimated. From experimental results, Mineral oil is selected as the optimal coolant, and the maximum actuation frequency was measured as 0.5Hz for 40% contraction lifting 1kg.
