Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) of intelligent vehicles contributes to improving cruise control performance, reducing traffic congestion, saving energy and increasing traffic flow capacity. In this paper, we resolve the CACC problem from the viewpoint of synchronization control, our main idea is to introduce the spatial-temporal synchronization mechanism into vehicle platoon control to achieve the robust CACC and to further realize the non-stop intersection control. Firstly, by introducing the cross-coupling based space synchronization mechanism, a distributed control algorithm is presented to achieve the single-lane CACC in the presence of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, which enables autonomous vehicles to track the desired platoon trajectory while synchronizing their longitudinal velocities to keeping the expected inter-vehicle distance. Secondly, by designing the enter-time scheduling mechanism (temporal synchronization), a high-level intersection control strategy is proposed to command vehicles to form a virtual platoon to pass through the intersection without stopping. Thirdly, a Lyapunov-based time-domain stability analysis approach is presented. Compared with the traditional string stability based approach, the proposed approach guarantees the global asymptotical convergence of the proposed CACC system. Experiments in the small-scale simulated system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
