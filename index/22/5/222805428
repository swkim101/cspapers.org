Physical buttons provide clear haptic feedback when pressed and released, but their responses are unvarying. Physical buttons can be powered by force actuators to produce unlimited click sensations, but the cost is substantial. An alternative can be augmenting physical buttons with simple and inexpensive vibration actuators. When pushed, an augmented button generates a vibration overlayed on the button's original kinesthetic response, under the general framework of haptic augmented reality. We explore the design space of augmented buttons while changing vibration frequency, amplitude, duration, and envelope. We then visualize the perceptual structure of augmented buttons by estimating a perceptual space for 7 physical buttons and 40 augmented buttons. Their sensations are also assessed against adjectives, and results are mapped into the perceptual space to identify meaningful perceptual dimensions. Our results contribute to understanding the benefits and limitations of programmable vibration-augmented physical buttons with emphasis on their feels.
