Relatively little work in human and robot control has examined the control of underactuated objects with internal dynamics, such as transporting a cup of coffee, a task that presents little problems for humans. This study examined how humans move a ‘cup of coffee’ with a view to identify principles that may be useful for robot control. The specific focus was on how humans choose initial conditions to safely reach a steady state. We hypothesized that subjects choose initial conditions that minimized the transient duration to reach the steady state faster, as it presented more predictable dynamics. In the experiment, the cup of coffee was reduced to a 2-D cup with a sliding ball inside which was simulated in a virtual environment. Human subjects interacted with this virtual object via a robotic manipulandum that provided haptic feedback. Participants moved the cup between two targets without losing the ball; they were instructed to explore different initial conditions before initiating the continuous interaction. Results showed that subjects converged to a small set of initial conditions that decreased their transient durations and achieved a predictable steady state faster. Simulations with a simple feedforward controller and inverse dynamics calculations confirmed that these initial conditions indeed led to shorter transients and less complex interaction forces. These results may inform robot control of objects with internal dynamics where the effects of initial conditions need further investigation.
