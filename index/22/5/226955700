In the analysis of the heat transfer of the tongue, the convective heat transfer coefficient on the tongue surface has a significant influence on the accurate computation of the temperature field of the tongue. In order to determine the thermal boundary condition of tongue in closed mouth, a convection heat transfer model of the air in oral cavity under closed state was established. Using the measured temperature on the surface of tongue and oral cavity as the constant temperature boundary conditions, the heat exchange between the air and the tongue in closed oral cavity was simulated. The convective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of human tongue and the average temperature of the air in oral cavity were determined. Results showed that the average heat transfer coefficient ranges from 2 W/m2-K to 3W/m2-K and the average temperature ranges from 307.5 K to 308.5 K in the oral cavity. The results provided a reference for the analysis about the heat transfer of human tongue.
