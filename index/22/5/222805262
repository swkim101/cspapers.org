Correcting errors in entered text is a common task but usually difficult to perform on mobile devices due to tedious cursor navigation steps. In this paper, we present JustCorrect, an intelligent post hoc text correction technique for smartphones. To make a correction, the user simply types the correct text at the end of their current input, and JustCorrect will automatically detect the error and apply the correction in the form of an insertion or a substitution. In this way, manual navigation steps are bypassed, and the correction can be committed with a single tap. We solved two critical problems to support JustCorrect: (1) Correction Algorithm: we propose an algorithm that infers the user's correction intention from the last typed word. (2) Input Modalities: our study revealed that both tap and gesture were suitable input modalities for performing JustCorrect. Based on our findings, we integrated JustCorrect into a soft keyboard. Our user studies show that using JustCorrect reduces the text correction time by 12.8% over the stock Android keyboard and by 9.7% over the "Type, then Correct" text correction technique by Zhang et al. (2019). Overall, JustCorrect complements existing post hoc text correction techniques, making error correction more automatic and intelligent.
