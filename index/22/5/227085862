. While MEG and EEG source imaging methods have to tackle a severely ill-posed problem their success can be stated as their ability to constrain the solutions using appropriate priors. In this paper we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model facilitating spatio-temporal pat-terns through the use of both spatial and temporal basis functions. We demonstrate the eﬃcacy of the model on both artiﬁcial data and real EEG data.
