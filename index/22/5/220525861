We develop an improved bound for the chromatic number of graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ under the assumption that the number of edges spanning any neighbourhood is at most $(1-\sigma)\binom{\Delta}{2}$ for some fixed $0<\sigma<1$. The leading term in this bound is best possible as $\sigma\to0$. As two consequences, we advance the state of the art in two longstanding and well-studied graph colouring conjectures, the Erdős-Nesetřil conjecture and Reed's conjecture. We prove that the strong chromatic index is at most $1.772\Delta^2$ for any graph $G$ with sufficiently large maximum degree $\Delta$. We prove that the chromatic number is at most $\lceil 0.801(\Delta+1)+0.199\omega\rceil$ for any graph $G$ with clique number $\omega$ and sufficiently large maximum degree $\Delta$.
