There has been an increased interest in discovering heuristics for combinatorial problems on graphs through machine learning. While existing techniques have primarily focused on obtaining high-quality solutions, scalability to billion-sized graphs has not been adequately addressed. In addition, the impact of budget-constraint, which is necessary for many practical scenarios, remains to be studied. In this paper, we propose a framework called G COMB to bridge these gaps. G COMB trains a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using a novel probabilistic greedy mechanism to predict the quality of a node. To further facilitate the combinatorial nature of the problem, G COMB utilizes a Q -learning framework, which is made efﬁcient through importance sampling . We perform extensive experiments on real graphs to benchmark the efﬁciency and efﬁcacy of G COMB . Our results establish that G COMB is 100 times faster and marginally better in quality than state-of-the-art algorithms for learning combinatorial algorithms. Additionally, a case-study on the practical combinatorial problem of Inﬂuence Maximization (IM) shows G COMB is 150 times faster than the specialized IM algorithm IMM with similar quality.
