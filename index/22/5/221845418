This work presents a method to control omnidirectional micro aerial vehicles (OMAVs) for the tracking of 6-DoF trajectories in free space. A rigid body model based approach is applied in a receding horizon fashion to generate optimal wrench commands that can be constrained to meet limits given by the mechanical design and actuators of the platform. Allocation of optimal actuator commands is performed in a separate step. A disturbance observer estimates forces and torques that may arise from unmodeled dynamics or external disturbances and fuses them into the optimization to achieve offset-free tracking. Experiments on a fully overactuated MAV show the tracking performance and compare it against a classical PD-based controller.
