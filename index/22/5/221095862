Social connections play a vital role in improving the performance of recommendation systems (RS). However, incorporating social information into RS is challenging. Most existing models usually consider social influences in a given session, ignoring that both users? preferences and their friends? influences are evolving. Moreover, in real world, social relations are sparse. Modeling dynamic influences and alleviating data sparsity is of great importance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework named Dynamic RElation-Aware Model (DREAM) for social recommendation, which tries to model both users? dynamic interests and their friends? temporal influences. Specifically, we design temporal information encoding modules, because of which user representations are updated in each session. The updated user representations are transferred to relational-GAT modules, subsequently influence the operations on social networks. In each session, to solve social relation sparsity, we utilize glove-based method to complete social network with virtual friends. Then we employ relational-GAT module over completed social networks to update users? representations. In the extensive experiments on the public datasets, DREAM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.
