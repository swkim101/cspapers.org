This paper considers deep visual recognition on long-tailed data. To make our method general, we tackle two applied scenarios, i.e. , deep classification and deep metric learning. Under the long-tailed data distribution, the most classes (i.e., tail classes) only occupy relatively few samples and are prone to lack of within-class diversity. A radical solution is to augment the tail classes with higher diversity. To this end, we introduce a simple and reliable method named Memory-based Jitter (MBJ). We observe that during training, the deep model constantly changes its parameters after every iteration, yielding the phenomenon of weight jitters. Consequentially, given a same image as the input, two historical editions of the model generate two different features in the deeply-embedded space, resulting in feature jitters. Using a memory bank, we collect these (model or feature) jitters across multiple training iterations and get the so-called Memory-based Jitter. The accumulated jitters enhance the within-class diversity for the tail classes and consequentially improves long-tailed visual recognition. With slight modifications, MBJ is applicable for two fundamental visual recognition tasks, i.e., deep image classification and deep metric learning (on long-tailed data). Extensive experiments on five long-tailed classification benchmarks and two deep metric learning benchmarks demonstrate significant improvement. Moreover, the achieved performance are on par with the state of the art on both tasks.
