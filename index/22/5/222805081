Prosthetic limbs are an extension of the human body and should allow for the same function and control that a natural limb provides. Most prosthetics aim to allow an individual to return to a baseline quality of life, but few allow the individual to return to sports. Sport prosthetics can be difficult to produce due to the specificity of the designs and associated costs. Some prosthetics are becoming more accessible with the availability of 3D-printing. In this work, we create a prototype basketball prosthetic hand to enable a more natural shot. This prototype uses 3D printed springs for energy return and 3D printed electronics for integrated strain sensing that can be mapped to haptic feedback for the user. Combining these technologies will lead to a sport prosthetic limb whose technology advancements can be applied to future prosthetic designs.
