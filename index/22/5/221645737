In this paper, we revisit the problem of secure shuffling in a three-server setting with an honest majority. We begin with the recent work of Araki. et al. (CCS'21) and use precomputation to improve the communication and round complexity of the online phase of their shuffle protocol. Our simple yet effective shuffling method is not limited to three parties and can be used in a variety of situations. Furthermore, the design of our solution allows for fine tuning to achieve improved efficiency based on the underlying application's parameters. Our protocols are initially presented with semi-honest security and then extended to support malicious corruption.
