We prove communication complexity lower bounds for (possibly mixed) Nash equilibrium in potential games. In particular, we show that finding a Nash equilibrium requires $\text{poly}(N)$ communication in two-player $N\times N$ potential games, and $2^{\text{poly}(n)}$ communication in n-player two-action games. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results to demonstrate hardness in any model of (possibly mixed) Nash equilibrium in potential games.
