The chase is a famous algorithmic procedure in database

theory with numerous applications in ontology-mediated query answering. 

We consider static analysis of the chase termination 

problem, which asks, given set of TGDs, whether the chase 

terminates on all input databases. The problem was recently 

shown to be undecidable by Gogacz et al. for 

sets of rules containing only ternary predicates.



In this work, we show that undecidability occurs already

for sets of single-head TGD over binary vocabularies. 

This question is relevant since many real-world ontologies, e.g., 

those from the Horn fragment of the popular OWL, are of this shape.
