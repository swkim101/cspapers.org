Soft robots are capable of inherently safer interactions with their environment than rigid robots since they can mechanically deform in response to unanticipated stimuli. However, their complex mechanics can make planning and control diﬃcult, particularly with tasks such as locomotion. In this work, we present a mobile and untethered underwater crawling soft robot, PATRICK, paired with a testbed that demonstrates closed-loop locomotion planning. PATRICK is inspired by the brittle star, with five flexible legs actuated by a total of 20 shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires, providing a rich variety of possible motions via its large input space. We propose a motion planning infrastructure based on a simple set of PATRICK’s motion primitives, and provide experiments showing that the planner can command the robot to locomote to a goal state. These experiments contribute the first examples of closed-loop, state-space goal seeking of an underwater, untethered, soft crawling robot, and make progress towards full autonomy of soft mobile robotic systems.
