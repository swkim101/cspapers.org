Textiles encompass a wide variety and rich characteristics that ranges from soft to tough, foldable to rigid, cuttable to stiff, elastic to plastic. On the other hand, 3D printing thermoplastic (e.g., PLA) materials exhibit controlled deformation at a certain transition temperature. In this paper, we present a method of fabricating form-fitting composite textiles by printing PLA on different fabric substrates, designing different structures and transforming the fabric-PLA composite to form different textures.
