For many applications, robots will need to be incrementally trained to recognize the specific objects needed for an application. This paper presents a practical system for incrementally training a robot to recognize different object categories using only a small set of visual examples provided by a human. The paper uses a recently developed state-of-the-art method for few-shot incremental learning of objects. After learning the object classes incrementally, the robot performs a table cleaning task organizing objects into categories specified by the human. We also demonstrate the systemâ€™s ability to learn arrangements of objects and predict missing or incorrectly placed objects. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves nearly the same performance as a system trained with all examples at one time (batch training), which constitutes a theoretical upper bound.
