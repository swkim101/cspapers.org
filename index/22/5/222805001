We present a novel method to render color patterns using electrolysis applied onto open wet surfaces. By implementing electrodes within a wet object and electrifying them, electrolysis can occur and generate ions. Using color indicators reacting to such ions, we can create a color-forming display. By applying common techniques, such as a printed circuit board, arbitrary patterns can be displayed by computer control. By reversing the polarity of electrodes and varying the number of ions, it is possible to fade the existing pattern and display a contrasting color. The proposed method can be used to create a color-forming display using various objects more common in everyday life than those used in conventional substantial displays.
