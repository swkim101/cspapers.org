This paper proposes two efﬁcient algorithms for computing approximate second-order stationary points (SOSPs) of problems with generic smooth non-convex objective functions and generic linear constraints. While ﬁnding (approximate) SOSPs for the class of smooth non-convex linearly constrained problems is computationally intractable, we show that generic problem instances in this class can be solved efﬁciently. Speciﬁcally, for a generic problem instance, we show that certain strict complementarity (SC) condition holds for all Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions. Based on this condition, we design an algorithm named Successive Negative-curvature grAdient Projection (SNAP) , which performs either conventional gradient projection or some negative curvature based projection steps to ﬁnd SOSPs. SNAP is a second-order algorithm that requires e O (max { 1 /ϵ 2 G , 1 /ϵ 3 H } ) iterations to compute an ( ϵ G , ϵ H ) -SOSP, where e O hides the iteration complexity for eigenvalue-decomposition. Building on SNAP, we propose a ﬁrst-order algorithm, named SNAP + , that requires O (1 /ϵ 2 . 5 ) iterations to compute ( ϵ, √ ϵ ) -SOSP. The per-iteration computational complexities of our algorithms are polynomial in the number of constraints and problem dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that ﬁrst-order algorithms with polynomial per-iteration complexity and global sublinear
