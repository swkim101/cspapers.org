A conventional camera often suffers from over-or under-exposure when recording a real-world scene with a very high dynamic range (HDR). In contrast, a modulo camera with a Markov random Ô¨Åeld (MRF) based unwrapping algorithm can theoretically accomplish unbounded dynamic range but shows degenerate performances when there are modulus-intensity ambiguity, strong local contrast, and color misalignment. In this paper, we reformulate the modulo image unwrapping problem into a series of binary labeling problems and propose a modulo edge-aware model, named as UnModNet, to iteratively estimate the binary rollover masks of the modulo image for unwrapping. Experimental results show that our approach can generate 12 -bit HDR images from 8 -bit modulo images reliably, and runs much faster than the previous MRF-based algorithm thanks to the GPU acceleration.
