This supplementary material demonstrates the link between NeRV and Class-NeRV in its unsupervised case (Section 1), illustrates individual effect of each sub-term of ClassNeRV stress with an ablation study (Section 2) and presents the full confusion matrix of the 10-NN classiÔ¨Åer on the Isolet dataset (Section 3). It also provides the parameters of the DR techniques (Section 4), additional experiments to support our claim while accounting for randomness of stochastic methods (Section 5), quantitative comparison with unsupervised DR methods for the digits dataset (Section 6) and additional supervised indicators (Section 7)
