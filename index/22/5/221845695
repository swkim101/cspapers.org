This paper introduces an intrinsically safe parallel manipulator dedicated to fast pick-and-place operations, called R-Min. It has been designed to reduce the risk of injury during a collision with a human operator, while maintaining high speed and acceleration. The proposed architecture is based on a modification of the well-known planar five-bar mechanism, where additional passive joints are introduced to the distal links in order to create a planar seven-bar mechanism with two degrees of underactuation, so that it can passively reconfigure in case of collision. A supplementary passive leg, in which a tension spring is mounted, is added between the base and the end-effector in order to constrain the additional degrees of freedom.A prototype of this new collaborative parallel robot is designed and its equilibrium configurations under several types of loadings are analyzed. Its dynamics is also studied. We analyze the impact force occurring during a collision between our prototype and the head of an operator and compare these results with those that would have been obtained with a rigid five-bar mechanism. Simulation results of impact during a standard pick-and-place trajectory of duration 0.3 s show that a regular five-bar mechanism would injure a human, while our robot would avoid the trauma.
