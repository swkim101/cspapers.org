With one of the largest available collection of reusable packages, the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js is one of the most popular programming application. With recent work showing evidence that known vulnerabilities are prevalent in both open source and industrial software, we propose and implement a viable code-based vulnerability detection tool for Node.js applications. Our case study lists the challenges encountered while implementing our Node.js vulnerable code detector.
