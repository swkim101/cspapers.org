A deep visual tracker is typically based on either object detection or template matching while each of them is only suitable for a particular group of scenes. It is straightforward to consider fusing them together to pursue more reliable tracking. However, this is not wise as they follow different tracking principles. Unlike previous fusion-based methods, we propose a novel ensemble framework, named DTNet, with an online decision mechanism for visual tracking based on hierarchical reinforcement learning. The decision mechanism substantiates an intelligent switching strategy where the detection and the template trackers have to compete with each other to conduct tracking within different scenes that they are adept in. Besides, we present a novel detection tracker which avoids the common issue of incorrect proposal. Extensive results show that our DTNet achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance as well as a good balance between accuracy and efÔ¨Åciency.
