In recent years, blockchain technology has created a new cryptocurrency world and has attracted a lot of attention. It also is rampant with various scams. For example, phishing scams have grabbed a lot of money and has become an important threat to users' financial security in the blockchain ecosystem. To help deal with this issue, this paper proposes a systematic approach to detect phishing accounts based on blockchain transactions and take Ethereum as an example to verify its effectiveness. Specifically, we propose a graph-based cascade feature extraction method based on transaction records and a lightGBM-based Dual-sampling Ensemble algorithm to build the identification model. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm can effectively identify phishing scams.
