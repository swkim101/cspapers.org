Mangroves forests inhabiting the south coast of China are crucial habitats for the functioning
of the coastal zone. This role has not been carefully considered in China and compared to
their functional role worldwide. China’s mangroves currently occupy 20,303 ha. Average forest biomass
is equivalent to the global average, but the mean ratio of below-ground to above-ground biomass
is high (46%), reflecting the young age of most forests. Rates of annual litterfall, net primary
productivity, and root production are above the global average, indicating that China’s mangrove
forests are highly productive within their latitudinal band. High productivity may reflect high
rates of organic inputs, young forest ages, and high rates of precipitation. As China’s mangrove
forests have short canopies, these data imply that the rates of forest turnover are more rapid than in
most other mangroves. Mangrove organic carbon (Corg) stock averaged 190.96 Mg Corg ha-1, mostly
(58%) in soils, less than the global average, reflecting young forest age and frequent soil disturbance.
Total Corg stored in China’s mangroves is 3.9 Tg, only 0.03% of the global total, but the total
Corg sequestration rate is 139.4 Gg Corg a-1 while the average Corg sequestration rate is 6.87 Mg Corg
ha-1 a-1, which is greater than the global average. Corg losses via microbial mineralization are large
as total Corg export from mangroves accounts for 44% of the total Corg exported to the South China
Sea. Nutrients are efficiently retained suggesting their use and proper management as aquaculture
filters. Mangroves have close links to other coastal food webs.
