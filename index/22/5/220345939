Learning community structures in graphs that are randomly generated by stochastic block models (SBMs) has received much attention lately. In this paper, we focus on the problem of exactly re-covering the communities in a binary symmetric SBM, where a graph of n vertices is partitioned into two equal-sized communities and the vertices are connected with probability p = α log( n ) /n within communities and q = β log( n ) /n across communities for some α > β > 0 . We propose a two-stage iterative algorithm for solving this problem, which employs the power method with a random starting point in the ﬁrst-stage and turns to a generalized power method that can identify the communities in a ﬁnite number of iterations in the second-stage. It is shown that for any ﬁxed α and β such that √ α −√ β > √ 2 , which is known to be the information-theoretic limit for exact recovery, the proposed algorithm exactly identiﬁes the underlying communities in ˜ O ( n ) running time with probability tending to one as n → ∞ . As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst algorithm with nearly-linear running time that achieves exact recovery at the information-theoretic limit. We also present numerical results of the proposed algo-rithm to support and complement our theoretical development.
