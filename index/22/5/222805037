Programming-by-example (PBE) can be a powerful tool for reducing manual work in repetitive data transformation tasks. However, having few examples often leaves ambiguity and may cause undesirable data transformation by the system. This ambiguity can be resolved by allowing the user to directly edit the synthesized programs, but this is difficult for non-programmers. Here, we present a novel approach: data-centric interaction for data transformation, where users resolve the ambiguity in data transformation by examining and modifying the output rather than the program. The key idea is focusing on the given set of data the user wants to transform instead of pursuing the synthesized program's completeness. Our system provides interactive visualization that allows users to efficiently examine and fix the transformed outputs, which is much simpler than understanding and modifying the program itself. Our experiment shows that the number of candidates is much smaller than the number of synthesized programs, which implies the effectiveness of the proposed method.
