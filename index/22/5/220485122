Motivated by the capability of Generative Adversarial Network on exploring the latent semantic space and capturing semantic variations in the data distribution, adversarial learning has been adopted in network embedding to improve the robustness. However, this important ability is lost in existing adversarially regularized network embedding methods, because their embedding results are directly compared to the samples drawn from perturbation (Gaussian) distribution without any rectification from real data. To overcome this vital issue, a novel Joint Adversarial Network Embedding (JANE) framework is proposed to jointly distinguish the real and fake combinations of the embeddings, topology information and node features. JANE contains three pluggable components, Embedding module, Generator module and Discriminator module.

The overall objective function of JANE is defined in a min-max form, which can be optimized via alternating stochastic gradient. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed JANE on link prediction (3% gains in both AUC and AP) and node clustering (5% gain in F1 score).
