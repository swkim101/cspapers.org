This paper considers the optimal cooperative robotic manipulation problem in terms of energy resources. In particular, we consider rigid cooperative manipulation systems, i.e., with rigid grasping contacts, and study energy-optimal conditions in the sense of minimization of the arising internal forces, which are inter-agent forces that do not contribute to object motion. Firstly, we use recent results to derive a closed form expression for the internal forces. Secondly, by using a standard inverse dynamics control protocol, we provide novel conditions on the force distribution to the robotic agents for provable internal force minimization. Moreover, we derive novel results on the provable achievement of a desired non-zero inter-agent internal force vector. Extensive simulation results in a realistic environment verify the theoretical analysis.
