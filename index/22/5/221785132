Vibration measurement is a crucial task in industrial systems, where vibration characteristics reflect the health and indicate anomalies of the objects. Previous approaches either work in an intrusive manner or fail to capture the micrometer-level vibrations. In this work, we propose mmVib, a practical approach to measure micrometer-level vibrations with mmWave radar. By introducing a Multi-Signal Consolidation (MSC) model to describe the properties of the reflected signals, we exploit the inherent consistency among those signals to accurately recover the vibration characteristics. We implement a prototype of mmVib, and the experiments show that this design achieves 8.2% relative amplitude error and 0.5% relative frequency error in median. Typically, the median amplitude error is 3.4um for the 100um-amplitude vibration. Compared to two existing approaches, mmVib reduces the 80th-percentile amplitude error by 62.9% and 68.9% respectively.
