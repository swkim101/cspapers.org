The detection of anomalies is an essential data mining task for achieving security and reliability in computer systems. Logs are a common and major data source for anomaly detection methods in almost every computer system. Recent studies have focused predominantly on one-class deep learning methods on manually specified log representations. The main limitation is that these models are not able to learn log representations describing the semantic differences between normal and anomaly logs, leading to a poor generalization on unseen logs. We propose Logsy, a classification-based method to learn log representations that allow to distinguish between normal system log data and anomaly samples from auxiliary log datasets, easily accessible via the internet. The idea behind such an approach to anomaly detection is that the auxiliary dataset is sufficiently informative to enhance the representation of the normal data, yet diverse to regularize against overfitting and improve generalization. We perform several experiments on publicly available datasets to evaluate the performance and properties, where we show improvement of 0.25 in F1 compared to previous methods.
