We give a deterministic (global) min-cut algorithm for weighted undirected graphs that runs in time $O(m^{1+\epsilon})$ plus polylog ($n$) max-flow computations. Using the current best max-flow algorithms, this results in an overall running time of $\tilde{O}(m\cdot\min(\sqrt{m}, n^{2/3}))$ for weighted graphs, and $m^{4/3+o(1)}$ for unweighted (multi)-graphs. This is the first improvement in the running time of deterministic algorithms for the min-cut problem on general (weighted/multi) graphs since the early 1990s when a running time bound of $\tilde{O}(mn)$ was established for this problem.
