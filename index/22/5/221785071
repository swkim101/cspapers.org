Network function virtualization (NFV) plays a vital role in 5G mobile networks. Concatenating virtual network functions (VNFs) into service function chains (SFCs) provides flexible and diverse network support for intelligent applications. However, the mobile network connection is very unreliable. A reasonable SFC composition mechanism is essential for stable service providing. This paper proposes a high availability service function chain composition approach, TSFCC. TSFCC includes real-time road marking strategy, bi-composition mechanism, and VNF reallocation mechanism. Evaluation results prove that TSFCC can adapt to the mobile network environment and provide users with efficient and highly available SFC service.
