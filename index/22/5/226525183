â€”We present an approach based on Memory-Augmented Neural Networks for the task of detecting clauses in online Terms of Service that are potentially unfair for the consumer, with the additional goal to explain the legal rationale behind unfairness. The proposed approach goes in the direction of developing neural models for the legal domain, whose output is interpretable and explainable by humans.
