Force feedback is commonly used to enhance realism in virtual reality (VR). However, current works mainly focus on providing different force types or patterns, but do not investigate how a proper point of application of force (PAF), which means where the resultant force is applied to, affects users' experience. For example, users perceive resistive force without torque when pulling a virtual bow, but with torque when pulling a virtual slingshot. Therefore, we propose a set of handheld controllers, ElastiLinks, to provide force feedback between controllers with dynamic PAFs.A rotatable track on each controller provides a dynamic PAF, and two common types of force feedback, resistive force and impact, are produced by two links, respectively. We performed a force perception study to ascertain users' resistive and impact force level distinguishability between controllers. Based on the results, we conducted another perception study to understand users' distinguishability of PAF offset and rotation differences. Finally, we performed a VR experience study to prove that force feedback with dynamic PAFs enhances VR experience.
