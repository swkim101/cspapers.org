Needle-based procedures, such as biopsy and percutaneous tumor ablation, highly depend on the accuracy of needle placement. The accuracy is significantly affected by the needle-tissue interaction no matter what needles (straight or steerable) are used. Due to the unknown tissue mechanics, it is challenging to achieve high accuracy in practice. This paper hence proposes a needle design with an articulated tip for increased steerability and improved needle path consistency. Due to the passive needle tip articulation, tissue mechanics always plays a dominant role such that the needle creates similar paths with approximately piece-wise constant curvature in different tissues. Kinematics model for the proposed needle is presented. The algorithms of path planning and needle tip pose estimation under external imaging modality are developed. Experimental verifications were conducted to demonstrate the needleâ€™s steerability as well as the target-reaching capability with obstacles avoidance.
