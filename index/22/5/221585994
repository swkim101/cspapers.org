Cuts in graphs are a fundamental object of study, and play a central role in the study of graph algorithms. The problem of sparsifying a graph while approximately preserving its cut structure has been extensively studied and has many applications. In a seminal work, Benczúr and Karger (1996) showed that given any <tex>$n$</tex>-vertex undirected weighted graph <tex>$G$</tex> and a parameter <tex>$\varepsilon\in(0,1)$</tex>, there is a near-linear time algorithm that outputs a weighted subgraph <tex>$G^{\prime}$</tex> of <tex>$G$</tex> of size <tex>$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^{2})$</tex> such that the weight of every cut in <tex>$G$</tex> is preserved to within a (<tex>$1\pm\varepsilon$</tex>)-factor in <tex>$G^{\prime}$</tex>. The graph <tex>$G^{\prime}$</tex> is referred to as a (<tex>$1\pm\varepsilon$</tex>)-approximate cut sparsifier of <tex>$G$</tex>. A natural question is if such cut-preserving sparsifiers also exist for hypergraphs. Kogan and Krauthgamer (2015) initiated a study of this question and showed that given any weighted hypergraph <tex>$H$</tex> where the cardinality of each hyperedge is bounded by <tex>$r$</tex>, there is a polynomial-time algorithm to find a (<tex>$1\pm\varepsilon$</tex>)-approximate cut sparsifier of <tex>$H$</tex> of size <tex>$\tilde{O}(\frac{nr}{\varepsilon^{2}})$</tex>. Since <tex>$r$</tex> can be as large as <tex>$n$</tex>, in general, this gives a hypergraph cut sparsifier of size <tex>$\tilde{O}(n^{2}/\varepsilon^{2})$</tex>, which is a factor <tex>$n$</tex> larger than the Benczúr-Karger bound for graphs. It has been an open question whether or not Benczúr-Karger bound is achievable on hypergraphs. In this work, we resolve this question in the affirmative by giving a new polynomial-time algorithm for creating hypergraph sparsifiers of size <tex>$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^{2})$</tex>.
