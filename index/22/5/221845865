This paper proposes a model identification method and evaluation of a force model for multirotor UAVs. The model incorporates propellers’ aerodynamics derived from momentum and blade element theories, as well as aerodynamics of the UAV’s structure and actuation dynamics. A two-steps identification approach of the model parameters is proposed. The model is identified and evaluated from outdoor experiments with flight speeds exceeding 10m/s.
