Many existing identification approaches require active user input, specialized sensing hardware, or personally identifiable information such as fingerprints or face scans. In this paper, we propose EchoLock, a low-effort identification scheme that validates the user by sensing hand geometry via commodity microphones and speakers. EchoLock can serve as a complementary verification method for high-end devices or as a stand-alone user identification scheme for lower-end devices without using privacy-sensitive features. In addition to security applications, our system can also personalize user interactions with smart devices, such as automatically adapting settings or preferences when different people are holding smart remotes. To this end, we study the impact of hands on structure borne sound propagation in mobile devices and develop a user identification scheme that can measure, quantify, and exploit distinct sound reflections in order to differentiate distinct identities. Particularly, we propose a non-intrusive hand sensing technique to derive unique acoustic features in both time and frequency domain, which can effectively capture the physiological and behavioral traits of a user's hand (e.g., hand contours, finger sizes, holding strengths, and holding styles). Furthermore, learning-based algorithms are developed to robustly identify the user under various environments and conditions. We conduct extensive experiments with 20 participants, gathering 80,000 hand geometry samples using different hardware setups across 160 key use case scenarios. Our results show that EchoLock is capable of identifying users with over 94% accuracy, without requiring any active user input.
