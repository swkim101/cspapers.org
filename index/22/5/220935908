Common experience suggests that agents who know each other well are better able to work together. In this work, we address the problem of calibrating intention and capabilities in human-robot collaboration. In particular, we focus on scenarios where the robot is attempting to assist a human who is unable to directly communicate her intent. Moreover, both agents may have differing capabilities that are unknown to one another. We adopt a decision-theoretic approach and propose the TICC-POMDP for modeling this setting, with an associated online solver. Experiments show our approach leads to better team performance both in simulation and in a real-world study with human subjects.
