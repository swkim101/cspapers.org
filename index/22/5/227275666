The idea behind data augmentation techniques is based on the fact that slight changes in the percept do not change the brain cognition. In classiﬁcation, neural networks use this fact by applying transformations to the inputs to learn to predict the same label. However, in deep subspace clustering (DSC), the ground-truth labels are not available, and as a result, one cannot easily use data augmentation techniques. We propose a technique to exploit the beneﬁts of data augmentation in DSC algorithms. We learn representations that have consistent subspaces for slightly transformed inputs. In particular, we introduce a temporal ensembling component to the objective function of DSC algorithms to enable the DSC networks to maintain consistent subspaces for random transformations in the input data. In addition, we provide a simple yet effective unsupervised procedure to ﬁnd efﬁcient data augmentation policies. An augmentation policy is deﬁned as an image processing transformation with a certain magnitude and probability of being applied to each image in each epoch. We search through the policies in a search space of the most common augmentation policies to ﬁnd the best policy such that the DSC network yields the highest mean Silhouette coefﬁcient in its clustering results on a target dataset. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four standard subspace clustering datasets. The source code is available at: https://github.com/mahdiabavisani/DSCwithDA.git .
