Given recent advances in deep music source separation, we propose a feature representation method that combines source separation with a state-of-the-art representation learning technique that is suitably repurposed for computer audition (i.e. machine listening). We train a depthwise separable convolutional neural network on a challenging electronic dance music (EDM) data set and compare its performance to convolutional neural networks operating on both source separated and standard spectrograms. It is shown that source separation improves classification performance in a limited-data setting compared to the standard single spectrogram approach.
