Electronic health records (EHR) are often generated and collected across a large number of patients featuring distinctive medical conditions and clinical progress over a long period of time, which results in unaligned records along the time dimension. EHR is also prone to missing and erroneous data due to various practical reasons. Recently, PARAFAC2 has been re-popularized for successfully extracting meaningful medical concepts (phenotypes) from such temporal EHR by irregular tensor factorization. Despite recent advances, existing PARAFAC2 methods are unable to robustly handle erroneousness and missing data which are prevalent in clinical practice. We propose REPAIR, a Robust tEmporal PARAFAC2 method for IRregular tensor factorization and completion method, to complete an irregular tensor and extract phenotypes in the presence of missing and erroneous values. To achieve this, REPAIR designs a new effective low-rank regularization function for PARAFAC2 to handle missing and erroneous entries, which has not been explored for irregular tensors before. In addition, the optimization of REPAIR allows it to enjoy the same computational scalability and incorporate a variety of constraints as the state-of-the-art PARAFAC2 method for efficient and meaningful phenotype extraction. We evaluate REPAIR on two real temporal EHR datasets to verify its robustness in tensor factorization against various missing and outlier conditions. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies to demonstrate that REPAIR is able to extract meaningful and useful phenotypes from such corrupted temporal EHR.
