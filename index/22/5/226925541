Aiming at the shortcomings of the traditional gap sensor, the measurement accuracy is greatly affected by environmental factors such as temperature, and a levitation gap measurement method based on image processing is designed. The high-speed industrial camera monitors the levitation gap in real time and transmits the image to the PC. The image is processed by the PC to obtain the value of the levitation gap, which can complete the function of the traditional gap sensor. The experimental results show that the method has high precision and fast speed, which can meet the stability control requirements of the levitation ball system.
