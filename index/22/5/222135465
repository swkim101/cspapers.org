Participants of the Bitcoin system form mining pools, which have become the leading institutions of the Bitcoin mining economy, to smooth their reward of mining. Many attacks towards mining pools have been proposed. Block Withholding attack is an attacker splitting some of the power to mine in a pool, submitting shares while withholding blocks, which is one of the most famous and original attacks. Few pieces of research pay attention to the case that managers work rationally to gain extra rewards themselves at the same time of countering withholding attack. However, some different reward functions have been proposed to avoid rational miners' withholding. In this paper, we offer a model that a rational manager gain extra rewards and incentivize miners not to withhold blocks by applying a dynamic mining strategy. We conduct quantitive analysis and simulations to verify the availability and effectiveness of our attacks. We show the attack benefits the miners in the pool in some circumstances, and further discuss improvement for our attack.
