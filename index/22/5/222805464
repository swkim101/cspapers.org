Human communication mediated by computers and Augmented Reality devices will enable us to dynamically express, share and explore new ideas with each other via live simulations as easily as we talk about the weather. This collaboration provides a "shared truth" - what you see is exactly what I see, I see you perform an action as you do it, and we both see exactly the same dynamic transformation of this shared information space. When you express an idea, the computer, a full participant in this conversation, instantly makes it real for both of us enabling us to critique and negotiate the meaning of it. This shared virtual world will be as live, dynamic, pervasive, and visceral as the physical.
