People with limited digital literacy struggle to keep up with our increasing dependence on websites for everyday tasks like paying bills or booking flight tickets online. They often get in-person assistance from their friends and family but such help may not always be possible. Remote assistance from peers such as phone calls, or written instructions via email or text messages can be useful. However, remote methods of assistance may lead to communication issues between the helper and the help-seeker, due to a lack of shared visual context; a helper cannot see the help-seeker's screen. Moreover, help-seekers are often unacquainted with the terminology associated with web navigation. In order to bridge the gap between in-person support and remote help, we develop Remo, a web browser extension, which will allow helpers to create interactive tutorials by demonstration. These tutorials will be embedded within a web page and will make use of visual cues to direct users to specific parts of the page. Remo aims to provide opportunities for people with limited digital literacy to complete online tasks by following the step-by-step and task specific tutorials generated by their peers. Using Remo, we anticipate that the target population will be able to get personalized assistance, similar to in-person support, and eventually learn how to complete broader online tasks independently.
