This paper presents Droplet , a decentralized data access con-trol service. Droplet enables data owners to securely and selectively share their encrypted data while guaranteeing data conﬁdentiality in the presence of unauthorized parties and compromised data servers. Droplet’s contribution lies in coupling two key ideas: (i) a cryptographically-enforced access control construction for encrypted data streams which enables users to deﬁne ﬁne-grained stream-speciﬁc access policies, and (ii) a decentralized authorization service that serves user-deﬁned access policies. In this paper, we present Droplet’s design, the reference implementation of Droplet, and the experimental results of three case-study applications deployed with Droplet: Fitbit activity tracker, Ava health tracker, and ECOviz smart meter dashboard, demonstrating Droplet’s applicability for secure sharing of IoT streams.
