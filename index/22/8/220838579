Accelerating SQL queries on stream processing by utilizing heterogeneous coprocessors, such as GPUs, has shown to be an effective approach. Most works show that heterogeneous coprocessors bring signiﬁcant performance improvement because of their high parallelism and computation capacity. However, the discrete memory architectures with relatively low PCI-e bandwidth and high latency have dragged down the beneﬁts of heterogeneous coprocessors. Recently, hardware vendors propose CPU-GPU integrated architectures that integrate CPU and GPU on the same chip. This integration provides new opportunities for ﬁne-grained cooperation be-tween CPU and GPU for optimizing SQL queries on stream processing. In this paper, we propose a data stream system, called FineStream, for efﬁcient window-based stream processing on integrated architectures. Particularly, FineStream performs ﬁne-grained workload scheduling between CPU and GPU to take advantage of both architectures, and it also provides efﬁcient mechanism for handling dynamic stream queries. Our experimental results show that 1) on integrated architectures, FineStream achieves an average 52% throughput improvement and 36% lower latency over the state-of-the-art stream processing engine; 2) compared to the stream processing engine on the discrete architecture, FineStream on the integrated
