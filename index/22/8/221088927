Linear constrained convex programming has many practical applications, including support vector machine and machine learning portfolio problems. We propose the randomized primal-dual coordinate (RPDC) method, a randomized coordinate extension of the first-order primal-dual method by Cohen and Zhu, 1984 and Zhao and Zhu, 2019, to solve linear constrained convex programming. We randomly choose a block of variables based on a uniform distribution, linearize, and apply a Bregman-like function (core function) to the selected block to obtain simple parallel primal-dual decomposition. We then establish almost surely convergence and expected O(1/t) convergence rate, and expected linear convergence under global strong metric subregularity. Finally, we discuss implementation details for the randomized primal-dual coordinate approach and present numerical experiments on support vector machine and machine learning portfolio problems to verify the linear convergence.
