In this paper, we study the state-constrained consensus problem and introduce a new family of distributed algorithms based on subspace projection methods which are simple to implement and which preserve, under some suitable conditions, the consensus value of the original discrete-time agreement protocol. The proposed theory is supported by extensive numerical experiments for the constrained 2D rendezvous of single-integrator robots.
