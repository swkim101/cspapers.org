The 15th ACM SIGSAC Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS 2020) is co-located with the 27th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS 2020). Over its now more than ten-year history, PLAS has provided a unique forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas about programming language and program analysis techniques with the goal of improving the security of software systems. Strongly encouraged are proposals of new, speculative ideas, evaluations of new or known techniques in practical settings, and discussions of emerging threats and important problems.
