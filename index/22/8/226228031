The speaker will utilize his experience from inside one of the world's largest social networks during the 2016 and 2018 elections, and running an election integrity war room in 2020 to discuss the ways that technology fails the people we try so hard to serve. We will discuss the realistic assumptions we can make about threats, and the expectations we should have of users, and try to chart a path forward for how cutting-edge security research might better inform the engineers and product designers who end up putting computing technologies in the hands of billions.
