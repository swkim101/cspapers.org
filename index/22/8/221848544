This paper presents a study on a compliant cable-driven exoskeleton for hip assistance in lifting tasks that is aimed at preventing low-back pain and injuries in the vocational setting. In the proposed concept, we used twisted string actuator (TSA) to design a light-weight and powerful exoskeleton that benefits from inherent TSA advantages. We have noted that nonlinear nature of twisted stringsâ€™ transmission ratio (decreasing with twisting) closely matched typical torque-speed requirements for hip assistance during lifting tasks and tried to use this fact in the exoskeleton design and motor selection. Hip-joint torque and speed required to lift a 10-kg load from stoop to stand were calculated, which gave us a baseline that we used to design and manufacture a practical exoskeleton prototype. Preliminary experimental trials demonstrated that the proposed device was capable of generating required torque and speed at the hip joint while weighing under 6 kg, including battery.
