We present Gaptron, a randomized first-order algorithm for online multiclass classification. In the full information setting we show expected mistake bounds with respect to the logistic loss, hinge loss, and the smooth hinge loss with constant regret, where the expectation is with respect to the learner's randomness. In the bandit classification setting we show that Gaptron is the first linear time algorithm with $O(K\sqrt{T})$ expected regret, where $K$ is the number of classes. Additionally, the expected mistake bound of Gaptron does not depend on the dimension of the feature vector, contrary to previous algorithms with $O(K\sqrt{T})$ regret in the bandit classification setting. We present a new proof technique that exploits the gap between the zero-one loss and surrogate losses rather than exploiting properties such as exp-concavity or mixability, which are traditionally used to prove logarithmic or constant regret bounds.
