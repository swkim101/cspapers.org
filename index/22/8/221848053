This paper identifies conditions for designing the appropriate spatial admittance to achieve reliable force-guided assembly of polyhedral parts for cases in which a single frictional contact occurs between the two parts. This work is an extension of previous work in which frictionless contact was considered. This paper presents a way to characterize friction without solving a set of complicated non-linear equations. We show that, by modifying the error reduction function and evaluating the function bounds associated with friction, the procedures developed for frictionless contact apply to the frictional cases. Thus, for bounded misalignments, if an admittance satisfies the misalignment-reducing conditions at a finite number of contact configurations, then the admittance will also satisfy the conditions at all intermediate configurations for any value of friction less than the specified upper bound.
