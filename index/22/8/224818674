The elderly population is steadily increasing in most countries due to a decline in birth and mortality rate. The population of senior citizens living independently has also become significant. This has led to an active research focus in geriatric wellness. One of the common effects of ageing is Frailty which is seen in the Elderly population. This research is focused on detecting activities specific to frailty in typical natural home environment of the geriatric population living alone. To this end, we evaluated only Passive Infra-Red (PIR)-based motion and magnetic door contact sensors for detection of frailty through a unique combination of custom and statistical techniques to achieve reasonable accuracy. This is further validated using ground truth obtained through surveys to understand the level of frailty of selected elderly people. .
