This paper follows the line of works that design concretely efficient transparent sublinear zero-knowledge Interactive Oracle Proofs (IOP). Arguments obtained via this paradigm have the advantages of not relying on public-key cryptography, not requiring a trusted setup, and resistance to known quantum attacks. In the realm of transparent systems, Ligero and Aurora stand out with incomparable advantages where the former has a fast prover algorithm somewhat succinct proofs and the latter has somewhat fast prover and succinct proofs. In this work, we introduce Ligero++ that combines the best features of both approaches to achieve the best of both worlds. We implement our protocol and benchmark the results.
