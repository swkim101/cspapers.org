Solar flares are caused by magnetic eruptions in active
regions (ARs) on the surface of the sun. These events can have
significant impacts on human activity, many of which can be mitigated
with enough advance warning from good forecasts. To date, machine
learning-based flare-prediction methods have employed physics-based
attributes of the AR images as features; more recently, there has been
some work that uses features deduced automatically by deep learning
methods (such as convolutional neural networks). We describe a suite
of novel shape-based features extracted from magnetogram images of the
Sun using the tools of computational topology and computational
geometry. We evaluate these features in the context of a multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) neural network and compare their performance against
the traditional physics-based attributes. We show that these abstract
shape-based features outperform the features chosen by the human
experts, and that a combination of the two feature sets improves the
forecasting capability even further.
