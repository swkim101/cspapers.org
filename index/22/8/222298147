This paper proposes a cost-effective, high-impedance-state (HIS)-insensitive, triple-node-upset (TNU)-tolerant and single-event-transient (SET)-filterable latch, namely HITTSFL, to ensure high reliability with low-cost. The latch mainly comprises an output-level SET-filterable Schmitt-trigger and three inverters that make the values stored in three parallel single-node-upset (SNU)-recoverable dual-interlocked-storage-cells (DICEs) converge at a common node to tolerate any possible TNU. The latch does not use C-elements to be insensitive to the HIS. Simulation results demonstrate the TNU-tolerability and SET-filterability of the proposed HITTSFL latch. Moreover, due to the use of clock-gating technologies and fewer transistors, the proposed latch can reduce delay, power, and area by 76.65%, 6.16%, and 28.55%, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art TNU hardened latch (TNUHL) that cannot filter SETs.
