Previous top-performing approaches for point cloud in-stance segmentation involve a bottom-up strategy, which often includes inefficient operations or complex pipelines, such as grouping over-segmented components, introducing additional steps for refining, or designing complicated loss functions. The inevitable variation in the instance scales can lead bottom-up methods to become particularly sensitive to hyper-parameter values. To this end, we propose in-stead a dynamic, proposal-free, data-driven approach that generates the appropriate convolution kernels to apply in response to the nature of the instances. To make the kernels discriminative, we explore a large context by gathering homogeneous points that share identical semantic categories and have close votes for the geometric centroids. Instances are then decoded by several simple convolutional layers. Due to the limited receptive field introduced by the sparse convolution, a small light-weight transformer is also devised to capture the long-range dependencies and high-level interactions among point samples. The proposed method achieves promising results on both ScanetNetV2 and S3DIS, and this performance is robust to the particular hyper-parameter values chosen. It also improves inference speed by more than 25% over the current state-of-the-art. Code is available at: https://git.io/DyCo3D
