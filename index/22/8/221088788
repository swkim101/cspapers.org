Instead of using one kernel, it learns the optimal kernel from a pre-selected dictionary of kernels. The selection of the dictionary has crucial impact on both the performance and complexity of MKL. Specifcally, inclusion of a large number of irrelevant kernels may impair the accuracy, and increase the complexity of MKL algorithms. To enhance the accuracy, and alleviate the computational burden, the present paper develops a novel scheme which actively chooses relevant kernels. The proposed framework models the pruned kernel combination as feedback collected from a graph, that is refned ‘on the fy.’ Leveraging the random feature approximation, we propose an online scalable multi-kernel learning approach with graph feedback, and prove that the proposed algorithm enjoys sublinear regret. Numerical tests on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel approach.
