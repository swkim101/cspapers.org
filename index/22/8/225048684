Recently, automatic lawnmowers have been widely used in families and public areas and the usage is also increasing rapidly. In order to design an efficient automatic lawnmower, this paper proposes an efficient complete coverage path planning algorithm. In this paper, we propose a coverage path planning algorithm for RTK-based autonomous lawnmower with the ability to detect obstacles and to plan a collision-free path simultaneously by using various sensors. The key technology is the complete coverage path planner which plans an efficient path with low duplication rate. The duplication rate of planned paths is about 150%.
