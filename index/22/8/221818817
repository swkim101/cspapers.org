We leverage what are typically considered the worst qualities of deep learning algorithms - high computational cost, requirement for large data, no explainability, high dependence on hyper-parameter choice, overfitting, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations - in order to create a method for the secure and efficient training of remotely deployed neural networks over unsecure channels.
