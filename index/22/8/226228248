Online gaming, with a reported 152 billion US dollar market, is immensely popular today. One of the critical issues in multiplayer online games is cheating, in which a player uses an illegal methodology to create an advantage beyond honest game play. For example, wallhacks, the main focus of this work, animate enemy objects on a cheating player's screen, despite being actually hidden behind walls (or other occluding objects). Since such cheats discourage honest players and cause game companies to lose revenue, gaming companies deploy mitigation solutions alongside game applications on the player's machine. However, their solutions are fundamentally flawed since they are deployed on a machine where the attacker has absolute control.
