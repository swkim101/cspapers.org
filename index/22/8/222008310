—The controller area network (CAN) is widely adopted in modern automobiles to enable communications among in-vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). Lacking mainstream network security capabilities due to resource constraints, the CAN is susceptible to the ECU masquerade attack in which a compromised (attacker) ECU impersonates an uncompromised (victim) ECU and spoofs the latter’s CAN messages. A cost-effective state-of-the-art defense against such attacks is the CAN bus voltage-based intrusion detection system (VIDS), which identiﬁes the source of each message using its voltage ﬁngerprint on the bus. Since the voltage ﬁngerprint emanates from an ECU’s hardware characteristics, an attacker ECU by itself cannot controllably modify it. As such, VIDS has been proved effective in detecting masquerade attacks that each involve a single attacker. In this paper, we discover a novel voltage corruption tactic that leverages the capabilities of two compromised ECUs (i.e., an attacker ECU working in tandem with an accomplice ECU) to corrupt the bus voltages recorded by the VIDS. By exploiting this tactic along with the fundamental deﬁciencies of the CAN protocol, we propose a novel masquerade attack called D UET , which evades all existing VIDS irrespective of the features and classiﬁcation algorithms employed in them. D UET follows a two-stage attack strategy to ﬁrst manipulate a victim ECU’s voltage ﬁngerprint during VIDS retraining mode, and then impersonate the manipulated ﬁngerprint during VIDS operation mode. Our evaluation of D UET on real CAN buses (including three in two real cars) demonstrates an impersonation success rate of at least 90% in evading two state-of-the-art VIDS
