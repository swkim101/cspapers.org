Distributed safety-critical systems require both time-predictable task execution and communication. On the processor, the execution of the tasks is dictated by a scheduling policy, while on the network, different industrial communication protocols can be deployed to guarantee bounded message latency. In this paper, we investigate the synchronization of the task execution with the underlying communication schedule, and we propose an open-source software framework. We implement a cyclic executive task scheduling policy on a time-predictable platform and synchronize the task execution with the underlying TTEth-ernet communication schedule. We evaluate our framework by developing a simple one-sensor, one-actuator industrial control example, distributed over three nodes. The presented real-time system can exchange messages with minimal jitter, and the distributed tasks synchronize to a precision of ≈ 1.6µs.
