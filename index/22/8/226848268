In this paper we propose an approach for an integrated and iterative performance tuning of an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) digital twin. Using the systematic series of steps in the proposed approach, the digital twin- linked to its real-world counterpart, can now be used in different ways to predict, refine, fine tune and optimize the operation of the asset (e.g. Cyber Physical System (CPS) in the IIoT plant) during various stages of its software development life cycle.
