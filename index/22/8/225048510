This paper proposes to implement boolean operations on a query of Context search engine (CSE), and shows experimental results to present its advantages on information retrieval tasks. Although web search engines have shown lots of advantages for us to search on the internet, its basic usage is remaining in only entering a few keywords. Its simplicity enables many people to use it easily, however, combining keywords needs well-experienced ability, therefore, it cannot be applied to another usage such as searching trends. CSE has been established to deal with temporal data, especially, trends among contents. However, it does not support combined queries like that of using boolean operations. This paper proposes to introduce boolean operations into CSE, and shows its advantages through experiments conducted with help of participants of students.
