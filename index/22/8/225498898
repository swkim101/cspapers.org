The aging process in our population can cause changes in people’s sleeping patterns, more specifically in the elderly, by impairing their cognitive abilities, quality of life, and autonomy. Advances in Ubiquitous Computing and Internet of Things have contributed to the monitoring of such situations. In particular, the use of sensors to evaluate the environment and aspects related to the health and well-being of individuals, as well as providing event alerts. The main objective of this experiment is to propose a monitoring system based on both the responses of multiple sensors (brightness, microphone, accelerometer, and gyroscope) at runtime to classify the environment for elderly people’s sleep quality. The results show that using embedded devices, and capturing environmental aspects through sensors, can develop solutions that offer more safety and comfort to the individuals’ sleep quality environment.
