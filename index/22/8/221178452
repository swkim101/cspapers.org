Once compromised, server ﬁrmware can surreptitiously and permanently take over a machine and any stack running thereon, with no hope for recovery, short of hardware-level intervention. To make things worse, modern ﬁrmware contains millions of lines of unnecessary code and hundreds of unnecessary modules as a result of a long ﬁrmware supply chain designed to optimize time-to-market and cost, but not security. As a result, off-the-shelf motherboards contain large, unnecessarily complex, closed-source vulnerability surfaces that can completely and irreversibly compromise systems. In this work, we address this problem by dramatically and automatically reducing the vulnerability surface. DECAF is an extensible platform for automatically pruning a wide class of commercial UEFI ﬁrmware. DECAF intelligently runs dynamic iterative surgery on UEFI ﬁrmware to remove a maximal amount of code with no regressive effects on the functionality and performance of higher layers in the stack (OS, applications). DECAF has successfully pruned over 70% of unnecessary, redundant, reachable ﬁrmware in leading server-grade moth-erboards with no effect on the upper layers, and increased resulting system performance and boot times.
