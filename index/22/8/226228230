The problem of fair exchange consists of interchanging goods between two parties that do not trust each other. Despite known impossibility results, recent works leverage the block-chain and zero-knowledge proofs to implement zero-knowledge contingent payment (zkCP) systems that make fair exchange of digital goods possible. Implementing these systems in a secure and efficient way is a big challenge, as evidenced by several unsuccessful attempts from the literature. Campanelli et al. (ACM CCS 2017) discovered a vulnerability on an existing zkCP proposal based on SNARKs (succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) and suggested several repairs. Fuchsbauer (ACM CCS 2019) found a flaw in the mentioned countermeasures. In particular, he showed that witness-indistinguishability (WI) is not sufficient for the zkCP schemes proposed by Campanelli et al. to be secure. In this work, we observe that a slightly stronger notion of WI, that we coin trapdoor subversion WI (tS-WI), rules out Fuchsbauer's attack. We formally define security properties for CP systems and show that, under tS-WI, Campanelli et al.'s proposal indeed satisfies these properties. Additionally, we explore alternative approaches to implement ZK (other than SNARKs) and develop a prototype, using it to demonstrate their potential. Our new ideas result in a protocol to sell ECDSA signatures with contingent payment that can be executed in less than $150$ milliseconds over a LAN network.
