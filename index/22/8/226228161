Machine learning has become increasingly prominent and is widely used in various applications in practice. Despite its great success, the integrity of machine learning predictions and accuracy is a rising concern. The reproducibility of machine learning models that are claimed to achieve high accuracy remains challenging, and the correctness and consistency of machine learning predictions in real products lack any security guarantees. In this paper, we initiate the study of zero knowledge machine learning and propose protocols for zero knowledge decision tree predictions and accuracy tests. The protocols allow the owner of a decision tree model to convince others that the model computes a prediction on a data sample, or achieves a certain accuracy on a public dataset, without leaking any information about the model itself. We develop approaches to efficiently turn decision tree predictions and accuracy into statements of zero knowledge proofs. We implement our protocols and demonstrate their efficiency in practice. For a decision tree model with 23 levels and 1,029 nodes, it only takes 250 seconds to generate a zero knowledge proof proving that the model achieves high accuracy on a dataset of 5,000 samples and 54 attributes, and the proof size is around 287 kilobytes.
