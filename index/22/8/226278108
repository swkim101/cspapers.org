Motion prediction is a critical part of self-driving technology, responsible for inferring future behavior of traffic actors in autonomous vehicleâ€™s surroundings. In order to ensure safe and efficient operations, prediction models need to output accurate trajectories that obey the map constraints. In this paper, we address this task and propose a novel ellipse loss that allows the models to better reason about scene compliance and predict more realistic trajectories. Ellipse loss penalizes off-road predictions directly in a supervised manner, by projecting the output trajectories into the top-down map frame using a differentiable trajectory rasterizer module. Moreover, it takes into account actor dimensions and orientation, providing more direct training signals to the model. We applied ellipse loss to a recently proposed state-of-the-art joint detection-prediction model to showcase its benefits. Evaluation on large-scale autonomous driving data strongly indicates that the method allows for more accurate and more realistic trajectory predictions.
