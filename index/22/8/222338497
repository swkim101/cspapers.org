Teams that bring together experts with different expertise are important for solving complex problems. However, research shows that teaming up people simply based on their ability is not enough. Team members need to have clear roles, and they should mutually endorse and respect their teammates for the role they assume on the team. In this paper, we define the MaxMutualRespect problem, a novel team-formation problem that asks for a set of experts, each assigned to a distinct role, such that the total respect that the individuals receive by the rest of the team members for their assigned role is maximized. We show that the problem is NP-complete and we consider approximation and heuristic algorithms. Experiments with real datasets demonstrate that our problem definitions and algorithms work well in practice and yield intuitive results.
