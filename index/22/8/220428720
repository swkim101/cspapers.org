We study a large family of stochastic processes that update a limited amount in each step. One family of such examples is agent-based modeling, where one agent at a time updates, so the state has small changes in each step. A key question is how this family of stochastic processes is approximated by their mean-field approximations. Prior work shows that the stochastic processes escape repelling fixed points and saddle points in polynomial time. We provide a tight analysis of the above question. For any non-attracting hyperbolic fixed point and a sufficiently small constant ε >0, the process will be ε-far away from the fixed point in O(n log n) time with high probability. We also show that it takes time Ω(n log n) to escape such a fixed point with constant probability. This shows that our result is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We leverage the above result and show that such stochastic processes can reach the neighborhood of some attracting fixed point in $O(nłog n)$ time with high probability. Finally, We show the power of our results by applying them to several settings: evolutionary game theory, opinion formation dynamics, and stochastic gradient descent in a finite-dimensional space.
