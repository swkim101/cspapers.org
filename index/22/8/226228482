In the past few years, we have seen multiple attacks on one-dimensional databases that support range queries. These attacks achieve full database reconstruction by exploiting access pattern leakage along with known query distribution or search pattern leakage. We are the first to go beyond one dimension, exploring this threat in two dimensions. We unveil an intrinsic limitation of reconstruction attacks by showing that there can be an exponential number of distinct databases that produce equivalent leakage. Next, we present a full database reconstruction attack. Our algorithm runs in polynomial time and returns a poly-size encoding of all databases consistent with the given leakage profile. We implement our algorithm and observe real-world databases that admit a large number of equivalent databases, which aligns with our theoretical results.
