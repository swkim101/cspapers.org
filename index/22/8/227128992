Blockchains host smart contracts for voting, tokens, and other purposes. Vulnerabilities in contracts are common, often leading to the loss of money. Psamathe is a new language we are designing around a new flow abstraction, reducing asset bugs and making contracts more concise than in existing languages. We present an overview of Psamathe, and discuss two example contracts in Psamathe and Solidity.
