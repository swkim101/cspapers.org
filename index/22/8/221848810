This study aim to confirm the effect of viscosity characteristics differences on the rotational manipulation of a cylindrical rotary controller with the index finger and thumb through a quantitative analysis and evaluation of muscle and brain activations. The target motion was a rotary manipulation with the index finger and thumb of a cylindrical rotary controller with a 50 mm diameter. The rotary motion of the controller produces a click sensation at every 12 degrees in the rotation. The experimental conditions were three conditions with different viscosity characteristics related to the rotary motion of the controller. The subjects were six right-handed healthy males with a mean age of 21.7 (S. D.: 1.03) years. We analyzed the brain activity from a nearâ€“ infrared spectroscopy measurement system, the muscles activity using a surface myoelectric potential measurement device, the force data at the index finger and thumb tip using two independent six-axis force/torque sensors, and the position data using a 3D position measurement device. The experimental results showed that there was no significant difference in the questionnaire survey, muscle activity, and grasping force, respectively; however, a significant difference in brain activity was observed with increased controller viscosity. Therefore, it became clear that there was a change in the brain activity when rotating the cylindrical rotary controller with the viscosity characteristics related to the rotary motion.
