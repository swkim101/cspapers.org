Performing collaborative semantic mapping is a critical challenge for cooperative robots to maintain a comprehensive contextual understanding of the surroundings. Most of the existing work either focus on single robot semantic mapping or collaborative geometry mapping. In this paper, a novel hierarchical collaborative probabilistic semantic mapping framework is proposed, where the problem is formulated in a distributed setting. The key novelty of this work is the mathematical modeling of the overall collaborative semantic mapping problem and the derivation of its probability decomposition. In the single robot level, the semantic point cloud is obtained based on heterogeneous sensor fusion model and is used to generate local semantic maps. Since the voxel correspondence is unknown in collaborative robots level, an Expectation-Maximization approach is proposed to estimate the hidden data association, where Bayesian rule is applied to perform semantic and occupancy probability update. The experimental results show the high quality global semantic map, demonstrating the accuracy and utility of 3D semantic map fusion algorithm in real missions.
