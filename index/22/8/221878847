Providing personalized recommendations that are also accompanied by explanations as to why an item is recommended is a research area of growing importance. At the same time, progress is limited by the availability of open evaluation resources. In this work, we address the task of scientific literature recommendation. We present arXivDigest, which is an online service providing personalized arXiv recommendations to end users and operates as a living lab for researchers wishing to work on explainable scientific literature recommendations.
