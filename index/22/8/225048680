Motor paralysis of lower limbs has a great influence on the daily actions and social life of stroke patients. In order to carry out rehabilitation training for patients, a variety of power-assist robots has been studied. On the other hand, it has been shown that a motion change induced by the reflection phenomenon and the kinesthetic illusion can be generated by stimulating the specific muscles with vibration stimulation during upper-limb movement. Artificially generating the intended motion or giving the movement sensation by adding vibration stimulation may be an alternative method to realize the rehabilitation training. Because In this study, change of ankle joint movement based on the vibration stimulation of the tibialis anterior muscle of the lower-limb is studied by performing the experiment of adding vibration stimulation to the tibialis anterior muscle during the movement of ankle joint dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, and then the possibility of its application to rehabilitation training is evaluated.
