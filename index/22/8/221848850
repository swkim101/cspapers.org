Indoor positioning technology is essential for indoor mobile robots and drones. However, there has never been a general-purpose technology or infrastructure that enables indoor positioning with an accuracy of less than 10 cm. We have developed an attitude measurement method using multiple dynamic moires with a lenticular lens and developed an ultra- high-accuracy visual marker with an attitude estimation error of less than 0.1Â°. We also developed a calculation method that minimizes the marker position error by reminimizing reprojection error using its good attitude accuracy. We proved that accurate local positioning with a position error of about 1 cm in a marker coordinate system is possible even when a marker is shot from a distance of 10 m. In addition, a demonstration test was performed in a public space, and it was shown that high-accuracy global positioning with a position error of about 10 cm is possible.
