This project concerns on the development of applications using sensors for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. Thus, the leap motion sensor is employed for the finger motor rehabilitation training while the Microsoft Kinect sensor is utilized for the upper limb motor rehabilitation. Two applications which are named ‘Pick and Place’ and ‘Stone Breaker’ are developed. For the first application, the patient is required to pick up the virtual blocks and stack it up. The ‘Stone Breaker’ game requires the patient to move the upper limb in controlling the paddle movement in the game. At the end of the project, it is able to achieve the dominant objective of the project when the tested patient shows significant improvement in both the application.
