In this paper, we propose a parallel six-wheel-legged robot that can traverse irregular terrain while carrying objectives to do heavy-duty work. This robot is equipped with six Stewart platforms as legs and tightly integrates the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the wheels. The presented control strategy with physical system used to adapt the diverse degrees of each leg to irregular terrain such that robot increases the traversability, and simultaneously to maintain the horizontal whole-torso pose. This strategy makes use of Contact Scheduler (CS) and Whole-Torso Control (WTC) to control the multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) leg for performing high-flexibility locomotion and adapting the rough terrain like actively parallel suspension system. We conducted experiments on flat, slope, soft and sandgravel surface, which validate the proposed control method and physical system. Especially, we attempt to traverse over sand-gravel terrain with 3 people about 240kg payload.
