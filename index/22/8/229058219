 We study a new class of infill patterns, that we call wallpaper-infills for additive manufacturing based on space-filling shapes. To this end, we present a simple yet powerful geometric modeling framework that combines the idea of Voronoi decomposition space with wallpaper symmetries defined in 2-space. We first provide a geometric algorithm to generate wallpaper-infills and design four special cases based on selective spatial arrangement of seed points on the plane. Second, we provide a relationship between the infill percentage to the spatial resolution of the seed points for our cases thus allowing for a systematic way to generate infills at the desired volumetric infill percentages. Finally, we conduct a detailed experimental evaluation of the of these four cases to study their mechanical behavior under tensile loading.
