Estimating the 3D motion of points in a scene, known as scene flow, is a core problem in computer vision. Traditional learning-based methods designed to learn end-to-end 3D flow often suffer from poor generalization. Here we present a recurrent architecture that learns a single step of an unrolled iterative alignment procedure for refining scene flow predictions. Inspired by classical algorithms, we demonstrate iterative convergence toward the solution using strong regularization. The proposed method can handle sizeable temporal deformations and suggests a slimmer architecture than competitive all-to-all correlation approaches. Trained on FlyingThings3D synthetic data only, our network successfully generalizes to real scans, outperforming all existing methods by a large margin on the KITTI self-supervised benchmark.1
