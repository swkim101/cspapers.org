The International Space Station (ISS) serves as a research lab for a wide variety of experiments including some that study the biological effects of microgravity and spaceflight using the Rodent Habitat and Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG). Astronauts train for onboard dissections of rodents following basic training. An alternative approach for conducting these experiments is teleoperation of a robot located on the ISS from earth by a scientist who is proficient in rodent dissection. This pilot study addresses (1) the effects of extreme time delay on skill degradation during Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) tasks and rodent dissections using RAVEN II; (2) derivation and testing of rudimentary interaction force estimation; (3) elicitation of design requirements for an onboard dissection robot, RAVEN-S; and (4) simulation of the RAVEN-S prototype design with dissection data. The results indicate that the tasksâ€™ completion times increased by a factor of up to 9 for a 3 s time delay while performing manipulation and cutting tasks (FLS model) and by a factor of up to 3 for a 0.75 s time delay during mouse dissection tasks (animal model). Average robot forces/torques of 14N/0.1Nm (peak 90N/0.75Nm) were measured along with average linear/angular velocities of 0.02m/s / 4rad/s (peak 0.1m/s / 40rad/s) during dissection. A triangular configuration of three arms with respect to the operation site showed the best configuration given the MSG geometry and the dissection tasks. In conclusion, the results confirm the feasibility of utilizing a surgically-inspired RAVEN-S robot for teleoperated rodent dissection for successful completion of the predefined tasks in the presence of communications time delay between the ISS and ground control.
