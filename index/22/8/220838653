The Chameleon testbed is a case study in adapting the cloud paradigm for computer science research. In this paper, we explain how this adaptation was achieved, evaluate it from the perspective of supporting the most experiments for the most users, and make a case that utilizing mainstream technology in research testbeds can increase efﬁciency without compromising on functionality. We also highlight the opportunity inherent in the shared digital artifacts generated by testbeds and give an overview of the efforts we’ve made to develop it to foster reproducibility.
