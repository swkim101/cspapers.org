Logic regression aims to find a Boolean model involving binary covariates that predicts the response of an unknown system. It has many important applications, e.g., in data analysis and system design. In the 2019 ICCAD CAD Contest, the challenge of learning a compact circuit representing a black-box input-output pattern generator in a high dimensional Boolean space is formulated as the logic regression problem. This paper presents our winning approach to the problem based on a decision-tree reasoning procedure assisted with a template based preprocessing. Our methods outperformed other contestants in the competition in both prediction accuracy and circuit size.
