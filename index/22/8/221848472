In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to the calibrated camera motion estimation with a common direction. This case is relevant to smart phones, tablets, and other camera-IMU (Inertial measurement unit) systems, which have accelerometers to measure the gravity direction. We can align one of the axes of the camera with this common direction so that the relative rotation between the views reduces to only 1DOF (degree of freedom). This allows us to use only three point correspondences for relative pose estimation. Unlike previous work, we derive new constraints on the simplified essential matrix using an elimination strategy based on Gr√∂bner basis. In this case, computing the coefficients of these constraints require less computation and we only need to solve a polynomial eigenvalue problem. We show detailed analyses and comparisons against the existing 3-point algorithms, with satisfactory results obtained.
