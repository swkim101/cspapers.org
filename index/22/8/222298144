Modern computing systems typically have multiple users sharing hardware resources. While such shared hardware have typically been performance boosters, they have also led to inadvertent side-effects such as side channels. Caches, that present the largest attack surface, have been popular among adversaries for side channel attacks. In this work, we repurpose a classic cache performance metric namely, reuse distance, to capture the activity of an adversary in cache timing channels. We design Reuse-trap, an efficient cache side channel mitigation framework to record reuse distances during victim accesses and carefully inject noise to mislead the spy from inferring the victimâ€™s activity. Our experimental results show that we can identify adversaries with zero false positives and make timing channels suffer from over 50% bit error rate on average.
