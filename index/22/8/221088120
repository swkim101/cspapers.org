We consider the product of determinantal point processes (DPPs) , a point process whose probability mass is proportional to the product of principal minors of multiple matrices as a natural, promising generalization of DPPs. We study the computational complexity of computing its normalizing constant , which is among the most essential probabilistic inference tasks. Our complexity-theoretic results (almost) rule out the existence of efÔ¨Åcient algorithms for this task, unless input matrices are forced to have favorable structures. In particular, we prove the following:
