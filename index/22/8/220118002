Trajectory forecasting and imputation are pivotal steps towards understanding the movement of human and objects, which are quite challenging since the future trajectories and missing values in a temporal sequence are full of uncertainties, and the spatial-temporally contextual correlation is hard to model. Yet, the relevance between sequence prediction and imputation is disregarded by existing approaches. To this end, we propose a novel imitative non-autoregressive modeling method to simultaneously handle the trajectory prediction task and the missing value imputation task. Specifically, our framework adopts an imitation learning paradigm, which contains a recurrent conditional variational autoencoder (RC-VAE) as a demonstrator, and a non-autoregressive transformation model (NART) as a learner. By jointly optimizing the two models, RC-VAE can predict the future trajectory and capture the temporal relationship in the sequence to supervise the NART learner. As a result, NART learns from the demonstrator and imputes the missing value in a non autoregressive strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular datasets, and the results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets.
