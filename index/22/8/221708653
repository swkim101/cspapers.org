Deep Neural Networks models are state-of-the-art solutions in accurately forecasting future video frames in a movie. A successful video prediction model needs to extract and encode semantic features that describe the complex spatio-temporal correlations within image sequences of the real world. The IARAI Traﬃc4cast Challenge of the NeurIPS Competition Track 2019 for the ﬁrst time introduced the novel argument that this is also highly relevant for urban traﬃc. By framing traﬃc prediction as a movie completion task, the challenge requires models to take advantage of complex geo-spatial and temporal patterns of the underlying process. We here report on the success and insights
