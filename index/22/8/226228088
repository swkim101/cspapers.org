It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 2010 ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security -- AISec'10. This year's workshop continues its tradition of being a premier forum for presentation of research results and position papers that bridge the gap between the artificial intelligence and security communities. We also continue our relationship with the ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference (CCS 2010). 
 
This will be the third workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence. Techniques from artificial intelligence (notably bayesian learning and captchas) have achieved great success in helping administrators manage automated attacks such as SPAM and network attacks that would overwhelm human capacities. The proliferation of data and data mining techniques has important implications for security and privacy. However, the scientific foundation for the use of these techniques in adversarial contexts contains many open questions, other AI techniques are being applied to security applications, and as AI technologies (like autonomous vehicles) become increasingly mainstream, their security properties become increasingly important. 
 
The call for papers attracted 15 submissions from 6 countries on 3 continents. The program committee accepted 5 full papers and 5 short papers that cover a variety of security applications from malware detection to social network privacy and use a variety of AI techniques from machine learning to adjustable autonomy.
