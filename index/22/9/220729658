Predicting user engagement (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate) on the display ads plays a critical role in delivering the right ad to the right user in online advertising. Existing techniques spanning Logistic Regression to Factorization Machines and their derivatives, focus on modeling the interactions among handcrafted features to predict the user engagement. Little attention has been paid on how the ad fits with the context (e.g., hosted webpage, user demographics). In this paper, we propose to include the metadata feature, which captures the visual appearance of the ad, in the user engagement prediction task. In particular, given a data sample, we combine both the basic context features, which have been widely used in existing prediction models, and the metadata feature, which is extracted from the ad using a state-of-the-art deep learning framework, to predict user engagement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metadata feature, we compare the performance of the widely used prediction models before and after integrating the metadata feature. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the metadata feature is able to further improve the prediction performance.
