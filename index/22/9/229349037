3D NAND flash memory with advanced multi-level cell techniques provides high storage density, but suffers from significant performance degradation due to a large number of read-retry operations. Although the read-retry mechanism is essential to ensuring the reliability of modern NAND flash memory, it can significantly in-crease the read latency of an SSD by introducing multiple retry steps that read the target page again with adjusted read-reference voltage values. Through a detailed analysis of the read mechanism and rigorous characterization of 160 real 3D NAND flash memory chips, we find new opportunities to reduce the read-retry latency by exploiting two advanced features widely adopted in modern NAND flash-based SSDs: 1) the CACHE READ command and 2) strong ECC engine. First, we can reduce the read-retry latency using the advanced CACHE READ command that allows a NAND flash chip to perform consecutive reads in a pipelined manner. Second, there exists a large ECC-capability margin in the final retry step that can be used for reducing the chip-level read latency. Based on our new findings, we develop two new techniques that effectively reduce the read-retry latency: 1) Pipelined Read-Retry (PR²) and 2) Adaptive Read-Retry (AR²). PR² reduces the latency of a read-retry operation by pipelining consecutive retry steps using the CACHE READ command. AR² shortens the latency of each retry step by dynamically reducing the chip-level read latency depending on the current operating conditions that determine the ECC-capability margin. Our evaluation using twelve real-world workloads shows that our proposal improves SSD response time by up to 31.5% (17% on average)over a state-of-the-art baseline with only small changes to the SSD controller.
