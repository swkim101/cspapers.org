The study proposes SC-type and QS-type location estimators and phase I control charts based on skewness coefficient, quantile measure of skewness and weighted variance based on the semivariance. The estimators are analyzed in terms of the mean squired errors and the detection effectiveness of the proposed charts is validated in four types of disturbances and skewed distributions. The QS-type control charts show superior detection effectiveness in four tested scenarios compared to the SC-type charts based on traditional skewness coefficients.
