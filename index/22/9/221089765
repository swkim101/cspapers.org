Policy learning using historical observational data is an important problem that has found widespread applications. However, existing literature rests on the crucial assumption that the future environment where the learned policy will be deployed is the same as the past environment that has generated the data–an assumption that is often false or too coarse an approximation. In this paper, we lift this assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with bandit observational data. We propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a robust policy to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts. We ﬁrst present a policy evaluation procedure in the ambiguous environment and also give a heuristic algorithm to solve the distribution-ally robust policy learning problems efﬁciently. Additionally, we provide extensive simulations to demonstrate the robustness of our policy.
