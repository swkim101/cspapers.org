Having enough knowledge of the basic solar components, including Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI), Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI) and Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), is greatly significant to concentrated solar power (CSP) projects. (DNI), the amount of direct irradiance received on a plane normal to the sun, is of remarkable usefulness to CSP technologies around the world. However, in Tunisia, the field of solar energy generation faces twofold challenges. First, the unique type of solar concentrating collectors works only on global horizontal irradiation (GHI) which is the geometric sum of DNI and DHI. Second, these collectors are available in a limited number of locations.Regarding this additional review of hourly DNI, our approach to the real time assessment of the clear sky DNI gives a good estimation in the worst case the mean absolute error equal to 40 W/mÂ² for hourly values in comparison to the measured data.
