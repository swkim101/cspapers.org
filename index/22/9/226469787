The design and development of production-grade microservice backends is a tedious and error-prone task. In particular, they must be capable of handling all Functional Requirements (FRs) and all Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) (like security) including all operational requirements (like monitoring). This becomes even more difficult if there are many clients with different roles, linked to diverse (non-)functional requirements and many existing services are involved, which have to consider these in a consistent way. In this paper we present a model-driven approach that automatically generates client-specific production-grade backends by incorporating previously expressed architectural knowledge out of an interpretable specification of the targeted APIs and the NFRs.CCS CONCEPTS • Software and its engineering →Abstraction, modeling and modularity; System modeling languages; Software architectures; Software development techniques.
