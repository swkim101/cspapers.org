Conversational Information Seeking (CIS) is an emerging area of Information Retrieval focused on interactive search systems. As a result there is a need for new benchmark datasets and tools to enable their creation. In this demo we present the Agent Dialogue (AD) platform, an open-source system developed for researchers to perform Wizard-of-Oz CIS experiments. AD is a scalable cloud-native platform developed with Docker and Kubernetes with a flexible and modular micro-service architecture built on production-grade state-of-the-art open-source tools (Kubernetes, gRPC streaming, React, and Firebase). It supports varied front-ends and has the ability to interface with multiple existing agent systems, including Google Assistant and open-source search libraries. It includes support for centralized structure logging as well as offline relevance annotation.
