One popular thread of research in computational sarcasm detection involves modeling sarcasm as a contrast between positive and negative sentiment polarities or exploring more fine-grained categories of emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and so on. Most current models, however, treat these affective features independently, without regard for the sequential information encoded among the affective states. In order to explore the role of transitions in affective states, we formulate the task of sarcasm detection as a sequence classification problem by leveraging the natural shifts in various emotions over the course of a piece of text. Experiments conducted on datasets from two different genres suggest that our proposed approach particularly benefits datasets with limited labeled data and longer instances of text.
