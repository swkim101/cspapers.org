 This paper proposes an augmented reality (AR) framework and tool on smartphones as an alternative to conventional inspection for AM parts. The framework attempts to introduce the rapid inspection potential of smartphone based AR within manufacturing by leveraging the manufacturing capability of additive manufacturing (AM) to integrate markers onto AM parts. The key step from this framework that is explored in this paper is the design and quality assessment of AM markers for marker registration. As part of the marker design and quality assessment objectives, this research conducts an evaluation on the effects of different AM processes on the quality of augmentation achieved from AM fiducial markers. Furthermore, it evaluates the minimum fiducial pattern size that on integration onto AM parts will be viable for augmentation. The results suggest that the AM process and the size of the fiducial pattern play a significant role in determining the quality of the AM markers. The paper concludes by stating that dual material extrusion AM markers provide the highest number of detectable features and therefore the highest quality of AM markers, and the smallest viable fiducial pattern for Cybercode/QR code marker can be sized at 19 Ã— 19mm2.
