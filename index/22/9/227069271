Rather than performing inefficient local iterative routing between adjacent capsule 
layers, we propose an alternative global view based on representing the inherent uncertainty 
in part-object assignment. In our formulation, the local routing iterations 
are replaced with variational inference of part-object connections in a probabilistic 
capsule network, leading to a significant speedup without sacrificing performance. 
In this way, global context is also considered when routing capsules by introducing 
global latent variables that have direct influence on the objective function, and 
are updated discriminatively in accordance with the minimum description length 
(MDL) principle. We focus on enhancing capsule network properties, and perform a 
thorough evaluation on pose-aware tasks, observing improvements in performance 
over previous approaches whilst being more computationally efficient.
