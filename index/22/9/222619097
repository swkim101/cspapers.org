The BigScholar workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working on Big Scholarly Data to discuss what are emerging research issues and how to explore the Web of Scholars. Several core challenges such as the tools and methods for analyzing and mining scholarly data are particularly interesting for discussion at the workshop. The goal is to usher the birth of a community having a shared interest around the Web of Scholars and exploring it using data mining, recommender systems, social network analysis and other multidisciplinary methodologies or technologies.
