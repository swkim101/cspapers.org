Injecting domain knowledge into a neural learner to alleviate reliance on high-quality data and improve explainability is a rapidly expanding research trend. While most of the effort focused on regular topology formats such as sequences and grids, we consider graph datasets. Moreover, instead of knowledge graph (KG) embedding that underlies the majority of graph- centered methods, we propose a dedicated pattern mining-based approach. As our patterns are ontologically-generalized, they achieve multiple objectives: domain knowledge infusion, generalization capacity enhancement, interpretability, etc.
