Modern telemetry systems require advanced analytic capabilities such as drill down queries. These queries can be used to detect the beginning and end of a network anomaly by efficiently refining the search space. We present the first integral solution that (i) enables multiple measurement tasks inside the same data structure, (ii) supports specifying the time frame of interest as part of its queries, and (iii) is sketch-based and thus space efficient. Namely, our approach allows the user to define both the measurement task (e.g., heavy hitters, entropy estimation, cardinality estimation) and the time frame of relevance (e.g., 5PM-6PM) at query time. Our approach provides accuracy guarantees and is the only space-efficient solution that offers such capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to accurately pinpoint the beginning of a realistic DDoS attack.
