At the end of primary school, pupils begin to learn how to manage information web search. This activity is complex for young learners. Thus, they carry out their first learning and use in a "protected hypertext environment". Despite this material adaptation, cognitive processes remain complex and most of pupils need navigation aid. This study aimed to examine how a navigable overview of the structure of the hypermedia could support navigation and promote better performance in answering questions from non-linear hypermedia, considering childrenâ€™ personal differences. We hypothesized that both information retrieval skills in a non-linear printed document and motivational aspects (self-efficacy about these skills) would predict navigational behaviour and performance. Moreover, we expected that a navigable overview would help when personal resources are low. A sample of pupils schooled in priority education was examined. Our hypotheses were partially confirmed. Pedagogical applications were discussed.
