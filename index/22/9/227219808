In this paper, we propose a new approach to design a functional observer for delayed non-linear singular systems. Delay functions are considered in both state and input vectors. Using the Takagi-Sugeno multiple model principle, we propose to extend observer design for linear singular delayed systems to the non-linear singular delayed representation. Sufficient conditions of stability are given to develop the designed observer gain. Such proposed observer proves its effectiveness on a numerical example.
