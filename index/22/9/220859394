Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems for graph-structured data. However, a number of applications of link prediction, such as predicting commercial ties or memberships within a criminal organization, are adversarial, with another party aiming to minimize its effectiveness by manipulating observed information about the graph. In this paper, we focus on the feasibility of mounting adversarial attacks against link prediction algorithms based on graph neural networks. We first propose a greedy heuristic that exploits incremental computation to find attacks against a state-of-the-art link prediction algorithm, called SEAL. We then design an efficient variant of this algorithm that incorporates the link formation mechanism and Î¥-decaying heuristic theory to design more effective adversarial attacks. We used real-world datasets and performed an extensive array of experiments to show that the performance of SEAL is negatively affected by a significant margin. More importantly, our experimental results have shown that our adversarial attacks mounted based on SEAL can be readily transferred to several existing link prediction heuristics in the literature.
