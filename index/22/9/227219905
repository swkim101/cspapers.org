Obstacle avoidance, researching goal, and the path planning are the most important tasks for an autonomous mobile robot which moves in an uncertain environment, this paper presents a method of a fuzzy controller to control the robot to avoid all fixed and mobile obstacles. The objective is the control and programming of a mobile robot with obstacle avoidance using fuzzy logic. This robot can be controlled by a human-machine interface or by a keyboard. Communication between the human-machine interface and Robot is done by using wireless communication. Ultrasonic sensors and infrared sensors will be used to measure the distances between the robot and the obstacles in different directions. This robot can avoid collision with obstacles by intelligent reasoning using fuzzy logic.
