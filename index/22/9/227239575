In reality, there is still much to be done for robots to be able to perform manipulation actions with full autonomy. Complicated manipulation tasks, such as cooking, may still require a person to perform some actions that are very risky for a robot to perform. On the other hand, some other actions may be very risky for a human with physical disabilities to perform. Therefore, it is necessary to balance the workload of a robot and a human based on their limitations while minimizing the effort needed from a human in a collaborative robot (cobot) set-up. This paper proposes a new version of our functional object-oriented network (FOON) that integrates weights in its functional units to reflect a robotâ€™s chance of successfully executing an action of that functional unit. The paper also presents a task planning algorithm for the weighted FOON to allocate manipulation action load to the robot and human to achieve optimal performance while minimizing human effort. Through a number of experiments, this paper shows several successful cases in which using the proposed weighted FOON and the task planning algorithm allow a robot and a human to successfully complete complicated tasks together with higher success rates than a robot doing them alone.
