Current trends in industrial automation favor agile systems that allow adaptation to rapidly changing task requirements and facilitate customized production in smaller batches. This work presents a flexible manufacturing system relying on compliance control, CAD based localization, and a multi-modal gripper to enable fast and efficient task programming for assembly operations. CAD file processing is employed to extract component pose data from 3D assembly models, while the systemâ€™s active compliance compensates for errors in calibration or positioning. To minimize retooling delays, a novel gripper design incorporating both a parallel jaw element and a rotating module is proposed. The developed system placed first in the manufacturing track of the Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2019, experimentally validating its efficiency.
