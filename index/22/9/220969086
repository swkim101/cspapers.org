We study Frank-Wolfe algorithms – standard, pairwise, and away-steps – for efficient optimization of Dominant Set Clustering. We present a unified and computationally efficient framework to employ the different variants of Frank-Wolfe methods, and we investigate its effectiveness via several experimental studies. In addition, we provide explicit convergence rates for the algorithms in terms of the so-called Frank-Wolfe gap. The theoretical analysis has been specialized to Dominant Set Clustering and covers consistently the different variants.
