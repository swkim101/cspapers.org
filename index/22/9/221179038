Nowadays, virtually all mobile apps rely on communicating with a network backend. Given the sensitive nature of the data exchanged between apps and their backends, securing these network communications is of growing importance. In recent years, Google has developed a number of security mechanisms for Android apps, ranging from multiple KeyStores to the recent introduction of the new Network Security Policy, an XML-based conﬁguration ﬁle that allows apps to deﬁne their network security posture. In this paper, we perform the ﬁrst comprehensive study on these new network defense mechanisms. In particular, we presentthem in detail,we discuss the attacks they are defending from, and the relevant threat models. We then discuss the ﬁrst large-scale analysis on this aspect.

We then set out to explore the root cause of these weaknesses (i.e., the why ). Our analysis showed that app developers often copy-paste vulnerable policies from popular developer websites (e.g., StackOverﬂow). We also found that several popular ad libraries require apps to weaken their security policy, the key problem lying in the vast complexity of the ad ecosystem. As a last contribution, we propose a new extension of the Network Security Policy, so to allow app developers to embed problematic ad libraries without the need to weaken the security of their entire app.
