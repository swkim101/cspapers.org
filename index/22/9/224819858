Detecting fake news as early as possible has attracted growing attention due to its fast-spreading nature and the significant harm it can cause. As demonstrated in recent studies, the propagation pattern of fake news on social media differs from that of real news, and a number of works have extracted different types of features from the propagation pattern for detection. However, a major limitation of this approach is that the propagation network is not fully available in the early stages, and may take a long time to complete. As a result, existing network-based fake news detection methods yield low accuracy during the early stages of propagation. To bridge the research gap, in this work we: (1) propose a novel network embedding algorithm, based on the investigation of a wide range of features obtained from the propagation network, which are not well studied in previous work; and (2) design an autoencoder-based neural architecture to predict the embedding of the complete propagation network using the partially available network in the early stages of propagation. Our experiments show that with the predicted embedding for the complete propagation network, our model can achieve state-of-the-art performance while only having access to the early stage propagation network.
