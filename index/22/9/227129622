Static program verification requires a large number of user-provided specifications, resulting in a significant upfront verification cost. One method for reducing this burden is gradual verification, a novel approach that enables developers to deal with the cost of verification incrementally â€” statically where possible and dynamically where necessary. In this paper, we discuss our work designing and implementing the static portion of a gradual verification tool.
