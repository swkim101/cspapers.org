This paper presents an experimental framework to quantify grasp compliance, especially at object boundaries. A simplified underactuated compliant robotic grasper design and fabrication process is derived from Northeastern’s Baxter Easyhand (for the fingers) and on Yale’s OpenHand Model T (for the actuation). This results in an efficient robotic hand, with lower material costs, but finger layout asymmetry. Grasp performance of the hand is measured experimentally and processed to build grasp probability maps as a function of grasp location and material type. Borrowing on the idea of structured sampling, the paper introduces a structured experimental procedure based on location and object wear to perform an experimental quantification of grasp compliance. This results in data-driven statistical models and maps that quantify the grasper’s ability to compensate substantial positioning and object wear variation. They also highlight several phenomena such as a grasp probability gradient zone (about 10mm wide), the effect of the grasper’s asymmetry on grasp success and the influence of non-geometrical properties of the grasped object such as roughness and stiffness. Together this approach may help inform design, manufacturing and planning/control efforts.
