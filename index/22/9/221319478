The joint detection of drivable areas and road anomalies is a crucial task for ground mobile robots. In recent years, many impressive semantic segmentation networks, which can be used for pixel-level drivable area and road anomaly detection, have been developed. However, the detection accuracy still needs improvement. Therefore, we develop a novel module named the Normal Inference Module (NIM), which can generate surface normal information from dense depth images with high accuracy and efficiency. Our NIM can be deployed in existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to refine the segmentation performance. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our NIM, we embed it in twelve state-of-the-art CNNs. The experimental results illustrate that our NIM can greatly improve the performance of the CNNs for drivable area and road anomaly detection. Furthermore, our proposed NIM-RTFNet ranks 8th on the KITTI road benchmark and exhibits a real-time inference speed.
