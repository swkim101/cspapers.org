Robotic packaging of fresh leafy produce such as herbs and salads generally involves picking out a target mass from a pile or crate of plant material. Typically, for low-complexity parallel grippers, the weight picked can be controlled by varying the opening aperture. However, often individual strands of plant material get entangled with each other, causing more to be picked out than desired. This paper presents a simple spread-and-pick approach that significantly reduces the degree of entanglement in a herb pile when picking. Compared to the traditional approach of picking from an entanglement-free point in the pile, the proposed approach results in a decrease of up to 29.06% of the variance in for separate homogeneous piles of fresh herbs. Moreover, it shows good generalisation with up to 55.53% decrease in picked weight variance for herbs previously unseen by the system.
