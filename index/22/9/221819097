Recognizing fine-grained categories remains a challenging task, due to the subtle distinctions among different subordinate categories, which results in the need of abundant annotated samples. To alleviate the data-hungry problem, we consider the problem of learning novel categories from web data with the support of a clean set of base categories, which is referred to as weak-shot learning. Under this setting, we propose to transfer pairwise semantic similarity from base categories to novel categories, because this similarity is highly transferable and beneficial for learning from web data. Specifically, we firstly train a similarity net on clean data, and then employ two simple yet effective strategies to leverage the transferred similarity to denoise web training data. In addition, we apply adversarial loss on similarity net to enhance the transferability of similarity. Comprehensive experiments on three fine-grained datasets demonstrate that we could dramatically facilitate webly supervised learning by a clean set and similarity transfer is effective under this setting.
