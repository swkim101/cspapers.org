Driving is perhaps one of most dangerous tasks undertaken on a daily basis, and these dangers persist from urban to off-road environments. This research investigates an approach to mitigate these risks by visually detecting hazards common to these environments, with particular focus on hazards in mine sites. In addition to their practical appeal, hazards present an interesting challenge as they are defined by their affordance type as much as object type, with rocks only becoming a rubble hazard when on or near the road. Utilising the advantages of transfer learning, we fine-tune the CNN Re-fineNet which performs semantic segmentation to detect water/puddle, snow, rubble and dropoff edge hazard affordances on our small custom datasets. This transfer learning approach is then expanded with two key investigations; first through a series multi-hazard training schemes, and then by evaluating how performance is affected by even smaller training sets. Overall, the multi-hazard training schemes show that training with two hazards gives improved results, while three to four are too general to improve performance on any one task. Through evaluating how performance is affected with less training data, we establish that reasonable hazard detection rates can be achieved with only 10-12 training images. These insights aim to provide practical approaches for others to rapidly prototype CNNs for custom applications. We hope our application area of hazard detection for driving prompts further research on hazard detection to reduce vehicle related injuries and fatalities.
