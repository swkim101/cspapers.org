There are two main paradigms to exploit review information for recommendation. One is to concatenate all reviews of a user/item into a long document, which may neglect the different usefulness of reviews. The other paradigm is review-level i.e., analyzing each review separately to learn user/item features. In fact, the two paradigms are complementary, and fusing them together has the potential to learn more comprehensive features of users/items. Hence, we propose a unified framework to jointly learn document- and review-level representations of users/items. We design a document encoder to learn document-level features of users/items. Then, we use a review encoder to learn representations of reviews from words, and a user/item encoder to learn review-level features of users/items. Besides, different reviews from the same user may have different importance for different target items due to different item characteristics. We propose a cross attention model for user representation learning whose query vector is the embedding of target item ID, and apply it to the above three encoders to select different informative words and reviews for different target items. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
