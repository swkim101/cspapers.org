Driven by deep neural networks (DNN), the recent development of computer vision makes visual sensors such as stereo cameras and Lidars ubiquitous in autonomous cars, robotics and traffic monitoring. However, due to operational constraints, a processing pipeline like object tracking has to hard-wire an engineered set of DNN models to a fixed processing logic. To overcome this, we propose a novel semantic reasoning approach that uses stream reasoning programs for in-cooperating DNN models with commonsense and domain knowledge using Answer Set Programming (ASP). This approach enables us to realize a reasoning framework that can adaptively reconfigure the reasoning plan in each execution step of incoming stream data.
