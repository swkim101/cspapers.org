This half-day workshop explores challenges and potential research directions about Information Retrieval (IR) in finance. The focus will be on stimulating discussions around the accessing, searching, filtering, and analyzing financial documents in banking, insurance, and investment, such as the financial statements, analyst reports, filling forms, and news articles. We welcome theoretical, experimental, and methodological studies that aim to advance techniques of managing and understanding financial documents, as well as emphasize the applicability in practical applications. The workshop aims to bring together a diverse set of researchers and practitioners interested in investigating relevant topics. Besides, to facilitate developing and testing some relevant techniques, we hold a data challenge on quantifying analyst reports and news articles for the prediction of commodity prices.
