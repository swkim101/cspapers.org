Temporal knowledge graphs, also known as episodic or time-dependent knowledge graphs, are large-scale event databases that describe temporally evolving multi-relational data. An episodic knowledge graph can be regarded as a sequence of semantic knowledge graphs incorporated with timestamps. In this talk, we review recently developed learning-based algorithms for temporal knowledge graphs completion and forecasting.
