Modeling touch pointing is essential to touchscreen interface development and research, as pointing is one of the most basic and common touch actions users perform on touchscreen devices. Finger-Fitts Law [4] revised the conventional Fitts? law into a 1D (one-dimensional) pointing model for finger touch by explicitly accounting for the fat finger ambiguity (absolute error) problem which was unaccounted for in the original Fitts? law. We generalize Finger-Fitts law to 2D touch pointing by solving two critical problems. First, we extend two of the most successful 2D Fitts law forms to accommodate finger ambiguity. Second, we discovered that using nominal target width and height is a conceptually simple yet effective approach for defining amplitude and directional constraints for 2D touch pointing across different movement directions. The evaluation shows our derived 2D Finger-Fitts law models can be both principled and powerful. Specifically, they outperformed the existing 2D Fitts? laws, as measured by the regression coefficient and model selection information criteria (e.g., Akaike Information Criterion) considering the number of parameters. Finally, 2D Finger-Fitts laws also advance our understanding of touch pointing and thereby serve as the basis for touch interface designs.
