In this paper we investigate automated meth-ods for understanding false news dissemination on Twitter in relation to one particular event: the 2019 Indonesian presidential election. We collected a sample of 2,360 tweets related to topics addressed by fact-checking websites. The tweets were hand-labeled according to their trustworthiness. We trained several classiﬁcation models on the human-labelled data, using three groups of text features. The word n-gram features appeared to be the most eﬀective, reaching a recall of 85% for true news and 62% for false news. With this classiﬁer we labeled a larger sample of tweets related to fact-checking topics in the context of the 2019 Indonesian presidential elections. We then analysed the dissemination of true news and false news in the underlying Twitter network using community detection and centrality measures. The top inﬂuential users in the network disseminate more false news, including a government institution account and a veriﬁed politician’s account. Our results show that the combination of text features and social network analysis can provide valuable insights in detecting and preventing the dissemination of false news. Moreover, we make the dataset used in this research available for reuse by the community.
