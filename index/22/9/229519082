This work presents the deployment of UAVs for the exploration of clouds, from the system architecture and simulation tests to a real-flight campaign and trajectory analyzes. Thanks to their small size and low altitude, light UAVs have proven to be adapted for in-situ cloud data collection. The short life time of the clouds and limited endurance of the planes require to focus on the area of maximum interest to gather relevant data. Based on previous work on cloud adaptive sampling, the article focuses on the overall system architecture, the improvements made to the system based on preliminary tests and simulations, and finally the results of a field campaign. The Barbados experimental flight campaign confirmed the capacity of the system to map clouds and to collect relevant data in dynamic environment, and highlighted areas for improvement.
