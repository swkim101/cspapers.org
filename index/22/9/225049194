This paper proposes a just-in-time approach to introduce adaptive planning in personal daily context. Adaptive planning is known to be effective in agile development, which is expected to be useful for our daily life as well. The chatbot-based approach has been proposed for modeling personal daily context as user story graph. This paper extends this approach by adopting the design of sprint planning. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a short-term real-world simulation using a storytelling interface is conducted. The result shows that the proposed adaptive planning framework could lead to better decision-making during individualâ€™s daily life.
