Term frequency is a common method for identifying the importance of a term in a document. But term frequency ignores how a term interacts with its text context, which is key to estimating document-specific term weights. This paper proposes a Deep Contextualized Term Weighting framework (DeepCT) that maps the contextualized term representations from BERT to into context-aware term weights for passage retrieval. The new, deep term weights can be stored in an ordinary inverted index for efficient retrieval. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that DeepCT greatly improves the accuracy of first-stage passage retrieval algorithms.
