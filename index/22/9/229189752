To verify distributed systems, prior work introduced a methodology for verifying both the code running on individual machines and the correctness of the overall system when those machines interact via an asynchronous distributed environment. The methodology requires neither domain-speciﬁc logic nor tooling. However, distributed systems are only one instance of the more general phenomenon of systems code that interacts with an asynchronous environment. We argue that the software of a storage system can (and should!) be viewed similarly. We evaluate this approach in VeriBetrKV, a key-value store based on a state-of-the-art B ε tree. In building VeriBetrKV, we introduce new techniques to scale automated veriﬁcation to larger code bases, still without introducing domain-speciﬁc logic or tooling. In particular, we show a discipline that keeps the automated veriﬁcation development cycle responsive. We also combine linear types with dynamic frames to relieve the programmer from most heap-reasoning obligations while enabling them to break out of the linear type system when needed. VeriBetrKV exhibits similar query performance to unveriﬁed databases. Its insertion performance is 24 × faster than unveriﬁed BerkeleyDB and 8 × slower than RocksDB.
