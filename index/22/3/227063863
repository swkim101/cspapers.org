In this work, we focus on polar codes in mobile communication systems where a retransmission strategy, namely, the incremental redundancy hybrid automatic repeat request (IR-HARQ) scheme, is performed. We propose an early termination (ET) of polar codes using the interleaved cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes and the parity check (PC) codes. The parity-check equations of CRC and PC codes are used to detect the incorrectly decoded bits during the polar decoding. The simulation results verify that the proposed ET techniques can detect the erroneous bits in initial transmission and retransmission. The proposed technique provides the ET rate about 4-90%, and the block error rate (BLER) performance degradation is less than 2 dB.
