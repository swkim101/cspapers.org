Using open-source libraries can provide rich functions and reduce development cost. However, some critical issues have also been caused such as license conflicts and vulnerability risks. In this paper, we design and implement an open-source libraries detection tool OSLDetector which uses methods of matching features to detect third-party libraries for multi-platform software in binaries. We took a series of methods such as filtering features and novelty building an internal clone forest to cope with the challenge of feature duplication. The tool can also provide the conflict of licenses and identify possible corresponding vulnerabilities, so these potential risks can be resolved and avoided. To evaluate the efficiency of OSLDetector, we collect 5K libraries containing 9K versions and manage their respective license type and existing vulnerabilities. The experimental results with a precision of 96% and recall of 92.3% show that OSLDetector is effective and outperforms similar tools.
