Insufficient semantic understanding of dialogue always leads to the appearance of generic responses, in generative dialogue systems. Recently, high-quality knowledge bases have been introduced to enhance dialogue understanding, as well as to reduce the prevalence of boring responses. Although such knowledge-aware approaches have shown tremendous potential, they always utilize the knowledge in a black-box fashion. As a result, the generation process is somewhat uncontrollable, and it is also not interpretable. In this paper, we introduce a topic fact-based commonsense knowledge-aware approach, TopicKA. Different from previous works, TopicKA generates responses conditioned not only on the query message but also on a topic fact with an explicit semantic meaning, which also controls the direction of generation. Topic facts are recommended by a recommendation network trained under the Teacher-Student framework. To integrate the recommendation network and the generation network, this paper designs four schemes, which include two non-sampling schemes and two sampling methods. We collected and constructed a large-scale Chinese commonsense knowledge graph. Experimental results on an open Chinese benchmark dataset indicate that our model outperforms baselines in terms of both the objective and the subjective metrics.
