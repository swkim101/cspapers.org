In this discussion paper we present some preliminary ideas on the role of argumentation in the context of BDI and BOID agents, i.e. agents whose deliberation is based on beliefs, obligations, intentions and desires. More precisely, we identify several argumentation issues which do not occur in argumentation concerned with only the information or knowledge of single agent systems. We distinguish among argumentation issues for single agent deliberation, multiagent dialogues, and interaction between agents and their normative system. For each category we present some examples, and some ideas about their formalization.
