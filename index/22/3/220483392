Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have reached significant

maturity over several years for safe civilian operations like

mapping, search and rescue. The operation performance can

be significantly improved by deploying multiple cooperating

UAVs and optimal decision making. In this work, we present

the use of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for

two different applications involving cooperative UAVs.
