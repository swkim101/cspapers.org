Energy scavenging overlay networks with artificial noise (ESONwAN) integrate three emerging (energy harvesting, cognitive radio, physical layer security) technologies to boost spectrum utilization efficiency, energy efficiency, and message security, which sufficiently provide secured communication demands of an immense number of users in modern wireless systems. This paper analyzes secrecy throughput of these networks over Nakagami-m fading channels. Numerous results corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the secrecy throughput of both secondary and primary networks increases significantly with better fading conditions and is adjusted, traded-off and maximized by various options.
