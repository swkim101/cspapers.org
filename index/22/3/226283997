Oracle bone script (OBS) is the earliest known ancient Chinese writing system and the ancestor of modern Chinese. As the Chinese writing system is the oldest continuously-used system in the world, the study of OBS plays an important role in both linguistic and historical research. In order to utilize advanced machine learning methods to automatically process OBS, we construct an information system for OBS (IsOBS) to symbolize, serialize, and store OBS data at the character-level, based on efficient databases and retrieval modules. Moreover, we also apply few-shot learning methods to build an effective OBS character recognition module, which can recognize a large number of OBS characters (especially those characters with a handful of examples) and make the system easy to use. The demo system of IsOBS can be found from http://isobs.thunlp.org/. In the future, we will add more OBS data to the system, and hopefully our IsOBS can support further efforts in automatically processing OBS and advance the scientific progress in this field.
