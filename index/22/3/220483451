We investigate the problem of generating natural language summaries from knowledge base triples. Our approach is based on a pointer-generator network, which, in addition to generating regular words from a fixed target vocabulary, is able to verbalise triples in several ways. We undertake an automatic and a human evaluation on single and open-domain summaries generation tasks. Both show that our approach significantly outperforms other data-driven baselines.
