The feature interaction problem arises when two or more independent features interact with each other in an undesirable manner. Feature interactions remain a challenging and important problem in emerging domains of cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as intelligent vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the Internet of Things (IoT), where the outcome of an unexpected interaction may result in a safety failure. Existing approaches to resolving feature interactions rely on priority lists or fixed strategies, but may not be effective in scenarios where none of the competing feature actions are satisfactory with respect to system requirements. This paper proposes a novel synthesis-based approach to resolution, where a conflict among features is resolved by synthesizing an action that best satisfies the specification of desirable system behaviors in the given environmental context. Unlike existing resolution methods, our approach is capable of producing a desirable system outcome even when none of the conflicting actions are satisfactory. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study involving interactions among safety-critical features in an autonomous drone.
