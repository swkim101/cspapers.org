In this paper, we address the problem of finding cost-efficient three-dimensional paths that satisfy the maximum allowed curvature and the pitch angle of the vehicle. For any given initial and final configurations, the problem is decoupled into finding the horizontal and vertical parts of the path separately. Although the individual paths are modeled as two-dimensional Dubins curves using closed-form solutions, the final 3D path is constructed using the proposed local optimization to find a cost-efficient solution. Moreover, based on the decoupled approach, we provide a lower bound estimation of the optimal path that enables us to determine the quality of the found heuristic solution. The proposed solution has been evaluated using existing benchmark instances and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Based on the reported results and lower bounds, the proposed approach provides paths close to the optimal solution while the computational requirements are in hundreds of microseconds. Besides, the proposed method provides paths with fewer turns than others, which make them easier to be followed by the vehicleâ€™s controller.
