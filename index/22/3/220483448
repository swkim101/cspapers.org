Bipartite b-matching is fundamental in algorithm design, and has been widely applied into diverse applications, such as economic markets, labor markets, etc. These practical problems usually exhibit two distinct features: large-scale and dynamic, which requires the matching algorithm to be repeatedly executed at regular intervals. However, existing exact and approximate algorithms usually fail in such settings due to either requiring intolerable running time or too much computation resource. 

To address this issue, based on a key observation that the matching instances vary not too much, we propose NeuSearcher which leverage the knowledge learned from previously instances to solve new problem instances. Specifically, we design a multichannel graph neural network to predict the threshold of the matched edges, by which the search region could be significantly reduced. We further propose a parallel heuristic search algorithm to iteratively improve the solution quality until convergence. Experiments on both open and industrial datasets demonstrate that NeuSearcher can speed up 2 to 3 times while achieving exactly the same matching solution compared with the state-of-the-art approximation approaches.
