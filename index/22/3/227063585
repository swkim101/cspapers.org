This paper compares the performance of the different channel modeling methods in categories of GBSM designed for Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) standard. One of these channel models, the One-ring channel model (ORM) is proposed for 4G wideband mobile communication networks. The others, the Two-ring channel model (TRM) and the Elliptical channel model (ELM) is applied to mobile to mobile (M2M) communication. By using these channel simulators, we compared the properties of the spatial-temporal correlation functions in the same conditions. The simulation results show that the correlation functions of three channel models are overlapped without the changing the antenna elements of the transmitter. In other cases, the correlation functions of the three models are different, however, their minimum correlation values are similar. The simulation results also show that the system performance obtained by using these channel models are comparable in different correlation coefficients. By implementing the convolution code with code rate 2/3 to the physical layer and Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA) in MAC layer of Multiple Input Multiple Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multi Access (MIMO-OFDMA), we investigate the influence of spatial correlation characteristic to the number of active users in system using those channel simulators.
