Traditional IT projects have rolled out newly developed software or systems after iterating manual tests based on the scenarios and cases that are considered sufficient. However, due to the time and budget limitation of IT projects, these traditional tests almost always fail to include all the possible scenarios and cases of the real world. Thus, we cannot eliminate all potential defects before go-live and unexpected failures might occur as a result, which can lead to severe damage to both customers and IT project contractors. This paper demonstrates a real transaction-based automated testing approach named ‘PerfecTwin’ with several real-world examples. PerfecTwin overcomes the above limitations of the traditional testing by running the new and old systems side-by-side, automatically validating the new system against the old system's actual transactions, in real time, which can eliminate almost all potential defects before go-live.
