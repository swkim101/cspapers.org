In this work, we consider partition decoding to diminish the required memory of polar codes in 5G new radio. We show that the suitable design of partition decoding for downlink and uplink control channels may differ. Moreover, the partitioning technique can reduce the computation complexity of polar decoder by limiting the number of codewords passed between partitions. We then propose to use the parity bits of interleaved CRC codes to select the codewords passed between partitions. The parity bits can help the partition decoding of which the codewords are verified. The simulation results show that the parity bits can improve the performance of partition decoding of polar codes in the downlink control channel of 5G new radio.
