In this paper we perform an extensive experimental evaluation of three planar target based 3D-LIDAR camera calibration algorithms, on a sensor suite consisting multiple 3D-LIDARs and cameras, assessing their robustness to random initialization and by using metrics like Mean Line Re-projection Error (MLRE) and Factory Stereo Calibration Error. We briefly describe each method and provide insights into practical aspects like ease of data collection. We also show the effect of noisy sensor on the calibration result and conclude with a note on which calibration algorithm should be used under what circumstances.
