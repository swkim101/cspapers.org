Two-way relay-based power-line communication (PLC) has been used in many smart grid applications. It is necessary to model the channel characteristics of such system in order to design a reliable communication link between premises and data centre. The channel transfer function (CTF) is preferred to be found using the bottom-up approach, as it represents the true topology of the PLC network. In this paper, we model a bottom-up multipath channel model for single relay two-way PLC channel based on transmission and reflection coefficients. We also compare the proposed model with the ABCD method and the voltage ratio approach (VRA) method. We show that the multipath model can well represent the two-way relay-based PLC channel.
