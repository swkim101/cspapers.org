Although Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is being considered as a promising future networking technology, it has non-negligible security issues to be solved. Despite the necessity for overcoming the security issues, however, there is no well-organized references that contain what the security issues are. To promote and accelerate SDN security studies, we have recently constructed a public knowledge repository, called as SDNSecurity, which has systematized SDN security vulnerabilities with lots of useful resources (e.g., Animations, demo-vids, source codes and so forth) and proposed feasible research projects to handle the security issues. In this paper, we briefly introduce overall research projects and available resources as a knowledge repository.
