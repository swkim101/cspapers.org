We present SplitFusion, a novel dense RGB-D SLAM framework that simultaneously performs tracking and dense reconstruction for both rigid and non-rigid components of the scene. SplitFusion first adopts deep learning based semantic instant segmentation technique to split the scene into rigid or non-rigid surfaces. The split surfaces are independently tracked via rigid or non-rigid ICP and reconstructed through incremental depth map fusion. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can provide not only accurate environment maps but also well-reconstructed non-rigid targets, e.g., the moving humans.
