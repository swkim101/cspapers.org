In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the fashion analysis (e.g., clothing matching) due to the huge economic value of the fashion industry. The essential problem is to model the compatibility between the complementary fashion items, such as the top and bottom in clothing matching. The majority of existing work on fashion analysis has focused on measuring the item-item compatibility in a latent space with deep learning methods.

In this work, we aim to improve the compatibility modeling by sketching a compatible template for a given item as an auxiliary link between fashion items. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end Auxiliary Template-enhanced Generative Compatibility Modeling (AT-GCM) scheme, which introduces an auxiliary complementary template generation network equipped with the pixel-wise consistency and compatible template regularization. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.
