Deep generative models are commonly used for generating images and text. Interpretability of these models is one important pursuit, other than the generation quality. Variational auto-encoder (VAE) with Gaussian distribution as prior has been successfully applied in text generation, but it is hard to interpret the meaning of the latent variable. To enhance the controllability and interpretability, one can replace the Gaussian prior with a mixture of Gaussian distributions (GM-VAE), whose mixture components could be re-lated to hidden semantic aspects of data. In this paper, we generalize the practice and introduce DEM-VAE, a class of models for text generation using VAEs with a mixture distribution of exponential family. Unfortunately, a standard variational training algorithm fails due to the mode-collapse problem. We theoretically identify the root cause of the problem and propose an effective algorithm to train DEM-VAE. Our method penalizes the training with an extra dispersion term to induce a well-structured latent space. Experimental results show that our approach does obtain a meaningful space, and it outperforms strong baselines in text generation benchmarks.
