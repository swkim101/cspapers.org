This paper presents a study to investigate the effect of color on students’ task performance in use of ICT device. In color psychology, colors in surroundings can affect human emotional states and behavioral responses. In educational field, the effect on students’ emotions and performance in class has been discussed. The design of an environment through a variety of means such as lighting and colors can stimulate perceptual and emotional responses in students and affect their behavior. However, they did not discuss the methodology for quantitatively assessing student’s internal state. We therefore developed a multimodal sensing for understanding color effect on students’ task performance.
