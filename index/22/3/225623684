Realization of industry-scale, goal-driven, autonomous systems with AI planning technology faces several challenges: flexibly specifying planning goal states in varying situations, synthesizing plans in large state spaces, re-planning in dynamic situations, and facilitating humans to supervise, give feedback and intervene. In this paper, we present Intent-driven Strategic Tactical Planning (ISTP) to address these challenges. We demonstrate its efficacy through its application for radio base station inspection across several locations using drones. The inspection task involves capturing images, thermal images or signal measurements - called knowledge-objects - of various components of the base stations for downstream processing. In the ISTP approach, an operator indicates her goals by flying the drone to different components of interest. These goals are generalized to capture the intent of the operator, which are then instantiated in new situations to generate goals dynamically. Towards planning and re-planning in large state spaces to achieve these goals efficiently, we extend the Strategic-Tactical Planning paradigm. All the components of ISTP are integrated in an intuitive UI and demonstrated through a real life use-case built on the UNITY simulator platform.
