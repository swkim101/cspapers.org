Analogical transfer consists in leveraging a measure of similarity between two situations to predict the amount of similarity between their outcomes. Acquiring a suitable similarity measure for analogical transfer may be difficult, especially when the data is sparse or when the domain knowledge is incomplete. To alleviate this problem, this paper presents a dataset complexity measure that can be used either to select an optimal similarity measure, or if the similarity measure is given, to perform analogical transfer: among the potential outcomes of a new situation, the most plausible is the one which minimizes the dataset complexity.
