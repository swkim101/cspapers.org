The principal target of this study is to enhance the performance of the 4-level holographic data storage (HDS) systems by using a well-suited modulation code scheme. The HDS system is one of the most promising approaches for storing massive digital data for the next-generation optical data storage systems. However, the performance of retrieving data in the HDS system is severely affected by fatal interference (FI) patterns. The proposed coding design aims to get rid of all FI patterns during the recording procedure with reasonable computational complexity.
