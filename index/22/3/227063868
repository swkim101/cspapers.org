High data rates and low latencies will be indispensable in next generation communication devices. In order to achieve these targets, the use of wireless communication technology combined with photonics and optics is expected to have significant potential. In this paper, we present a key device for advanced fiber wireless and optical wireless communications. A new device integrated with a 100 GHz uni-travelling carrier photodetector and a 100 GHz pHEMT amplifier is introduced for high data rate fiber wireless communication applications operating at data rates above 20 Gbps. For optical wireless communication applications, another novel two-dimensional photodetector array (2D-PDA) device is introduced, and demonstrated for 100 Gbps high data rate communications using the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology in free-space.
