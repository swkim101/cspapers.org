At present, most of the smart systems are based on cloud computing, and massive data generated at the smart end device will need to be transferred to the cloud where AI models are deployed. Therefore, a big challenge for smart system engineers is that cloud based smart systems often face issues such as network congestion and high latency. In recent years, mobile edge computing (MEC) is becoming a promising solution which supports computation-intensive tasks such as deep learning through computation offloading to the servers located at the local network edge. To take full advantage of MEC, an effective collaboration between the end device and the edge server is essential. In this paper, as an initial investigation, we propose Edge4Sys, a Device-Edge Collaborative Framework for MEC based Smart System. Specifically, we employ the deep learning based user identification process in a MEC-based UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) delivery system as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework which can significantly reduce the network traffic and the response time.
