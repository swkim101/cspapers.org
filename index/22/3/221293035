Android unlock patterns are still commonly used, and roughly 25% of the respondents to our study use a pattern when unlocking their phone. Despite security issues, the design of the patterns have remained unchanged. We propose Double Patterns (DPatts), a natural advancement on Android unlock patterns that maintains the core design but instead of selecting a single pattern, a user selects two patterns entered one-after-the-other super-imposed on the same 3x3 grid. We evaluated DPatts for both security and usability through an online study (n = 634) with three treatments: a control a first pattern entry blocklist, and a blocklist for both patterns. We find that in all settings, user chosen DPatts are more secure than traditional patterns based on standard guessability metrics, more similar to that of 4-/6-digit PINs, and even more difficult to guess for a simulated attacker. Users express positive sentiments in qualitative feedback, particularly those who currently (or previously) used Android unlock patterns, and overall, participants found the DPatts interface quite usable, with high recall retention and comparable entry times to traditional patterns. In particular, current Android pattern users, the target population for DPatts, reported SUS scores in the 80th percentile and high perceptions of security and usability in responses to open- and closed-questions. Based on these findings, we would recommend adding DPatts as an advancement to Android patterns, much like allowing for added PIN length.
