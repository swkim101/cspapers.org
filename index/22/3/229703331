As a common IT infrastructure, APM (Application Performance Management) systems have been widely adopted to monitor call requests to an on-line service. Usually, each request may contain multi-dimensional attributes (e.g., City, ISP, Platform, etc.), which may become the reason for a certain anomaly regarding DSR (De-clining Success Rate) of service calls either solely or as a combination. Moreover, each attribute may also have multiple values (e.g., ISP could be T-Mobile, Vodafone, CMCC, etc.), rendering intricate root causes and huge challenges to identify the root causes. In this paper, we propose a prototype tool, ImpAPTr (Impact Analysis based on Pruning Tree), to identify the combination of dimensional attributes as the clues to dig out the root causes of anomalies regarding DSR of a service call in a timely manner. ImpAPTr has been evaluated in MeiTuan, one of the biggest on-line service providers. Performance regarding the accuracy outperforms several previous tools in the same field.
