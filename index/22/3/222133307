Understanding the capability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in learning the full spectrum of spatial frequencies, that is, beyond the low-frequency dominant spectrum of natural images, is critical for assessing the reliability of GAN-generated data in any detail-sensitive application. In this work, we show that the ability of convolutional GANs to learn an image distribution depends on the spatial frequency of the underlying carrier signal, that is, they have a bias against learning high spatial frequencies. Our findings are consistent with the recent observations of high-frequency artifacts in GAN-generated images, but further suggest that such artifacts are the consequence of an underlying bias. We also provide a theoretical explanation for this bias as the manifestation of linear dependencies present in the spectrum of filters of a typical generative Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, by proposing a proof-of-concept method that can effectively manipulate this bias towards other spatial frequencies, we show that the bias is not fixed and can be exploited to explicitly direct computational resources towards any specific spatial frequency of interest in a dataset, with minimal computational overhead.
