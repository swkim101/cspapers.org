neighborhoods of various sizes. Moreover, we show that our design incorporates larger neighborhoods compared to SGC thus coping better with oversmoothing. We explain that limiting over-dominance of the largest neighborhoods in the aggregation step is a desired approach to limit oversmoothing while preserving large context of each node. We also show that in spectral analysis that S 2 GC is a trade-off between the low-and high-pass ﬁlters which leads to capturing the global and local contexts of each node. Moreover, we show how S 2 GC and APPNP (Klicpera et al., 2019a) are related and explain why S 2 GC captures a range of neighborhoods better than APPNP. Our experimental results include node clustering, unsupervised and semi-supervised node classiﬁ-cation, node property prediction and supervised text classiﬁcation. We show that S 2 GC is highly competitive often signiﬁcantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods
