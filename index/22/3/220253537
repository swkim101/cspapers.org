Cloud providers are building infrastructure at unprecedented speeds building the foundation for global IT services and cost-effective containerized apps. Unfortunately the silicon technologies we have relied on for the past several decades leading to the exponential growth in IT have slowed down in scaling and will soon come to a halt, resulting in diminishing returns in digital platform scalability in the post-Moore era of computing. Meanwhile the basic architecture of a modern server blade still dates back to the CPU-centric desktop PC of the 80âĂŹs managing memory at hardware speeds but accessing the network, storage and now discrete accelerators through the OS, legacy software stacks and peripheral interfaces. This talk will make the case for a clean slate co-design of server software and hardware for the post-Moore era.
