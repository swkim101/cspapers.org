In this paper, we present a diabolo model that can be used for training agents in simulation to play diabolo, as well as running it on a real dual robot arm system. We first derive an analytical model of the diabolo-string system and compare its accuracy using data recorded via motion capture, which we release as a public dataset of skilled play with diabolos of different dynamics. We show that our model outperforms a deep-learning-based predictor, both in terms of precision and physically consistent behavior. Next, we describe a method based on optimal control to generate robot trajectories that produce the desired diabolo trajectory, as well as a system to transform higher-level actions into robot motions. Finally, we test our method on a real robot system playing the diabolo, and throw it to and catch it from a human player.
