We propose a novel and principled method to learn a nonparametric graph model called graphon, which is defined in an infinite-dimensional space and represents arbitrary-size graphs. 
Based on the weak regularity lemma from the theory of graphons, we leverage a step function to approximate a graphon. 
We show that the cut distance of graphons can be relaxed to the Gromov-Wasserstein distance of their step functions. 
Accordingly, given a set of graphs generated by an underlying graphon, we learn the corresponding step function as the Gromov-Wasserstein barycenter of the given graphs.
Furthermore, we develop several enhancements and extensions of the basic algorithm, e.g., the smoothed Gromov-Wasserstein barycenter for guaranteeing the continuity of the learned graphons and the mixed Gromov-Wasserstein barycenters for learning multiple structured graphons. 
The proposed approach overcomes drawbacks of prior state-of-the-art methods, and outperforms them on both synthetic and real-world data.
