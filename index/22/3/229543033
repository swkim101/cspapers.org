Multi-core real-time systems face the challenge of efficiently maintaining consistency of shared data despite concurrent operations. Existing synchronisation techniques ignore data locality, resulting in cache-related execution time overheads. This paper proposes Migration-Based Synchronisation (MBS), a transparent replacement for locks. In MBS, control flows are migrated to data, instead of moving data to control flows. The consequence is an improvement of data locality that reduces the worst-case execution time of critical sections, and indirectly, worst-case blocking bounds.
