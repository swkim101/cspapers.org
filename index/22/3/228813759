 Electrification can act as a catalyst in social progress. In some communities, grid connection is not possible. As such, microgrids are a viable alternative to provide access to electricity. Yet, progress can be impacted by challenges with insufficient energy supply. In such scenarios, it is important to understand the relationships between electricity supply and social development in managing available resources.
 We propose a framework to relate quality of life with power management, such that progress is not hindered when available energy is insufficient. In this paper, electrical loads for pumping water, powering streetlights, and powering household devices are examined. A compromise decision support problem (cDSP) is developed to balance the produced and consumed energy. We develop a set of power management options by exploring the solution space developed from performing the cDSP, anchored in quality of life. Organizations engaged in sustainable development can select the solution most appropriate for the community.
 A salient feature of the framework is the versatility. The formulation can be modified for different requirements, communities, and time periods. A test problem is used to illustrate the flexibility of the approach. This framework is constructed to support decision making for microgrid operation to continue to uplift communities.
