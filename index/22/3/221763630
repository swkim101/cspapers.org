This paper presents LinnOS, an operating system that leverages a light neural network for inferring SSD performance at a very ﬁne—per-IO—granularity and helps parallel storage applications achieve performance predictability. Lin-nOS supports black-box devices and real production traces without requiring any extra input from users, while outper-forming industrial mechanisms and other approaches. Our evaluation shows that, compared to hedging and heuristic-based methods, LinnOS improves the average I/O latencies by 11.9-66.4% with 87-97% inference accuracy and 4-6 µ s inference overhead for each I/O, demonstrating how to incorporate machine learning inside operating systems for real-time decision-making.
