Description logics are well-known logical formalisms for knowledge

representation. We propose to enrich knowledge bases (KBs) with dynamic

axioms that specify how the satisfaction of statements from the KBs

evolves when the interpretation is decomposed or recomposed, providing

a natural means to predict the evolution of interpretations.

Our dynamic axioms borrow logical connectives from separation logics,

well-known specification languages to verify programs with

dynamic data structures.

In the paper, we focus on ALC and EL augmented

with dynamic axioms, or to their subclass of positive dynamic axioms. 

The knowledge base consistency problem in the presence of dynamic axioms

is investigated, leading to interesting complexity results, among which

the problem for EL with positive dynamic axioms is tractable,

whereas EL with dynamic axioms is undecidable.
