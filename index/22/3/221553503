The ability to simulate and predict the outcome of contacts is paramount to the successful execution of many robotic tasks. Simulators are powerful tools for the design of robots and their behaviors, yet the discrepancy between their predictions and observed data limit their usability. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised approach to learning residual models for rigid-body simulators that exploits corrections of contact models to refine predictive performance and propagate uncertainty. We empirically evaluate the framework by predicting the outcomes of planar dice rolls and compare itâ€™s performance to state-of-the-art techniques.
