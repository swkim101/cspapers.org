Creating robots with emotional personalities will transform the usability of robots in the real-world. As previous emotive social robots are mostly based on statically stable robots whose mobility is limited, this paper develops an animation to real-world pipeline that enables dynamic bipedal robots that can twist, wiggle, and walk to behave with emotions. First, an animation method is introduced to design emotive motions for the virtual robotâ€™s character. Second, a dynamics optimizer is used to convert the animated motion to dynamically feasible motion. Third, real-time standing and walking controllers and an automaton are developed to bring the virtual character to life. This framework is deployed on a bipedal robot Cassie and validated in experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to present an animatronic dynamic legged robot that is able to perform motions with desired emotional attributes. We term robots that use dynamic motions to convey emotions as Dynamic Relatable Robotic Characters.
