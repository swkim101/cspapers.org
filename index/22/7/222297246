Coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) is an energy-efficient and processing-flexible parallel computing architecture. Efficiency of CGRA highly depends on how to map data dependencies using different CGRA resources. Previous works investigated different strategies for transferring data dependencies, using registers, processing elements (PEs) and memory. However, these works do not consider all those resources in CGRA and take a long time during compilation period. This paper proposes a Transfer-Aware Effective loop Mapping (TAEM) method for CGRA, which can efficiently utilize all those heterogeneous resources on CGRA and significantly accelerate the compilation time. Experimental results show that TAEM is able to reduce the compilation time by 11.1x over the state-of-the-art technique RAMP, while keeping the same or better performance of loop mapping results.
