To support the decision-making process in various industrial applications, many companies use knowledge management and Information Retrieval (IR). In an industrial setting, knowledge is extracted from data that is often stored in a semi-structured or unstructured format. As a result, Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have been applied to a number of IR steps. Inthiswork, weexplorehowNLPandparticularlytopicmodellingcanbeusedtoimprovetherelevanceofsparepartretrieval in the context of maintenance services. A proposed methodology extracts topics from short maintenance service reports that also include part replacement data. An intuition behind the proposed methodology is that every topic should represent a specific root cause. Experimental were conducted for an ad-hoc retrieval system of service case descriptions and spare parts. The results have shown that our modification improves a baseline system thus boosting the performance of maintenance service solution recommendation.
