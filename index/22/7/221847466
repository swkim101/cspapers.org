In this paper, a slip-limiting controller for redundant line-suspended robots is presented. This kind of robot is usually equipped with v-shaped wheels, which brings uncertainty about the effective wheel radius, particularly when crossing obstacles. The proposed algorithm is able to estimate and limit wheel slippage in the presence of such uncertainty, relying only on wheel angular velocity measurements. Slip limitation occurs in the control allocation algorithm and hence is decoupled from the high-level velocity controller, allowing a broad applicability in centralized control approaches. Experimental results on Line Ranger show that it effectively reduces wheel slippage compared to traditional centralized control while being more energy efficient than traditional decentralized control approaches.
