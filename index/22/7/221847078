This paper presents a study that evaluates the effects on the walking pattern of a full-sized humanoid robot as it pushes different carts. Furthermore, it discuss a modified Zero Moment Point (ZMP) pattern based on a capture point method, and a friction compensation method for the arms. Humanoid researchers have demonstrated that robots can perform a wide range of tasks including handling tools, climbing ladders, and patrolling rough terrain. However, when it comes to handling objects while walking, humanoids are relatively limited; it becomes more apparent when humanoids have to push a cart. Many challenges become evident under such circumstances; for example, the walking pattern will be severely affected by the external force opposed by the cart. Therefore, an appropriate walking pattern dynamic model and arm compliance are needed to mitigate external forces. This becomes crucial in order to ensure the robotâ€™s self-balance and minimize external disturbances.
