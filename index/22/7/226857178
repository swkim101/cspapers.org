User interface research in HCI mostly aims to minimize interaction friction for effective user interface design. To promote digital wellbeing, however, we argue that increasing interaction friction or even blocking user interaction would be beneficial. We propose an interaction restraint framework that generalizes existing restrictive user interaction design for selfregulating digital devices. We discuss design dimensions and related design concepts. Furthermore, we review several recent systems and suggest several research directions and challenges.
