 Reducing the weight of structures remains a major challenge in the aviation industry in order to reduce fuel consumption. The stiffened panel is the main assembly method for primary structures in aircraft, e.g. fuselage or wing.
 Density-based topology optimization has been used in research and in industry as a tool to help create new stiffening patterns for aircraft components, such as ribs, spars, bulkheads or even floor design.
 One critical aspect of stiffened panel design for wing structures is the buckling resistance. However, most work found in the literature does not include buckling analysis during optimization which leads to sub-optimal results when the stiffening layout is validated for buckling.
 Including buckling as a constraint for the density-based topology optimization has proven to be a complex task, mainly caused by the fact that the buckling of the stiffeners is not captured accurately. As such, this work presents an optimization method for stiffened panels based on the ground structure approach usually used for truss topology optimization. The main novelty of the method is the use of a stiffener activation variable (SAV) to activate only one variable at a time, either the height or density variable associated with each stiffeners of the ground structure.
 This work shows that while ground structure topology optimization requires more setup time and limiting the degrees of freedom of the optimization, it finds the best stiffening layout efficiently when compared to the density method.
