The current implementation of automated mobile apps testing generally relies on internal program information, such as reading code or GUI layout files, capturing event streams. This paper proposes an approach of automated mobile apps testing from a completely visual perspective. It uses computer vision technology to enable computer to judge the internal functions from the external GUI information of mobile apps as we humans do and generates test strategy for execution, which improves the interactivity, flexibility, and authenticity of testing. We believe that this vision-based testing approach will further help alleviate the contradiction between the current huge test requirements of mobile apps and the relatively lack of testers.
