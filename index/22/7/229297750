We study the problem of understanding hand-object interactions from 2D images in the wild. This requires reconstructing both the hand and the object in 3D, which is challenging because of the mutual occlusion between the hand and the object. In this paper we make two main contributions: (1) a novel reconstruction technique, RHO (Reconstructing Hands and Objects), which reconstructs 3D models of both the hand and the object leveraging the 2D image cues and 3D contact priors; (2) a dataset MOW (Manipulating Objects in the Wild) of 500 examples of hand-object interaction images that have been "3Dfied" with the help of the RHO technique. Overall our dataset contains 121 distinct object categories, with a much greater diversity of manipulation actions, than in previous datasets.
