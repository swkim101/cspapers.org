This paper presents a novel control strategy to herd a group of non-cooperative evaders by means of a team of robotic herders. In herding problems, the motion of the evaders is typically determined by strong nonlinear reactive dynamics, escaping from the herders. Many applications demand the herding of numerous and/or heterogeneous entities, making the development of flexible control solutions challenging. In this context, our main contribution is a control approach that finds suitable herding actions even when the nonlinearities in the evadersâ€™ dynamics yield to implicit equations. We resort to numerical analysis theory to characterise the existence conditions of such actions and propose two design methods to compute them, one transforming the continuous time implicit system into an expanded explicit system, and the other applying a numerical method to find the action in discrete time. Simulations and real experiments validate the proposal in different scenarios.
