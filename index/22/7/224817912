This short paper proposes a framework for designing search-centric learning systems that support search as learning. Our argument draws on Jacksonâ€™s purpose-centric design concepts for software, and from research on self-regulated learning, an established paradigm that intersects psychology, education, and learning sciences. In introducing these ideas we also examine searching for information as self-regulating activity and the design of experimental learning systems that support self-regulation. We argue that embedding search functionality within learning systems holds promise for better supporting students engaged in self-regulated learning.
