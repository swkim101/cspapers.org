Brain-inspired computing aims to understand the cognitive mechanisms of a brain and apply them to advance various areas in computer science. Deep learning is an example to greatly improve the field of pattern recognition and classification by utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN). To exploit advanced mechanisms of a brain and thus make more great advances, researchers need a methodology that can simulate neural networks with higher computational capabilities such as advanced spiking neural networks (SNNs) with two-stage neurons and synaptic delays. However, existing SNN simulation methodologies are too slow and energy-inefficient due to their software-based simulation or hardware-based but time-driven execution mechanisms. In this paper, we present NeuroEngine, a fast and energy-efficient hardware-based system to efficiently simulate advanced SNNs. The key idea is to design an accelerator to enable event-driven simulations of the SNNs at a minimum cost. NeuroEngine achieves high speed and energy efficiency by carefully architecting its datapath and memory units to take the best advantage of the event-driven mechanism while satisfying all the important requirements to simulate our target SNNs. For high performance and energy efficiency, NeuroEngine applies a simpler datapath, multi-queue scheduler, and lazy update to minimize its neuron computation and event scheduling overhead. Then, we build an end-to-end simulation system by implementing a programming interface and a compilation toolchain for NeuroEngine hardware. Our evaluations show that NeuroEngine greatly improves the harmonic mean performance and energy efficiency by 4.30× and 2.60×, respectively, over the state-of-the-art time-driven simulator.
