Social media has become an essential platform and source for most mainstream news channels, and many works have been dedicated to analyzing and understanding user experience and engagement with the online news on social media in general, and on YouTube in particular. In this study, we investigate the correlation of diﬀerent toxic behaviors such as identity hate, and obscenity with diﬀer-ent news topics. To do that, we collected a large-scale dataset of approximately 7.3 million comments and more than 10,000 news video captions, utilized deep learning-based techniques to construct an ensemble of clas-siﬁers tested on a manually-labeled dataset for label prediction, achieved high accuracy, uncovered a large number of toxic comments on news videos across 15 topics obtained us-ing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) over the captions of the news videos. Our analysis shows that religion and crime-related news have the highest rate of toxic comments, while economy-related news has the lowest rate. We highlight the necessity of eﬀective tools to address topic-driven toxicity impacting interactions and public discourse on the platform.
