We report work in progress for visualizing and quantifying learning during search. Users initiate a search session with a Pre-Search Knowledge state. During search, they undergo a change in knowledge. Upon conclusion, users attain a PostSearch Knowledge state. We attempt to measure this dynamic knowledge-change from a stationary reference point: Expert Knowledge on the search topic Using word-embeddings of searchersâ€™ written summaries, we show that w.r.t. Expert Knowledge, there is observable and quantifiable difference between the Pre-Search knowledge (Pre-Exp distance) and Post-Search knowledge (Post-Exp distance).
