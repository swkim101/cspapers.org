Attaining prototypical features to represent class distributions is well established in representation learning. However, learning prototypes online from streaming data proves a challenging endeavor as they rapidly become outdated, caused by an ever-changing parameter space during the learning process. Additionally, continual learning does not assume the data stream to be stationary, typically resulting in catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. As a first, we introduce a system addressing both problems, where prototypes evolve continually in a shared latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point in time. To facilitate learning, a novel objective function synchronizes the latent space with the continually evolving prototypes. In contrast to the major body of work in continual learning, data streams are processed in an online fashion without task information and can be highly imbalanced, for which we propose an efficient memory scheme. As an additional contribution, we propose the learner-evaluator framework that i) generalizes existing paradigms in continual learning, ii) introduces data incremental learning, and iii) models the bridge between continual learning and concept drift. We obtain state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin on eight benchmarks, including three highly imbalanced data streams. Code is publicly available. 1
