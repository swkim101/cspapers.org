Existing neural network based one-class learning methods mainly use various forms of auto-encoders or GAN style adversarial training to learn a latent representation of the given one class of data. This paper proposes an entirely different approach based on a novel regularization, called holistic regularization (or H-regularization ), which enables the system to consider the data holistically, not to produce a model that biases towards some features. Combined with a proposed 2-norm instance-level data normalization , we obtain an effective one-class learning method, called HRN. To our knowledge, the proposed regularization and the normalization method have not been reported before. Experimental evaluation using both benchmark image classiÔ¨Åcation and traditional anomaly detection datasets show that HRN markedly outperforms the state-of-the-art existing deep/non-deep learning models. The code of HRN can be found here 3 .
