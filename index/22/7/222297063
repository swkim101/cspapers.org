The wavelength-routed optical network-on-chip (WRONoC) is a promising solution for signal transmission in modern system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Previous works do not handle three main issues for WRONoCs: correlations between the topological structure and physical layout, trade-offs between the maximum insertion loss and wavelength power, and a fully automated flow to generate predictable designs. As a result, the insertion loss estimation is inaccurate, and thus only suboptimal results are obtained. To remedy these disadvantages, we present a fully automated topological structure and physical layout codesign flow to minimize the maximum insertion loss and the wavelength power simultaneously with a significant speedup. Experimental results show that our codesign flow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art works in the maximum insertion loss, wavelength power, and runtimes.
