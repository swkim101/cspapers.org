To generate assembly sequences that robots can easily handle, this study tackled assembly sequence generation (ASG) by considering two tradeoff objectives: (1) insertion conditions and (2) degrees of the constraints affecting the assembled parts. We propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm to balance these two objectives. Furthermore, we extend our previously proposed 3D computer-aided design (CAD)-based method for extracting three types of two-part relationship matrices from 3D models that include deformable parts. The interference between deformable and other parts can be determined using scaled part shapes. Our proposed ASG can produce Pareto-optimal sequences for multi-component models with deformable parts such as rubber bands, rubber belts, and roller chains. We further discuss the limitation and applicability of the generated sequences to robotic assembly.
