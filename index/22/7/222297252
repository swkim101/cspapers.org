In this paper, we introduce a fast and efficient critical path generation algorithm considering extensive path constraints on a Static Timing Analysis (STA) graph. Critical path generation is a key routine in the inner loop of path-based analysis and timing-driven synthesis flows. Our algorithm can report arbitrary numbers of critical paths on a logic cone constrained by a sequence of from/through/to pins under different min/max modes and rise/fall transitions. Our algorithm is general, efficient, and provably good. Experimental results have showed that our algorithm produces reports that matches a golden reference generated by an industrial signoff timer. Our results also correlate to a commercial timer yet achieving more than an order of magnitude speed-up.
