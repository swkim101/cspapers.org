Inference and learning in linear dynamical systems have long been studied in signal processing, machine learning, and system theory for tracking, localization, and control. In the linear Gaussian case, closed form solutions to inference and learning, also called system identification, are known as the Kalman Filter. For nonlinear dynamical systems (NLDSs), inference and system identification typically require approximations, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).
