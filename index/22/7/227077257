This paper provides analysis of the Adaptive Mixed Criticality (AMC) scheduling scheme for mixed-criticality systems that include tasks with arbitrary deadlines and semi-clairvoyant behavior. An arbitrary deadline task is one that can have a deadline that may be greater than its period. A semi-clairvoyant task is one that upon arrival of each job, reveals which of its two WCET parameters will be respected. This enables an earlier switch to be made from the normal mode of operation to the abnormal mode. The previously published schedulability test AMC-max is modified to cater for both of these extensions. Evaluation shows that there is a significant improvement in schedulability for semi-clairvoyant tasks over non-clairvoyant, and for arbitrary-deadline tasks over considering those deadlines as being constrained by the taskâ€™s period.
