This year, Wikimedia starts to build a new platform for the collaborative acquisition and maintenance of structured data: Wikidata. Wikidata's prime purpose is to be used within the other Wikimedia projects, like Wikipedia, to provide well-maintained, high-quality data. The nature and requirements of the Wikimedia projects require to develop a few novel, or at least unusual features for Wikidata: Wikidata will be a secondary database, i.e. instead of containing facts it will contain references for facts. It will be fully internationalized. It will contain inconsistent and contradictory facts, in order to represent the diversity of knowledge about a given entity.
