While the Linux memory reclaim scheme is designed to deliver high throughput in server workloads, the scheme becomes inefﬁcient on mobile device workloads. Through care-fully designed experiments, this paper shows that the current memory reclaim scheme cannot deliver its desired performance due to two key reasons: page re-fault, which occurs when an evicted page is demanded again soon after, and direct reclaim, which occurs when the system needs to free up pages upon request time. Unlike the server workload where the direct reclaim happens infrequently, multiple direct re-claims can happen in many common Android use cases. We provide further analysis that identiﬁes the major sources of the high number of page re-faults and direct reclaims and pro-pose Acclaim, a foreground aware and size-sensitive reclaim scheme. Acclaim consists of two parts: foreground aware evic-tion (FAE) and lightweight prediction-based reclaim scheme (LWP). FAE is used to relocate free pages from background applications to foreground applications. While LWP dynamically tunes the size and the amount of background reclaims according to the predicted allocation workloads. Experimental results show Acclaim can signiﬁcantly reduce the number of page re-faults and direct reclaims with low overheads and delivers better user experiences for mobile devices.
