Controlling and manning robots from a remote location is difficult because of the limitations one faces in perception and available degrees of actuation. Although humans can become skilled teleoperators, the amount of training time required to acquire such skills is typically very high. In this paper, we propose a novel solution (named Autocomplete) to aid novice teleoperators in manning robots adroitly. At the input side, Autocomplete relies on machine learning to detect and categorize human inputs as one from a group of motion primitives. Once a desired motion is recognized, at the actuation side an automated command replaces the human input in performing the desired action. So far, Autocomplete can recognize and synthesize lines, arcs, full circles, 3-D helices, and sine trajectories. Autocomplete was tested in simulation on the teleoperation of an unmanned aerial vehicle, and results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed solution versus manual steering.
