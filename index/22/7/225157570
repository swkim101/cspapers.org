A fault-tolerant control problem of an electrical power supply grid for rail transport systems is addressed. Timed automata with guards models are used to solve this control issue. In this study, we have considered four types of faults, that are actuators and sensors faults, plant defects and controller faults that may appear on the electrical grid. The principle of the approach consists to build of a set of trajectories from which an appropriate trajectory will be chosen at the occurrence of a fault in view of reaching the state desired by the designer of the system. This method considers time constraints with guards and generally these guards condition the appearance of faults in systems.
