This paper presents the design of a new soft pneumatic actuator whose direction and magnitude of bending may be precisely controlled via activation of different shape memory alloy (SMA) springs within the actuator, in conjunction with pneumatic actuation. This design is inspired by examples seen in nature such as the human tongue, where the combination of hydrostatic pressure and contraction of intrinsic muscle groups enables precise maneuverability and morphing capabilities. Here, SMA springs are embedded in the walls of the actuator, serving as intrinsic muscles that may be selectively activated to constrain the device. The pneumatic SMA (PneuSMA) actuator demonstrates remarkable spatial controllability evidenced by testing under different pressures and SMA activation combinations. A baseline finite element model is also developed to predict the actuator deformation under different pressure and activation conditions.
