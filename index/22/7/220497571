Crowdsourced testing provides an effective way to deal with the problem of Android system fragmentation, as well as the application scenario diversity faced by Android testing. The generation of test requirements is a significant part of crowdsourced testing. However, manually generating crowdsourced testing requirements is tedious, which requires the issuers to have the domain knowledge of the Android application under test. To solve these problems, we have developed a tool named KARA, short for Knowledge Graph Aided Crowdsourced Requirements Generation for Android Testing. KARA first analyzes the result of automatic testing on the Android application, through which the operation sequences can be obtained. Then, the knowledge graph of the target application is constructed in a manner of pay-as-you-go. Finally, KARA utilizes knowledge graph and the automatic testing result to generate crowdsourced testing requirements with domain knowledge. Experiments prove that the test requirements generated by KARA are well understandable, and KARA can improve the quality of crowdsourced testing.
