We present a toolehain based on Docker and KubeEdge that enables containerization and orchestration of ROS-based robotic SW applications on heterogeneous and hierarchical HW architectures. The toolehain allows for verification of functional and real-time constraints through HW-in-the-loop simulation, and for automatic mapping exploration of the SW across Cloud-Server-Edge architectures. We present the results obtained for the deployment of a real case of study composed by an ORB-SLAM application combined to local/global planners with obstacle avoidance for a mobile robot navigation.
