As the feature sizes keep shrinking, interconnect delays have become a major limiting factor for FPGA timing closure. Traditional placement algorithms that address wirelength alone are no longer sufficient to close timing, especially for the large-scale heterogeneous FPGAs. In this paper, we resolve the crucial FPGA placement problem by optimizing wirelength and timing simultaneously. First, a smoothed routing-architecture-aware timing model is proposed to accurately estimate each interconnect delay. Then, a timing-driven delay look-up table is constructed to further speed up delay access. Finally, we present an effective wirelength and timing co-optimization strategy to produce high-quality placements without timing violations. Compared with Vivado 2019.1 on Xilinx benchmark suites for xc7k325t device, experimental results show that our algorithm achieves not only a 6.6% improvement in worst slack but also a 3.2% reduction for routed wirelength.
