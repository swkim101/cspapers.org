Safely generating impacts with robots is challenging due to subsequent discontinuous velocity and high impact forces. We aim at increasing the impact velocity – the robot’s relative speed prior to contact – such that impact-tasks like grabbing and boxing are made with the highest allowable speed performance when needed. Previous works addressed this problem for rigid bodies’ impacts. This letter proposes a control paradigm for generating intentional impacts with deformable contacts that incorporates hardware and task constraints. Based on data-driven learning of the shock-absorbing soft dynamics and a novel mapping of joint-space limits to contact-space, we devise a constrained model-predictive control to maximize the intentional impact within a feasible, robot-safe level. Our approach is assessed with real-robot experiments on the redundant Panda manipulator, demonstrating high pre-impact velocities (up to 0.9 m/s) of a rigid end-effector on soft objects and an end-effector soft suction-pump on rigid or deformable objects.
