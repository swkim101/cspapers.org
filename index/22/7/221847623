This paper introduces a 2-DOF spatial remote center of motion (RCM) tensegrity mechanism, based on a double parallelogram system, dedicated for percutaneous needle insertion. The originality of this mechanism is its ability to be reconfigured and its capacity to perform a decoupled modulation of its stiffness in an asynchronous way. To do so, an analytical stiffness model of the robot is established, and a control methodology is proposed. A prototype of the robot is developed and assessed experimentally. The position tracking is evaluated using a 6-DOF magnetic tracker sensor showing a root mean square error less than 0.8Â° in both directions of the needle guide.
