Unlike robots, humans do not have constant movements. Their pathways are individually changeable and influenced by circumstances. This paper presents a method to investigate human pathway variations in a real study. In systematically selected tasks, human pathways are examined for 100 participants in manual and human-robot collaboration (HRC) scenarios. As a result, the variations of pathways are presented depending on various features: e.g. in nearly all cases the variance of womenâ€™s walking pathways is smaller than that of men. VariPath database can be used in any planning process of manual or HRC scenarios to ensure safety and efficiency.
