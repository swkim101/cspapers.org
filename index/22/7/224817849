Journalism is under pressure from loss of advertisement and revenues, while experiencing an increase in digital consumption and user demands for quality journalism and trusted sources. Journalistic Knowledge Platforms (JKPs) are an emerging generation of platforms which combine state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as knowledge graphs, linked open data (LOD), and natural-language processing (NLP) for transforming newsrooms and leveraging information technologies to increase the quality and lower the cost of news production. In order to drive research and design better JKPs that allow journalists to get most benefits out of them, we need to understand what challenges and opportunities JKPs are facing. This paperpresentsan overviewofthe mainchallengesand opportunitiesinvolved inJKPswhich havebeenmanually extracted from literature with the support of natural language processing and understanding techniques. These challenges and opportunities are organised in: stakeholders, information, functionalities, components, techniques and other aspects.
