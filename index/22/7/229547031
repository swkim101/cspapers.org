Mobile devices can sense different types of radio signals. For example, broadcast signals. These broadcasted signals allow the device to establish a connection to the access point broadcasting it. Moreover, mobile devices can record different physical layer measurements. These measurements are an indication of the service quality at the point they were collected. These measurements data can be aggregated to form physical layer measurement maps. These maps are useful for several applications such as location fixing, navigation, access control, and evaluating network coverage and performance. In this paper, we propose a method to build physical layer measurements maps by crowdsourcing physical layer measurements, GPS locations, from participating mobile devices. The proposed system gives different weights to each data point provided by the participating devices based on the data source's trustworthiness. Our tests showed that the different models of mobile devices return GPS location with different location accuracies. Consequently, when building the RSS maps our algorithm assigns a higher weight to data points coming from devices with higher GPS location accuracy. This allows accommodating a wide range of mobile devices with different capabilities in crowdsourcing applications. Crowdsourcing; physical layer Measurments; Maps; GPS
