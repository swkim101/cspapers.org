We show how to transform any interactive proof system which is statistical zero-knowledge with respect to the honest-verifier, into a proof system which is statistical zero-knowledgewith respect to any verifier. This is done by limiting the behavior of potentially cheating verifiers, without using computational assumptions or even referring to the complexity of such verifier strategies. (Previous transformations have either relied on computational assumptions or were applicable only to constant-round public-coin proof systems.) Our transformation also applies to public-coin (aka Arthur-Merlin) computational zero-knowledge proofs: We transform any ArthurMerlin proof system which is computational zero-knowledge with respect to the honest-verifier, into an Arthur-Merlin proof system which is computational zero-knowledge with respect to any probabilistic polynomial-time verifier. A crucial ingredient in our analysis is a new lemma regarding 2-universal hashing functions.
