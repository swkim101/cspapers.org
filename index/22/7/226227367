This paper computes a distance between tasks modeled as joint distributions on data and labels. We develop a stochastic process that transports the marginal on the data of the source task to that of the target task, and simultaneously updates the weights of a classifier initialized on the source task to track this evolving data distribution. The distance between two tasks is defined to be the shortest path on the Riemannian manifold of the conditional distribution of labels given data as the weights evolve. We derive connections of this distance with Rademacher complexity-based generalization bounds; distance between tasks computed using our method can be interpreted as the trajectory in weight space that keeps the generalization gap constant as the task distribution changes from the source to the target. Experiments on image classification datasets show that this task distance helps predict the performance of transfer learning: fine-tuning techniques have an easier time transferring to tasks that are close to each other under our distance.
