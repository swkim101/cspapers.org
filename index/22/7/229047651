 In product design, it is essential to understand customers’ preferences for product features. Traditional methods including the survey and interview are time-consuming and costly. As an alternative, research on utilizing online data for user analysis has been actively conducted. Although various methods have been proposed in this domain, most of them focus on the main features or usages of the product. However, from the manufacturer’s perspective, sub-features are as crucial as main features or usages, because the preference for sub-features is necessary for component configuration in actual product development. As the first step to solve this problem, this paper proposes a methodology to extract and cluster sub-features by incorporating phrase embedding into the previous word embedding. Also, the presented methodology increases the accuracy and diversity of the clustering result by using X-means clustering as a noise filter and adopting spectral clustering.
