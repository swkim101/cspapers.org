We provide more sample-efficient versions of some basic routines in quantum data analysis, along with simpler proofs. Particularly, we give a quantum ”Threshold Search” algorithm that requires only O((log2 m)/є2) samples of a d-dimensional state ρ. That is, given observables 0 ≤ A1, A2, …, Am ≤ 1 such that (ρ Ai) ≥ 1/2 for at least one i, the algorithm finds j with (ρ Aj) ≥ 1/2−є. As a consequence, we obtain a Shadow Tomography algorithm requiring only O((log2 m)(logd)/є4) samples, which simultaneously achieves the best known dependence on each parameter m, d, є. This yields the same sample complexity for quantum Hypothesis Selection among m states; we also give an alternative Hypothesis Selection method using O((log3 m)/є2) samples.
