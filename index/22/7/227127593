We study the problem of concept induction in visual reasoning, i.e., identifying concepts and their hierarchical relationships from question-answer pairs associated with images; and achieve an interpretable model via working on the induced symbolic concept space. To this end, we first design a new framework named object-centric compositional attention model (OCCAM) to perform the visual reasoning task with object-level visual features. Then, we come up with a method to induce concepts of objects and relations using clues from the attention patterns between objectsâ€™ visual features and question words. Finally, we achieve a higher level of interpretability by imposing OCCAM on the objects represented in the induced symbolic concept space. Experiments on the CLEVR and GQA datasets demonstrate: 1) our OCCAM achieves a new state of the art without human-annotated functional programs; 2) our induced concepts are both accurate and sufficient as OCCAM achieves an on-par performance on objects represented either in visual features or in the induced symbolic concept space.
