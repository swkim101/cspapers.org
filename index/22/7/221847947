Pose estimation is of paramount importance for flight control as well as localization and navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to enable autonomous operations. In environments without GPS, such estimation can only be determined using onboard sensors; optical flow using a monocular camera is a popular approach. Monocopters are a class of nature inspired UAVs known as free rotors where their design and flight dynamics are inspired by the falling samara seed. With a constantly rotating body frame, free rotors introduces some unique challenges for visual perception required during optical flow sensing. This paper addresses these problems with the introduction of SHIFT (Selective Heading Image for Translation) that selects optimal images for determining translation with optical flow. It achieves this by decoupling rotation vectors about the optical axis from translation vectors in a flow field through the separate tracking of orientation and position using an Unscented Kalman Filter with phase correlation in the log-polar and spatial domain. The experiments show that SHIFTâ€™s estimation in orientation is stable even under sinusoidal excitation with a median absolute percentage errors of less than 1 %. It is able to track position and orientation of a UAV accurately.
