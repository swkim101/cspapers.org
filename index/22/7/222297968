During the last few years Symbolic Computer Algebra (SCA) delivered excellent results in the verification of large integer and finite field multipliers at the gate level. In contrast to those encouraging advances, SCA-based divider verification has been still in its infancy and awaited a major breakthrough. In this paper we analyze the fundamental reasons that prevented the success for SCA-based divider verification so far and present SAT Based Information Forwarding (SBIF). SBIF enhances SCA-based backward rewriting by information propagation in the opposite direction. We successfully apply the method to the fully automatic formal verification of large non-restoring dividers.
