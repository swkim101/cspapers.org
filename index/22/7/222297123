This paper introduces the first problem formulation in the literature for automatic MOM capacitor cell generation with adaptive capacitance. Given an expected capacitance value and available metal layers, the proposed capacitor cell generation method can produce a compact MOM capacitor cell with minimized area and matched capacitance. Compared with MOM capacitor cells with non-adaptive capacitance in the previous work, the experimental results show that the proposed adaptive MOM capacitor cell generation method can reduce 25% chip area and 20% power consumption of the capacitor network in successive-approximation-register analog-to-digital converters (SAR ADC).
