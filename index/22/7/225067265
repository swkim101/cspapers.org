We study the sample complexity of private synthetic data generation over an unbounded sized class of statistical queries, and show that any class that is privately proper PAC learnable admits a private synthetic data generator (perhaps non-efﬁcient). Previous work on synthetic data generators focused on the case that the query class D is ﬁnite and obtained sample complexity bounds that scale logarithmically with the size |D| . Here we construct a private synthetic data generator whose sample complexity is independent of the domain size
