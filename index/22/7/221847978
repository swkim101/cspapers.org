For safe human-robot interaction, various type of flexible manipulators have been developed. Especially series elastic actuator (SEA) based manipulators have been getting huge attention since the elastic element of SEA prevents people from injury when undesirable collision happens. Moreover, it improves system durability by absorbing impact force, which could damage actuators. However, the elastic element inside SEA manipulator causes low system bandwidth which limits the speed performance of conventional impedance control approaches. To alleviate the low bandwidth issue of impedance controlled SEA while guaranteeing system stability, we implement Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA) and Successive Stiffness Increment (SSI) approach, which was invented in haptic and teleoperation domain. Impedance controlled SEA is reformulated as a two-port electrical circuit network for implementing TDPA. In addition, a pair of input and output power conjugate variable, dominating the system passivity is identified for implementing SSI approach. Experimental results showed that TDPA and SSI approach can render the stiffness of the impedance controller, which decides the bandwidth, upto 350 kN/m without any stability issue, while normal impedance controller only render upto 120 kN/m. Although both of the approaches significantly increased the bandwidth of the impedance controlled SEA, TDPA slightly outperformed in stability, and SSI outperformed in tracking.
