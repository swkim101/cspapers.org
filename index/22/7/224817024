We present the concept of an intelligent tutoring system which combines web search for learning purposes and state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. Our concept is described for the case of teaching information literacy, but has the potential to be applied to other courses or for independent acquisition of knowledge through web search. The concept supports both, students and teachers. Furthermore, the approach integrates issues like AI explainability, privacy of student information, assessment of the quality of retrieved information and automatic grading of student performance.
