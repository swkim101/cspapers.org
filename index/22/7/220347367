LiDAR is playing a more and more essential role in autonomous driving vehicles for objection detection, self localization and mapping. A single LiDAR frequently suffers from hardware failure (e.g., temporary loss of connection) due to the harsh vehicle environment (e.g., temperature, vibration, etc.), or performance degradation due to the lack of sufficient geometry features, especially for solid-state LiDARs with small field of view (FoV). To improve the system robustness and performance in self-localization and mapping, we develop a decentralized framework for simultaneous calibration, localization and mapping with multiple LiDARs. Our proposed framework is based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF), but is specially formulated for decentralized implementation. Such an implementation could potentially distribute the intensive computation among smaller computing devices or resources dedicated for each LiDAR and remove the single point of failure problem. Then this decentralized formulation is implemented on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) carrying 5 low-cost LiDARs and moving at 1.3m/s in urban environments. Experiment results show that the proposed method can successfully and simultaneously estimate the vehicle state (i.e., pose and velocity) and all LiDAR extrinsic parameters. The localization accuracy is up to 0.2% on the two datasets we collected. To share our findings and to make contributions to the community, meanwhile enable the readers to verify our work, we will release all our source codes1 and hardware design blueprint2 on our Github.
