Transient sensitivity is useful for analyzing the gradients of objective functions with respect to given parameters. This is useful in variation and circuit optimization. The computational complexity for traditional transient sensitivity analysis for objective function with N time points is O(N2), which is too expensive for large N. In this paper we propose a transient sensitivity analysis method that reduces the computational complexity to O(N), enabling the analysis of performance metrices related to thousands of time points, such as SNDR, THD, SFDR, and etc.
