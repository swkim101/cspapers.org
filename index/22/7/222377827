Calibration of sensors is fundamental to robust performance for intelligent vehicles. In natural environments, disturbances can easily challenge calibration. One possibility is to use natural objects of known shape to recalibrate sensors. An approach based on recognition of traffic signs, such as stop signs, and use of them for recalibration of cameras is presented. The approach is based on detection, geometry estimation, calibration, and recursive updating. Results from natural environments are presented that clearly show convergence and improved performance.
