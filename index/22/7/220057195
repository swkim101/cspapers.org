We show SUGILITE, an intelligent task automation agent that can learn new tasks and relevant associated concepts interactively from the userâ€™s natural language instructions and demonstrations, using the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of third-party mobile apps. This system provides several interesting features: (1) it allows users to teach new task procedures and concepts through verbal instructions together with demonstration of the steps of a script using GUIs; (2) it supports users in clarifying their intents for demonstrated actions using GUI-grounded verbal instructions; (3) it infers parameters of tasks and their possible values in utterances using the hierarchical structures of the underlying app GUIs; and (4) it generalizes taught concepts to different contexts and task domains. We describe the architecture of the SUGILITE system, explain the design and implementation of its key features, and show a prototype in the form of a conversational assistant on Android.
