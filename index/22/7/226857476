In this position paper, I present a set of data-driven techniques in modeling the learning material, learner workflow and the learning task as graphical representations, with which at scale can create and support learning opportunities in the wild. I propose the graphical models resulting from this bottom-up approach can further serve as proxies for representing learnability bounds of an interface. I also propose an alternative approach which directly aims to “learn” the interaction bounds by modeling the interface as an agent’s sequential decision making problem. Then I illustrate how the data-driven modeling techniques and algorithm modeling techniques can create a mutually beneficial bridge for advancing design of interfaces.
