The Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy is a semi-definite programming meta-algorithm that captures state-of-the-art polynomial time guarantees for many optimization problems such as Max-$k$-CSPs and Tensor PCA. On the flip side, a SoS lower bound provides evidence of hardness, which is particularly relevant to average-case problems for which NP-hardness may not be available. In this paper, we consider the following average case problem, which we call the Planted Affine Planes (PAP) problem: Given $m$ random vectors $d_{1}, \ldots, d_{m}$ in $\mathrm{I}\!\mathrm{R}^{n}$, can we prove that there is no vector $v \in \mathrm{I}\!\mathrm{R}^{n}$ such that for all $u\in[m],\ \langle v, d_{u}\rangle^{2}= 1$? In other words, can we prove that $m$ random vectors are not all contained in two parallel hyperplanes at equal distance from the origin? We prove that for $m\leq n^{3/ 2-\varepsilon}$, with high probability, degree-$n^{\Omega(\varepsilon)}$ SoS fails to refute the existence of such a vector $v$. When the vectors $d_{1}, \ldots, d_{m}$ are chosen from the multivariate normal distribution, the PAP problem is equivalent to the problem of proving that a random $n$-dimensional subspace of $\mathrm{I}\!\mathrm{R}^{m}$ does not contain a boolean vector. As shown by Mohanty–Raghavendra–Xu [STOC 2020], a lower bound for this problem implies a lower bound for the problem of certifying energy upper bounds on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian, and so our lower bound implies a degree-$n^{\Omega(\varepsilon)}$ SoS lower bound for the certification version of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick problem.
