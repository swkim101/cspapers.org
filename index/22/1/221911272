We have recently developed a new component for an existing healthcare system for Scandinavian users. The project setup included outsourced development in Egypt. In this experience report, we describe the project and the way we did requirements engineering. We identify and discuss a number of lessons learnt regarding requirements. Some of the lessons relate to the relatively long path from understanding and capturing of the needs of Scandinavian healthcare workers to providing software developers in Egypt the proper basis to do their work efficiently and with high quality. In our case, this path had four main constituents: (1) the Scandinavian healthcare domain; (2) a Scandinavian software company which was our customer; (3) the Danish software company Mjølner; (4) Mjølner's subcontractor Crossworkers in Egypt.
