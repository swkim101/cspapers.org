There has been a rapid growth in the use of symbolic representations along with their applications in many important tasks. Symbolic representations, in the form of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), constitute large networks of real-world entities and their relationships. On the other hand, sub-symbolic artificial intelligence has also become a mainstream area of research. This workshop brought together researchers to discuss and foster collaborations on the intersection of these two areas.
