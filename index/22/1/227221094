This paper presents the Sensorless control of variable reluctance synchronous motor VRSM based on direct speed control (DSC) based on PLL technique. This technique reduces the absorbed current value and it ensures a high starting torque. The proposed control has many advantages such as: the reduction the hardware implementation complexity, the low cost, offers a reduced size, elimination of direct sensor wiring, better noise immunity, increased reliability and less maintenance requirements. Thus, based on these stated benefits and to estimate the speed as well as the rotor flux, we have proposed a model reference adaptive system observer (MRAS). Simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed Sensorless vector control.
