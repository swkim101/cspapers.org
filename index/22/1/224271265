Quasimodo is an open-source commonsense knowledge base that significantly advanced the state of salient commonsense knowledge base construction. It introduced a pipeline that gathers, normalizes, validates and scores statements coming from query log and question answering forums. In this demonstration, we present a companion web portal which allows (i) to explore the data, (ii) to run and analyze the extraction pipeline live, and (iii) inspect the usage of Quasimodo's knowledge in several downstream use cases. The web portal is available at https://quasimodo.r2.enst.fr.
