Data sparsity is a challenge problem that most modern recommender systems are confronted with. By leveraging the knowledge from relevant domains, the cross-domain recommendation technique can be an effective way of alleviating the data sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-directional Transfer learning method for cross-domain recommendation by using Graph Collaborative Filtering network as the base model (BiTGCF). BiTGCF not only exploits the high-order connectivity in user-item graph of single domain through a novel feature propagation layer, but also realizes the two-way transfer of knowledge across two domains by using the common user as the bridge. Moreover, distinct from previous cross-domain collaborative filtering methods, BiTGCF fuses users' common features and domain-specific features during transfer. Experimental results on four couple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of BiTGCF over state-of-the-art models in terms of bi-directional cross domain recommendation.
