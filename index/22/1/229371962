1. EXTENDED ABSTRACT Enabling screens and cameras to communicate has been attracting growing interests. The idea is simple: information is encoded into a visual frame shown on a screen, and any camera-equipped device can turn to the screen and immediately fetch the information. Operating on the visible light spectrum band, screen-camera communication is free of electromagnetic interference, offering a promising out-of-band communication alternative for short-range information acquiring. The most popular example is QR code [1], where information (typically a URL) is encoded into a 2D barcode. Recent research endeavors have led to innovative barcode designs to boost data rate or to enhance reliability. These efforts are exciting, however they commonly require displaying visible coded images, which interfere with the content the screen is playing and create unpleasant viewing experiences. In this work, we seek approaches to enabling unobtrusive screen-camera communication, which allows the screen to concurrently fulfill a dual role: displaying content and communication. Ultimately, we envision a screen-camera communication system that transmits and receives dynamic data in real time, while ensuring communication occurs unobtrusively regardless of the content the screen is displaying — let it be an image, a movie, a video clip, a web page, a game interface, or any other app window. As the user interacts with the screen and switches the content, the communication sustains. Hence, communication is truly realized as an additional functionality for the screen, without placing any constraints on the screen’s original functionality (displaying content). Existing designs on unobtrusive screen-camera communication, however, are limited to screen content in a standalone file (e.g., image, video) and fail to support arbitrary content on the screen, which can be generated on the fly with user interactions.
