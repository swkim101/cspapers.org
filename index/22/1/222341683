Conventional image classifiers are trained by randomly sampling mini-batches of images. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, sophisticated data augmentation schemes are used to expand the amount of training data available for sampling. In contrast, meta-learning algorithms sample not only images, but classes as well. We investigate how data augmentation can be used not only to expand the number of images available per class, but also to generate entirely new classes. We systematically dissect the meta-learning pipeline and investigate the distinct ways in which data augmentation can be integrated at both the image and class levels. Our proposed meta-specific data augmentation significantly improves the performance of meta-learners on few-shot classification benchmarks.
