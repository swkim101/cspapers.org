A knowledge graph becomes a central data hub in the enterprise and the research communities. Nevertheless, the development of knowledge graphs is challenging due to the insufficient functionalities of knowledge graph management platforms. In this paper, we develop a knowledge graph management platform (UWKGM). This platform enables users to integrate arbitrary functionalities as RESTful API services in order to facilitate the knowledge graph development process. In the demonstration, we highlight the main features of UWKGM and its use cases on knowledge graph management tasks.
