Robotic systems have been increasingly employed in everyday tasks. Considering that software plays a crucial point in robot systems, to investigate how software engineering concepts in a software quality perspective can improve robotic systems. In this work, we present a systematic mapping to identify and classify the state-of-art of software engineering for robotic systems in a quality software perspective. We selected and systematically analyzed a final set of 35 primary studies extracted from an automated search on Scopus digital library. This work presents three main contributions. Firstly, we organize a catalogue of research studies about software engineering, more specifically software quality applied in robotic systems. Next, we systematically analyze software quality areas used in robotic systems. Finally, we discuss insights into research opportunities and gaps in software engineering to robotic systems for future studies. As a result, we observed that there are studies in the robotic systems area, addressing in a combined way, software engineering approaches and software quality aspects. The less investigated software quality aspect is security. Due to this fact, we presented an overview of the state-of-art on blockchain applying in robotics systems. Blockchain brings opportunities for changing the ways that robots interact with humans. Finally, we identify research opportunities and gaps in software quality on robotic systems, presenting an overview for future studies.
