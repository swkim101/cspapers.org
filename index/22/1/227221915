Performance evaluation or optimization of the maintenance activities inside the repair shop is crucial for the life of all manufacturers. Repair shops aim to detect the origin of the failure on a faulty equipment, with two alternatives: to restore its operation (corrective maintenance), or to take some components for another reuse, and for what remains to recover material. It is the set of resources required for maintenance actions, such as maintenance operators, the different intervention stations necessary for the different stages of repair, whose objective is to direct the faulty equipment towards a repair or reuse. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a literature review of repair shop improvements, when taking into account the context of Circular Economy, which allows firstly, for repairable defective equipment, to be returned to serviceable condition and secondly, for non-repairable equipment, to identify reusable components that will be used to supply the spare parts warehouse.
