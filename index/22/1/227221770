Industrial companies, especially in petrochemical industry, have to reach ever more higher objectives of availability and reliability to satisfy their customersâ€™ needs while remaining profitable and safe. Their whole organization has to be implied to do so. Maintenance activity and turnarounds scheduling are major contributors to the achievement of these objectives and have to deal with this change in practices. To accompany the practitioners, this paper offers a systemic model based on a systematic review of the processes, constraints and stakeholders that contribute to the decision-making in turnarounds scheduling, to serve as decision support in a selective risk-based maintenance approach. The objective of this paper is to position turnarounds scheduling in the organization of an industrial company in order to integrate realistic constraints, impacts and objectives for future works of scheduling simulation and optimization.
