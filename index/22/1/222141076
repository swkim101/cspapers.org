Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs running on the blockchain. They cannot be modified, even when bugs are detected. The Selfdestruct function is the only way to destroy a contract on the blockchain system and transfer all the Ethers on the contract balance. Thus, many developers use this function to destroy a contract and redeploy a new one when bugs are detected. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method to find security issues of Ethereum smart contracts by finding the updated version of a destructed contract. After finding the updated versions, we use open card sorting to find security issues.
