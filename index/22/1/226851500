The growing computational demands of automotive applications require the use of powerful embedded, heterogeneous computing platforms in vehicles. OpenMP, and in particular its device offloading features, are a promising candidate programming model for these platforms. In this work, we show how typical automotive workloads can be implemented and optimized with OpenMP device offloading. To this end, we also adapt the LLVM OpenMP runtime to embedded, heterogeneous platforms. Our evaluation shows that OpenMP device offloading can deliver performance similar to that of optimized CUDA implementations.
