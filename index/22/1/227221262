This paper presents a novel control design methodology for a class of distributed parameter systems (DPSs) described by the nonlinear Burgers-Fisher equation model. The proposed approach is built upon a fuzzy Burgers-Fisher equation model of T-S type which is derived to approximate the nonlinear DPS dynamics over the spatio-temporal dimension. Relying on the geometric control theory, a complete control design procedure is developed based on the constructed fuzzy Burgers-Fisher equation model with distributed control. The resulting fuzzy distributed controller is infinite dimensional showing good stabilizing effect and performs considerably well within the specified operating conditions.
