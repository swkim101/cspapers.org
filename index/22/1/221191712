The vulnerability of deep neural networks has gained a great upsurge of research attention, which engages well-designed examples through adding little perturbations to fool a well-performed network. Meanwhile, a progress has been made in leveraging adversarial examples to boost the robustness of deep cross-modal networks. However, for cross-modal learning, both the causes of adversarial examples and their latent advantages in learning cross-modal correlations are under-explored. In this paper, we propose novel Disentangled Adversarial examples for Cross-Modal learning, dubbed DACM. Specifically, we first divide cross-modal data into two aspects, namely modality-related component and modality-unrelated counterpart, and then learn to improve the reliability of network using the modality-related component. To achieve this goal, we apply the generation of adversarial perturbations to strengthen cross-modal correlations, wherein the modality-related component is acquired through gradually detaching the modality-unrelated component. Finally, the proposed DACM is employed to create modality-related examples towards the application of cross-modal hashing retrieval. Extensive experiments carried out on two cross-modal benchmarks show that the adversarial examples learned by DACM are efficient at fooling a target deep cross-modal hashing network. On the other hand, training this target model by merely leveraging our created modality-related examples in turn significantly promotes the robustness of this model itself.
