In this paper, we present the results of a series of qualitative studies involving patients and care providers to explore opportunities for involving patients in their care. Empowering patients in their own care can facilitate the treatment process, increase patientsâ€™ quality of life, and support patients in reaching their goals. A cultural shift towards patient centered care is currently underway, however, at least in Canada, there is still much to be done. Through interviews and focus groups with patients and care providers, we aim to contribute to this cultural shift by identifying three areas of opportunity to involve patients in their own care and be a part of their care team. We then describe potential technology solutions to address these opportunities.
