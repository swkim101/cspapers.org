In this paper, we propose a new method for the representation of nonlinear systems by exploiting the ARX-Laguerre model in the multimodel approach. The representation of non-linear systems by the ARX-Laguerre multimodel approach takes place in two stages; The first consists in developing each ARX sub-model on orthogonal bases independent of Laguerre. The second deals with the parametric identification problem of the ARX-Laguerre multimodel.
