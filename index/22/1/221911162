Architecture-first approaches are increasingly widely adopted for addressing resiliency requirements in critical systems. In these approaches, the system is built from the ground-up to be resilient, starting with the system's architecture design. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the architecture design is robust, without any flaws that could compromise the system's ability to detect, prevent, react to or recover from adverse conditions, such as cyber-attacks. In this paper, we describe our ongoing efforts in aiding software architects in designing cyber-resilient systems by automatically detecting weaknesses in their architectural models.
