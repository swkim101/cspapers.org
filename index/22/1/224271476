Performance anomalies are a core problem in modern information systems, that affects the execution of the hosted applications. The detection of these anomalies often relies on the analysis of the application execution logs. The current most effective approach is to detect samples that differ from a learnt nominal model. However, current methods often focus on detecting sequential anomalies in logs, neglecting the time elapsed between logs, which is a core component of the performance anomaly detection. In this paper, we develop a new model for performance anomaly detection that captures temporal deviations from the nominal model, by means of a sliding window data representation. This nominal model is trained by a Long Short-Term Memory neural network, which is appropriate to represent complex sequential dependencies. We assess the effectiveness of our model on both simulated and real datasets. We show that it is more robust to temporal variations than current state-of-the-art approaches, while remaining as effective.
