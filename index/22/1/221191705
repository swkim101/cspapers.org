Finding node associations across different networks is the cornerstone behind a wealth of high-impact data mining applications. Traditional approaches are often, explicitly or implicitly, built upon the linearity and/or consistency assumptions. On the other hand, the recent network embedding based methods promise a natural way to handle the non-linearity, yet they could suffer from the disparate node embedding space of different networks. In this paper, we address these limitations and tackle cross-network node associations from a new angle, i.e., cross-network transformation. We ask a generic question: Given two different networks, how can we transform one network to another? We propose an end-to-end model that learns a composition of nonlinear operations so that one network can be transformed to another in a hierarchical manner. The proposed model bears three distinctive advantages. First (composite transformation), it goes beyond the linearity/consistency assumptions and performs the cross-network transformation through a composition of nonlinear computations. Second (representation power), it can learn the transformation of both network structures and node attributes at different resolutions while identifying the cross-network node associations. Third (generality), it can be applied to various tasks, including network alignment, recommendation, cross-layer dependency inference. Extensive experiments on different tasks validate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.
