Kirchhoff approximation method has been utilized for analyzing the diffraction of a transverse electric planewave by a window aperture on a thick conducting wall. The scattering fields are formulated as successive radiations from equivalent magnetic current sources assumed by closing the window aperture. Waveguide modal description has been used to solve the window glass effect of the structure. Scattering fields have been calculated to show the effect of the window glass.
