In this paper, we propose an indirect adaptive control strategy for a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) linked to both external loads and the electrical grid. This configuration is widely used in smart buildings when the building has a positive power it can inject the excess amount directly to the grid. Our objective is to ensure the fast-tracking and boundless of all signals in both stages of synchronization and power regulation. The proposed technic is independent of the system model and guarantees the robustness against external (load changes) and internal perturbations (speed changesâ€¦etc.). The fuzzy adaptive system is used to estimate in real-time the nonlinear functions of the system, the control law with the proposed adaptation laws ensure the stability of the controller with the DFIG based WECS. Numerical and graphical Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme for both synchronization and power control.
