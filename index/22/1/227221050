In this paper, we propose a new method for the development of a functional H∞ filer for linear singular systems, knowing that a state delay is present in both dynamic and output equations. The proposed filter scheme estimates a functional state independently from the considered delay and according to a H∞ criterion in order to minimize the perturbation effect on the error dynamics. The proposed algorithm is based on The Lyapunov- Krasovskii stability theory using LMI Tools and it's tested on a numerical example where the results were successful.
