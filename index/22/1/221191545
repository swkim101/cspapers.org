Understanding human language in real world scenarios involves not just natural language processing but also speech, vision, knowledge graphs, user modeling, and other AI techniques. Doing this at Google scale involves planetary-scale cloud computing as well as tiny-scale edge computing. I'll share a behind-the-scenes look at how Google uses Language AI to power its billion-user products, and discuss some of the newer approaches we are developing to make sense of human language. I'll end with our vision to democratize AI and how you can use Google AI in your own work.
