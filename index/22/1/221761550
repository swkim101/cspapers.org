Over the last decade, time series motif discovery has emerged as a useful primitive for many downstream analytical tasks, including clustering, classification, rule discovery, segmentation, and summarization. In parallel, there has been an increased understanding that Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is the best time series similarity measure in a host of settings. Surprisingly however, there has been virtually no work on using DTW to discover motifs. The most obvious explanation of this is the fact that both motif discovery and the use of DTW can be computationally challenging, and the current best mechanisms to address their lethargy are mutually incompatible. In this work, we present the first scalable exact method to discover time series motifs under DTW. Our method automatically performs the best trade-off between time-to-compute and tightness-of-lower-bounds for a novel hierarchy of lower bounds representation we introduce. We show that under realistic settings, our algorithm can admissibly prune up to 99.99% of the DTW computations.
