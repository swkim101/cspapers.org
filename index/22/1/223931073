Health news delivers findings from health-related research to the public. As the delivered information may affect the public’s everyday decision or behavior, readers should get an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the research from articles they read. However, it is rarely achieved due to incomplete information delivered by the news stories and a lack of critical evaluation of readers. In this position paper, we propose a readersourcing approach, an idea of engaging readers in a critical reading activity while collecting valuable artifacts for future readers to acquire a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of health-related information. We discuss challenges, opportunities, and design considerations in the readersourcing approach. Then we present the initial design of a web-based news reading application that connects health news readers via questioning and answering tasks.
