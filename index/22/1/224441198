With growing hardware complexity and ever-evolving user requirements, the kernel is increasingly bloated which increases its attack surface. Despite its large size, for speciﬁc applications and workloads, only a small subset of the kernel code is actually required. Kernel specialization approaches exploit this observation to either harden the kernel or restrict access to its code (debloating) on a per-application basis. However, existing approaches suffer from coarse specialization granularity and lack strict enforcement which limits their effectiveness. This paper presents S HARD , a practical framework to enforce ﬁne-grain kernel specialization. S HARD specializes at both the application and system call levels to signiﬁcantly restrict the kernel code exposed to attackers. Furthermore, S HARD introduces context-aware hardening to dynamically enable code hardening during suspicious execution contexts. S HARD implements an instance of a context-aware hardening scheme using control-ﬂow integrity (CFI), which provides near-native performance for non-hardened executions and strong security guarantees. Our analysis of the kernel attack surface reduction with S HARD as well as concrete attacks shows that S HARD exposes 181 × less kernel code than the native kernel, an order of magnitude better than existing work, and prevents 90% of the evaluated attacks. Our evaluation shows that the average performance overhead of S HARD on real-world applications is moderate—10% to 36% on NG-INX, 3% to 10% on Redis, and 0% to 2.7% on the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks.
