Manufacturing of car bodies heavily relies on demanding welding processes of joining body parts together that introduce thousands of joining welding spots in each car. Quality monitoring for these spots impacts production efficiency and cost. In this paper we develop an ML pipeline to predict the spot quality before the actual welding happens. This pipeline is based on a Feature Engineering~(FE) approach to manually design features using domain knowledge. We evaluated the pipeline with two datasets from industrial plants, achieving very promising results with prediction errors around 2%. Then, we develop an approach to semantically enhance FE pipelines in order to automate the ML process without compromising the prediction accuracy and to facilitate generalisation and transfer of FE-based models to other datasets and processes. Our ML pipeline has been deployed offline on various Bosch manufacturing datasets in a controlled environment since early 2019 and evaluated.
