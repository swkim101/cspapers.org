Both geometric and semantic information of the search space are imperative for a good plan. We encode those properties in a weighted colored graph (geometric information in terms of edge weight and semantic information in terms of edge and vertex color) and propose a generalized A∗ to find the shortest path among the set of paths with minimal inclusion of low-ranked color edges. We prove the completeness and optimality of this Class-Ordered A∗ (COA∗ ) algorithm with respect to the hereto defined notion of optimality. The utility of COA∗ is numerically validated in a ternary graph with feasible, infeasible, and unknown vertices and edges for the cases of a 2D mobile robot, a 3D robotic arm, and a 5D robotic arm with limited sensing capabilities. We compare the results of COA∗ to that of the regular A∗ algorithm, the latter of which finds a shortest path regardless of the semantic information, and we show that the COA∗ dominates the A∗ solution in terms of finding less uncertain paths.
