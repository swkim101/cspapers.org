Over a decade, as a specialized workshop in the field of text mining applied to biomedical informatics, DTMBIO (ACM international workshop on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics) has been held annually in conjunction with one of the largest data management conferences, CIKM. The purpose of DTMBIO is to foster discussions regarding the state-of-the-art applications of data and text mining on biomedical research problems. To address our purpose, we bring together researchers working on computer science and bio/medical informatics area including text mining and high throughput genomic data analysis, such as the next generation Sequencing (NGS) data. DTMBIO 2020 will help scientists navigate emerging trends and opportunities in the evolving area of informatics related techniques and problems in the context of biomedical research.
