Knowledge graphs have been used to support a wide range of applications and enhance search and QA for Google, Bing, Amazon Alexa, etc. However, we often miss long-tail knowledge, including unpopular entities, unpopular relations, and unpopular verticals. In this talk we describe our efforts in harvesting knowledge from semi-structured websites, which are often populated according to some templates using vast volume of data stored in underlying databases. We describe our Ceres system, which extracts knowledge from semi-structured web. AutoCeres is a ClosedIE system that extracts knowledge according to existing ontology. It improves the accuracy of fully automatic knowledge extraction from 60%+ of state-of-the-art to 90%+ on semi-structured data. OpenCeres is the first-ever OpenIE system on semi-structured data, that is able to identify new relations not readily included in existing ontologies. ZeroShotCeres goes further and enables extracting knowledge for completely new domains, where there is no seed knowledge for bootstrapping the extraction. Finally, we describe our other efforts in ontology alignment, entity linkage, graph mining, and QA, that allow us to best leverage the knowledge we extract for search and QA.
