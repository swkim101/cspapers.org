Unstructured scientific text, in various forms of textual artifacts, including manuscripts, publications, patents, and proposals, is used to store the tremendous wealth of knowledge discovered after weeks, months, and years, developing hypotheses, working in the lab or clinic, and analyzing results. A grand challenge on data mining research is to develop effective methods for transforming the scientific text into well-structured forms (e.g., ontology, taxonomy, knowledge graphs), so that machine intelligent systems can build on them for hypothesis generation and validation. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive overview on recent research and development in this direction. First, we introduce a series of text mining methods that extract phrases, entities, scientific concepts, relations, claims, and experimental evidence. Then we discuss methods that construct and learn from scientific knowledge graphs for accurate search, document classification, and exploratory analysis. Specifically, we focus on scalable, effective, weakly supervised methods that work on text in sciences (e.g., chemistry, biology).
