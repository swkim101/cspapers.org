ANFIS is combining a neural network with a fuzzy system results in a hybrid neuro-fuzzy system, capable of reasoning and learning in an uncertain and imprecise environment. In this paper, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is employed to control an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV).Â  First, autopilots structure is defined, and then ANFIS controller is applied, to control UAVs lateral position. The results of ANFIS and PID lateral controllers are compared, where it shows the two controllers have similar results. ANFIS controller is capable to adaptation in nonlinear conditions, while PID has to be tuned to preserves proper control in some conditions. The simulation results generated by Matlab using Aerosim Aeronautical Simulation Block Set, which provides a complete set of tools for development of six degree-of-freedom. Nonlinear Aerosonde unmanned aerial vehicle model with ANFIS controller is simulated to verify the capability of the system. Moreover, the results are validated by FlightGear flight simulator.
