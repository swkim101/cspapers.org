To solve the problems such as poor machining adaptability, poor expandability, and unsatisfied integration control requirements of the robot control system (RCS) in the unstructured machining process, the numerical control system (NCS) of mobile robotic equipment for unstructured machining was studied. Then, an implementation framework of NCS is given, and key technologies such as power distribution optimization and hardware configuration, system parameter debugging and optimization, robot kinematics parameter configuration and optimization, etc. are researched. The control accuracy of NCS was verified by the laser tracker which was used to measure the target point. The experimental results show that the maximum comprehensive error of the positioning robot controlled by NCS is 2.33 mm. And, compared with RCS, the NCS has higher control accuracy.
