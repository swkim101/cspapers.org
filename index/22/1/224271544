DataMod 2020 aims to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry and research institutions interested in the combined application of computational modelling methods with data-driven techniques from the areas of knowledge management, data mining and machine learning. Modelling methodologies of interest include automata, agents, Petri nets, process algebras and rewriting systems. Application domains include social systems, ecology, biology, medicine, smart cities, governance, security, education, software engineering, and any other field that deals with complex systems and large amounts of data. Papers can present research results in any of the themes of interest for the symposium as well as application experiences, tools and promising preliminary ideas. Papers dealing with synergistic approaches that integrate modelling and knowledge management/discovery or that exploit knowledge management/discovery to develop/syntesise system models are especially welcome.
