In software design, the various stakeholders generate large numbers of heterogeneous artifacts. These artifacts are often developed in, and managed by, different tools. In this paper, we present our initial prototype of Linecept, a tool that helps stakeholders organize, find, and view disparate design artifacts by organizing them on a timeline that presents a single unified view of the artifacts and who created them. We have used Linecept to retrospectively capture design artifacts for its own creation and in a software design class.
