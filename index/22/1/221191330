Computer vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world for a variety of exciting downstream tasks such as self-driving cars, checkout-less shopping, smart cities, cancer detection, and more. The field of CV has been revolutionized by deep learning over the last decade. This tutorial looks under the hood of modern day CV systems, and builds out some of these tech pipelines in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, OpenCV, Keras and Tensorflow. While the primary focus is on digital images from cameras and videos, this tutorial will also introduce 3D point clouds, and classification and segmentation algorithms for processing them.
