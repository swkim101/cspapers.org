In this paper, we present high-speed, low latency, and flexible transport systems for 5G and beyond networks using an orchestration of different transmission mediums, including fiber-optic, free-space optics (FSO), and millimeter-wave (MMW). We introduce the system concepts and review our recent proof-of-concept demonstration results for each system. We also present a hybrid FSO and MMW system for highly resilient and reliable mobile transport in ultra-dense small cell networks.
