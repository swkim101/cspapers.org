Powerful software tools, such as software development environments, often have complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that are not intuitive to handle, especially when performing complex, multi-step operations. We hypothesize that sketching could be a more intuitive way of expressing user intentions than navigating nested menus or memorizing keyboard shortcuts to accomplish complex operations. Enabling this vision requires software capable of both allowing the user to sketch anywhere on a GUI, and interpreting those sketches as specific commands to be performed within the integrated development environment (IDE). In this paper, we report on preliminary results of an elicitation study performed to gather insights into how developers would use a sketch-based interface.
