Maximal clique enumeration is a well-studied problem due to its many applications. We present a new algorithm for this problem that enumerates maximal cliques in a diverse ordering. The main idea behind our approach is to adapt the classic Bron-Kerbosch (BK) algorithm by, conceptually, jumping between different nodes in the execution tree. Special care is taken to ensure that (1) each maximal clique is created precisely once, (2) the theoretical runtime remains the same as in the BK algorithm and (3) memory requirements remain reasonable. Experimental results show that we indeed achieve our goals, and moreover, that the cliques are enumerated in a diverse order.
