Tactile sensors are used in robot manipulation to reduce uncertainty regarding hand-object pose estimation. However, existing sensor technologies tend to be bulky and provide signals that are difficult to interpret into actionable changes. Here, we achieve wireless tactile sensing with soft and conformable magnetic stickers that can be easily placed on objects within the robot’s workspace. We embed a small magnetometer within the robot’s fingertip that can localize to a magnetic sticker with sub-mm accuracy and enable the robot to pick up objects in the same place, in the same way, every time. In addition, we utilize the soft magnets’ ability to exhibit magnetic field changes upon contact forces. We demonstrate the localization and force-feedback features with a 7-DOF Franka arm on deformable tool use and a key insertion task for applications in home, medical, and food robotics. By increasing the reliability of interaction with common tools, this approach to object localization and force sensing can improve robot manipulation performance for delicate, high-precision tasks.
