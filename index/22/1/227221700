This Nowadays, deep learning is one of the most used technique for image denoising until it outperforms so far, all other denoising methods. However, this method requires a lot of computing power, so itâ€™s quite difficult to achieve real-time deep learning denoisers especially on edge devices like embedded systems and mobile phones. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning denoiser that works in real-time on a Raspberry Pi 3B+, 1GB of ram, to increase in real-time the incoming noisy video from a Raspberry Pi Camera frame per frame, where each frame is an RGB image if size 256x256. We used a residual denoiser that extracts the noise and enhance the quality of obtained images. In fact, the proposed architecture has a very small size that can fit easily on any edge device. Furthermore, many optimization techniques were applied on the denoiser so it can run faster on a very limited computing resource. Each denoised frame where uploaded directly to a Microsoft storage service.
