Taking as reference not only the work of Negus, Maffesoli, Deleuze, Guattari, Bourdieu, and Straw, but also research conducted during 2011 and 2012 (consisting in the selection and analysis of press materials in traditional and alternative media, organization of interviews with jazz musicians and agents, and field work carried out in strategic venues), the aim of this article was to assess: a) whether a Rio de Janeiro jazz scene has been consolidated in the past two years; b) and if “musicability” and “street culture” are still continuing to produce social mobilization in that city.
