Link prediction has long been the focus in the analysis of network-structured data. Though straightforward and efficient, heuristic approaches like Common Neighbors perform link prediction with pre-defined assumptions and only use superficial structural features. While it is widely acknowledged that a vertex could be characterized by a bunch of neighbor vertices, network embedding algorithms and newly emerged graph neural networks still exploit structural features on the whole network, which may inevitably bring in noises and limits the scalability of those methods. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework, namely hyper-substructure enhanced link predictor (HELP), for link prediction. HELP utilizes local topological structures from the neighborhood of the given vertex pairs, avoiding useless features. For further exploiting higher-order structural information, HELP also learns features from hyper-substructure network (HSN).Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets have shown the state-of-the-art performance of HELP on link prediction.
