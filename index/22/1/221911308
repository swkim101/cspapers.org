The new European Payments Service Directive (Directive (EU) 2015/2366) introduces a novelty for users of online accounts: the possibility of accessing their own bank statements or making payment transactions directly through software created by Third Party Providers. The new players authorized by the directive represent the real novelty with respect to the previous one (Directive 2007/64/CE), and introduce for the first time a strong risk of disintegration between the Bank and its customers. New authorized parties include the Account Servicing Payment Service Provider, the Payment Initiation Service Provider and the Account Information Service Provider. This new mechanism for accessing information on personal bank statements or for the payment will stimulate a remodeling of the offers for customers. In this work a first attempt to implement a service of account information and a service of account storing through a blockchain oriented software application is presented.
