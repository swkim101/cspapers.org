The Internet of Things (IoT) market is growing fast with an increasing number of connected devices. This led many software companies to shift their focus to develop and provide IoT solutions. IoT development has its own challenges as typical IoT solutions are composed of heterogeneous devices, protocols and software. To cope with these challenges, many frameworks are available to help developers to build IoT applications. Some of these frameworks are open source and might be of great interest for small and medium-sized companies wishing to build IoT solutions at a lower cost. In this paper, we present the results of a preliminary study of four open source IoT development frameworks. In particular, we used these frameworks to implement a sample of three IoT applications and we analyze them against a minimal set of IoT requirements. We focus in our study on the IoT development for Raspberry PI as it is a very low-cost and popular platform.
