In this paper, we investigate the time domain design of a Functional Unknown input Observer (FUIO) for linear time delay systems in presence of bounded disturbance. A constant and variable delays act, respectively, in the state and the known input vectors. The proposed time domain approach is based on the unbiasedness of the estimation error using Lyapunov functional and the observer gain is designed using Hâˆž techniques. The design problem is transformed to Linear Matrix inequalities (LMIs). The effectiveness of our approach is shown by its application on a numerical example.
