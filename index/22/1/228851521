 Multi-objective decision making problems can sometimes involve an infinite number of objectives. In this paper, an approach is presented for solving multi-objective optimization problems containing an infinite number of parameterized objectives, termed “infinite objective optimization”. A formulation is given for infinite objective optimization problems and an approach for checking whether a Pareto frontier is a solution to this formulation is detailed. Using this approach, a new sampling based approach is developed for solving infinite objective optimization problems. The new approach is tested on several different example problems and is shown to be faster and perform better than a brute force approach.
