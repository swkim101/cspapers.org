For many years, malicious cyber-attackers have been targeting the industrial control systems (ICSs) that manage the critical infrastructure. Industries become vulnerable to cyberattacks, following the introduction of new technologies in their production processes. Cyber-security becomes a critical subject that treatment can be improved: it is a little taken into consideration in humans and environmental risk analysis, despite the common points with the risks related to cyber-security. In this article the approaches that combined the security and safety in risk analysis are presented and applied to a case study to evaluate and compare them, this evaluation allows us to find the best way to propose our future risk analysis approach.
