Automated ML is an emerging field in Machine Learning that helps developers and new data scientists with little data science knowledge build Machine Learning models and solutions without understanding the complexity of Learning Algorithm selection, and Hyper parameter tuning. With Azure Machine Learning's automated machine learning capability, given a dataset and a few configuration parameters, you will get a trained high quality machine learning model for the dataset that you can use for predictions. In this session, you will learn how to use Automated ML for productivity gains, empowering domain experts to build ML based solutions and scale to build several models with Azure Machine Learning's Automated ML.
