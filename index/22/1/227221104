In this paper, we will propose a solution to estimate the defect at the input of a non-linear system based on the ARX-Laguerre multimodel. So, we will present the design of the PI (Proportional Integral) observer based on the ARX-Laguerre multimodel. and the gains of which will be calculated by an algorithm for detecting and estimating input faults in non-linear systems. The detection and estimation algorithm is based on the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) optimization method.
