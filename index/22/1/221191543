Subjective data refers to data that contains opinions and experiences. Such data is ubiquitous in product reviews, tweets, and discussion forums in social media. Consumers today spend considerable time sifting through subjective data to make informed decisions about purchases. At Megagon Labs, we are building technologies to synthesize knowledge from subjective data and to facilitate searching over them. In this talk, I will overview some of the technologies we have developed in the directions of subjective data preparation and integration, experience discovery and search, subjective knowledge representation, and data analytics and exploration.
