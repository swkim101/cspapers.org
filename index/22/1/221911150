Software is a critical factor in the reliability of computer systems. While the development of hardware is assisted by mature science and engineering disciplines, software science is still in its infancy. This situation is likely to worsen in the future with quantum computer systems. Actually, if quantum computing is quickly coming of age, with potential groundbreaking impacts on many different fields, such benefits come at a price: quantum programming is hard and finding new quantum algorithms is far from straightforward. Thus, the need for suitable formal techniques in quantum software development is even bigger than in classical computation. A lack of reliable approaches to quantum computer programming will put at risk the expected quantum advantage of the new hardware. This position paper argues for the need for a proper quantum software engineering discipline benefiting from precise foundations and calculi, capable of supporting algorithm development and analysis.
