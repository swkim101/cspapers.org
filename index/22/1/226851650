Heterogeneous computing is a promising solution to scale the performance of computing systems maintaining energy and power efficiency. Managing such resources is, however, complex and it requires smart resource allocation strategies in both embedded and high-performance systems. In this short paper, we propose a game theory approach to allocate heterogeneous resources to applications, with a focus on performance, power, and energy requirements. The game congestion model has been selected and a cost function designed. The proposed allocation strategy is then evaluated by performing a preliminary experimental evaluation.
