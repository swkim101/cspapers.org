Recent advancements in Bayesian likelihood-free inference enables a probabilistic treatment for the problem of estimating simulation parameters and their uncertainty given sequences of observations. Domain randomization can be performed much more effectively when a posterior distribution provides the correct uncertainty over parameters in a simulated environment. In this paper, we study the integration of simulation parameter inference with both model-free reinforcement learning and model-based control in a novel sequential algorithm that alternates between learning a better estimation of parameters and improving the controller. This approach exploits the interdependence between the two problems to generate computational efficiencies and improved reliability when a black-box simulator is available. Experimental results suggest that both control strategies have better performance when compared to traditional domain randomization methods.
