We propose a new traceroute tool, FlashRoute for efficient large-scale topology discovery. FlashRoute reduces the time required for tracerouting the entire /24 IPv4 address space by a factor of three and half compared to previous state of the art. Additionally, we present a new technique to measure hop-distance to a destination using a single probe and uncover a bias of the influential ISI Census hitlist [18] in topology discovery.
