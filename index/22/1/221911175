The present live study is proposed with the objective of investigating the influence of negative emotions (i.e., stress) in the efficiency for verifying conceptual models. To conduct this study, we use a Model-driven Testing tool, named CoSTest, and our own version of stress detector within a competition setting. The experiment design, overview of the empirical procedure, instrumentation and potential threats are presented in the proposal.
