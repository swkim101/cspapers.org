During robot-assisted therapy of hemiplegic patients, interaction with the patient must be intrinsically safe. Straight-forward collision avoidance solutions can provide this safety requirement with conservative margins. These margins heavily reduce the robot’s workspace and make interaction with the patient’s unguided body parts impossible. However, interaction with the own body is highly beneficial from a therapeutic point of view. We tackle this problem by combining haptic rendering techniques with classical computer vision methods. Our proposed solution consists of a pipeline that builds collision objects from point clouds in real-time and a controller that renders haptic interaction. The raw sensor data is processed to overcome noise and occlusion problems. Our proposed approach is validated on the 6 DoF exoskeleton ANYexo for direct impacts, sliding scenarios, and dynamic collision surfaces. The results show that this method has the potential to successfully prevent collisions and allow haptic interaction for highly dynamic environments. We believe that this work significantly adds to the usability of current exoskeletons by enabling virtual haptic interaction with the patient’s body parts in human-robot therapy.
