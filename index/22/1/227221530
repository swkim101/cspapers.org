In this paper we propose a new method of a time design observer for a bilinear system with unknown input and constant time delays in both state and control vectors. This approach is based on the stability of Lyapunov Krasovskii stability theory and the matrix inequality resolution approach (LMI). It provides an estimation of a functional state vector. The proposed method is tested on a given numerical example and proves its effectiveness.
