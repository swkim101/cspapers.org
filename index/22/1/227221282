As the interest in autonomous vehicles increases rapidly, the necessity of an evaluation environment for verifying and evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles and technology-equipped vehicles is emerging. In order to reflect the increasing number and complexity of electronic systems, various climatic conditions, and driving styles of drivers, various open source simulators have emerged in connection with autonomous driving technology testing. These simulators use 3D maps to perform autonomous driving algorithm tests. This paper proposes a method of generating a 3D point map that is a driving environment of an autonomous driving simulator using a LiDAR sensor provided by a driving simulator.
