Industry 4.0 has brought a number of new technologies that are completely changing the shape of todayâ€™s maintenance processes. However, studies about these new technologies are still premature. This article provides an understanding and analysis of the most current and relevant studies on the area. As a method, we first selected the most relevant articles using a bibliometric methodology called the Theory of the Consolidated Meta-analytic Approach (TEMAC) method, then the 13 most significant studies were reviewed and presented and finally a study of possible gaps in the literature left uncovered by authors that allowed us to identify key elements and to forecast the future of Intelligent Predictive Maintenance.
