Although there are many commercial products and services advertising their capability of indoor navigation using smartphone, still the service coverage is highly restricted to the specific area due to tremendous effort on pre-survey and maintenance on positioning resources such as radio map of Wi-Fi signals. Most of indoor positioning is dependent on the installed facilities such as Wi-Fi APs and BLE beacons in service area. Without pre-surveyed information such as fingerprint database, one can not localize himself at the first visiting site.
