Docker helps developers reuse software artifacts by providing a lightweight solution to the problem of operating system virtualization. A Docker image contains very rich and useful knowledge of software engineering, including the source of software packages, the correlations among software packages, the installation methods of software packages and the information on operating systems. To effectively obtain this knowledge, this paper proposes an approach to constructing a knowledge graph of Docker artifacts, named DockerKG, by analyzing a large number of Dockerfiles in Docker Hub, which contains more than 3.08 million Docker repositories (up to February 2020). Currently, DockerKG contains the domain knowledge extracted from approximately 200 thousand Dockerfiles in Docker Hub. Besides, it contains the information on Docker repositories and their semantic tags. In future work, DockerKG can be used for Docker image recommendations and online Q&A service providing software engineering domain knowledge.
