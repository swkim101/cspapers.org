Organizations such as Amazon, Apple and Google have been investing in Developer Relations (DevRel) team to engage a critical mass of third-party developers in producing and evolving contributions to a common technological platform. It fosters the establishment of a Software Ecosystem (SECO). However, it is still unknown how the DevRel team should act on monitoring a SECO aiming to establish a robust ecosystem. One tangible possibility is to mine repositories to enhance DevRel strategies. In this paper, we report on an investigation of the reasons that lead 31 DevRel practitioners to use software repositories during their activities. The results point out a common perspective for DevRel practitioners and researchers in developing strategies and research roadmaps.
