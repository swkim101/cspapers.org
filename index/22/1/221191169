In the midst of COVID-19, a global economic crisis is threatening the livelihoods of small business owners everywhere. In ordinary times, 50 percent of small businesses go out of business in the first 5 years. In today's extraordinary times, nearly 7.5 million (~25 percent) of small businesses in the U.S. alone have been at risk of closing permanently in a matter of months (Source: Main Street America's Small Business Survey 2020). Among the all-time top contributing factors to survival? Cash flow management and access to capital. Whether in the midst of a pandemic or a devastating life event, business owners are more likely to survive if they can 1) efficiently manage the inflow and outflow of cash, 2) understand their cash position to qualify for government aid and/or loans with flexible borrowing terms, and 3) use financial insights to map out revenue and spending scenarios. In this talk, Nhung Ho, Director of Data Science for Intuit's Small Business and Self-Employed Group, will describe how Intuit AI has applied artificial intelligence and large-scale machine learning to help small businesses around the world to overcome the challenges of cash flow forecasting and capital access to build financial resilience in turbulent times.
