The prevalence and success of AI applications have been tempered by concerns about the controllability of AI systems about AI's impact on the future of work. These concerns reflect two aspects of a central question: how would humans work with AI systems? While research on AI safety focuses on designing AI systems that allow humans to safely instruct and control AI systems, research on AI and the future of work focuses on the impact of AI on humans who may be unable to do so. This Blue Sky Ideas paper proposes a unifying set of declarative principles that enable a more uniform evaluation of arbitrary AI systems along multiple dimensions of the extent to which they are suitable for use by specific classes of human operators. It leverages recent AI research and the unique strengths of the field to develop human-centric principles for AI systems that address the concerns noted above.
