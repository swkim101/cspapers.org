Given the importance of IT for organizations worldwide, IT Governance is an increasing concern for C-suite officers. Inside IT, software is a key aspect in the governance scenario. The increasing pressures by regulatory, and compliance efforts are changing the software governance arena, thus there is a need to focus on the current state of the topic. Despite this acknowledged need, the studies on Software Governance are still scarce. In this paper, authors expand the software governance model introduced by Chulani et al. [1] with new concerns derived from the alignment of the model with the IT Governance standard, ISO/ IEC 38500 and the experience of authors. Moreover, the new model proposes the categorization of these concerns to govern software development activities aligned with IT Governance.
