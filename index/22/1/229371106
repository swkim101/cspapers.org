Semi-supervised node classification on graph-structured data has many applications such as fraud detection, fake account and review detection, userâ€™s private attribute inference in social networks, and community detection. 
Various methods such as pairwise Markov Random Fields (pMRF) and graph neural networks were developed for semi-supervised node classification. 
 pMRF is more efficient than graph neural networks. However, existing pMRF-based methods are less accurate than graph neural networks, due to a key limitation that they assume a heuristics-based constant edge potential for all edges. In this work, we aim to address the key limitation of existing pMRF-based methods. In particular, we propose to learn edge potentials for pMRF. Our evaluation results on 
 various types of graph datasets show that our optimized pMRF-based method consistently outperforms existing graph neural networks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our results highlight that previous work may have underestimated the power of pMRF for semi-supervised node classification.
