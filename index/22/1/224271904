In tag-enhanced video recommendation systems, videos are attached with some tags that highlight the contents of videos from different aspects. Tag ranking in such recommendation systems provides personalized tag lists for videos from their tag candidates. A better tag ranking model could attract users to click more tags, enter their corresponding tag channels, and watch more tag-specific videos, which improves both tag click rate and video watching time. However, most conventional tag ranking models merely concentrate on tag-video relevance or tag-related behaviors, ignoring the rich information in video-related behaviors. We should consider user preferences on both tags and videos. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph neural network based tag ranking (GraphTR) framework on a huge heterogeneous network with video, tag, user and media. We design a novel graph neural network that combines multi-field transformer, GraphSAGE and neural FM layers in node aggregation. We also propose a neighbor-similarity based loss to encode various user preferences into heterogeneous node representations. In experiments, we conduct both offline and online evaluations on a real-world video recommendation system in WeChat Top Stories. The significant improvements in both video and tag related metrics confirm the effectiveness and robustness in real-world tag-enhanced video recommendation. Currently, GraphTR has been deployed on WeChat Top Stories for more than six months. The source codes are in https://github.com/lqfarmer/GraphTR.
