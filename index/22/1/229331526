Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a largely ad-dressed subject today. Collision avoidance is one of main strategies that allow space sharing and interaction without contact between human and robot. It is thus usual to use a 3D depth camera sensor which may involves issues related to occluded robot in camera view. While several works overcame this issue by applying infinite depth principle or increasing the number of cameras, we developed in the current work a new and an original approach based on the combination of a 3D depth sensor (Microsoft® Kinect V2) and the proprioceptive robot position sensors. This method uses a principle of limited safety contour around the obstacle to dynamically estimate the robot-obstacle distance, and then generate the repulsive force that controls the robot. For validation, our approach is applied in real time to avoid collision between dynamical obstacles (humans or objects) and the end-effector of a real 7-dof Kuka LBR iiwa collaborative robot.Several strategies based on distancing and its combination with dodging were tested. Results have shown a reactive and efficient collision avoidance, by ensuring a minimum obstacle-robot distance (of ≈ 240mm), even when the robot is in an occluded zone in the Kinect camera view
