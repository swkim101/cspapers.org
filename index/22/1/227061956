This paper presents a multi-layer microstrip antenna designed for RFID application. This antenna is implemented by a folded dipole antenna with a loop-based directing element to increase the gain for the whole antenna structure. The proposed antenna operates at 2.4 GHz ISM band and achieves high gain of 6.4 dBi which is suitable for far-field RFID reader. Detailed study of the proposed RFID reader antenna exhibits that the designed antenna structure provides both strong near E-field and H-field and good impedance matching properties. The antenna was fabricated and its performance was validated by simulated and measured results with respect to return loss and radiation pattern.
