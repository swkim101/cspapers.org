The 2019 IARAI traﬃc4cast competition is a traﬃc forecasting problem based on traﬃc data from three cities that are encoded as images. We developed a ResNet-inspired graph convolutional neural network (GCN) approach that uses street network-based subgraphs of the image lattice graphs as a prior. We train the Graph-ResNet together with GCN and convolutional neural network (CNN) benchmark models on Moscow traﬃc data and use them to ﬁrst predict the traﬃc in Moscow and then to predict the traﬃc in Berlin and Istanbul. The results suggest that the graph-based models have superior generalization properties than CNN-based models for this application. We argue that in contrast to purely image-based approaches, formulating the prediction problem on a graph allows the neural network to learn properties given by the underlying street network. This facilitates the transfer of a learned network to predict the traﬃc status at unknown locations.
