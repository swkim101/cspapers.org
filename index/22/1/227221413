The vehicle simulator aims to provide the user with a driving experience that reproduces the sensations experienced in a real vehicle. The important thing is to duplicate the motion. Therefore various parallel manipulator have been developed like six and three degree of freedom motion platform(vehicle simulator). In this paper, we present kinematic analysis of a manipulator with new type of 2-link structure and motion cueing through inverse kinematics. For accurate calculation, Matlab and a recursive method was used.
