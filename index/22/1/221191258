This presentation provides information on the path taken by a faculty member at a Minority Serving Institution (MSI). She presents the difficulties and opportunities that have been presented to her and, as a role model she has managed to improve the quality of life of her students. Knowing the distribution of the population in computer areas (by race, gender, and other characteristics) is relevant to be able to introduce the concept of diversity, equality, and inclusion and to establish basic strategies to improve these characteristics in the work and study environments for minority populations. On the other hand, it is important to know the types of bias and how this issue has been addressed (successfully and unsuccessfully) in companies related to computing and the impact it generates on diversity, inclusion, and equity. Finally, we will briefly mention how the issue of diversity, inclusion, and bias impacts research results, particularly in data science.
