This is essentially a 'call for research' and collaboration between industry and academia to improve the motivation and performance of software engineers through use of language, words and symbols. How languages and symbols shape the way people think, feel and behave has been a topic of wide research. Words have powerful association with perception and cognition and throughout history, language has been used as a medium for influencing minds and for mass propaganda. While this is widely understood in politics, psychology and sociology, very little research has been to study the implicit and explicit impact of words, phrases and language on the way software engineers think, feel, behave and perform. While software engineering could be seen as a science that lends itself to a formal process and methods, it can also be seen as a craft and art which needs imagination and creativity which in turn are influenced by emotions. We propose some hypotheses, research questions and ideas to trigger formal studies of deeper connections between language/ symbols and software engineers' performance. We also draw inspiration from a wide body of research already conducted in this area which have influenced the field of psychology, sociology and mass communication.
