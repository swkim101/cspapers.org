In the next generation of communication technology, high data rate, low latency communication will be indispensable. In order to achieve those targets, wireless communication technology combined with photonics will have a big potential. In this talk, we will present fiber wireless and optical wireless communications and its key device as the advanced wireless communication technologies. A new device integrated with a 100 GHz uni-travelling carrier photodetector and a 100 GHz pHEMT amplifier will be introduced for high data rate fiber wireless communication application beyond 10 Gbps. For optical wireless communication applications, a new two-dimensional photodetector array device will be introduced and the link performances will be discussed.
