Similarity analysis plays an important role in automated program repair by finding the correct solution earlier. However, the effectiveness of similarity is mostly validated using common benchmark Defects4J which consists of 6 large projects. To mitigate the threat of generalizability, this study examines the performance of similarity in repairing small programs. For this purpose, existing syntactic and semantic similarity based approaches, as well as a new technique of combining both similarities, are used. These approaches are evaluated using QuixBugs, a dataset of diverse type bugs from 40 small programs. These techniques fix bugs faster by validating fewer patches than random patch selection based approach. Thus, it proves the effectiveness of similarity in repairing small programs.
