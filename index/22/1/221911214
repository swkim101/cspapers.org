Enforcing security on IoT devices is not an easy task, due to several vulnerabilities in many products that reach consumer shelves. With the rapid growth of the IoT market in the recent past there are specific network attacks targeting IoT devices, thus it is paramount to create mechanisms aiming this niche. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS, or IDS for short) can be used to employ defenses and detect anomalous traffic on IoT networks. However, due to the nature of these tools and the typical sysdamin users they target, usability is not one of the main concerns, with tools usually available through console and also demanding very specific network knowledge market. Since a large share of the IoT market is represented by consumers on Smart Home contexts, usability must be treated as a crucial feature on IDS systems that target IoT environments. We present a user-friendly approach that helps writing rules to enforce the detection of anomalous behavior on network traffic in IoT networks. This approach was applied in our platform that works as an IDS system monitoring network traffic that continuously applies rules programmed by its users or administrators.
