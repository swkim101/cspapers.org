This paper focuses on the design and manufacture of the carrier phase modulation of satelliteâ€™s transmitter at S band. Unlike other traditional carrier phase modulators, this modulator was designed with the direct RF input. The high frequency signal was directly modulated through this carrier phase modulation. The direct brings many advantages, such as: smaller size, lower cost, easier integration, easier replacement, etc. But it also cause the signal to be greatly attenuated. To overcome this disadvantage, the authors have used a suitable power amplification solution to compensate for these losses. This design achieved the low conversion loss and wide bandwidth to satisfy not only the requirements of Vietnamese MicroSatellite but also other satellite in S band.
