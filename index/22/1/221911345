Mobile app stores are available in over 150 countries, allowing users from all over the world to leave public reviews of downloaded apps. Previous studies have shown that such reviews can serve as sources of requirements and suggested that users from different countries have different needs and expectations regarding the same app. However, the tremendous quantity of reviews from multiple countries, as well as several other factors, complicates identifying country-specific app feature requests. In this work, we present a simple approach to address this through NLP-based analysis and discuss some of the challenges involved in using the NLP-based analysis for this task.
