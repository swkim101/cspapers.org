This paper presents the active suspension system (ASS) control method using the adaptive cascade control scheme. The control scheme is implemented by two control loops, the inner control loop and outer control loop are designed respectively. The inner control loop uses the pole assignment method in order to move the poles of the original system to desired poles respect to the required performance of the suspension system. To design the controller in the inner loop, the model without the noise caused by the road profile and velocity of the car is used. The outer control loop then designed with an adaptive mechanism calculates the active control force to compensate for the vibrations caused by the road profile and velocity of the car. The control force is determined by the error between states of the reference model and states of suspension systems, the reference model is the model of closed-loop with inner control loop without the noise. The simulation results implemented by using the practice date of the road profile show that the capability of oscillation decrease for ASS is quite efficient.
