Searching on the Web has become an essential part of learning, and bookmarking is a way to remember relevant and interesting sites. Even though bookmarking systems have been around since the dawn of the Web, they have not evolved much in the last 20 years. In this paper, we introduce LogCanvas v2, a new and extended design of the search history interface, intended to capture the search and learning process in our Learnweb educational platform. Our new interface focuses on usersâ€™ queries rather than just the browsed webpages, enabling users to reconstruct the searching, browsing and learning process. Also, it helps them to re-find the information they need and annotate the useful information. We hypothesize that search learning with annotation capabilities can be achieved in our platform. We finish the paper with a detailed description of a learning scenario and the benefits of the learning process in our platform.
