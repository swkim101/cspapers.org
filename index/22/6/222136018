The widespread deployment of exploit mitigations such as CFI and shadow stacks are making code-reuse attacks increasingly difficult. This has forced adversaries to consider data-only attacks against which the venerable ASLR remains the primary deployed defense.Data-Space Randomization (DSR) techniques raise the bar against data-only attacks by making it harder for adversaries to inject malicious data flows into vulnerable applications. DSR works by masking memory load and store instructions. Masks are chosen (i) to not interfere with intended data flows and (ii) such that masking likely interferes with unintended flows introduced by malicious program inputs. In this paper, we show two new attacks that bypass all existing static DSR approaches; one that directly discloses memory and another using speculative execution. We then present CoDaRR, the first dynamic DSR scheme resilient to disclosure attacks. CoDaRR continuously rerandomizes the masks used in loads and stores, and re-masks all memory objects to remain transparent w.r.t. program execution. Our evaluation confirms that CoDaRR successfully thwarts these attacks with limited run-time overhead in standard benchmarks as well as real-world applications.
