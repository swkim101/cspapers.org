In Search as Learning (SAL) research, when and how learning occurs during the search process has been a focus that attracts research attention. The goal of this study is to explore and characterize searchers’ knowledge change patterns in the context of learning-related tasks from a process perspective. A user experiment was conducted, and participants were asked to search for two learning-related search tasks in a laboratory environment, and draw mind maps before and during search to keep a record of what they know about the task. Searchers’ knowledge change behaviors during the search process were extracted from their mind maps and analyzed based on the "Actions-Tactics-Strategies (ATS)" research path. In this study, we report current preliminary analysis, which discovered twenty-five types of knowledge change actions, and identified eight types of knowledge change tactics using bottom-up clustering methods. The findings are the basis for our further exploration of searchers’ learning strategies during the whole session, also present a complete behavioral and cognitive picture of searchers’ knowledge change process, for search systems providing assistance at different stages of searching and learning.
