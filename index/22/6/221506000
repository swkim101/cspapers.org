This paper presents a platform for engaging in global health challenges, captured in the form of an OpenAI Gym styled environment. This platform has been used in three competitive challenges in 2019, and exposes a novel application domain for RL practitioners, along with the potential for signiﬁcant social and scientiﬁc impact. While the platform has been demonstrated with problem formulations in global health, it is principally designed to facilitate general learning from simulation in a more abstract manner.
