Electric motors have been widely used as the actuators of robot and automation systems. This paper aims at achieving the high-precision position control of motor drive systems. For this purpose, a robust control scheme is presented by combining the internal model principle, the sliding mode technique and the extended state observer (ESO). The PID-type controller is firstly designed by using the internal model control (IMC) rules. Since the analysis of the IMC system is performed via a sliding surface, a robust sliding mode control (SMC) law is then synthesized to enhance the control ability of the system to uncertainties. However, this robust solution should make a trade-off between the chattering attenuation and the control accuracy. To handle this drawback, a linear ESO is employed to compensate the modeling errors for a higher control accuracy. The stability analysis is provided via a Lyapunov-based method, and the superiority of the proposed approach was validated by comparative experiments on a motor drive platform.
