Reconfiguring shapes of objects enables transforming existing passive objects with robotic functionalities, e.g., a transformable coffee cup holder can be attached to a chair's armrest, a piggy bank can reach out an arm to 'steal' coins. Despite the advance in end-user 3D design and fabrication, it remains challenging for non-experts to create such 'transformables' using existing tools due to the requirement of specific engineering knowledge such as mechanisms and robotic design. We present Romeo -- a design tool for creating transformables to robotically augment objects' default functionalities. Romeo allows users to transform an object into a robotic arm by expressing at a high level what type of task is expected. Users can select which part of the object to be transformed, specify motion points in space for the transformed part to follow and the corresponding action to be taken. Romeo then automatically generates a robotic arm embedded in the transformable part ready for fabrication. A design session validated this tool where participants used Romeo to accomplish controlled design tasks and to open-endedly create coin-stealing piggy banks by transforming 3D objects of their own choice.
