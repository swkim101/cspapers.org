We revisit the problem of counting the number of distinct elements F 0 ( D ) in a data stream D , over a domain [ u ] . We propose an ( ε, δ ) -differentially private algorithm that approximates F 0 ( D ) within a factor of (1 ± γ ) , and with additive error of O ( (cid:112) ln(1 /δ ) /ε ) , using space O (ln(ln( u ) /γ ) /γ 2 ) . We improve on the prior work at least quadratically and up to exponentially, in terms of both space and additive error. Our additive error guarantee is optimal up to a factor of O ( (cid:112) ln(1 /δ )) , and the space bound is optimal up to a factor of O (cid:16) min (cid:110) ln (cid:16) ln( u ) γ (cid:17) , 1 γ 2 (cid:111)(cid:17) . We assume the existence of an ideal uniform random hash function, and ignore the space required to store it. We later relax this requirement by assuming pseudo-random functions and appealing to a computational variant of differential privacy, SIM-CDP. Our algorithm is built on top of the celebrated Flajolet-Martin (FM) sketch. We show that FM-sketch is differentially private as is, as long as there are ≈ (cid:112) ln(1 /δ ) / ( εγ ) distinct elements in the data set. Along the way, we prove a structural result showing that the maximum of k i.i.d. random variables is statistically close (in the sense of ε -differential privacy) to the maximum of ( k + 1) i.i.d. samples from the same distribution, as long as k = Ω (cid:0) 1 ε (cid:1) . Finally, experiments show that our algorithms introduces error within
