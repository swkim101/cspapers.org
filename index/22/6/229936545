This paper describes basic implementation of an embedded controller board based on a hybrid architecture equipped with an Intel FPGA SoC and an NVIDIA GPU SoC. Embedded distributed network involving motor-drivers or other embedded boards is constructed with low-latency optical transmission link. The central controller for high-level motion planning is connected via Gigabit Ethernet. The controller board with the hybrid architecture provides lower-latency feedback control performance. Computing performance of the FPGA SoC, the GPU SoC, and the central controller is evaluated by computation time of matrix multiplication. Then, the total feedback latency is estimated to show the performance of the hybrid architecture.
