Document-level relation extraction aims to extract relations among entities within a document. Different from sentence-level relation extraction, it requires reasoning over multiple sentences across a document. In this paper, we propose Graph Aggregation-and-Inference Network (GAIN) featuring double graphs. GAIN first constructs a heterogeneous mention-level graph (hMG) to model complex interaction among different mentions across the document. It also constructs an entity-level graph (EG), based on which we propose a novel path reasoning mechanism to infer relations between entities. Experiments on the public dataset, DocRED, show GAIN achieves a significant performance improvement (2.85 on F1) over the previous state-of-the-art. Our code is available at this https URL .
