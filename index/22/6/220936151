In view of the difficulty in reconstructing object details in point cloud completion, we propose a shape prior learning method for object completion. The shape priors include geometric information in both complete and the partial point clouds. We design a feature alignment strategy to learn the shape prior from complete points, and a coarse to fine strategy to incorporate partial prior in the fine stage. To learn the complete objects prior, we first train a point cloud auto-encoder to extract the latent embeddings from complete points. Then we learn a mapping to transfer the point features from partial points to that of the complete points by optimizing feature alignment losses. The feature alignment losses consist of a L2 distance and an adversarial loss obtained by Maximum Mean Discrepancy Generative Adversarial Network (MMD-GAN). The L2 distance optimizes the partial features towards the complete ones in the feature space, and MMD-GAN decreases the statistical distance of two point features in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We achieve state-of-the-art performances on the point cloud completion task. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiaogangw/point-cloud-completion-shape-prior.
