This paper presents a preliminary study of an Aerial Manipulator suspended by a spring to a robotic carrier. The suspended aerial manipulator is actuated by six pairs of contra-rotating propellers generating a 6-DoF wrench. Simulations show path following results using a computed torque (feedback linearization) control strategy. Active vibration canceling is validated experimentally on a first prototype.
