Drone racing has become one of the challenging topics in robotics and machine learning because such a drone requires to equip with high performing modules that carry out demanding tasks, such as obstacle avoidance, mapping, and planning. In addition, one of the most crucial aspects of the racing drone is its speed. However, this is the somewhat less studied area compared to conventional topics such as obstacle avoidance and path-ﬁnding, probably because designing a loss function for the speed optimization with the gradient-based method is diﬃcult. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary scheme for optimizing the speed-related parameters for shortening the travel time rather than using the gradient-based loss for them. For the planning part, we use an online learning method with the racing parameter optimization. Therefore, our approach is to combine evolutionary algorithms for speed optimization and gradient-based online learning, achieving ﬁrst place in Tier 2 and Tier 3 in Game of Drones competition at NeurIPS 2019.
