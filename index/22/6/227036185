The adoption of low latency persistent memory modules (PMMs) upends the long-established model of remote storage for distributed ﬁle systems. Instead, by colocating computation with PMM storage, we can provide applications with much higher IO performance, sub-second application failover, and strong consistency. To demonstrate this, we built the As-sise distributed ﬁle system, based on a persistent, replicated coherence protocol that manages client-local PMM as a lin-earizable and crash-recoverable cache between applications and slower (and possibly remote) storage. Assise maximizes locality for all ﬁle IO by carrying out IO on process-local, socket-local, and client-local PMM whenever possible. Assise minimizes coherence overhead by maintaining consistency at IO operation granularity, rather than at ﬁxed block sizes. We compare Assise to Ceph/BlueStore, NFS, and Octopus on a cluster with Intel Optane DC PMMs and SSDs for common cloud applications and benchmarks, such as LevelDB, Postﬁx, and FileBench. We ﬁnd that Assise improves write latency up to 22 × , throughput up to 56 × , fail-over time up to 103 × , and scales up to 6 × better than its counterparts, while providing stronger consistency semantics.
