Unlike large and dangerous industrial robots at production lines in factories that are strictly fenced off, collaborative robots are smaller and safer and can be installed adjacent to human workers and collaborate with them. However, controlling and teaching new moves to collaborative robots can be difficult and time-consuming when using existing methods, such as pressing buttons on a teaching pendant and physically grabbing and moving the robot via direct teaching. We present Robot Telekinesis, a novel robot interaction technique that lets the user remotely control the movement of the end effector of a robot arm with unimanual and bimanual hand gestures that closely resemble handling a physical object. Through formal evaluation, we show that using a teaching pendant is slow and confusing and that direct teaching is fast and intuitive but physically demanding. Robot Telekinesis is as fast and intuitive as direct teaching without the need for physical contact or physical effort.
