In this paper, an automated tracking system with head and tail recognition for time-lapse observation of free-moving C. elegans is presented. In microscale field, active C. elegans can move out of the view easily without an automated tracking system because of the narrow field of view and rapid speed of C. elegans. In our previous works, we constructed an automated platform with 3D freedom to track centroid region of the nematode successfully. However, tracking time was not long enough to support a full time-lapse observation. Our proposed system in this study integrate the detection method in horizontal plane with depth evaluation more tightly. Tracking time and response speed have been greatly improved. Besides, we make full use of curvature calculation to make the system recognize the head and tail of C. elegans and the recognition rate can be up to 95%. The results demonstrate that the system can fully achieve automated long-term tracking of a free-living nematode and will be a nice tool for C. elegans behavioral analysis.
