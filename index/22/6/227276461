Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have become effective models for graph classiﬁcation. Similar to many deep networks, GCNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on graph topology and node attributes. Recently, a number of effective attack and defense algorithms have been developed, but certiﬁcates of robustness against topological perturbations are currently available only for PageRank and label/feature propagation, while none has been designed for GCNs. We propose the ﬁrst algorithm for certifying the robustness of GCNs to topological attacks in the application of graph classiﬁcation . Our method is based on Lagrange dual-ization and convex envelope, which result in tight approximation bounds that are efﬁciently computable by dynamic programming. When used in conjunction with robust training, it allows an increased number of graphs to be certiﬁed as robust.
