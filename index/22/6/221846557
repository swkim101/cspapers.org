Exosuits can reduce metabolic demand and improve gait. Controllers explicitly derived from biological mechanisms that reflect the user's joint or muscle dynamics should in theory allow for individualized assistance and enable adaptation to changing gait. With the goal of developing an exosuit control strategy based on muscle power, we present an approach for estimating, at real time rates, when the soleus muscle begins to generate positive power. A low-profile ultrasound system recorded B-mode images of the soleus in walking individuals. An automated routine using optical flow segmented the data to a normalized gait cycle and estimated the onset of concentric contraction at real-time rates (~130Hz). Segmentation error was within 1% of the gait cycle compared to using ground reaction forces. Estimation of onset of concentric contraction had a high correlation (R2=0.92) and an RMSE of 2.6% gait cycle relative to manual estimation. We demonstrated the ability to estimate the onset of concentric contraction during fixed speed walking in healthy individuals that ranged from 39.3% to 45.8% of the gait cycle and feasibility in two persons post-stroke walking at comfortable walking speed. We also showed the ability to measure a shift in onset timing to 7% earlier when the biological system adapts from level to incline walking. Finally, we provided an initial evaluation for how the onset of concentric contraction might be used to inform exosuit control in level and incline walking.
