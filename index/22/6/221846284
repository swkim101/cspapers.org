The human-robot collaboration is a promising and challenging field of robotics research. One of the main collaboration tasks is the object co-manipulation where the human and robot are in a continuous physical interaction and forces exerted must be handled. This involves some issues known in robotics as physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI), where human safety and interaction comfort are required. Moreover, a definition of interaction quality metrics would be relevant.In the current work, the assessment of Human-Robot object co-manipulation task was explored through the proposed metrics of interaction quality, based on human forces throughout the movement. This analysis is based on co-manipulation of objects with different dynamical properties (weight and inertia), with and without including these properties knowledge in the robot control law. Here, the human is a leader of task and the robot the follower without any information of the human trajectory and movement profile. For the robot control law, a well-known impedance control was applied on a 7-dof Kuka LBR iiwa 14 R820 robot.Results show that the consideration of object dynamical properties in the robot control law is crucial for a good and more comfortable interaction. Besides, human efforts are more significant with a higher no-considered weight, whereas it remains stable when these weights were considered.
