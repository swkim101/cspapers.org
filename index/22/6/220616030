Representing time-dependent factual knowledge in RDF and OWL has become increasingly important in recent times. Extending OWL relation instances or RDF triples with further temporal arguments is usually realized through new individuals that hide the range arguments of the extended relation. As a result, reasoning and querying with such representations is extremely complex, expensive, and error-prone. In this paper, we discuss several well-known approaches to this problem and present their pros and cons. Three of them are compared in more detail, both on a theoretical and on a practical level. We also present schemata for translating triple-based encodings into general tuples, and vice versa. Concerning query time, our preliminary measurements have shown that a general tuple-based approach can easily outperform triple-based encodings by several orders of magnitude.
