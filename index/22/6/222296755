Future NoCs should be highly flexible to adapt to communication demands to achieve high scalability and low power consumption. However, the flexibility is still quite limited by the high complexity of reconfiguration for globally reconfigured channels. In this paper, we propose to augment a router-based buffered NoC with a reconfigurable ring architecture by exploiting cycle decomposition of a torus bufferless network. At runtime, the topologies of the rings can be reconfigured according to the workloads by choosing different cycle decompositions of the torus network. Because the shapes of the rings are restricted to a specified regular shape, the reconfiguration time can be reduced to a linear complexity with respect to network size, and the reconfiguration algorithm can be implemented in a distributed hardware. The experimental results show that the reconfigurable rings provide 54% and 26% improvements on packet latency and static power saving, respectively, for realistic workloads.
