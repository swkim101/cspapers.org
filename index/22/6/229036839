 Expanding on previous work of automating functional modeling, we have developed a more informed automation approach by assigning a weighted confidence metric to the wide variety of data in a design repository. Our work focuses on automating what we call linear functional chains, which are a component-based section of a full functional model. We mine the Design Repository to find correlations between component and function and flow. The automation algorithm we developed organizes these connections by component-function-flow frequency (CFF frequency), thus allowing the creation of linear functional chains. In previous work, we found that CFF frequency is the best metric in formulating the linear functional chain for an individual component; however, we found that this metric did not account for prevalence and consistency in the Design Repository data. To better understand our data, we developed a new metric, which we refer to as weighted confidence, to provide insight on the fidelity of the data, calculated by taking the harmonic mean of two metrics we extracted from our data, prevalence, and consistency. This method could be applied to any dataset with a wide range of individual occurrences. The contribution of this research is not to replace CFF frequency as a method of finding the most likely component-function-flow correlations but to improve the reliability of the automation results by providing additional information from the weighted confidence metric. Improving these automation results, allows us to further our ultimate objective of this research, which is to enable designers to automatically generate functional models for a product given constituent components.
