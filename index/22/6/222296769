Many industrial players are currently challenged in building distributed CPS and IoT applications with stringent endto-end QoS requirements. Examples are Vehicle-to-X applications, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) or functionalities in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Currently, there is no comprehensive solution allowing to efficiently program, deploy, and operate such distributed applications. This paper will focus on real-time concerns, in building distributed CPS and IoT systems. Thereby, the focus lies, on the one hand, on mechanisms required inside of the IoT (compute) nodes, and, on the other hand, on communication protocols such as TSN and 5G connecting them. In the authorsâ€™ view, the required building blocks for a first end-to-end technology stack are available. However, their integration into a holistic framework is missing.
