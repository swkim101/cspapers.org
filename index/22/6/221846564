In this paper we propose an algorithm to actively control the distance of a motor-propeller system (MPS) to a large obstacle using data from a single microphone. The method is based upon a broadband constructive/destructive interference pattern across the audible frequency band that is present when the MPS is near an obstacle. By taking the difference between the power spectrum in the obstacle-free case and the spectrum when recording near an obstacle, a broadband oscillation with respect to frequency is revealed. The frequency of this oscillation is linearly-related to the distance from the microphone to the wall. We present both static and dynamic experiments showcasing the ability of the proposed method to estimate the distance to a wall as well as actively control it.
