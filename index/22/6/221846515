Deep Reinforcement Learning has been used to exploit specific environments, but has difficulty transferring learned policies to new situations. This issue poses a problem for practical applications of Reinforcement Learning, as real-world scenarios may introduce unexpected differences that drastically reduce policy performance. We propose the use of differentiated sub-policies governed by a hierarchical controller to support adaptation in such scenarios. We also introduce a confidence- based training process for the hierarchical controller which improves training stability and convergence times. We evaluate these methods in a new Capture the Flag environment designed to explore adaptation in autonomous multi-agent settings.
