Three polymers containing different numbers of thiophene groups were constructed. Degradation
experiments on the aqueous solutions of tetracycline and norfloxacin revealed that the polymer
with three thiophene groups in the monomer indicated the best degradation efficiency of
73.7% for tetracycline and 56.9% for norfloxacin. Moreover, this polymer had a relatively stronger
ability to separate and transport photocharging carriers under visible light. Therefore, the photocatalytic
performance of conjugated polymers could be regulated by changing the number of characteristic
groups.



Antibiotic residues in the environment are considered as one of the most serious
sources of environmental pollution. Although catalyst photodegradation is regarded as the most
promising strategy to solve environmental pollution-related problems, it still requires new and
advanced photocatalysts.



To design new organic conjugated material structures.



Three polymers (ThME-1, ThME-2, and ThME-3) were prepared by the
condensation of melamine with 2, 5-thiophenedicarboxaldehyde, thieno[3, 2-b]thiophene-2,
5-dicarbaldehyde, and dithieno[3, 2-b:2’, 3’-d]thiophene-2, 6-dicarbaldehyde. The photocatalytic
performance of these polymers was investigated by testing their diffused light absorption capacity,
photocurrent response, AC impedance, specific surface area, fluorescence, and thermal stability.



ThME-3, containing three thiophene groups in the monomer, manifested the best degradation
efficiency of 73.7% for tetracycline and 56.9% for norfloxacin.



The photocatalytic performance of conjugated polymers could be regulated by changing
the number of characteristic groups.
