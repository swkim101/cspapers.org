This paper presents an extension of a multifactor recommendation approach based on user tagging with term neighbours. Neighbours of words in tag vectors and documents provide for hitting larger set of documents and not only those matching with direct tag vectors or content of the documents. Tag popularity, tag representativeness and tag similarity are applied similarly as in the original approach but also to neighbours. By doing so, we treat the documents which have been added to the result set by considering word neighbours in the same way as the others. This provides an advantage in the situations where the quality of tags is lower. We discuss the approach on the examples from the existing Medworm system to indicate the usefulness of the approach.
