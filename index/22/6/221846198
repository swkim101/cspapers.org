For those with irregular gait, re-calibration of motor control strategies and retraining of coordination are key goals. Thoughtful external forces or resistances during repetitive tasks can reprogram motor control patterns and strategies. Prior work in our lab has utilized this theory to improve gait in various patient groups using the Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD), a treadmill-based robotic trainer. In this paper, we propose a new, portable extension of the TPAD, which relies on an open-loop, forward kinematics based controller to remove the restriction of walking in the laboratory on a treadmill, and therefore accommodates overground ambulation. To evaluate the effects of this new control scheme and the effects of the users holding the mobile TPAD frame, a dataset of walking in four conditions was collected from eight healthy individuals. When applying a constant pelvic loading force of 10% body weight, the mean ground reaction force increased by 8.2±7.7% when the individual holds the walker frame and 11.1±7.8% when no hand contact is made. The mobile TPAD was shown to still induce a targeted loading on individuals during treadmill walking. The validation of this mobile device’s controller and characterization of holding the frame allow overground studies to be conducted, and now opens the door to new training paradigms for overground gait training.
