Software plays a dominant role in modern automotive systems. The rapid increase of automotive software brings various challenges for automotive system development. To ensure the safety and reliability of automotive software systems, new methods, models and tools are used in the software development. In this paper, we propose an approach of source code testing for automotive software by use of the UPPAAL model. UPPAAL, as a model checker, has been applied successfully in real-time controllers. We extend the application fields of the UPPAAL model to code testing. If the inputs of software source code and its corresponding UPPAAL model are same, the correctness of the source code can be determined by comparing their output results.
