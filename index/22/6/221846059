In the present paper, we first adopt explicit force control from general robotics and embed it into teleoperation systems to enhance the transparency by reducing the effect of the perceived inertia to the human operator and simultaneously improve contact perception. To ensure stability of the proposed teleoperation system considering time-delays, we propose a sequential design procedure based on time domain passivity approach. Experimental results of master-slave teleoperation system, based on KUKA light-weight-robots, for different values of delays are presented. Comparative analysis is conducted considering two existing approaches, namely 2-channel and 4-channel architecture based bilateral controllers, and its results clearly indicate significant improvement in force transparency owing to the proposed method. The proposed system is finally validated considering a real industrial assembly scenario.
