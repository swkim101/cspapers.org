Carrying payloads in air is a major mission for multirotor aerial robot. However, the presence of payloads on multirotor aerial robot has a risk of degrading the performance of the flight controller. This concern becomes obvious especially when carrying objects not securely attached to the body or performing aerial manipulation. Therefore, controller with the ability to adapt itself to the effects of payloads on flight stability is needed. This paper proposes a novel nonlinear multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) model reference adaptive control (MRAC) system for attitude control of multirotor aerial robots which can dynamically compensate change in the position of center of gravity and inertia caused by payloads. Stability and robustness of the controller are experimentally confirmed in quadrotor and transformable multirotor, and experiments modeling practical applications are conducted for each aerial robot system, proving the utility of the controller.
