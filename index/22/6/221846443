In this work we introduce ModQuad-DoF, a modular flying robotic structure with enhanced capabilities for yaw actuation. We propose a new module design that allows a one degree of freedom relative motion between the flying robot and the cage, with a docking mechanism allowing rigid connections between cages. A novel method of yaw actuation that increases the structure control authority is also presented. Our new method for the structure yaw control relies on the independent roll angles of each one of the modules, instead of the traditional drag moments from the propellers. In this paper, we propose a controller that allows the ModQuad-DoF to control its position and attitude. In our experiments, we tested a different number of modules flying in cooperation and validated the novel yaw actuation method.
