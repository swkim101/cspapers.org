This paper introduces a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for fully-constrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots. The main advantage of the proposed scheme lies in its ability to explicitly handle cable tension limits. Indeed, the cable tension distribution is performed as an integral part of the main control architecture. This characteristic significantly improves the safety of the system. Experimental results demonstrate this advantage addressing a typical pick-and-place task with two different scenarios: nominal cable tension limits and reduced maximum tension. Satisfactory tracking errors were obtained in the first scenario. In the second scenario, the desired trajectory escapes from the workspace defined by the new set of tension limits. The proposed MPC scheme is able to minimize the tracking errors without violating the tension limits. Satisfying results were also obtained regarding robustness against uncertainties on the payload mass.
