Program Overview We received a record number of 446 full-paper submissions (30% higher than MICRO 2019), out of which the program committee selected 82 papers for inclusion in the program â€“ an acceptance rate of 18%. Twenty four papers were withdrawn at various stages during the review process (primarily during the rebuttal period). In addition to the 82 papers, the program also features three keynotes and a track highlighting the ACM Student Research Competition. The keynotes are delivered by Srilatha (Bobbie) Manne, Cristina Silvano, and Rich Wolsky.
