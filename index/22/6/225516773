This article proposes the integration of electromagnetic weapons on a robot, design and construction of an electromagnetic armed robot, autonomous targeting of possible targets with the electromagnetic weapon, and the features a electromagnetic armed safety robot should have. Unlike traditional user-targeted field security robot approaches, the robot mentioned in this study detects potential threats in the task area with image processing and artificial intelligence techniques, so the user can accurately identify and autonomously target targets without the need for controlled targeting.
