In this study, a visual shock absorber capable of adapting to free-fall objects with various weights and speeds is designed and realized. The key element is a magnetic gear to passively absorb shock in the moment of contact, which is difficult for traditional feedback control to deal with. The magnetic gear allows the seamless transfer of control from the non-contact state to the contact state. 1000 Hz high-speed visual object tracking is used for preparation with position and velocity control in the object non-contact state. In the moment of object contact, the high backdrivability of the magnetic gear response by hardware provides high responsiveness to external force. After the impact, the plastic deformation control of a parallel-expressed Maxwell model handles the contact state.
