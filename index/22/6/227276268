Motivated by pricing applications in online advertising, we study a variant of linear regression with a discontinuous loss function that we term Myersonian regression. In this variant, we wish to find a linear function f : R → R that well approximates a set of points (xi, vi) ∈ R × [0, 1] in the following sense: we receive a loss of vi when f(xi) > vi and a loss of vi − f(xi) when f(xi) ≤ vi. This arises naturally in the economic application of designing a pricing policy for differentiated items (where the loss is the gap between the performance of our policy and the optimal Myerson prices). We show that Myersonian regression is NP-hard to solve exactly and furthermore that no fully polynomial-time approximation scheme exists for Myersonian regression conditioned on the Exponential Time Hypothesis being true. In contrast to this, we demonstrate a polynomial-time approximation scheme for Myersonian regression that obtains an m additive approximation to the optimal possible revenue and can be computed in time O(exp(poly(1/ ))poly(m,n)). We show that this algorithm is stable and generalizes well over distributions of samples.
