With the increasing design requirements of modern circuits, a standard-cell library often contains cells of different row heights to address various trade-offs among performance, power, and area. However, maintaining all standard cells with integer multiples of a single-row height could cause some area overheads and increase power consumption. In this paper, we present an analytical placer to directly consider a circuit design with non-integer multiple-height standard cells and additional layout constraints. The region of different cell heights is adaptively generated by the global placement result. In particular, an exact penalty iterative shrinkage and thresholding (EPIST) algorithm is employed to efficiently optimize the global placement problem. The convergence of the algorithm is proved, and the acceleration strategy is proposed to improve the performance of our algorithm. Compared with the state-of-the-art works, experimental results based on the 2017 CAD Contest at ICCAD benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves the best wirelength and area for every benchmark. In particular, our proposed EPIST algorithm provides a new direction for effectively solving large-scale nonlinear optimization problems with non-smooth terms, which are often seen in real-world applications.
