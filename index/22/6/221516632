Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides a visual bridge between a software application and end users, through which they can interact with each other. With the development of technology and aesthetics, the visual effects of the GUI are more and more attracting. However, such GUI complexity posts a great challenge to the GUI implementation. According to our pilot study of crowdtesting bug reports, display issues such as text overlap, blurred screen, missing image always occur during GUI rendering on different devices due to the software or hardware compatibility. They negatively influence the app usability, resulting in poor user experience. To detect these issues, we propose a novel approach, OwlEye, based on deep learning for modelling visual information of the GUI screenshot. Therefore, OwlEye can detect GUIs with display issues and also locate the detailed region of the issue in the given GUI for guiding developers to fix the bug. We manually construct a large-scale labelled dataset with 4,470 GUI screenshots with UI display issues and develop a heuristics-based data augmentation method for boosting the performance of our OwlEye. The evaluation demonstrates that our OwlEye can achieve 85% precision and 84% recall in detecting UI display issues, and 90% accuracy in localizing these issues. We also evaluate OwlEye with popular Android apps on Google Play and F-droid, and successfully uncover 57 previously-undetected UI display issues with 26 of them being confirmed or fixed so far.
