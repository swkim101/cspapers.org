We consider the problem of nonnegative submodular maximization in the online setting. At time step t , an algorithm selects a set S t ∈ C ⊆ 2 V where C is a feasible family of sets. An adversary then reveals a submodular function f t . The goal is to design an efﬁcient algorithm for minimizing the expected approximate regret. In this work, we give a general approach for improving regret bounds in online submodular maximization by exploiting “ﬁrst-order” regret bounds for online linear optimization.
