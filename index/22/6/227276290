Modeling dependencies in multivariate discrete data is a challenging problem, especially in high dimensions. The Potts model is a versatile such model, suitable when each coordinate is a categorical variable. However, the full Potts model has too many parameters to be accurately ﬁt when the number of categories is large. We introduce a variation on the Potts model that allows for general categorical marginals and Ising-type multivariate dependence. This reduces the number of parameters from Ω( d 2 K 2 ) in the full Potts model to O ( d 2 + Kd ) , where K is the number of categories and d is the dimension of the data. We show that the complexity of ﬁtting this new Potts-Ising model is the same as that of an Ising model. In particular, adopting the neighborhood regression framework, the model can be ﬁt by solving d separate logistic regressions. We demonstrate the ability of the model to capture multivariate dependencies in real data by comparing with existing approaches.
