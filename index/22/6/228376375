Despite their overwhelming capacity to overfit, deep neural networks trained by specific optimization algorithms tend to generalize well to unseen data. Recently, researchers explained it by investigating the implicit regularization effect of optimization algorithms. A remarkable progress is the work (Lyu&Li, 2019), which proves gradient descent (GD) maximizes the margin of homogeneous deep neural networks. Except GD, adaptive algorithms such as AdaGrad, RMSProp and Adam are popular owing to their rapid training process. However, theoretical guarantee for the generalization of adaptive optimization algorithms is still lacking. In this paper, we study the implicit regularization of adaptive optimization algorithms when they are optimizing the logistic loss on homogeneous deep neural networks. We prove that adaptive algorithms that adopt exponential moving average strategy in conditioner (such as Adam and RMSProp) can maximize the margin of the neural network, while AdaGrad that directly sums historical squared gradients in conditioner can not. It indicates superiority on generalization of exponential moving average strategy in the design of the conditioner. Technically, we provide a unified framework to analyze convergent direction of adaptive optimization algorithms by constructing novel adaptive gradient flow and surrogate margin. Our experiments can well support the theoretical findings on convergent direction of adaptive optimization algorithms.
