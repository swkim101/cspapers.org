Traditional search engines for life sciences (e.g., PubMed) are designed for document retrieval and do not allow direct retrieval of specific statements. Some of these statements may serve as textual evidence that is key to tasks such as hypothesis generation and new finding validation. We present EVIDENCEMINER, a web-based system that lets users query a natural language statement and automatically retrieves textual evidence from a background corpora for life sciences. EVIDENCEMINER is constructed in a completely automated way without any human effort for training data annotation. It is supported by novel data-driven methods for distantly supervised named entity recognition and open information extraction. The entities and patterns are pre-computed and indexed offline to support fast online evidence retrieval. The annotation results are also highlighted in the original document for better visualization. EVIDENCEMINER also includes analytic functionalities such as the most frequent entity and relation summarization. EVIDENCEMINER can help scientists uncover important research issues, leading to more effective research and more in-depth quantitative analysis. The system of EVIDENCEMINER is available at https://evidenceminer.firebaseapp.com/.
