Given an edge-weighted directed graph G , the Negative-k -Cycle problem asks whether G contains a negative-weight cycle with at most k edges. For k = 3 the problem is known as the NegativeTriangle problem and is equivalent to all-pairs shortest paths (and to min-plus matrix multiplication) and solvable in O ( n 3 ) time. In this paper, we consider the case of directed planar graphs. We show that the Negative-k -Cycle problem can be solved in min { O ( nk 2 log n ) , O ( n 2 ) } time. Assuming the min-plus convolution conjecture, we then show, for k > n 1 / 3 that there is no algorithm polynomially faster than O ( n 1 . 5 √ k ) , and for k ≤ n 1 / 3 that our O ( nk 2 log n ) upper bound is essentially tight. The latter gives the ﬁrst non-trivial tight bounds for a planar graph problem in P. Our lower bounds are obtained by introducing a natural problem on matrices that generalizes both min-plus matrix multiplication and min-plus convolution, and whose complexity lies between the complexities of these two problems.
