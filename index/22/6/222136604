In this talk, I will talk about challenges and exciting new opportunities at the intersection of AI and Security, how AI and deep learning can enable better security, and how Security can enable better AI. In particular, I will talk about secure deep learning and challenges and approaches to ensure the integrity of decisions made by deep learning. I will also give an overview on challenges and new techniques to enable privacy-preserving machine learning. Finally, I will conclude with future directions at the intersection of AI and Security.
