Attention modules have been demonstrated effective in strengthening the representation ability of a neural network via reweighting spatial or channel features or stacking both operations sequentially. However, designing the structures of different attention operations requires a bulk of computation and extensive expertise. In this paper, we devise an Auto Learning Attention (AutoLA) method, which is the ﬁrst attempt on automatic attention design. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne a novel attention module named high order group attention (HOGA) as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each group represents a node, and each edge represents an operation of heterogeneous attentions. A typical HOGA architecture can be searched automatically via the differential AutoLA method within 1 GPU day using the ResNet-20 backbone on CIFAR10. Further, the searched attention module can generalize to various backbones as a plug-and-play component and outperforms popular manually designed channel and spatial attentions for many vision tasks, including image classiﬁcation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet, object detection and human keypoint detection on COCO dataset.
