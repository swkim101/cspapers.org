Effective intersection control can play an important role in reducing trafﬁc congestion and associated vehicular emissions. This is vitally needed in developing countries, where air pollution is reaching life threatening levels. This paper presents EcoLight intersection control for developing regions, where budget is constrained and network connectivity is very poor. EcoLight learns effective control ofﬂine using state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning methods, but deploys highly efﬁcient runtime control algorithms on low cost embedded devices that work stand-alone on road without server connectivity. EcoLight optimizes both average case and worst case values of throughput, travel time and other metrics, as evaluated on open-source datasets from New York and on a custom developing region dataset.
