This work presents the concept of energy-based safety for series-elastic actuation. Generic actuation passivity and safety is treated, defining several energy storage and power flow properties related to passivity. Safe behaviour is not guaranteed by passivity, but can be guaranteed by energy and power limits that adapt the nominal behaviour of an impedance controller. A discussion on power flows in series-elastic actuation is presented and an appropriate controller is developed. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the energy-based safety in elastic actuation.
