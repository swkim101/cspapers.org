In this work, we present the concept, design, and initial testing of a single actuator peristaltic motion robot for subsurface geological exploration and device emplacement. We are researching unconventional methods, including robotics, for the production of energy from oil reservoirs that do not liberate carbon to the atmosphere. For such application, we are developing autonomous robots for data acquisition and tool transportation inside petroleum reservoirs. The mechanism described in this work is a cam-follower configuration worm robot that utilizes peristaltic displacement. We confirmed that the mechanism works on a plane surface and in non-consolidated media.
