We present A-QED (Accelerator-Quick Error Detection), a new approach for pre-silicon formal verification of stand-alone hardware accelerators. A-QED relies on bounded model checking -- however, it does not require extensive design-specific properties or a full formal design specification. While A- QED is effective for both RTL and high-level synthesis (HLS) design flows, it integrates seamlessly with HLS flows. Our A-QED results on several hardware accelerator designs demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness: 1. A-QED detected all bugs detected by conventional verification flow. 2. A-QED detected bugs that escaped conventional verification flow. 3. A-QED improved verification productivity dramatically, by 30X, in one of our case studies (1 person-day using A-QED vs. 30 person-days using conventional verification flow). 4. A-QED produced short counterexamples for easy debug (37X shorter on average vs. conventional verification flow).
