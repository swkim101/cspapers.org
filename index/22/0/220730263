Group recommendation aims to suggest preferred items to a group of users rather than to an individual user. Most existing methods on group recommendation directly learn theinherent interests of groups and users orinherent features of items, i.e., independently modeling the inherent embeddings of groups, users or items. However, the independent view severely suffers from the cold-start problem when making recommendations for occasional groups that are temporally formed by a set of users and have few interactions on items. Actually, the groups, users and items are interdependent because they interact with one another. The interdependencies constitute an interaction graph that provides multiple views to model the embeddings of groups, users and items from their interacting counterparts to improve recommendation for occasional groups. To this end, we propose a model, named GAME to learn the Graphical and Attentive Multi-view Embeddings (i.e., representations) for the groups, users and items from the independent view and counterpart views based on the interaction graph. In the counterpart views, the embedding of a group, user or item is aggregated from the interacting counterparts based on an attention mechanism that derives the adaptive weight for each counterpart. For instance, a user's embedding may be aggregated from her interacting items or groups. Further, GAME applies neural collaborative filtering to investigate the interactions between the multi-view embeddings of groups (or users) and items for group recommendation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real datasets. The experimental results show that GAME outperforms other state-of-the-art models, especially on both cold-start groups (i.e., occasional groups) and cold-start items.
