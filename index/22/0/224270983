Research on data dependencies has experienced a revival as dependency violations can reveal errors in data. Several data cleaning systems use a DBMS to detect such violations. While DBMSs are efficient for some kinds of data dependencies (e.g., unique constraints), they are likely to fall short of satisfactory performance for more complex ones, such as order dependencies. We present a novel system to efficiently detect violations of denial constraints (DCs), a well-known formalism that generalizes many kinds of data dependencies. We describe its execution model, which operates on a compressed block of tuples at-a-time, and we present various algorithms that take advantage of the predicate form in the DCs to provide effective code patterns. Our experimental evaluation includes comparisons with DBMS-based and DC-specific approaches, real-world and synthetic data, and various kinds of DCs. It shows that our system is up to three orders-of-magnitude faster than the other solutions, especially for datasets with a large number of tuples and DCs that identify a large number of violations.
