ARCAR is a proof-of-concept headset-based mixed reality experience, for use by a driver in full control of a moving vehicle. The functional prototype has been implemented using a high end video pass-through mixed reality headset, and tested on roads (closed to external traffic) at conventional driving speeds. Our implementation embodies acceptable solutions to a number of current challenges that have been in the way of in-car XR applications, and enables a wealth of research. ARCAR is intended to serve as a research platform in the near future, enabling investigations on topics which include safety, design, perceived quality, and consumer applications.
