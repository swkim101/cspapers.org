There is a long and unresolved debate between the symbolic and sub-symbolic methods. However, in recent years, there is a push towards in-between methods. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of the symbolic, sub-symbolic and in-between approaches focused in the domain of knowledge graphs, namely, schema representation , schema matching , knowledgegraphcompletion , linkprediction , entityresolution , entityclassification and tripleclassification . Wecriticallypresent key characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of the main algorithms in each domain, and review the use of these methods in knowledge graph related applications.
