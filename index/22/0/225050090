Existing moving target detection methods mainly include inter-frame differences, background differences, optical flow and so on. For the recognition of human motions in the process of human-computer collaboration, existing algorithms are usually difficult to meet the requirements of real-time processing and easily interfered by lighting or image noises. In this paper, a method for establishing a static background model based on pixel histogram is proposed. The effect of moving targets and noises on the background model is excluded due to the selectivity of the new algorithm to the gray values, so it can detect the real background more reliably. Compared with other moving target detection methods, this method has the characteristics of fast speed, strong anti-interference ability, and the ability to identify human body movement quickly and accurately.
