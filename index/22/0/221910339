Traditional threat modeling approaches such as Microsoft's STRIDE rely on Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) as the main input. As DFDs are constructed from only five distinct model element types, these system models are deliberately kept simple. While this lowers the bar for practical adoption, there are a number of significant drawbacks. In this position paper, we identify and illustrate four key shortcomings of DFD models when used for security threat modeling, related to the inadequate representation of security concepts, data elements, abstraction levels, and deployment information. Based on these shortcomings, we posit the need for a dedicated, integrated language for threat modeling, and discuss the trade-offs that need to be made between the ease of adoption and the level of support for systematic and repeatable threat modeling.
