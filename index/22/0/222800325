Accurate 3D registration of real and virtual objects is a crucial step in AR, especially when manipulating those objects in space. Previous work simplifies mid-air 3D manipulations by removing one or more degrees of freedom by constraining motion using automatic algorithms. However, when designing objects, limiting the user's actions can affect their creativity. To solve this problem, we present a new system called Context-based 3D Grids that allows users to do precise mid-air 3D manipulations without constraining their actions. Our system creates 3D grids for each object in the scene that change depending on the object pose. Users can display additional reference frames inside the virtual environment using natural hand gestures that are commonly used when designing an object. Our goal is to help users visualize more clearly the spatial relation and the differences in pose and size of the objects.
