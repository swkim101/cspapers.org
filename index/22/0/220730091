Recently session search evaluation has been paid more attention as a realistic search scenario usually involves multiple queries and interactions between users and systems. Evolved from model-based evaluation metrics for a single query, existing session-based metrics also follow a generic framework based on the cascade hypothesis. The cascade hypothesis assumes that lower-ranked search results and later-issued queries receive less attention from users and should therefore be assigned smaller weights when calculating evaluation metrics. This hypothesis gains much success in modeling search users' behavior and designing evaluation metrics, by explaining why users' attention decays on search engine result pages. However, recent studies have found that the recency effect also plays an important role in determining user satisfaction in search sessions. Especially, whether a user feels satisfied in the later-issued queries heavily influences his/her search satisfaction in the whole session. To take both the cascade hypothesis and the recency effect into the design of session search evaluation metrics, we propose Recency-aware Session-based Metrics (RSMs) to simultaneously characterize users' examination process with a browsing model and cognitive process with a utility accumulation model. With both self-constructed and public available user search behavior datasets, we show the effectiveness of proposed RSMs by comparing them with existing session-based metrics in the light of correlation with user satisfaction. We also find that the influence of the cascade and the recency effects varies dramatically among tasks with different difficulties and complexities, which suggests that we should use different model parameters for different types of search tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of investigating and utilizing cognitive effects besides examination hypotheses in search evaluation.
