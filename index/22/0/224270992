Web search is one of the most ubiquitous online activities and often used for learning purposes, i.e., to extend one's knowledge or skills about certain topics or procedures. The importance of learning as an outcome of Web search has been recognized in research at the intersection of information retrieval, human-computer interaction, psychology, and educational sciences. Search as Learning (SAL) research examines relationships between querying, navigation, and reading behavior during Web search and the resulting learning outcomes, and how they can be measured, predicted, and supported. IWILDS aims to provide a platform to the interdisciplinary SAL community, with the objective to bring together interested researchers, provide room for presentation and discussion of novel research insights, and to inspire future directions of SAL research.
