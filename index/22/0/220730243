In this paper, we present the design of QuAChIE, a Question Answering based Chinese Information Extraction system. QuAChIE mainly depends on a well-trained question answering model to extract high-quality triples. The group of head entity and relation are regarded as a question given the input text as the context. For the training and evaluation of each model in the system, we build a large-scale information extraction dataset using Wikidata and Wikipedia pages by distant supervision. The advanced models implemented on top of the pre-trained language model and the enormous distant supervision data enable QuAChIE to extract relation triples from documents with cross-sentence correlations. The experimental results on the test set and the case study based on the interactive demonstration show its satisfactory Information Extraction quality on Chinese document-level texts.
