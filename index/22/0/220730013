In product-to-product search and recommendation, the product image often plays a pivotal role for the user to determine the relevance of that product. The present study investigates the relationship between the users' visual intents (in terms of colour, texture and material, and design) and the amount of user feedback (namely, clicks, likes, and purchases) using real product data and crowdsourcing. Through the analysis, we found that visual relevance (i.e., relevance of a target product with respect to a particular visual intent) correlates with the amount of user feedback, and that visual relevance can be the cause of user feedback.
