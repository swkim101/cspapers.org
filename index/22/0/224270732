Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen categories whose data is unavailable during the training stage. Most existing ZSL algorithms focus on learning an embedding space and determine the classes of test samples according to sample-prototype similarities in this space. However, we observe that, in contrast to the single sample-prototype relationship, an ensemble criterion usually benefits the final classification, just as the saying "more than one". Inspired by this, we introduce a novel cluster-prototype matching (CPM) strategy and propose a ZSL framework based on CPM. Firstly, we learn a mapping between the visual space and the semantic space utilizing a well-established ZSL algorithm. Via the learned mapping, all test samples are projected into the embedding space and clustered in this space. Secondly, two CPM methods, soft-CPM and hard-CPM, are proposed to match clusters and class prototypes, along with cluster-prototype similarities calculated. Finally, the label of each sample is determined by the combination of the sample-prototype similarity and the cluster-prototype similarity. We apply our framework to five basic ZSL methods and compare them with several advanced baselines of ZSL. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of the basic ZSL models and help them achieve or beyond the state-of-the-art.
