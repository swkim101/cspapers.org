We study the problem of deriving geolocations for Wikipedia pages. To this end, we introduce a general four-step process to location derivation, and consider different instantiations of this process, leveraging both textual and categorical data. Extensive experimentation shows that our methods provide good precision-recall trade-offs and improvements over text-only methods. Hence, our system can be used to augment the geographic information of Wikipedia, and to enable more effective geographic information retrieval.
