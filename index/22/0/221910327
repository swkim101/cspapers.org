There is a lack of empirical evidence on software ecosystem health metrics, and a need for operationalizable metrics that describe software ecosystem characteristics. This study unveils a new approach for measuring technical variety concisely. Studies show that a high variety opens up new opportunities and thus, better niche creation, and ultimately, improves software ecosystem health. Four different ecosystems are evaluated, and compared. Variety is measured in relation to robustness, and productivity metrics of the ecosystem to uncover the influence of technical variety on software ecosystems. Technical variety indicates a positive correlation with robustness, however acceptance of this statement is not confirmed with certainty due to a weak relation. Furthermore, significant relations indicate differences between ecosystem types.
