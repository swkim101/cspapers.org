A synergetic control theory (SCT) approach is proposed in this paper to control the longitudinal flight dynamics of a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in the presence of wind disturbances with input constraints. The main goal of this work is to design a synergetic method for the synthesis of nonlinear control systems for a fixed-wing UAV, which guarantees the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop systems when moving along a given trajectory, stability and adaptability with significant nonlinearity of mathematical models for controlling fixed-wing UAVs in the presence of wind disturbances. Furthermore, an important task in the synthesis of control systems for various objects, including UAV, is to take into account constraints on the control inputs of the UAV. The effectiveness of the proposed approach to the synergetic synthesis of control strategies is confirmed by the results of a computer simulation of the synthesized nonlinear vector control system of fixed-wing UAV. The proposed synergetic method of control system synthesis for fixed-wing UAV can be applied for the development of advanced flight simulation and navigation complexes that simulate the fixed-wing UAV behavior in the presence of wind disturbances and serve as a basis for improving the flight performance of the fixed-wing UAV.
