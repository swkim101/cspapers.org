Phishing is one of the most common cyberattacks these days. Attackers constantly look for new techniques to make their campaigns more lucrative by extending the lifespan of phishing pages. To achieve this goal, they leverage different anti-analysis (i.e., evasion) techniques to conceal the malicious content from anti-phishing bots and only reveal the payload to potential victims. In this paper, we study the resilience of anti-phishing entities to three advanced anti-analysis techniques based on human verification: Google re-CAPTCHA, alert box, and session-based evasion. We have designed a framework for performing our testing experiments, deployed 105 phishing websites, and provided each of them with one of the three evasion techniques. In the experiments, we report phishing URLs to major server-side anti-phishing entities (e.g., Google Safe Browsing, NetCraft, APWG) and monitor their occurrence in the blacklists. Our results show that Google Safe Browsing was the only engine that detected all the reported URLs protected by alert boxes. However, none of the anti-phishing engines could detect phishing URLs armed with Google re-CAPTCHA, making it so far the most effective protection solution of phishing content available to malicious actors. Our experiments show that all the major serverside anti-phishing bots only detected 8 out of 105 phishing websites protected by human verification systems. As a mitigation plan, we intend to disclose our findings to the impacted anti-phishing entities before phishers exploit human verification techniques on a massive scale.
