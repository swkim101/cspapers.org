Testing and Debugging is an important part of development in any embedded systems. It provides the significant information about the health of the systems in real time. Onâ€“chip debuggers have certain limitations and constraints, for this reason sometimes external hardware debugger are inevitable to investigate the bugs in a systems. In a RTOS these Hardware debuggers need core information about the RTOS before providing the source of the bugs. This additional or core information regarding the RTOS is referred as "Awareness". The Awareness delivers core information of the Operating system to the debugger to thoroughly investigate the error. This Awareness of RTOS is fed into the debugger prior to the debugging process. In this paper a methodology to implement operating system (OS) awareness for the debugger is presented. A number of case scenarios are also described which validates the implementation of the OS Awareness.
