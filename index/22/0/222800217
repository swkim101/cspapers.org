The bias of news articles can strongly affect the opinions and behaviors of readers, especially if they do not consume sets of articles that represent diverse political perspectives. To mitigate media bias and diversify news consumption, we developed Counterweight---a browser extension that presents different perspectives by recommending articles relevant to the current topic. We provide a platform to encourage a more diversified consumption of news and mitigate the negative effects of media bias.
