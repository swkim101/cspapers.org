Diagnosis prediction aims to forecast diseases that a patient might have in his next hospital visit, which is critical in Clinical Decision Supporting System (CDSS). Existing approaches mainly formulate diagnosis prediction as a multi-label classification problem and use discrete medical codes as major features. While the structural information among medical codes and time series data in clinical data are generally neglected. In this paper, we propose Multi-modal Clinical Data based Hierarchical Multi-label model (MHM) to integrate discrete medical codes, structural information and time series data into the same framework for diagnosis prediction task. Experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate the superiority of proposed MHM over state-of-the-art approaches.
