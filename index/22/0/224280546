Location Based Services (LBS) is a continuous, local, and spatially restricted mobile database system (MDS) technology in the sense of a mobile environment. This domain is associated with many fascinating issues and challenges to be tackled and provided a fertile ground for many researchers and experts to work on it. This paper discusses the issues and challenges derived from the available literature to the research community regarding the latest approaches and experimentation results for location-dependent cache invalidation-replacement, prefetching, location privacy, and map matching (MM) policies. It offers potential future paths for exploring the unanswered questions.
