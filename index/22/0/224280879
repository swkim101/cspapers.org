Pinterest as a popular image search platform has been widely adopted by users. Every day, people come to Pinterest searching for fashion- and home decor-related content. In these domains, users exhibit stable personal tastes. In this paper, we propose a novel search algorithm which can infer user tastes from their past engagement history and tailor the search results to fit their preferences. The online and offline experiments show that our method can efficiently improve user experience and increase user engagements.
