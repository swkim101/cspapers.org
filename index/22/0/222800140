We present PViMat, a portable photovoltaic mat that can recognise six unique useful dynamic hover gestures up to 30 cm above the surface over a large area with more than 97% accuracy. We utilised an off-the-shelf portable and rollable outdoor solar tape and employed it to harvest indoor natural and artificial light energy to trickle charge a LiPo battery for self-powering. We demonstrate a low-power operation technique of continuous charging with DC photocurrent and simultaneous event-driven gesture recognition with AC photocurrent. The PViMat prototype harvests 30 mW in a general livingroom light level of 300 lux and consumes 0.8 mW per gesture. Lastly, we propose applications of PViMat with its large-area, flexible and rollable form-factors and the gesture set.
