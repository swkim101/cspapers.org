Modern users typically open multiple software, websites, and documents for daily tasks. Retrieving previously used digital resources, such as web pages, documents, local files, and software, for knowledge workers is inevitable, but can be time-consuming. People may fail to remember where the resource is. In addition, sometimes, users need to retrieve digital resources across multiple applications to resume a computing task. However, the current methods - bookmarks, file systems, and recent history - for curating such resources are limited in their capacity and dispersed over multiple applications. To address the above problems, we test the idea of curating digital resources by developing Scrapbook, a software that allows users to curate digital resources with screenshots. Scrapbook allows users to take a screenshot of their computer screen and stores metadata of captured applications in the screenshot. Later, users can utilize multimodal (visual and textual) information to retrieve information that they want to recall or to restore the working context of a certain task. In this poster, we acknowledge previous relevant research, introduce ongoing efforts of developing Scrapbook, and share our plan to validate the idea via a user study.
