In many real-world applications, data are collected in the form of a stream, whose feature space can evolve over time. For instance, in the environmental monitoring task, features can be dynamically vanished or augmented due to the existence of expired old sensors and deployed new sensors. Furthermore, besides the evolvable feature space, the data distribution is usually changing in the streaming scenario. When both feature space and data distribution are evolvable, it is quite challenging to design algorithms with guarantees, particularly theoretical understandings of generalization ability. To address this difÔ¨Åculty, we propose a novel discrepancy measure for data with evolving feature space and data distribution, named the evolving discrepancy . Based on that, we present the generalization error analysis, and the theory motivates the design of a learning algo-rithm which is further implemented by deep neural networks. Empirical studies on synthetic data verify the rationale of our proposed discrepancy measure, and extensive experiments on real-world tasks validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
