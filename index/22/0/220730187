A better understanding of users' reading behavior helps improve many information retrieval (IR) tasks, such as relevance estimation and document ranking. Existing research has already leveraged eye movement information to investigate user's reading process during document-level relevance judgments and the findings were adopted to build more effective ranking models. Recently, fine-grained (e.g., passage or sentence level) relevance judgments have been paid much attention to with the requirements in conversational search and QA systems. However, there is still a lack of thorough investigation on user's reading behavior during these kinds of interaction processes. To shed light on this research question, we investigate how users allocate their attention to passages of a document during the relevance judgment process. With the eye-tracking data collected in a laboratory study, we show that users pay more attention to the "key" passages which contain key useful information. Users tend to revisit these key passages several times to accumulate and verify the gathered information. With both content and user behavior features, we find that key passages can be predicted with supervised learning. We believe that this work contributes to better understanding users' reading behavior and may provide more explainability for relevance estimation.
