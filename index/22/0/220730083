Answer selection plays a crucial role in natural language processing. and thus has received much attention. Many recent works treat it as an ad-hoc retrieval problem where ranking optimization accounts for a large proportion. Previous works mainly consider the similarity between answer and question, but rarely utilize similarity and dissimilarity relationship in the answers candidate set. In this paper, we propose a similarity aggregation method to rerank the results produced by different baseline neural networks. The key idea of similarity aggregation is that true matches should not only similar to other true matches, but also dissimilar with false matches, and inspired by multi-view verification, the true answers should have the same ranking to the question in different baseline methods and false answers are the same. The empirical results, from the public benchmark task of answer selection, demonstrate that our method has significant improvement over the baseline methods.
