Many applications of machine learning on discrete domains, such as learning preference functions in recommender systems
or auctions, can be reduced to estimating a set function that is sparse in the Fourier domain. In this work, we present a new
family of algorithms for learning Fourier-sparse set functions. They require at most nk âˆ’ k log k + k queries (set function
evaluations), under mild conditions on the Fourier coefficients, where n is the size of the ground set and k the number of
non-zero Fourier coefficients. In contrast to other work that focused on the orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT),
our novel algorithms operate with recently introduced non-orthogonal Fourier transforms that offer different notions of
Fourier-sparsity. These naturally arise when modeling, e.g., sets of items forming substitutes and complements. We 
demonstrate effectiveness on several real-world applications.
