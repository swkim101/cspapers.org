Swipe-based methods for text entry by gaze allow users to swipe through the letters of a word by gaze, analogous to how they can swipe with a finger on a touchscreen keyboard. Two challenges for these methods are: (1) gaze paths do not possess clear start and end positions, and (2) it is difficult to design text editing features. We introduce Swipe&Switch, a text-entry interface that uses swiping and switching to improve gaze-based interaction. The interface contains three context regions, and detects the start/end of a gesture and emits text editing commands (e.g., word insertion, deletion) when a user switches focus between these regions. A user study showed that Swipe&Switch provides a better user experience and higher text entry rate over a baseline, EyeSwipe.
