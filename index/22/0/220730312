Many government and public organisations have a requirement to release their official documents to the public and therefore need to review such documents to identify and protect any sensitive information that they contain. When reviewing a document for sensitivity, reviewers often use information from other documents within the collection to assist in their decisions. It can be difficult for the reviewers to find related documents in large digital collections when they are performing sensitivity review. Receptor is a new solution that aims to provide sensitivity reviewers with the ability to explore a collection of documents to discover latent relations, between for example entities and events, that can be a reliable indicator of sensitive information. The system provides novel scalable graph search and exploration functionalities as well as interactive visualisations of the latent relations between related entities, events, and documents to enable users to identify hidden patterns of sensitivity.
