Inspired by the recent discoveries in neuroscience, the study of the sparse binary projection model started to attract people's attention, shedding new light on image retrieval. Different from the classical work that tries to reduce the dimension of the data for faster retrieval speed, the model projects dense input samples into a higher-dimensional space and outputs sparse binary data representations after winner-take-all competition. Following the work along this line, this paper designed a new algorithm which obtains a high-quality sparse binary projection matrix through unsupervised training. Simple as it is, the algorithm reported significantly improved results over the state-of-the-art methods in both search accuracy and retrieval speed in a series of empirical evaluations on large-scale image retrieval tasks, which exhibited its promising potential in industrial applications.
