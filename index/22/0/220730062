Graph retrieval from a large corpus of graphs has a wide variety of applications, e.g., sentence retrieval using words and dependency parse trees for question answering, image retrieval using scene graphs, and molecule discovery from a set of existing molecular graphs. In such graph search applications, nodes, edges and associated features bear distinctive physical significance. Therefore, a unified, trainable search model that efficiently returns corpus graphs that are highly relevant to a query graph has immense potential impact. In this paper, we present an effective, feature and structure-aware, end-to-end trainable neural match scoring system for graphs. We achieve this by constructing the product graph between the query and a candidate graph in the corpus, and then conduct a family of random walks on the product graph, which are then aggregated into the match score, using a network whose parameters can be trained. Experiments show the efficacy of our method, compared to competitive baseline approaches.
