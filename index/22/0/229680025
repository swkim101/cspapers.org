Domain generalisation (DG) methods address the problem of domain shift, when there is a mismatch between the distributions of training and target domains. Data augmentation approaches have emerged as a promising alternative for DG. However, data augmentation alone is not sufficient to achieve lower generalisation errors. This project proposes a new method that combines data augmentation and domain distance minimisation to address the problems associated with data augmentation and provide a guarantee on the learning performance, under an existing framework. Empirically, our method outperforms baseline results on DG benchmarks.
