Maintaining good indoor air quality is critical for all people since the rate of pollution indoors is much higher than it is outdoors. Indoor ventilation to refresh indoor air is very essential, as it improves the air quality and reduces the health risks for people. The automation of the process of refreshing indoor air is very important in these kinds of situations due to the fast lifestyles of people today. The proposed method offers a fully automated system that monitors and controls the indoor air quality, temperature, and humidity using Arduino technology and a fuzzy logic controller. The system measures the air quality using the MQ-135 sensor and keeps track of the temperature and humidity using the DHT-11 sensor. The readings of these sensors are used to adjust the ventilation of the indoor area to remove unwanted gases as well as control the temperature and humidity. The results show that the proposed system achieves high performance in controlling and monitoring the air quality in a room environment. Moreover, the proposed system reduces the power consumption of the ventilation mechanics. This reduction is due to the fuzzy logic controller, which adjusts the speed and the working time interval of room ventilation. Some related works are presented to show the difference between other techniques and the proposed system.
