Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neuro-degenerative disorder which is caused by a decrease in dopamine producing neurons in the human body and affects the body’s motor system. In addition to affecting several motor and non-motor activities of a person’s day to day life, PD patients have difficulty in speech production due to reduced coordination of the muscles that control breathing, phonation, articulation and prosody. Analyzing speech allows clinicians to objectively measure the severity of PD in a non-invasive way. In this work, we propose an effective method to discriminate between PD and healthy control (HC) subjects by utilizing a technique to decompose a speech signal into simpler Intrinsic Mode Functions called the Empirical Mode Decomposition. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn significant properties from raw IMFs for the purpose of PD-HC classification. We evaluate our technique on sustained phonations speech from the Italian Parkinson’s Voice and Speech database. Experimental results show that significant characteristics of Parkinsonian dysarthria can be learnt by using the raw IMFs and the need for explicitly extracting handcrafted features could be mitigated.
