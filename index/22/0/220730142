People use web image search with various search intents: from serious demands for work to just passing time by browsing images of a favorite actor. Such a diversity of intents can influence user satisfaction and evaluation metrics, both of which are important factors for providing a better image search environment. In this paper, we investigate this influence by using a publicly available one-month field study dataset. With respect to satisfaction, we take into consideration both query-level and task-level satisfaction provided by search users. Regarding the evaluation metrics, we use grid-based evaluation metrics that incorporate user behavior specific to image search. The results of our analysis indicate that both query/task satisfaction and grid-based evaluation metrics are influenced by the image search intent. Based on the results, we show possibilities to support users' search processes according to their search intents. We also discuss that there is still room for improvement in evaluation metrics through the development of intent-aware evaluation metrics in image search.
