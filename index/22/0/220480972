Cost partitioning is a method for admissibly combining admissible heuristics.

In this work, we extend this concept to merge-and-shrink (M&S) abstractions

that may use labels that do not directly correspond to operators. We

investigate how optimal and saturated cost partitioning (SCP) interact with

M&S transformations and develop a method to compute SCPs during the

computation of M&S. Experiments show that SCP significantly improves M&S on

standard planning benchmarks.
