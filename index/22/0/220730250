Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used by practitioners for millennia to prevent and treat disease, but has struggled to gain broad acceptance in the West. In 2019, the World Health Organisation officially recognized TCM as a form of medical treatment, a step towards internationalizing TCM and integrating it with Western medicine (WM). The proposed dissertation research aims to bridge eastern and western medical philosophies by applying named entity recognition (NER) and information retrieval (IR) models supported by medical and cross lingual knowledge graphs, to enhance the retrieval performance as well as to increase the model explainability.
