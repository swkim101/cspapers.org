Videos of actions are complex spatio-temporal signals, containing rich compositional structures. Current generative models are limited in their ability to generate examples of object configurations outside the range they were trained on. Towards this end, we introduce a generative model (AG2Vid) based on Action Graphs, a natural and convenient structure that represents the dynamics of actions between objects over time. Our AG2Vid model disentangles appearance and position features, allowing for more accurate generation. AG2Vid is evaluated on the CATER and Something-Something datasets and outperforms other baselines. Finally, we show how Action Graphs can be used for generating novel compositions of unseen actions.
