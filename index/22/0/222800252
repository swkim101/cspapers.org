With the rise of the Maker Movement and STEM education, toolkit research for beginners in electronics has become popular. Most of them are focused on the efficient creation and debugging of electrical circuits. Therefore, users were implicitly required to understanding of the nature of electricity and some prerequisites knowledge. In this paper, we propose tangible interface to express electrical properties such as voltage and resistance. This system aims to bring a deep interest and understanding of the nature of electricity to the beginners explicitly. In this research, we discuss the interaction between the laws of electricity and another several physical laws, present an example of a prototype implementation, and describe the results of a preliminary user questionnaire.
