Online reviews play a critical role in persuading or dissuading users when making purchase decisions. And yet very few users take the time to write helpful reviews. Encouragingly, recent advances in deep neural networks offer good potential to produce review-like natural language content. However, there is a lack of large, high-quality labeled data at both the aspect and sentiment level for training. Hence, toward enabling a writing assistant framework to help users post online reviews, this paper proposes a scalable labeling method for bootstrapping aspect and sentiment labels.Concretely, the proposed approach ? Aspect Dependent Online RE-views (ADORE) - leverages the underlying distribution of reviews and a small seed set of labeled data through carefully designed review segmentation and label assignment. We then show how these labels can inform a generative model to produce aspect and sentiment-aware reviews. We study the effectiveness of ADORE under various scenarios such as how end-users perceive the quality of the labels and aspect-aware generated reviews. Our experiments indicate that the proposed effective labeling process along with a regularized joint generative model lead to high quality reviews with 90% accuracy.
