Nowadays, customer virtual reality (VR) devices can offer high-quality presence experiences in a relatively low cost, which opens opportunities for popularizing situated learning. We investigate situated learning of soft skills, in particular, elevator pitches, through simulating an interactive agent with multimodal feedback in VR. A virtual agent acts as a coach and offers both verbal and nonverbal feedback to users. We developed a prototype system and conducted a quantitative experiment to investigate the potential of situated learning in VR, especially on how users perceive the virtual agent. We summarize design considerations on developing interactive agents with multimodal feedback in VR to facilitate situated learning of soft skills.
