To provide more accurate personalized product search (PPS) results, it is compulsory to go beyond modeling user-query-item interaction. Graph embedding techniques open the potential to integrate node information and topological structure information. Existing graph embedding enhanced PPS methods are mostly based on entity-relation-entity graph learning. In this work, we propose to consider structural relationship in users' product search scenario with graph embedding by latent representation learning. We argue that explicitly modeling the structural relationship in graph embedding is essential for more accurate PPS results. We propose a novel method, Graph embedding based Structural Relationship Representation Learning (GraphSRRL), which explicitly models the structural relationship in users-queries-products interaction. It combines three key conjunctive graph patterns to learn graph embedding for better PPS. In addition, GraphSRRL facilitates the learning of affinities between users (resp. queries or products) in the designed geometric operation in low-dimensional latent space. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets to evaluate GraphSRRL for PPS. Experimental results show that GraphSRRL outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm on real-world search datasets by at least 50.7% in term of Hit@10 and 48.7% in terms of NDCG@10.
