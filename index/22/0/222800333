Museum visitors can often be distanced from directly engaging with historical artefacts due to their fragile nature. ARcheoBox is a novel interface that lets users physically pick up a digitized version of a real artefact and inspect it closely from all angles through a screen. The system combines augmented reality and tangible interactions to remove barriers between visitors and artefacts. We piloted our prototype with eight archaeological experts at a local exhibition centre. The results indicate that this is a promising way to remove barriers between humans and historical artefacts, and that it allows expert users to inspect, understand and interact with these artefacts in a way not previously possible.
