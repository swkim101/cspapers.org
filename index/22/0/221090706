This paper presents 6T SRAM cell-based bit-parallel in-memory computing (IMC) architecture to support various computations with reconfigurable bit-precision. In the proposed technique, bit-line computation is performed with a short WL followed by BL boosting circuits, which can reduce BL computing delays. By per-forming carry-propagation between each near-memory circuit, bit-parallel complex computations are also enabled by iterating operations with low latency. In addition, reconfigurable bit-precision is also supported based on carry-propagation size. Our 128KB in/near memory computing architecture has been implemented using a 28nm CMOS process, and it can achieve 2.25GHz clock frequency at 0.9V with 5.2% of area overhead. The proposed architecture also achieves 0.68, 8.09 TOPS/W for the parallel addition and multiplication, respectively. In addition, the proposed work also supports a wide range of supply voltage, from 0.6V to 1.1V.
