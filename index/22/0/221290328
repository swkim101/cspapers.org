Network embedding is an active research area due to the prevalence of network-structured data. While the state of the art often learns high-quality embedding vectors for high-degree nodes with abundant structural connectivity, the quality of the embedding vectors for low-degree or tail nodes is often suboptimal due to their limited structural connectivity. While many real-world networks are long-tailed, to date little effort has been devoted to tail node embedding. In this paper, we formulate the goal of learning tail node embeddings as a few-shot regression problem, given the few links on each tail node. In particular, since each node resides in its own local context, we personalize the regression model for each tail node. To reduce overfitting in the personalization, we propose a locality-aware meta-learning framework, called meta-tail2vec, which learns to learn the regression model for the tail nodes at different localities. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the promising results of meta-tail2vec.
