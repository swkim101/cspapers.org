Commonsense knowledge is fundamental to make machines reach human-level intelligence. However, conventional methods of commonsense extraction generally do not work well because commonsense by nature is usually not explicitly stated in texts or other data. Besides, commonsense knowledge graphs built in advance are difficult to cover all the knowledge required for practical tasks due to the incompleteness of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose an online commonsense oracle to achieve knowledge reasoning. Specifically, we focus on the on-demand inference of specific commonsense propositions. We use capableOf relation as an example due to its notable significance in daily life. For more effective capableOf reasoning, informative supporting features derived from an existing commonsense knowledge graph and a Web search engine are exploited. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
