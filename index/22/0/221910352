This paper proposes a concept of introducing Git repository to record a history of program evolution via automated program repair techniques. In contrast to the general usage of Git by actual developers, a Git repository is generated by an APR system. This paper presents that it is feasible to store the history of program repair efficiently and comprehensively by using Git. Moreover, the proposed concept allows to share the details of an APR execution and to compare various APR executions.
