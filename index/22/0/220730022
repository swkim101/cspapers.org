Nowadays, intelligent information systems, especially the interactive information systems (e.g., conversational interaction systems like Siri, and Cortana; news feed recommender systems, and interactive search engines, etc.), are ubiquitous in real-world applications. These systems either converse with users explicitly through natural languages, or mine users interests and respond to users requests implicitly. Interactivity has become a crucial element towards intelligent information systems. Despite the fact that interactive information systems have gained significant progress, there are still many challenges to be addressed when applying these models to real-world scenarios. This half day workshop explores challenges and potential research, development, and application directions in applied interactive information systems. We aim to discuss the issues of applying interactive information models to production systems, as well as to shed some light on the fundamental characteristics, i.e., interactivity and applicability, of different interactive tasks. We welcome practical, theoretical, experimental, and methodological studies that advances the interactivity towards intelligent information systems. The workshop aims to bring together a diverse set of practitioners and researchers interested in investigating the interaction between human and information systems to develop more intelligent information systems.
