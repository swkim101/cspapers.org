It is common knowledge that tractor-trailer vehicles are affected by jackknifing, a phenomenon that consists in the divergence of the trailer hitch angle and ultimately causes the vehicle to fold up. For the case of backwards motion, in which jackknifing can also occur at low speeds, we present a control method that drives the vehicle along a reference Cartesian trajectory while avoiding the divergence of the hitch angle. In particular, a feedback control law is obtained by combining two actions: a tracking term, computed using input-output linearization, and a corrective term, generated via IS-MPC, an intrinsically stable MPC scheme which is effective for stable inversion of nonminimum-phase systems. The proposed method has been verified in simulation and experimentally validated on a purposely built prototype.
