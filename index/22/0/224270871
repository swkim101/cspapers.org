Structured world knowledge is at the foundation of knowledge-centric AI applications. Despite considerable research on knowledge base construction, beyond mere statement counts, little is known about the progress of KBs, in particular concerning their coverage, and one may wonder whether there is constant progress, or diminishing returns. In this paper we employ question answering and entity summarization as extrinsic use cases for a longitudinal study of the progress of KB coverage. Our analysis shows a near-continuous improvement of two popular KBs, DBpedia and Wikidata, over the last 19 years, with little signs of flattening out or leveling off.
