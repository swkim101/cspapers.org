The purpose of this research project is for robots to react to biological data from humans, thus the necessity for understanding human interactions. This project observes synchronization of relations between human interaction. Through casual conversation, we monitored changes in heartrate and brainwaves. In the future we hope to program robots to accurately calculate student interest and through synchronization to improve learning impact and motivation.
