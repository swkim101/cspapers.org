Recently, diverse primitive skills have been learned by adopting the entropy as intrinsic reward, which further shows that new practical skills can be produced by combining a variety of primitive skills. This is essentially skill transfer, very useful for learning high-level skills but quite challenging due to the low efficiency of transferring primitive skills. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient skill transfer method, where we learn independent skills and only independent components of skills are transferred instead of the whole set of skills. More concretely, independent components of skills are obtained through independent component analysis (ICA), which always have a smaller amount (or lower dimension) compared with their mixtures. With a lower dimension, independent skill transfer (IST) exhibits a higher efficiency on learning a given task. Extensive experiments including three robotic tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of our proposed IST method in comparison to direct primitive-skill transfer and conventional reinforcement learning.
