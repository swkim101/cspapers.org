Recently, the demand for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has substantially escalated amidst the current unprecedented events and the global pandemic, as they play an essential role in both the security and health sectors, through surveillance, extracting and conveying test samples, transportation of crucial assets and providing temporary services. Nevertheless, the process of designing and producing such aerial vehicles is suppressed by the internal and external constraints that pose serious challenges. One of the key operations during flight is landing, especially, the autonomous landing of UAV on a moving platform, which is a scientifically complicated engineering problem. Typically, executing a successful automatic landing on a moving platform requires accurate localization of the landing zone, swift flying trajectory planning, and robust control configuration. To accomplish such goals, intense observations of the data concerning the autonomous landing approach such as the intersection point between the two moving bodies, the position of the platform/UAV and the inclination angle required to land are significantly crucial. In this paper, a mathematical approach to this problem is presented in the X-Y plane based on the inclination angle and state of UAV during the landing procedure. Moreover, the experimental results depict the accurate position of the UAV, the intersection between the UAV and the moving platform and inclination angle in the landing process, allowing for prediction of the intersection point.
