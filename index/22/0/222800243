In the area of ubiquitous computing, there is research that use surfaces of elements in the environment such as windows and walls as screens. It is necessary to install an opaque screen and projectors on both sides of the screen in order to switch projection surfaces, i.e., front, back, or both sides. In this paper, we propose Janus Screen, a novel screen system with polarizers that allow switching of the projection surface to the front, back, or both sides using only projectors on one side. Janus Screen employs projectors equipped with polarizers and a screen with multiple layers. We implement a prototype and confirm that Janus Screen can selectively switch the projection surface. Moreover, we discuss unique characteristics and possible applications of the proposed system.
