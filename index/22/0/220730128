Predicting the survival of cancer patients holds significant meaning for public health, and has attracted increasing attention in medical information communities. In this study, we propose a novel framework for cancer survival prediction named Multimodal Graph Neural Network (MGNN), which explores the features of real-world multimodual data such as gene expression, copy number alteration and clinical data in a unified framework. In order to explore the inherent relation, we first construct the bipartite graphs between patients and multimodal data. Subsequently, graph neural network is adopted to obtain the embedding of each patient on different bipartite graphs. Finally, a multimodal fusion neural layer is designed to fuse the features from different modal data. The output of our method is the classification of short term survival or long term survival for each patient. Experimental results on one breast cancer dataset demonstrate that MGNN outperforms all baselines. Furthermore, we test the trained model on lung cancer dataset, and the experimental results verify the strong robust by comparing with state-of-the-art methods.
