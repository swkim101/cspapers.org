Recently deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been used for intelligent traffic light control. Unfortunately, we find that state-of-the-art on DRL-based intelligent traffic light essentially adopts discrete decision making and would suffer from the issue of unsafe driving. Moreover, existing feature representation of environment may not capture dynamics of traffic flow and thus cannot precisely predict future traffic flows. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose a DDPG-based DRL framework to learn a continuous time duration of traffic signal phases by introducing 1) a transit phase before the change of current phase for better safety, and 2) vehicle moving speed into feature representation for more precise estimation of traffic flow in next phase. Our preliminary evaluation on a well-known simulator SUMO indicates that our work significantly outperforms a recent work by much smaller number of emergency stops, queue length and waiting time.
