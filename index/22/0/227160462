Online social networks (OSNs) attract attackers that use abusive accounts to conduct malicious activities for economic, political, and personal gain. In response, OSNs often deploy abusive account classiﬁers using machine learning (ML) approaches. However, a practical, effective ML-based defense requires carefully engineering features that are robust to adversarial manipulation, obtaining enough ground truth labeled data for model training, and designing a system that can scale to all active accounts on an OSN (potentially in the billions). To address these challenges we present Deep Entity Classiﬁ-cation (DEC) , an ML framework that detects abusive accounts in OSNs that have evaded other, traditional abuse detection systems. We leverage the insight that while accounts in isolation may be difﬁcult to classify, their embeddings in the social graph—the network structure, properties, and behaviors of themselves and those around them—are fundamentally dif-ﬁcult for attackers to replicate or manipulate at scale . Our system:
