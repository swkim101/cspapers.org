\emphSeasonal periodicity is a frequent phenomenon for social interactions in temporal networks. A key property of this behavior is that it exhibits periodicity for multiple particular periods in temporal networks. Mining such seasonal-periodic patterns is significant since it can indicate interesting relationships between the individuals involved in the interactions. Unfortunately, most previous studies for periodic pattern mining ignore the seasonal feature. This motivates us to explore mining seasonal-periodic subgraphs, and the investigation presents a novel model, called maximal σ-periodic $ømega$-seasonal k-subgraph. It represents a subgraph with size larger than k and that appears at least σ times periodically in at least $ømega$ particular periods on the temporal graph. Since seasonal-periodic patterns do not satisfy the anti-monotonic property, we propose a weak version of support measure with an anti-monotonic property to reduce the search space efficiently. Then, we present an effective mining algorithm to seek all maximal σ-periodic $ømega$-seasonal k-subgraphs. Experimental results on real-life datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
