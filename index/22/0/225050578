The main role of the prosthetic hand is to help people with the upper limb amputees carry out daily activities. The appearance of the prosthetic hand should also be as close as possible to the natural hand. The human hand is a very complex structure, and these complex structures have a profound effect on the movement of the hand. In order to develop a prosthetic hand with the same flexibility as a human hand, we designed the prosthetic hand according to hands anatomical features, and incorporating these structural features into design: prosthetic joints, ligaments and extensor hoods. To evaluate the performance of the proposed prosthetic hand in daily life, a grabbing experiment was conducted on common objects in our daily life. The results show that the proposed prosthetic hand has a high performance and natural appearance.
