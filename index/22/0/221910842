Despite the proliferation of software ecosystems (SECOs), growing a sustainable and healthy SECO remains a significant challenge. One approach to mitigate this challenge is the utilization of a mechanism that collects feedback from distributors (distros) and end-users of the SECO releases. This presentation aims at investigating the effectiveness of the feedback mechanism implemented by OpenStack to address the needs of end-users and distros. I mined the OpenStack repositories and mapped 20 distros' bug-related activities. Results suggest that OpenStack releases are actively maintained for 18 months before reaching end-of-life (EOL), which makes coordination with distros difficult because distros usually provide services to their end-users for a period between 36 - 60 months before reaching EOL. Also, bugs are fixed faster by the distros (7 - 76 days) than the OpenStack community (average of 4 months). However, only 22% of the bugs addressed by OpenStack distros are pushed back upstream.
