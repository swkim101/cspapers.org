Manipulation tasks such as grasping, placing, and hand-over ability is crucial for the robot home application. In order to help the elderly at home, robots should have awareness and react carefully to prevent injury or accidents. The idea of safety strategy in robotics mainly used for industrial environment with less uncertainty. However, the home-care robot deals with many uncertainties condition and it is difficult to predict the human behavior than predict the industrial moving object. Thus, it is important to formulate a systematic approach to improving safety awareness on home-care robots. The following paper describes an approach of safety strategy for robot home manipulation task. This system uses an ecological approach based on the interconnection between perceptual system and action system according to spatial-temporal context of the updated information from environment. Some recommendation and preliminary experiments are conducted to show the possibility of further development for future research.
