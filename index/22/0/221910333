Among the accessory applications of the blockchain, the idea of using it as an immutable register for tracking and certifying documents is recently gaining interest in research and industry. The problems of traceability, non-counterfeiting and unique usage of digital coupons fall within this area; many couponing platforms are hence exploring the possibility of addressing the above limitations with blockchain technologies. In view of the foregoing, in this work we analyse and compare several blockchain-based couponing systems. To do so, we first propose a general schema of digital coupon and define the desirable properties of a couponing system. Then, we select a sample of these systems and we examine them, describing their design choices and summarizing their relevant properties. Finally, we inspect their code and study how the notion of couponing system is interpreted in their smart contracts. We also highlight their distinctive features and relevant implementation solutions. We conclude by discussing what emerged from our analysis and proposing some possible future investigations.
