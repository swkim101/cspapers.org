Cross-modal hashing has been widely investigated recently for its efficiency in large-scale cross-media retrieval. However, most existing cross-modal hashing methods learn hash functions in a batch-based learning mode. Such mode is not suitable for large-scale data sets due to the large memory consumption and loses its efficiency when training streaming data. Online cross-modal hashing can deal with the above problems by learning hash model in an online learning process. However, existing online cross-modal hashing methods cannot update hash codes of old data by the newly learned model. In this paper, we propose Online Collective Matrix Factorization Hashing (OCMFH) based on collective matrix factorization hashing (CMFH), which can adaptively update hash codes of old data according to dynamic changes of hash model without accessing to old data. Specifically, it learns discriminative hash codes for streaming data by collective matrix factorization in an online optimization scheme. Unlike conventional CMFH which needs to load the entire data points into memory, the proposed OCMFH retrains hash functions only by newly arriving data points. Meanwhile, it generates hash codes of new data and updates hash codes of old data by the latest updated hash model. In such way, hash codes of new data and old data are well-matched. Furthermore, a zero mean strategy is developed to solve the mean-varying problem in the online hash learning process. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of OCMFH on online cross-media retrieval.
