This PhD thesis will explore conversational question answering with a special emphasis on incorporating user feedback. As preliminary work, we developed a conversational passage retrieval system in the scope of the TREC Conversational Assistance Track 2019. Our current focus is to develop methods based on reinforcement learning to incorporate implicit user feedback in form of question reformulations for conversational QA over knowledge graphs. Finally, we plan to design a conversational QA system operating on heterogeneous sources.
