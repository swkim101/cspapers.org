We present an early stage prototype of an acoustic labeling system using Velcro, a two-sided household adhesive product. We create labels by varying the shape of Velcro pieces to produce distinct sounds when the two sides are separated, and we use an automatic audio classification pipeline to detect and classify small sets of labels. We evaluate our classifier on four sets of three simple Velcro labels, present a demo highlighting potential use cases of these labels, and discuss future applications.
