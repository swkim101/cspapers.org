In the digital era, information retrieval, text/knowledge mining, and NLP techniques are playing increasingly vital roles in legal domain. While the open datasets and innovative deep learning methodologies provide critical potentials, in the legal-domain, efforts need to be made to transfer the theoretical/algorithmic models into the real applications to assist users, lawyers, judges and the legal professions to solve the real problems. The objective of this workshop is to aggregate studies/applications of text mining/retrieval and NLP automation in the context of classical/novel legal tasks, which address algorithmic, data and social challenges of legal intelligence. Keynote and invited presentations from industry and academic will be able to fill the gap between ambition and execution in the legal domain.
