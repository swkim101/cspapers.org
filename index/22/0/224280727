Social recommendation tasks exploit social connections to enhance recommendation performance. To fully utilize each user's first-order and high-order neighborhood preferences, recent approaches incorporate influence diffusion process for better user preference modeling. Despite the superior performance of these models, they either neglect the latent individual interests hidden in the user-item interactions or rely on computationally expensive graph attention models to uncover the item-induced sub-relations, which essentially determine the influence propagation passages. Considering the sparse substructures are derived from original social network, we name them as partial relationships between users. We argue such relationships can be directly modeled such that both personal interests and shared interests can propagate along a few channels (or dimensions) of latent users' embeddings. To this end, we propose a partial relationship aware influence diffusion structure via a computationally efficient multi-channel encoding scheme. Specifically, the encoding scheme first simplifies graph attention operation based on a channel-wise sparsity assumption, and then adds an InfluenceNorm function to maintain such sparsity. Moreover, ChannelNorm is designed to alleviate the oversmoothing problem in graph neural network models. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method is comparable to state-of-the-art graph attention-based social recommendation models while capturing user interests according to partial relationships more efficiently.
