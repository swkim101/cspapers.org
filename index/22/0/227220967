The method for the synthesis of a AUV spatial motion control system that allows to take into account the presence of interactions between degrees of freedom, variable or undefined parameters was proposed in paper. This control system consists of two loops. The first loop includes a combined system of a non-linear regulator that provides the desired dynamic characteristics of the AUV when its parameters are equal to the nominal values, and a self-tuning system with reference model that provides compensation for an undefined or variable part of the parameters. In this case, the parameters of the self-tuning controller are selected to reduce the possible amplitude of the discontinuous signal. The second loop is a non-linear position controller that allows to take into account the dynamic properties of the velocity loop and the kinematic properties of AUV. The simulation results confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed control system.
