My research goal is to build practical and intuitive 3D free-hand interactions for augmented reality (AR) on smartphones and to explore relevant behavioral-data-driven interaction techniques. In service of that goal, I have developed two preliminary AR systems on the smartphone: a Portal-ble system powered by visual, auditory, and haptic feedback and a set of grabbing accommodations that allows the user's hand to interact with AR contents directly. I have also developed a Portalware system that incorporates a smartphone-wearable interaction scheme to expand visual feedback beyond the smartphone's display and have leveraged this system to improve 3D mid-air sketching. My next steps are to use behavioral data such as device motion, hand motion and user postures to create dynamic and personalized interaction systems that facilitate intuitive AR interaction. Ultimately, these individually-tailored systems unlock new interaction possibilities for the general public and expand the usage scenarios for smartphone AR applications.
