Identifying critical information in real time in the beginning of a disaster is a challenging but important task. This task has been recently addressed using domain adaptation approaches, which eliminate the need for target labeled data, and can thus accelerate the process of identifying useful information. We propose to investigate the effectiveness of the Domain Reconstruction Classification Network (DRCN) approach on disaster tweets. DRCN adapts information from target data by reconstructing it with an autoencoder. Experimental results using a sequence-to-sequence autoencodershow that the DRCN approach can improve the performance of both supervised and domain adaptation baseline models.
