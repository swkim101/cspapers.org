Stunting is considered an important concern in the public health of children throughout the world. Inadequate nutrition in toddlers is closely related to the risk of growth retardation, where malnutrition is caused by several risk factors in the prenatal and postnatal periods. It is necessary to improve the identification, measurement, and understanding of stunting and increase the scope of preventive stunting to reduce the number of stunting events. In this paper, we develop Android-based for early detection of the risk of stunting in pregnant women and their recommendations. We use forward chaining techniques to detect stunting, and we provide recommendations for pregnant women who are at high risk for birth. Our proposed stunt detection with forward chaining yielded in a high accuracy value of 89%.
