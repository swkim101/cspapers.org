The mediation of haptic feedback largely depends on physical properties of the surface of interaction and its internal structure. Most mobile devices today are assembled using a wide range of components with varied physical properties that can limit the propagation of tactile signals. For that reason, it is important to understand how common materials used in assembling mobile devices relay vibration signals and develop techniques of effectively mediating haptic feedback uniformly throughout the entire device. This research compares three off-the-shelf waveguide materials and one custom-designed 3D-printed ABS structure for creating feedback signals on flat interaction surfaces. Preliminary results indicate that by altering the internal structure of the interaction surface we can reduce attenuation and integration of the applied signal and improving the overall haptic experience.
