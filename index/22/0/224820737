Entity summaries provide human users with the key information about an entity. In this system paper, we present the implementation of our entity summarizer ESSTER. It aims at generating entity summaries that contain structurally important triples and exhibit high readability and low redundancy. For structural importance, we exploit the global and local characteristics of properties and values in RDF data. For readability, we learn the familarity of properties from a text corpus. To reduce redundancy, we perform logical reasoning and compute textual and numerical similarity between triples. ESSTER solves a combinatorial optimization problem to integrate these features. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ESBM v1.2 dataset.
