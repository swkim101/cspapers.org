Search and recommender systems process rich natural language text data such as user queries and documents. Achieving high-quality search and recommendation results requires processing and understanding such information effectively and efficiently, where natural language processing (NLP) technologies are widely deployed. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning technology has been proven successful for improving various NLP tasks, indicating their great potential of promoting search and recommender systems. Developing deep learning models for NLP in search and recommender systems involves various fundamental components including query / document understanding, retrieval & ranking, and language generation. In this workshop, we propose to discuss deep neural network based NLP technologies and their applications in search and recommendation, with the goal of understanding (1) Why deep NLP is helpful; (2) What are the challenges to develop and productionize it; (3) How to overcome the challenges; (4) Where deep NLP models produce the largest impact.
