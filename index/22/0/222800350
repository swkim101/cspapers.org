In this work, we present the VRQuestionnaireToolkit, which enables the research community to easily collect subjective measures within virtual reality (VR). We contribute a highly customizable and reusable open-source toolkit which can be integrated in existing VR projects rapidly. The toolkit comes with a pre-installed set of standard questionnaires such as NASA TLX, SSQ and SUS Presence questionnaire. Our system aims to lower the entry barrier to use questionnaires in VR and to significantly reduce development time and cost needed to run pre-, in between- and post-study questionnaires.
