Journalistic knowledge platforms (JKPs) leverage data from the news, social media and other sources. They collect large amounts of data and attempt to extract potentially news-relevant information for news production. At the same time, by harvesting and recombining big data, they can challenge data privacy ethically and legally. Knowledge graphs offer new possibilities for representing information in JKPs, but their power also amplifies long-standing privacy concerns. This paper studies the implications of data privacy policies for JKPs. To do so, we have reviewed the GDPR and identified different areas where it potentially conflicts with JKPs.
