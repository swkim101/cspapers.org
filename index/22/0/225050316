Divisive hierarchical clustering is a powerful tool for extracting knowledge from data with a pluralistic and appropriate information granularity. Recent developments of hierarchical clustering algorithms apply Growing Neural Gas (GNG) to data divisive mechanisms. However, GNG-based algorithms tend to generate nodes excessively and sensitive to the input order of data points. Furthermore, the plasticity-stability dilemma is another unavoidable problem. In this paper, we propose a divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm based on Adaptive Resonance Theory-based clustering. Simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm can generate an appropriate tree structure depending on data while improving the performance of hierarchical clustering.
