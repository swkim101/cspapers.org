Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices promise to enhance even the most mundane of objects with computational properties by seamlessly coupling the virtual world to the physical. However, IoT's associated costs and cumbersome setup limits its extension to many everyday tasks and objects, such as those in the home. To address these issues, my dissertation work will enable IoT Stickers'a book of inexpensive, battery-free sensors and composition patterns'to support customizing everyday objects with software and web services using stickers. Using RFID-based paper mechanisms, IoT Stickers integrates common sensors and web services with interactive stickers through a trigger-action architecture. This integration enables computational services to be tailored to everyday activities by setting parameters to be passed to the sticker's actions and composing the stickers together. Thus, IoT Stickers demonstrates a way to associate IoT services with a dramatically wider set of objects and tasks.
