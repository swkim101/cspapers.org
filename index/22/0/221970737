We consider the Hypergraph-<tex>$k$</tex>-Cut problem. The input consists of a hypergraph <tex>$G= (V,\ E)$</tex> with nonnegative hyperedge-costs <tex>$c:E\rightarrow \mathbb{R}+$</tex> and a positive integer <tex>$k$</tex>. The objective is to find a least-cost subset <tex>$F\subseteq E$</tex> such that the number of connected components in <tex>$G-F$</tex> is at least <tex>$k$</tex>. An alternative formulation of the objective is to find a partition of <tex>$V$</tex> into <tex>$k$</tex> non-empty sets <tex>$V_{1}, V_{2}, \ldots, V_{k}$</tex> so as to minimize the cost of the hyperedges that cross the partition. Graph-<tex>$k$</tex>-Cut, the special case of Hypergraph-<tex>$k$</tex>-Cut obtained by restricting to graph inputs, has received considerable attention. Several different approaches lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for Graph-<tex>$k$</tex>-Cut when <tex>$k$</tex> is fixed, starting with the work of Goldschmidt and Hochbaum (1988) [1], [2]. In contrast, it is only recently that a randomized polynomial time algorithm for Hypergraph-<tex>$k$</tex>-Cut was developed [3] via a subtle generalization of Karger's random contraction approach for graphs. In this work, we develop the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for Hypergraph-<tex>$k$</tex>-Cut for all fixed <tex>$k$</tex>. We describe two algorithms both of which are based on a divide and conquer approach. The first algorithm is simpler and runs in <tex>$n^{O(k^{2})}$</tex> time while the second one runs in <tex>$n^{O(k)}$</tex> time. Our proof relies on new structural results that allow for efficient recovery of the parts of an optimum <tex>$k$</tex>-partition by solving minimum (<tex>$S,\ T$</tex>) -terminal cuts. Our techniques give new insights even for Graph-<tex>$k$</tex>-Cut.
