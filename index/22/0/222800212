In this paper, we propose a thin display panel system for converting an existing kitchen or vanity tabletop with an engineered marble into a smart touch display. The display system, which consists of an LED matrix panel including IR-LEDs and photodiodes, will be placed on the rear side of a tabletop of a kitchen or washbasins. The normal LED light is used for a visual display transmitted with a thick opaque resin, and the infrared light is used for detecting touch areas and objects using the same resin panel. This display panel can be used for various applications and can be touched with wet and/or dirty hands. In this paper, we describe the system overview, the optical characteristics of blurred display via an engineered marble plate, and an touch-sensing experiment. We also provide some applications of the smart touch display.
