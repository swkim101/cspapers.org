Despite the marked improvements in image classification and recognition tasks over the past decade, affordances and interfaces for searching images have remained largely unchanged on the web. In this demo, we present Newspaper Navigator, an open faceted search system for 1.5 million historic newspaper photographs. In contrast to standard faceted search, which requires facets to be pre-selected and applied to images, Newspaper Navigator empowers users to specify their own facets in an open-domain fashion during the search process by selecting relevant examples and iteratively training a machine learner. With Newspaper Navigator, users can quickly sort 1.5 million images according to dynamically-specified facets such as "baseball player'' and "oval-shaped portrait.'' Newspaper Navigator also drives facet exploration by suggesting related keyword search queries for a user to perform. Our demo walks through examples of searching with Newspaper Navigator and highlights the facet learning and exploration affordances.
