For sequential recommendation, it is essential to capture and predict future or long-term user preference for generating accurate recommendation over time. To improve the predictive capacity, we adopt reinforcement learning (RL) for developing effective sequential recommenders. However, user-item interaction data is likely to be sparse, complicated and time-varying. It is not easy to directly apply RL techniques to improve the performance of sequential recommendation. Inspired by the availability of knowledge graph (KG), we propose a novel Knowledge-guidEd Reinforcement Learning model (KERL for short) for fusing KG information into a RL framework for sequential recommendation. Specifically, we formalize the sequential recommendation task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and make three major technical extensions in this framework, including state representation, reward function and learning algorithm. First, we propose to enhance the state representations with KG information considering both exploitation and exploration. Second, we carefully design a composite reward function that is able to compute both sequence- and knowledge-level rewards. Third, we propose a new algorithm for more effectively learning the proposed model. To our knowledge, it is the first time that knowledge information has been explicitly discussed and utilized in RL-based sequential recommenders, especially for the exploration process. Extensive experiment results on both next-item and next-session recommendation tasks show that our model can significantly outperform the baselines on four real-world datasets.
