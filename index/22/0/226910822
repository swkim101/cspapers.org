In this paper, we present an adaptive decoupling control scheme using a serial redundant robot for teleoperated Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). In presence of uncertain interaction between the surgical tip and the patient body during teleoperated surgery, the accuracy of the end-effector position should be secured, while guaranteeing a Remote Center of Motion (RCM) constraint. Adaptive fuzzy approximation is adopted to estimate the dynamical uncertainties in physical interaction between the surgical tip and the abdominal wall to enhance the accuracy and keep the RCM constranit. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach was verified in a lab setup environment by using the LWR 4+ (KUKA) slave robot and Sigma7 (Force Dimension) master device.
