The technological advancement in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has evolved into sophisticated hardware, leading to systems that are complex and interconnected. This trend has made modern CPS susceptible to faults. We present a discrete event method developed using the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) to detect, diagnose, and accommodate CPS faults in Real-time. This includes Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD), Fault Tolerance (FT) in the control system, and Sensor Fusion in the Sensor system called SAFE
