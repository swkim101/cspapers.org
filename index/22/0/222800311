Interactive task learning (ITL) allows end users to 'teach' an intelligent agent new tasks, the corresponding task conditions,and the relevant concepts. This paper presents my research on expanding the applicability, generalizability, robustness, expressiveness, and script sharability of ITL systems usinga multi-modal approach. My research demonstrates that a multi-modal ITL approach that combines programming by demonstration and natural language instructions can empower users without significant programming expertise to extend intelligent agents for their own app-based computing tasks.
