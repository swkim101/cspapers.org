In this paper, we explore the use of a real-time speech visualization overlay to help native English speakers (NES) reflect on their speech speed and allow them to understand how English as a Foreign Language speakers (EFLS) perceive their speech. Our visual system generates a sequence of bubbles based on the speaking speed overlaid close to the user's mouth; the faster the speaking speed, the denser the bubble sequence, and vice versa. The results suggest that the presence of the speech visualization helps NES to understand their speech speed, and subsequently, it helps EFLS to feel comfortable speaking during the online group discussion.
