This paper presents a HAO-Graph system that generates and visualizes knowledge graphs from a speech in real-time. When a user speaks to the system, HAO-Graph transforms the voice into knowledge graphs with key phrases from the original speech as nodes and edges. Different from language-to-language systems, such as Chinese-to-English and English-to-English, HAO-Graph converts a speech into graphs, and is the first of its kind. The effectiveness of our HAO-Graph system is verified by a two-hour chairman's talk in front of two thousand participants at an annual meeting in the form of a satisfaction survey.
