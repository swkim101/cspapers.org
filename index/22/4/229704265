When generating GUI tests for Android apps, it typically is a separate test computer that generates interactions, which are then executed on an actual Android device. While this approach is efficient in the sense that apps and interactions execute quickly, the communication overhead between test computer and device slows down testing considerably. In this work, we present DD-2, a test generator for Android that tests other apps on the device using Android accessibility services. In our experiments, DD-2 has shown to be 3.2 times faster than its computer-device counterpart, while sharing the same source code.
