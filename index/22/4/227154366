Passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags are attractive because they are low cost, battery-free, and easy to deploy. This technology is traditionally being used to identify tags attached to the objects. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of turning passive RFID tags into battery-free temperature sensors. The impedance of the RFID tag changes with the temperature and this change will be manifested in the reflected signal from the tag. This opens up an opportunity to realize battery-free temperature sensing using a passive RFID tag with already deployed Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) RFID reader-antenna infrastructure in supply chain management or inventory tracking. However, it is challenging to achieve high accuracy and robustness against the changes in the environment. To address these challenges, we first develop a detailed analytical model to capture the impact of temperature change on the tag impedance and the resulting phase of the reflected signal. We then build a system that uses a pair of tags, which respond differently to the temperature change to cancel out other environmental impacts. Using extensive evaluation, we show our model is accurate and our system can estimate the temperature within a 2.9 degree centigrade median error and support a normal read range of 3.5 m in an environment-independent manner.
