We propose an in-ear sensing method that automatically detects vocal reactions that people often exhibit when listening to music. We observe what kind of vocal reactions are often brought during music listening and investigate the challenges of applying an existing representative acoustic classification model to vocal reaction recognition. We present our vocal reaction recognition method and the preliminary evaluation to assess its performance.
