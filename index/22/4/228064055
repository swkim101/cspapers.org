Self-supervised detection and segmentation of foreground objects aims for accuracy without annotated training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on restrictive assumptions on appearance and motion.For scenes with dynamic activities and camera motion, we propose a multi-camera framework in which geometric constraints are embedded in the form of multi-view consistency during training via coarse 3D localization in a voxel grid and fine-grained offset regression. In this manner, we learn a joint distribution of proposals over multiple views. At inference time, our method operates on single RGB images. We outperform state-of-the-art techniques both on images that visually depart from those of standard benchmarks and on those of the classical Human3.6M dataset.
