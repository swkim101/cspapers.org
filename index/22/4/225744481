Placement for very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits is one of the most important steps for design closure. This paper proposes a novel GPU-accelerated placement framework DREAMPlace, by casting the analytical placement problem equivalently to training a neural network. Implemented on top of a widely-adopted deep learning toolkit PyTorch, with customized key kernels for wirelength and density computations, DREAMPlace can achieve over $ 30\times $ speedup in global placement without quality degradation compared to the state-of-the-art multi-threaded placer RePlAce. We believe this work shall open up new directions for revisiting classical EDA problems with advancement in AI hardware and software.
