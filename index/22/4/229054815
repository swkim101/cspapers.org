 With the growth of complexity and extent, large scale interconnected network systems, e.g., transportation networks or infrastructure networks, become more vulnerable towards external disturbances. Hence, managing potential disruptive events during design, operating, and recovery phase of an engineered system therefore improving the systemâ€™s resilience is an important yet challenging task. In order to ensure system resilience after the occurrence of failure events, this study proposes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based restoration framework using heterogenous dispatchable agents. Scenario based stochastic optimization (SO) technique is adopted to deal with the inherent uncertainties imposed on the recovery process from the nature. Moreover, different from conventional SO using deterministic equivalent formulations, additional risk measure is implemented for this study because of the temporal sparsity of the decision making in applications such as the recovery from extreme events. The resulting restoration framework involves with a large-scale MILP problem and thus an adequate decompaction technique, i.e., modified Langragian Relaxation, is also proposed in order to achieve tractable time complexity. Case study results based on the IEEE 37-buses test feeder demonstrate the benefits of using the proposed framework for resilience improvement as well as the advantages of adopting SO formulations.
