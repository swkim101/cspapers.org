In this study, we measured the biomedical signals when subjects viewing videos and examined whether the high-definition videos like 4K resolution videos give the healing effects. We constructed an experimental environment which subjects feel less stressed, and measured heart rates, respiratory rates, cerebral blood flow dynamics, and skin temperature as biomedical signals.
