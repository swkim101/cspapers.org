In this paper, we propose BeeCast, a collaborative video streaming system, that allows a group of mobile users to cooperate in streaming video content. The novelty of the proposed system is that it allows each user to watch the same video content on their own device at the same time. This entails proposing a method to exchange the downloaded video chunks among the users using device-to-device communication. The proposed system is composed of two components: BeeBuzzer, and BeePlanner. The BeePlanner component performs chunk scheduling, while the BeeBuzzer component manages and coordinates the chunk exchange among devices.
