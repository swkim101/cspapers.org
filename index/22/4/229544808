Deformable objects are very common around us in our daily life. Because they have infinitely many degrees of freedom, they present a challenging problem in robotics. Inspired by practical industrial applications, we present in this paper our research on using a humanoid robot to take a long, thin and flexible belt out of a bobbin and pick up the bending part of the belt from the ground. By proposing a novel non-prehensile manipulation strategy "scraping" which utilizes the friction between the gripper and the surface of the belt, efficient manipulation can be achieved. In addition, a 3D shape detection algorithm for deformable objects is used during manipulation process. By integrating the novel "scraping" motion and the shape detection algorithm into our multi-objective QP-based controller, we show experimentally humanoid robots can complete this complex task.
