Physical distancing between individuals is key to preventing the spread of a disease such as COVID-19. On the one hand, having access to information about physical interactions is critical for decision makers; on the other, this information is sensitive and can be used to track individuals. In this work, we design Poirot, a system to collect aggregate statistics about physical interactions in a privacy-preserving manner. We show a preliminary evaluation of our system that demonstrates the scalability of our approach even while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.
