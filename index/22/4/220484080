Pedestrian detection at nighttime is a crucial and frontier problem in surveillance, but has not been well explored by the computer vision and artificial intelligence communities. Most of existing methods detect pedestrians under favorable lighting conditions (e.g. daytime) and achieve promising performances. In contrast, they often fail under unstable lighting conditions (e.g. nighttime). Night is a critical time for criminal suspects to act in the field of security. The existing nighttime pedestrian detection dataset is captured by a car camera, specially designed for autonomous driving scenarios. The dataset for nighttime surveillance scenario is still vacant. There are vast differences between autonomous driving and surveillance, including viewpoint and illumination. In this paper, we build a novel pedestrian detection dataset from the nighttime surveillance aspect: NightSurveillance1. As a benchmark dataset for pedestrian detection at nighttime, we compare the performances of state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors and the results reveal that the methods cannot solve all the challenging problems of NightSurveillance. We believe that NightSurveillance can further advance the research of pedestrian detection, especially in the field of surveillance security at nighttime.
