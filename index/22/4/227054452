Rotation detection serves as a fundamental building block in many visual applications involving aerial image, scene text, and face etc. Differing from the dominant regression-based approaches for orientation estimation, this paper explores a relatively less-studied methodology based on classification. The hope is to inherently dismiss the boundary discontinuity issue as encountered by the regression-based detectors. We propose new techniques to push its frontier in two aspects: i) new encoding mechanism: the design of two Densely Coded Labels (DCL) for angle classification, to replace the Sparsely Coded Label (SCL) in existing classification-based detectors, leading to three times training speed increase as empirically observed across benchmarks, further with notable improvement in detection accuracy; ii) loss re-weighting: we propose Angle Distance and Aspect Ratio Sensitive Weighting (ADARSW), which improves the detection accuracy especially for square-like objects, by making DCL-based detectors sensitive to angular distance and objectâ€™s aspect ratio. Extensive experiments and visual analysis on large-scale public datasets for aerial images i.e. DOTA, UCAS-AOD, HRSC2016, as well as scene text dataset ICDAR2015 and MLT, show the effectiveness of our approach. The source code is available at $\color{Red}{\text{DCL}}$ and is also integrated in our open source rotation detection benchmark:$\color{Red}{\text{RotationDetection}}$.
