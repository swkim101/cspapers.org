Hundreds of millions of users work with digital documents for their everyday tasks but the user interfaces have not fundamentally changed since they were first designed in the late seventies [10]. We focus on two examples of today's 'extreme users' of documents, legal professionals and scientists. Based on their work practices, we designed two document-centered tools: Textlets supports constraints and consistency within documents; FileWeaver automatically tracks dependencies across documents. I then describe two research directions that emerged from our empirical studies and recent literature: collaboration in documents, e.g. Jupyter notebook and direct manipulation for computational documents such as LaTeX. This dissertation will enhance our understanding of how today's users work with documents; demonstrate novel tools and expand the fundamental theory of interaction.
