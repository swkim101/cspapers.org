Most of today's AI technologies are geared towards mastering specific tasks performance through learning from a huge volume of data. However, less attention has still been given to make the AI understand its own purposes or be responsible socially. In this paper, a new model of agent is presented with the capacity to represent itself as a distinct individual with identity, a mind of its own, unique experiences, and social lives. In this way, the agent can interact with its surroundings and other agents seamlessly and meaningfully. A practical framework for developing an agent architecture with this model of self and self-awareness is proposed allowing self to be ascribed to an existing intelligent agent architecture in general to enable its social ability, interactivity, and co-presence with others. Possible applications are discussed with some exemplifying cases based on an implementation of a conversational agent.
