Online social networks have become a crucial medium to disseminate the latest political, commercial, and social information. Users with high visibility are often selected as seeds to spread information and affect their adoption in target groups. We study how gender differences and similarities can impact the information spreading process. Using a large-scale Instagram dataset and a small-scale Facebook dataset, we first conduct a multi-faceted analysis taking the interaction type, directionality and frequency into account. To this end, we explore a variety of existing and new single and multihop centrality measures. Our analysis unveils that males and females interact differently depending on the interaction types, e.g., likes or comments, and they feature different support and promotion patterns. We complement prior work showing that females do not reach top visibility (often referred to as the glass ceiling effect) jointly factoring in the connectivity and interaction intensity, both of which were previously mainly discussed independently. Inspired by these observations, we propose a novel seeding framework, called Disparity Seeding, which aims at maximizing spread while reaching a target user group, e.g., a certain percentage of females - promoting the influence of under-represented groups. Disparity Seeding ranks influential users with two gender-aware measures, the Target HI-index and the Embedding index. Extensive simulations comparing Disparity Seeding with target-agnostic algorithms show that Disparity Seeding meets the target percentage while effectively maximizing the spread. Disparity Seeding can be generalized to counter different types of inequality, e.g., race, and proactively promote minorities in the society.
