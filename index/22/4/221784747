Today's GPS navigators have difficulty determining altitude on multi-layer roads. In this paper, we first explain how the structures of overpasses and bridges have special magnetic fields. We then propose how to use the magnetometers which come with off-the-shelf smartphones to assist GPS navigators to determine position on multi-layer roads by detecting and matching these magnetic fingerprints. We also present performance evaluation on different multi-layer roads to show the feasibility of the proposed method.
