Surface identification provides contextual services during humancomputer interaction, which is important for target detection and scene understanding. A robust and ubiquitous surface recognition system has a wide range of applications such as context awareness and robot operation. Existing methods have shortcomings of requiring specialized devices and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Surtify, a surface identification system based on acoustic dispersion with a smartphone. By combining the intrinsic physical phenomenon (i.e., acoustic dispersion) with a deep learning model, Surtify can identify eleven kinds of surfaces with accuracies up to 96%, even in cross-person and cross-location scenarios.
