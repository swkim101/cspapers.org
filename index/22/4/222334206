Effectively detecting the fraudulent invitations is valuable for many online Internet enterprises such as iQIYI to promote good products and improve the user experience. However, it remains highly non-trivial to address, which mainly lies in two challenging data characteristics. First, the invitation graph structure is globally large yet locally small, as a large number of invitations usually occur in a very small local graph, making the global and local consistency difficult to achieve simultaneously. Secondly, the user associations are heterogeneous and diverse, as the user associations are from multiple different data resources, making the effects of multiple user associations difficult to use effectively. To this end, this paper proposes a novel heterogeneous graph neural network HmGnn, to detect fraudulent invitations at iQIYI platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study fraud invitation detection via graph neural networks. HmGnn handles the homogeneity and heterogeneity of networks simultaneously. Specifically, the proposal constructively introduces links between homogenous mini-graphs based on the similarity of mini-graphs, facilitating the impact of local mini-graphs to the global graph structure. In addition, this paper presents a heterogeneous attention convolution network to accurately optimize the contribution of multiple heterogeneous user associations. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world business data validate the excellent effectiveness and improvement on risk management of our method.
