We present GROOT, a mobile volumetric video streaming system that delivers three-dimensional data to mobile devices for a fully immersive virtual and augmented reality experience. The system design for streaming volumetric videos should be fundamentally different from conventional 2D video streaming systems. First, the amount of data required to deliver the 3D volume is considerably larger than conventional videos with frames of 2D images, even compared to high-resolution 2D or 360Â° videos. Second, the 3D data representation, which encodes the surface of objects within the volume, is a sparse and unorganized data structure with varying scales, whereas a conventional video is composed of a sequence of images with the fixed-size 2D grid structure. GROOT is a streaming framework with a novel data structure that enables not only real-time transmission and decoding on mobile devices but also continuous on-demand user view adaptation. Specifically, we modify the conventional octree to introduce the independence of leaf nodes with minimal memory overhead, which enables parallel decoding of highly irregular 3D data. We also developed a suite of techniques to compress color information and filter out 3D points outside of a user's view, which efficiently minimizes the data size and decoding cost. Our extensive evaluation shows that GROOT achieves more stable but faster frame rates compared to any previous method to stream and visualize volumetric videos on mobile devices.
