Over the last decade, energy harvesting has seen significant growth as different markets incorporate green and sustainable electrical energy production. Even though costs have fallen, few products in the Internet-of-Things marketplace have embraced solutions based on energy harvesting. This is partly due to a mismatch in both the power density and timeliness of energy production and consumption. Until recently, harvesting-based systems required a battery or supercapacitor to be functional. After years of research, advances in energy management techniques have enabled the design of fully batteryless sensing devices. This demo introduces the batteryless MiroCard, a novel smart-card powered by light. Its fast wake-up times and energy-efficient operation allow the MiroCard to emit BLE beacons even in low ambient light conditions.
