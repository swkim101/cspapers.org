Passive haptic feedback for virtual reality can provide immersive sensations but suffers from scalability issues. To tackle these, two independent concepts have been proposed previously: Dynamic Passive Haptic Feedback (DPHF), leveraging actuated props that change their physical state, and Haptic Retargeting, redirecting the user's hand during interaction. While past research on both techniques reported promising results, up to now, these concepts remained isolated. This paper advocates the combined use of DPHF and Haptic Retargeting. We introduce two thought experiments showcasing that the combination of both techniques in an example scenario is beneficial to solve two central challenges of prop-based VR haptics: haptic similarity and co-location of proxies and virtual objects.
