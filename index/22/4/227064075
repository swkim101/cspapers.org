The access transport networks are currently facing the traffic congestion problem due to rapid growth of user’s needs. The future fifth generation (5G) and beyond networks must overcome this issue to ensure that end-users have access to high-speed networks, especially in the ace of internet of things (IoTs), big data and so on. In particular, free-space optical (FSO) communication is technology that transmit large bandwidth’s signal wirelessly by using light propagating in free space and enables to realize this existing problem. In this paper, the access network configuration, i.e. transmitter to hybrid SSMF/FSO channel then to receiver, has been studied. We analyzed and evaluated system performance Q-factor of the dual polarization multiplexed 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (DP-16QAM) signal with hybrid configuration of SSMF and FSO links under atmospheric conditions such as clear air, rain and heavy weather. The lowest bandwidth of signal DP-16QAM through hybrid 80 km SSMF and 1 km FSO link in heavy weather conditions (25 mm/h) is 40 Gbaud. At the same time, the transmission distance of SSMF, FSO range, beam divergence, and receiver aperture diameter is optimized.
