In this paper we focus on a less usual way to represent Boolean functions, namely on representations by switch-lists. Given a truth table representation of a Boolean function f the switch-list representation (SLR) of f is a list of Boolean vectors from the truth table which have a different function value than the preceding Boolean vector in the truth table. The main aim of this paper is to include the language SL of all SLR in the Knowledge Compilation Map [Darwiche and Marquis, 2002] and to argue, that SL may in certain situations constitute a reasonable choice for a target language in knowledge compilation. First we compare SL with a number of standard representation languages (such as CNF, DNF, and OBDD) with respect to their relative succinctness. As a by-product of this analysis we also give a short proof of a long standing open question from [Darwiche and Marquis, 2002], namely the incomparability of MODS (models) and PI (prime implicates) languages. Next we analyze which standard transformations and queries (those considered in [Darwiche and Marquis, 2002] can be performed in poly-time with respect to the size of the input SLR. We show that this collection is quite broad and the combination of poly-time transformations and queries is quite unique.
