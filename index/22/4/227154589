In search and rescue (SAR) operation, the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) gathers great attention. Existing studies have made various experiments to find victims by a UAVs with a single sensor, e.g., one of an optical camera, a thermal infrared camera, and a radio wave signal. However, the experimental environments are limited to show the performance of the sensor. Since there are various SAR missions, it is difficult to choose the best sensor for all environments. Then, to enhance the UAV performance, we need to consider multiple sensors to find a victim efficiently. In the paper, we investigate optical camera and thermal infrared camera for finding a victim helpfully. In the investigation, we observed the differences between their images by distance and brightness to find a human.
