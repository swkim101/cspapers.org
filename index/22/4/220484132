Improving maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) outcomes is a critical target for global sustainable development. Our research is centered on building predictive models, evaluating their interpretability, and generating actionable insights about the markers (features) and triggers (events) associated with vulnerability in MNCH. In this work, we demonstrate how a tool for inspecting "black box" machine learning models can be used to generate actionable insights from models trained on demographic health survey data to predict neonatal mortality.
