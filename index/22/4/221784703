Wireless sensors have enabled a number of key applications. Due to their energy constraints, wireless sensors today communicate occasional short samples or pre-determined summary statistics of the data they collect. This means that computing every additional statistic at high fidelity incurs additional communication and energy overhead. This paper presents Joltik, a framework enabling general, future-proof, and energy-efficient analytics for low power wireless sensors. Joltik is general in that it summarizes sensed data from low-power devices without making assumptions on which specific statistical metric(s) are desired at the cloud and is future-proof, meaning it supports new, unforeseen metrics. Joltik is built upon recent theoretical advances in universal sketching, which can enable a Joltik sensor node to report a compact summary of observed data to enable a large class of statistical summaries. We address key system design and implementation challenges with respect to communication, memory, and computation bottlenecks that arise in practically realizing the potential benefits of universal sketching in the low-power regime. We present a proof-of-concept testbed evaluation of Joltik in LoRaWAN NUCLEO-L476RG boards and sensors. Across a range of realistic datasets, Joltik provides up to a 24.6Ã— reduction in energy cost compared to transmitting raw data and outperforms many natural alternatives (e.g., sub-sampling, custom sketches, compressed sensing, and lossy compression) in terms of energy-accuracy trade-offs.
