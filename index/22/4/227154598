Wearable devices collect user information about their activities and provide insights to improve their daily lifestyles. Smart health applications have achieved great success by training Machine Learning (ML) models on a large quantity of user data from wearables. However, user privacy and scalability are becoming critical challenges for training ML models in a centralized way. Federated learning (FL) is a novel ML paradigm with the goal of training high quality models while distributing training data over a large number of devices. In this demo, we present FL4W, a FL system with wearable devices enabling training a human activity recognition classifier. We also perform preliminary analytics to investigate the model performance with increasing computation of clients.
