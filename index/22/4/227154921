In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant problems for our society. Although contact tracing is an essential countermeasure for minimizing exposure, its applications are not widely used in Japan. We have developed a Wi-fi based contact tracing system for use in our campus network to protect students and staff. Although the area covered by Wi-fi technology is too wide to accurately analyze contacts, it can still be used for comparative analysis. We conducted preliminary experiments as an example to compare the effects of countermeasures. Our results show that by making 30% of classrooms safe, we can reduce the number of potential exposures by over 90%. This paper summarizes 1) the system design to acquire necessary information while maintaining the privacy of students, and 2) the results of preliminary experiments that compare the effect of countermeasures.
