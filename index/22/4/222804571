Videos are a convenient platform to begin, maintain, or improve a fitness program or physical activity. Traditional video systems allow users to manipulate videos through specific user interface actions such as button clicks or mouse drags, but have no model of what the user is doing and are unable to adapt in useful ways. We present adaptive video playback, which seamlessly synchronises video playback with the user's movements, building upon the principle of direct manipulation video navigation. We implement adaptive video playback in Reactive Video, a vision-based system which supports users learning or practising a physical skill. The use of pre-existing videos removes the need to create bespoke content or specially authored videos, and the system can provide real-time guidance and feedback to better support users when learning new movements. Adaptive video playback using a discrete Bayes and particle filter are evaluated on a data set collected of participants performing tai chi and radio exercises. Results show that both approaches can accurately adapt to the user's movements, however reversing playback can be problematic.
