In this demonstration, we show that audio signals emitted by a smartphone speaker can be captured by the accelerometer on the same smartphone, and accelerometers on recently released smartphones can cover most of the fundamental frequency band of adult speech. Based on these pivotal observations, we present AccelEve, a new side channel attack that allows smartphone applications to eavesdrop on the smartphone speaker without the requirement of sensitive system permissions. Through analyzing the accelerometer measurements of a smartphone, AccelEve is able to: 1) recognize the speech information (text) carried by the acceleration signal; 2) reconstruct the audio signal played by the smartphone speaker. This demo will present experimental validations for our observations and the proposed system.
