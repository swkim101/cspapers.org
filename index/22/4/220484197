We investigate opinion dynamics in multi-agent networks when there

exists a bias toward one of two possible opinions; for example, reflecting a status quo vs a

superior alternative.

Starting with all agents sharing an initial opinion representing the status

quo, the system evolves in steps. In each step, one agent selected uniformly at

random adopts with some probability a the superior opinion, and with

probability 1 - a it follows an underlying update rule to revise its

opinion on the basis of those held by its neighbors.

We analyze the convergence of the resulting process under two well-known update 

rules, namely majority and voter.

The framework we propose exhibits a rich structure, with a nonobvious

interplay between topology and underlying update rule.

For example, for the voter rule we show that the speed of convergence 

bears no significant dependence on the underlying topology, 

whereas the picture changes completely under the majority rule, 

where network density negatively affects convergence.

We believe that the model we propose is at the same time simple, rich, and modular,

affording mathematical characterization of the interplay between bias,

underlying opinion dynamics, and social structure in a unified setting.
