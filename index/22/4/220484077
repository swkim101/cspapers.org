Population aging is becoming an increasingly important issue around the world. As people live longer, they also tend to suffer from more challenging medical conditions. Currently, there is a lack of a holistic technology-powered solution for providing quality care at affordable cost to patients suffering from co-morbidity. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel AI-powered solution to provide early detection of the onset of Dementia + Parkinson's disease (DPD) co-morbidity, a condition which severely limits a senior's ability to live actively and independently. We investigate useful in-game behaviour markers which can support machine learning-based predictive analytics on seniors' risk of developing DPD co-morbidity.
