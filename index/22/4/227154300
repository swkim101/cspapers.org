The automotive navigation often embarrasses drivers by providing guidance that is awkward, incomprehensible, or almost impossible to follow. We point out the lack of on-the-spot awareness as the key reason behind this situation. The current navigation does not consider a driver's characteristics such as driving ability, as well as the detailed conditions of the current driving environment. In this paper, we explore the cases of embarrassment related to navigation usage. We collected a total of 56 cases of embarrassing moments from three drivers' experiences and derived 8 categories of embarrassing moments.
