2D image-based 3D objects retrieval is a new topic for 3D objects retrieval which can be used to manage 3D data with 2D images. The goal is to search some related 3D objects when given a 2D image. The task is challenging due to the large domain gap between 2D images and 3D objects. Therefore, it is essential to consider domain adaptation problems to reduce domain discrepancy. However, most of the existing domain adaptation methods only utilize the semantic information from the source domain to predict labels in the target domain and neglect the intrinsic structure of the target domain. In this paper, we propose a domain alignment framework with consistent domain structure learning to reduce the large gap between 2D images and 3D objects. The domain structure learning module makes use of both the semantic information from the source domain and the intrinsic structure of the target domain, which provides more reliable predicted labels to the domain alignment module to better align the conditional distribution. We conducted experiments on two public datasets, MI3DOR and MI3DOR-2, and the experimental results demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
