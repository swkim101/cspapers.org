We construct asymptotically optimal adjacency labelling schemes for every hereditary class containing 2Ω(n2) n-vertex graphs as n→ ∞. This regime contains many classes of interest, for instance perfect graphs or comparability graphs, for which we obtain an adjacency labelling scheme with labels of n/4+o(n) bits per vertex. This implies the existence of a reachability labelling scheme for digraphs with labels of n/4+o(n) bits per vertex and comparability labelling scheme for posets with labels of n/4+o(n) bits per element. All these results are best possible, up to the lower order term.
