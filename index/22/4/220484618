In this paper we present several proofs for the computational complexity of the physics-based video game Angry Birds. We are able to demonstrate that solving levels for different versions of Angry Birds is either NP-hard, PSPACE-hard, PSPACE-complete or EXPTIME-hard, depending on the maximum number of birds available and whether the game engine is deterministic or stochastic. We believe that this is the first time that a single-player video game has been proven EXPTIME-hard.
