We envision that our earbuds recognize how much we understand learning materials while taking online lectures for effective learning and teaching, e.g., to pinpoint the part for which we need to put more effort to learn. To this end, we explore the feasibility of recognizing the perceived level of understanding of online learners based on IMU sensor data from earbuds. We present an exploratory study to identify head-related behaviors that can be detected by in-ear IMU data, which are associated with the perceived level of understanding for online lectures.
