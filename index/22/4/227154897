Existing indoor location systems do not easily scale at low cost while maintaining high accuracy. We present EasiTrack, an indoor tracking system that achieves decimeter accuracy using a single commodity WiFi Access Point (AP) under Non-Line-Of-Sight conditions and can deploy at scale with (almost) zero cost. We build a fully functional real-time system with a satellite-like architecture, which enables EasiTrack to support an unlimited number of clients. We have demonstrated EasiTrack in a number of different scenarios to track both humans and machines. The results reveal that EasiTrack achieves a decimeter median accuracy and a <2m maximum error and supports a broad coverage of 50 mÃ—60 m using a single AP.
