This research investigated the psychological stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of essential oil odor exposure. In Japan, a stay-at-home restriction order was implemented in May 2020. We sent essential oils to the homes of 30 participants. The participants received emails 5 times a day for 6 days and reported how they felt before and after the essential oil odor exposure. They also reported their circumstances and intentions. Results showed that the vitality and stability levels increased after essential oil odor exposure. Besides, four psychological stress structures were obtained. Some of the participants felt conflicted about balancing housework, childcare, and work. They were the most stressed, and their vitality and stability levels increased considerably.
