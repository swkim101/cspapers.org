Distance learning, for which the demand is increasing due to the recent expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, pointed out the problem of less communication level that it would reduce student's concentration level in the study. However, there is no clear and objective evidence about such effect on the concentration level. In this work, we propose a method to objectively evaluate distance learning with the biometric information to understand the difference of the student's concentration level during the study. We measure the student's electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) to evaluate the concentration level by observing the change of student's emotion based on different communication condition during distance learning. In the experiment, we measured EEG and HRV of the students, while turning on and off face-to-face (FTF) video camera. The analysis of EEG and HRV results show that different communication condition effect student's concentration level. We found that their emotional states are different when the video is turned on and off and also found that it could be due to their preferences of the subject.
