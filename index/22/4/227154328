The COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping across the world and causing widespread death and disruption. To this effect, nations have struggled to use technologies to detect and to monitor COVID-19 cases and related information. Unfortunately, both inconsistent and inaccurate information from "trustless" sources, and "mistrust" in effectively monitoring and reporting patients symptoms and condition have highlighted the failure of existing infrastructures to preserve human healthcare while maintaining patient's privacy and to slow down the widespread of the pandemic. This paper provides an insight of the perceived benefits of Blockchain to expectations of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of providing "trust" in addressing information sharing in health systems while maintaining privacy. This paper exhibits a Blockchain-based COVID-19 Smart Healthcare approach that embraces Blockchain's benefits in healthcare systems.
