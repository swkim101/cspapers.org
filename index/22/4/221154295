We propose the integration of service-learning into the early undergraduate computer science curriculum by way of a course on computing, ethics and society. We believe that such a course will fill a common gap in computer science and can be used to draw smart, motivated students to the discipline by embracing its social relevance. Additionally, we outline a particular service-learning project that can be undertaken by students in the course--initiating a community computer recycling program. We describe the successful implementation of such a recycling program and describe some logistical issues that may arise in organizing such a program in a service-learning course. We believe that a student-implemented community outreach project such as this can alter the public's perception of computer science and will assist in reversing the trend of declining undergraduate enrollment.
