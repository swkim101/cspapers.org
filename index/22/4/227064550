Universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), which is a modification of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), is one of the proposed modulation methods for next generation wireless communication systems. To the best of our knowledge, the UFMC modulation method has not been implemented on visible light communication (VLC) systems using organic light emitting diodes (OLED), which have been rigorously researched for next generation indoor and short-range wireless communications. In this paper, for the first time, we presented in details the implementation process and experimental demonstration of UFMC modulation techniques for a VLC system using a commercial OLED. In our initial experimental results, UFMC could be support an aggregated bit rate of 3.1738 Mbps in a OLED-based VLC system with 325 kHz bandwidth.
