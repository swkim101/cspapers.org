The increasing complexity of web pages has brought a number of solutions to offer simpler or lighter versions of these pages. The qualitative evaluation of the new versions is commonly carried out relying on user studies. In addition to the associated costs, running user studies might become extremely challenging due to health, travel, and financial constraints. Moreover, user studies are prone to subjectivity, which makes it difficult to compare the results of different studies. In this paper, we propose PQual, a tool that enables the automation of the qualitative evaluation of web pages using computer vision. Results show that PQual computes comparable similarity scores to the scores provided by human raters. In addition, it can effectively evaluate all the functionality of a web page, whereas humans might skip many of the functional elements during the evaluation.
