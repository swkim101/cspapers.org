Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is a conventional and prevalent procedure used to diagnose and treat diseases in the digestive tract. This procedure requires inserting an endoscope equipped with a camera and instruments inside a patient to the target of interest. To manoeuvre the endoscope, an endoscopist would rotate the knob at the handle to change the direction of the distal tip and apply the feeding force to advance the endoscope. However, due to the nature of the design, this often causes a looping problem during insertion making it difficult to be further advanced to the deeper section of the tract such as the transverse and ascending colon. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel robotic endoscope which is covered by a rotating screw-like sheath and uses a spiral insertion technique to generate ’pull’ forces at the distal tip of the endoscope to facilitate insertion. The whole shaft of the endoscope can be actively rotated, providing the crawling ability from the attached spiral sheath. With the redundant control on a spring-like continuum joint, the bending tip is capable of maintaining its orientation to assist endoscope navigation. To test its functions and feasibility to address the looping problem, three experiments were carried out. The first two experiments were to analyse the kinematic of the device and test the ability of the device to hold its distal tip at different orientation angles during spiral insertion. In the third experiment, we inserted the device in the bent colon phantom to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design against looping when advancing through a curved section of a colon. Results show the moving ability using spiral technique and verify its potential of clinical application.
