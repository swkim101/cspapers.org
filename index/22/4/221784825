Temperature sensor is one of the most widespread technologies in the IoT era. Wireless temperature monitoring systems are convenient to deploy and can drive mass applications in the fields of smart home, transportation and logistics. Currently, wireless temperature monitoring products are based on microelectronic and semiconductor components, which are not cost-effective (e.g., a few dollars) and more importantly, generate electronic wastes. In this work, we present ThermoWave, a new paradigm of wireless temperature monitoring that is ecological, battery-less, and ultra-low cost. Specifically, ThermoWave is on the basis of the thermal scattering effect on millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals. Specifically, cholesteryl materials align their molecular patterns at different environmental temperatures, and this temperature-induced pattern change will be modulated and sensed by the scattered mmWave signals. There are three functional modules in the ThermoWave system. The ThermoTag is a cholesteryl material inked film or paper tag that can be conveniently attached to the object of interest to monitor temperature changes. Each ThermoTag costs less than 0.01 dollars. The temperature modulated mmWave scattering will be received by a mmWave-radar based ThermoScanner and demodulated by a software-based temperature decoder ThermoSense, which includes a model-based method (i.e., ThermoDot) for point temperature estimation and a data-driven method (i.e., ThermoNet) for thermal imaging. We prototype and evaluate the ThermoWave system performance in both controlled and real-world setups. Experimental results show that the ThermoWave achieves the precision of ±1.0°F in the range of 30°F to 120°F in a controlled setup. We also investigate the performance in real-world applications, and the ThermoWave can reach the ±3.0°F precision in the temperature estimation. We also test and discuss sustainability, durability, robustness, and cost-effectiveness of the ThermoWave in both design and experiments.
