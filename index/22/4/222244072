In this paper, we present a model of opportunistic planning that uses planning-time rear soning about the opportunities that might arise during plan execution. The model is composed of three parts: a planning-time mechanism that places blocked goals into memory for later activation, an understanding system that activates suspended goals as a byproduct of parsing the world, and an executiontime process for evaluating opportunities and merging newly activated goals into the planning/ execution agenda. We discuss this model in terms of examples from TRUCKER, a routescheduling system, and RUNNER, an errand planner.
