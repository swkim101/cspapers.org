Private set intersection (PSI) allows two parties to compute the intersection of their data without revealing the data they possess that is outside of the intersection. However, in many cases of joint data analysis, the intersection is also sensitive. We define differentially private set intersection and we propose new protocols using (leveled) homomorphic encryption where the result is differentially private. Our circuit-based approach has an adaptability that allows us to achieve differential privacy, as well as to compute predicates over the intersection such as cardinality. Furthermore, our protocol produces differentially private output for set intersection and set intersection cardinality that is optimal in terms of communication and computation complexity. For a client set of size $m$ and a server set of size $n$, where $m$ is smaller than $n$, our communication complexity is $O(m)$ while previous circuit-based protocols only achieve $O(n+m)$ communication complexity. In addition to our asymptotic optimizations which include new analysis for using nested cuckoo hashing for PSI, we demonstrate the practicality of our protocol through an implementation that shows the feasibility of computing the differentially private intersection for large data sets containing millions of elements.
