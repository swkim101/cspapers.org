Our objective is to achieve a city where everyone can move safely and comfortably by developing and implementing ICT-based mobile support system at the actual transport hub. Our system uses cameras installed at the transport hub to detect people who have difficulty moving, and notifies this information to the transportation staff in real time to help them move more smoothly. This system makes it possible to aggregate and provide information on places that is useful for COVID-19 measures, such as measuring the congestion of places and the social distances of the people who gather there.
