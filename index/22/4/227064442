This paper presents a novel wideband element antenna for base station application covering all frequency bands for existing cellular system from 1.65 to 2.93 GHz. The proposed antenna element has a stable gain of 8.7 ± 0.8 dBi over the entire frequency range. The horizontal beamwidth is at least 60 degrees. The performance of this antenna element is satisfied all requirements for expected wideband base station antennas. The antenna element based on magneto-electric (ME) dipoles consists of two double-bowtie shaped dipoles for two polarizations of ±45 degrees. The feeding baluns for the two dipoles have step-changed width to obtain better impedance matching, and they are simply designed for mass production. Besides, the radiators of the dipoles are double- bowtie shaped to enhance the impedance bandwidth.
