Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) IEEE 802.11ac WiFi systems only use a low number of antennas. This limits the multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) performance and, hence, the throughput of such systems, especially in dense environments. We present a unique solution based on hybrid digital-analog (HDA) beamforming to overcome the limitation of COTS WiFi hardware and effectively increase the MU-MIMO gain and to unlock the potential of MU-MIMO in WiFi. We use COTS WiFi hardware in combination with a self-developed beamforming module and novel algorithms for the HDA approach, leveraging the MU-MIMO precoding of the WiFi system. The implemented control and signal processing software is fully transparent to the WiFi part, i.e., no protocol changes are needed. We demonstrate the increase in MU-MIMO gain using unmodified COTS end-user terminals.
