The growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has the potential to improve waste management. In this work, we present ZotBins, a system that facilitates sustainable practices for individuals and improves waste management efficiency for organizations. ZotBins consists of smart bins fitted with sensors, a waste recognition framework, and a variety of user applications. Currently, eight smart bins have been deployed in University of California, Irvine (UCI) campus and the preliminary estimates show that it improves the diversion rate (percentage of waste diverted from landfills through methods such as recycling) by about 20% while generating tens of thousands of dollars in revenue over the course of next ten years for the university.
