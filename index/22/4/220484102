3D point cloud semantic segmentation has attracted wide attention with its extensive applications in autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robot sensing fields. However, in existing methods, each point in the segmentation results is predicted independently from each other. This property causes the non-contiguity of label sets in three-dimensional space and produces many noisy label points, which hinders the improvement of segmentation accuracy. To address this problem, we first extend adversarial learning to this task and propose a novel framework Attention Adversarial Networks (AttAN). With high-order correlations in label sets learned from the adversarial learning, segmentation network can predict labels closer to the real ones and correct noisy results. Moreover, we design an additive attention block for the segmentation network, which is used to automatically focus on regions critical to the segmentation task by learning the correlation between multi-scale features. Adversarial learning, which explores the underlying relationship between labels in high-dimensional space, opens up a new way in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. Experimental results on ScanNet and S3DIS datasets show that this framework effectively improves the segmentation quality and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
