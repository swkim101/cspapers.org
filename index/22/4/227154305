In this work, we present a solution for an accurate and real-time monitoring of breathing rate (BR) from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal on both smartphone and smartwatch. Respiration induces multiple modulations in a PPG signal which are difficult to extract from low-quality PPG signal collected using consumer devices. We present an effective method of validating the breathing signal data which is evaluated and compared on an open dataset. The solution is also implemented as a smartphone and smartwatch app to provide an on-device real-time BR, and evaluated on multiple subjects. For the demonstration, we shall show breathing rate and breathing pattern both on smartphone and smartwatch, which can be visualized in real-time on a dashboard.
