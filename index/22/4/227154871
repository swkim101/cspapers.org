Smartwatches, which are small and portable, have become dominant devices in the wearable ecosystem. However, due to the limited size of the touch screens, smartwatches typically have a poor interactive experience for users. In our previous work [3, 4], we studied appropriating the human body as a surface to extend the input through tapping-induced vibrations. In this demo, we extend previously published research by presenting a brand-new product: a smartwatch that provides on-body tapping gestures recognition. We design eight tapping gestures for four applications on the new smartwatch: music players, shortcuts, cameras, and phone calls. In 2020, we collaborated with Mad Gaze [1] and launched this smartwatch on a crowdfunding platform. Our smartwatch has exceeded the crowdfunding target amount by 27 times.
