Currently, power devices made of silicon (Si) is approach ing fundamental performance limitations. New generations of power devices based on the wide-bandgap semiconductor, such as SiC, GaN, Ga2O3, diamond, are expected to replace of Si because of great advantages in size, weight and power consumption. The InGaP/GaAs heterojunction phototransistor (HPT) and GaAs solar cell were monolithically integrated on an HPT epitaxial wafer, and the battery-free operation of the photosensor was successfully demonstrated for energy harvesting. Radiation hardness of the energy-harvesting InGaP/GaAs HPT, which was confirmed after the high-energy electron irradiation, guarantees its space application.
