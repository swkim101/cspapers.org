Emerging 3D printing technology has enabled the rapid development of physical objects. However, 3D-printed objects are rarely interactive and adding interactivity to printed objects is inherently challenging. To boost 3D printing for a wider spectrum of applications, I introduce in-place augmented structures, a class of 3D printable parametric structures that can be integrated with physical objects and spaces for augmented behaviors. In my research, I explore how 3D printing can support interaction (e.g., sensing and actuation) by creating novel design techniques and building interactive design tools that enable end-users to design and control desired behaviors. With these techniques and tools, I fabricate the in-place structures with readily available fabrication techniques and demonstrate my approach with a suite of applications across different domains.
