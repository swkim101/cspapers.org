We investigate the task and motion planning problem of clearing clutter from a workspace with limited ingress/egress access for multiple robots. We call the problem multi-robot clutter removal (MRCR). Targeting practical applications where motion planning is non-trivial but is not a bottle-neck, we focus on finding high-quality solutions for feasible MRCR instances, which depends on the ability to efficiently compute high-quality object removal sequences. Despite the challenging multi-robot setting, our proposed search algorithms based on A*, dynamic programming, and best-first heuristics all produce solutions for tens of objects that significantly outperform single robot solutions. Realistic simulations with multiple Kuka youBots further confirms the effectiveness of our algorithmic solutions. In contrast, we also show that deciding the optimal object removal sequence for MRCR is computationally intractable.
