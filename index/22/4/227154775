Cyber-physical systems are used both for sensing the environment around them as well as making changes to that environment (actuation). Interactions between actuators and sensors can create interference or uncertainty, but can also be leveraged to improve the sensing coverage, sensing resolution or capability of a cyber-physical system. The challenge in modifying actuator behavior in a system is to avoid degrading the actuation range or responsiveness. The acceptable range of actuator adaptation can be modelled and tested using physics-based, data-driven, or combination approaches.
