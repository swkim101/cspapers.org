Due to the mobility of autonomous vehicles and changing context through time, the constraints in safe driving rules specification need to be irregularly updated for monitoring the trajectory plan. This is not assumed in the Spatial-Temporal Logic. This paper proposes a novel approach to build the specification of assume-guarantee constraints providing safe driving rules related to time and space, in the context of Automated Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). The novelty lies in that the specification adopts Multiform Logical Time to express the time constraints and provides spatial events generated by interactions on area trajectory for expressing space constraints. We propose the safe specification patterns at a high-level that provide the required expressiveness for safe driving rules. In these patterns, logical time provides the power of parameterization to express rules, before instantiation in low-level simulation contexts. The specification finally could be used to generate monitors that are executed on lower-level simulation engines with physical and topological features.
