In this paper, we aim to reveal the relationship between the number of people infected with COVID-19 in each ward in Tokyo and the changes in human mobility behavior using demographic information (population density, number of restaurants, etc.) and mobility data collected from GPS data of residents in Tokyo's 23 wards. The results confirmed that changes in human mobility behavior extracted from mobility data in each ward were an important feature related to the number of people infected by COVID-19 on the previous day's difference. These results suggest that the transition of the number of infected people in COVID-19 is largely due to human mobility behavior.
