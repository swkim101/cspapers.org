Conﬁguration has become ever so complex and error-prone in today’s server software. To mitigate this problem, software vendors provide user manuals to guide system admins on conﬁguring their systems. Usually, manuals describe not only the meaning of conﬁguration parameters but also good practice recommendations on how to conﬁgure certain parameters. Unfortunately, manuals usually also have a large number of pages, which are time-consuming for humans to read and understand. Therefore, system admins often do not refer to manuals but rely on their own guesswork or unreliable sources when setting up systems, which can lead to conﬁguration errors and system failures. To understand the characteristics of conﬁguration recommendations in user manuals, this paper ﬁrst collected and studied 261 recommendations from the manuals of six large open-source systems. Our study shows that 60% of the studied recommendations describe speciﬁc and checkable speciﬁca-tions instead of merely general guidance. Moreover, almost all (97%) of such speciﬁcations have not been checked in the systems’ source code, and 61% of them are not equivalent to the default settings. This implies that additional checking is needed to ensure the recommendations are correctly applied. Based on our characteristic study, we build a tool called PracExtractor, which employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically extract conﬁguration recommendations from software manuals, converts them into speciﬁcations, and then uses the generated speciﬁcations to detect violations in system admins’ conﬁguration settings. We evaluate PracExtractor with twelve widely-deployed software systems, including one large commercial system from a public company. In total, PracExtractor automatically extracts 338 recommendations and generates
