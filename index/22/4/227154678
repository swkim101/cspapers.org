The appearance of the integrated chips with multiple communication modules and cross-technology communication (CTC) methods make it possible to improve the quality of wireless communication by utilizing the cooperation of different protocols. In this paper, we took the cooperation of WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as an example, and proposed a method to optimize the channel selection of BLE on condition that the CSI of related WiFi is fully used. The real experiments based on USRP were carried out. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results verify that our method has better performance in terms of RSSI and SNR.
