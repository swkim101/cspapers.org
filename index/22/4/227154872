This poster presents a device, SmartEye, which can help visually impaired people to read documents and sign on it on their own during on-site banking. With the help of Optical Character Recognition, gesture recognition, pen-tip recognition, Text to Speech, the wearable device can finish the tasks that we found in the bank. We tested SmartEye with visually impaired subjects on tasks including capturing information from documents and signing on forms. The result provided the effectiveness of SmartEye on assisting visually impaired people to reduce their inconvenience.
