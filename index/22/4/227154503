Many human activities involve interactions with passive objects. By wirelessly sensing human interactions with such "things", one can infer activities at a fine resolution, enabling a new wave of ubiquitous applications. This forms the basis of the tangible user interface allowing individual to use omnipresent objects as a control interface to the digital world. Existing works have tendencies to create such interface with complicated circuitry, leading to overwhelm complexities. To conquer these, we propose the inkjet printable capacitive tags (CapTags), empowering a new paradigm of printable communications and sensing modality. We use discrete capacitive and inductive components to simulate the tag-interrogator system, and prove the feasibility of proposed hardware featurization and high frequency sweeping strategy where the information can be encoded in the resonating spikes. This enables the touch points to be detected by searching resonating detune effects. Although this work only includes the designs and simulations, we believe this new sensing modality would truly realize the vision of printable ubiquitous computing.
