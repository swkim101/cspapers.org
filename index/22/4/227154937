Secure Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is becoming increasingly important with the ever-growing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in our daily life. To achieve secure D2D communication, the key agreement between different IoT devices without any prior knowledge is becoming desirable. Although various approaches have been proposed in the literature, they suffer from a number of limitations, such as low key generation rate and short pairing distance. In this paper, we present an inaudible acoustic signal based key generation protocol for mobile devices. Based on acoustic channel reciprocity, our system exploits channel frequency response of two legitimate devices as a common secret to generate keys. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed system in different real environments. Evaluation results show that the proposed system can generate the same secret key for two mobile devices with high probability.
