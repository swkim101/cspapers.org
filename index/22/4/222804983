We have explored a fluid-based interface(Hydrauio) on the pen body to extend interaction space of human-pen interaction. Users could perform finger gestures on the pen for input and also receive haptic feedback of different profiles from the fluid surface. The user studies showed that Hydrauio could achieve an accuracy of more than 92% for finger gesture recognition and users could distinguish different haptic profiles with an accuracy of more than 95%. Finally, we present application scenarios to demonstrate the potential of Hydrauio to extend interaction space of human-pen interaction.
