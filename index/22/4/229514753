Cable-driven joints proved to be an effective solution in a wide variety of applications ranging from medical to industrial fields where light structures, interaction with unstructured and constrained environments and precise motion are required. These requirements are achieved by moving the actuators from joints to the robot chassis. Despite these positive properties a cable-driven robotic arm requires a complex cable routing within the entire structure to transmit motion to all joints. The main effect of this routing is a friction phenomenon which reduces the accuracy of the motion of the robotic device. In this paper a bond-graph approach is presented to model a family of cable-driven joints including a novel friction model that can be easily implemented into a control algorithm to compensate the friction forces induced by the rope sliding into bushings.
