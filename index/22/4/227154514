Power delivery (PD) to computing and sensing devices in an indoor environment is as important as data communication between them. We are developing a USB-PD-based DC power supply system called VGHub. As the power loss at each input and output port of VGHub depends on the incoming or outgoing power at the port, the power distribution among all the ports needs to be optimized to maximize the power efficiency of VGHub. In this poster paper, we describe the formulation of a power distribution control in VGHub.
