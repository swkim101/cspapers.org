With an increase in the number of IoT devices, the amount of data transferred between the devices and applications is becoming huge. To ensure that these data are properly used, a new IoT data transfer system is needed to better control the timing and the content of the data to transmit. One of the promising means for such a large-scale city-data transfer is the publish/subscribe messaging model, which can separate data senders and receivers so that they can run independently. However, existing pub/sub systems cannot cope well with the mobility of senders and receivers, thereby limiting its applicability to real-world uses. In concrete, they don't consider Time-to-live (TTL) of data. Users can use the data anytime and within TTL of it. IoT platforms can improve controlling data transmission by used to this characteristic. In this paper, we focus on the Time-to-Live of data (data-TTL). Our system can control data transmission by using data-TTL and combine with the user's movement information. We have constructed a system, that is capable of control data transmission for mobility aware.
