Although not yet ubiquitous, censors and censorship-resistors have been eyeing QUIC as the next avenue for censorship-circumvention. In this poster, we highlight three QUIC features that are avenues for potential improvements to both Pluggable Transports and decoy routing: streams, connections identifiers, and congestion control. We also examine how traffic splitting can be used. We then discuss how these features can be integrated into Pluggable Transports and decoy routing. We close with providing guidance for future work on integrating QUIC into Pluggable Transports and decoy routing.
