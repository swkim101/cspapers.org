In order to prevent safety violations, predictive monitoring with uncertainty is crucial for deep learning-enabled services in smart cities. We develop a novel predictive monitoring system for smart city applications, which consists of an RNN-based predictor with uncertainty estimation and a new specification language, named Signal Temporal Logic with Uncertainty. The solution first predicts a sequence of distributions representing city's future states with uncertainty estimation and then checks the predicted results against STL-U specified safety and performance requirements. The system supports decision making by providing a quantitative satisfaction degree with confidence guarantees. We receive promising results from evaluations on two large-scale city datasets, and on a case study on real-time predictive monitoring in a simulated smart city.
