In this work we study online rent-buy problems as a sequential decision making problem. We show how one can integrate predictions, typically coming from a machine learning (ML) setup, into this framework. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we consider the ski-rental problem and the dynamic TCP acknowledgment problem. We present new online algorithms with or without predictions and obtain explicit performance bounds in-terms of the accuracy of the prediction. Our algorithms are close to optimal with accurate predictions while hedging against less accurate predictions
