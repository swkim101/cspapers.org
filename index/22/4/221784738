Quick response (QR) codes have been widely used in mobile applications, due to its convenience and the pervasive built-in cameras on smartphones. Recently, however, QR codes have been reported suffering attacks for being sniffed just before the QR code is scanned, which lead to financial loss. In this study, we propose ScreenID, for enhancing the QR code security by identifying its authenticity, which embeds a QR code with information of unique screen fingerprint - PWM frequency. PWM frequencies are adjusted to different values by screen manufacturers, therefore can successfully differentiate screens. To improve the estimation accuracy of PWM frequency, ScreenID incorporates a model for the interaction between the camera and screen in the temporal and spatial domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScreenID can differentiate screens of different models, types and manufacturers and thus improve the security of QR codes.
