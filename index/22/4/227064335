Cyber-physical system is a key for solving social challenges based on sensing-processing-actuation cycle: for instance, visualization of unknown challenges through big-data analysis based on trillion sensor networks. High-speed and high-capacity radio access systems relied on an optical fiber network should be converged and integrated for improvement of availability and resilience. We will discuss advanced R&D activities of integration technologies for the converged network.
