Family caregivers often report increased anxiety and depression. In order to improve the interactions between in-home patients and caregivers, and reduce strain on caregivers, we build a monitoring, modeling, and interactive recommendation system for caregivers for in-home dementia patient care. The system includes monitoring for mood by speech, building classifiers that work in realistic home settings, and supporting an adaptive recommendation system to reduce stress of the caregiver. This demo shows how our system supports caregivers in practice through several scenarios.
