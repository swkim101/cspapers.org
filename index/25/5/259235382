The digitalization of industrial environments has enabled the development of tools that make the production process more efficient and safer. In this sense, the Soft Sensor (SS) plays a fundamental role. Through historical data and indirect measurements, it is possible to estimate the value of important variables that are difficult to measure. This paper presents the SS development process: data collection and pre-processing, variable selection, model selection for SS implementation, model training and testing, and performance evaluation. The selection of variables was made with the help of Pearson Correlation, Mutual Information, and fastTracker algorithm techniques. For the implementation of SS have been tested several models: Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Elastic Net, Support Vector Regression and Gaussian Mixture Models. Four datasets were used to test the development of the SS.
