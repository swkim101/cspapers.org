Modern cyber-physical systems (CPSs) consist of numerous control units interconnected by communication networks. Each control unit is responsible for executing possibly multiple safety-critical and non-critical tasks in real time. Adversaries can exploit the deterministic behaviour maintained in such realtime systems to launch schedule-based attacks on safety-critical tasks. This paper aims to prevent the possibility of such timing inference-based side-channel attacks by executing safety-critical control tasks using a multi-rate schedule without hampering performance. With this strategy, we propose a novel attack-aware dynamic priority schedule randomization policy with the goal of success rate minimization of schedule-based attacks on safetycritical tasks.
