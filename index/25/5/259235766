Operations related to distributed maintenance, like any other activity, have a considerable impact on the environment. This impact is not negligible and must be evaluated in order to have a global vision of the operations carried out within this framework. In order to highlight these environmental effects more clearly, it is necessary to determine indicators that will make it possible. A literature review should then be provided in order to collect as much information as possible concerning the environmental impact of this activity. With the aim of knowing in which direction this literature review will be oriented, it will be useful to identify the concrete aspects of distributed maintenance that represent a threat and have a significant impact on the environment, and to identify some parameters that will allow to carry out the analysis of their effects. The purpose of this paper is therefore to highlight the gaps in information in the literature and thus propose solution approaches, including adaptations in other domains such as maintenance and transports that could be well adapted in the context of distributed maintenance.
