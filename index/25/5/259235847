A significant challenge in fish farms is net cage deterioration, which leads to fish escapes owing to holes and can have a severe influence on the fish's health due to biofouling. To reduce fish losses, divers are utilized on a weekly basis by fisheries to carry out the task of inspecting the net cages. Companies that are involved in aquaculture are always seeking for methods to increase their profits, and one of those ways is to cut down on the costs of maintenance. This paper is about the development of an unmanned underwater vehicle used for inspection in net cages at Kefalonia Fisheries in Greece. This vehicle has a 3D-printed body and a six-thruster configuration, featuring five degrees of freedom. The vehicle's primary goal is to reduce divers' expenses by conducting inspections more frequently. In this work, the design, manufacture, and control are presented along with the experimental results and flow simulation of the vehicle. The suggested design is versatile and robust while yet being affordable, and the fisheries may easily adopt it due to its inexpensive price and simplicity of operation.
