We present A11yBoard, an interactive multimodal system that makes interpreting and authoring digital artboards, such as presentation slides or vector drawings, accessible to blind and low-vision (BLV) users. A11yBoard combines a web-based application with a mobile touch screen device such as a smartphone or tablet. The artboard is mirrored from the PC onto the touch screen, enabling spatial exploration of the artboard via touch and gesture. In addition, speech recognition and non-speech audio are used for input and output, respectively. Finally, keyboard input is used with a custom search-driven command line interface to access various commands and properties. These modalities combine into a rich, accessible system in which artboard contents, such as shapes, lines, text boxes, and images, can be interpreted, generated, and manipulated with ease. With A11yBoard, BLV users can not only consume accessible content, but create their own as well.
