With the development of low-cost electronics, rapid prototyping techniques, as well as widely available mobile devices (e.g. mobile phones, smart watches), users are able to develop their own basic interactive functional applications, either on top of existing device platforms, or as stand-alone devices. However, the boundary for creating personal health sensing devices, both function prototyping and fabrication -wise, are still high. In this paper, I present my works on designing and fabricating personal health sensing devices with rapid function prototyping techniques and novel sensing technologies. Through these projects and ongoing future research, I am working towards my vision that everyone can design and fabricate highly-customized health sensing devices based on their body form and desired functions.
