Typical passive internet of things (IoT) localization systems, such as those based on UHF RFID, adopt narrow bandwidth signal and bind the localization function with energy harvesting and communication waveform. Due to the signal bandwidth and waveform constraints, the systems can not meet crucial requirements of practical IoT use cases. In this poster, we identify the fundamental challenges and analyze why the existing systems fall short. Based on the analysis, we propose to adopt dual band backscatter design and identify different design choices on frequency band, waveform and tag modulation. Finally, we build an ultra-wideband FMCW signal based prototype UWB2 to verify the feasibility of our proposal. Our results show that the system can achieve low tail error and realize one shot localization even under harsh multipath scenarios.
