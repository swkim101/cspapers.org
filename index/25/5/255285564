This article provides information technology on the analysis and synthesis of models for ensuring the quality characteristics of the working surfaces of products during mechanical processing, taking into account the defects of the material structure. Various micro defects are described, the development of which, under the influence of mechanical processing, leads to the appearance of cracks and their increase and, as a result, local or complete destruction. The problem of thermoelasticity for bodies weakened by inhomogeneities is solved. The probabilistic-statistical approach in increasing the accuracy of identification of technological processes of mechanical processing, development, and implementation of new, more effective methods and means of information and computer modeling is considered. The developed model takes into account the influence of inhomogeneities of technological origin (starting from the workpiece and ending with the finished product), which arise in the surface layer during the manufacture of structural elements, the analysis of which allows the creation of an information base of criteria, the implementation of which allows preventing the loss of functional properties of the responsible elements. Mathematical models of the dynamics of thermomechanical processes accompanying the mechanical processing of products from materials of the heterogeneous structure have been improved in the form of a spatially non-stationary formulation of the problem based on systems of differential equations of thermoelasticity in partial derivatives and discontinuity conditions on defects of the elastic-deformation characteristics of the processed material, which, unlike existing ones, made it possible to increase the accuracy of identification of mathematical models generally. Mathematical models of the system for evaluating the effectiveness of the functioning of technological complexes of mechanical processing have been developed, which make it possible to determine the relationship between the state parameters of the treated surfaces and the main controlling technological characteristics that provide the necessary properties of functionally gradient materials. Finally, the modeling results provide an opportunity to create effective information technology, which makes it possible to reduce the loss of functional properties of heterogeneous systems significantly.
