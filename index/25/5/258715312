A seller wants to sell an indivisible item to n buyers. The buyer valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution, but the seller does not know this distribution; the seller only knows the support [a, b]. To be robust against the lack of knowledge of the environment and buyers' behavior, the seller optimizes over dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) mechanisms, and measures the worst-case performance relative to an oracle with complete knowledge of buyers' valuations. Our analysis encompasses both the regret and the approximation ratio objectives.
