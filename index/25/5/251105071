Video deblurring is a highly under-constrained problem due to the spatially and temporally varying blur. An intuitive approach for video deblurring includes two steps: a) detecting the blurry region in the current frame; b) utilizing the information from clear regions in adjacent frames for current frame deblurring. To realize this process, our idea is to detect the pixel-wise blur level of each frame and combine it with video deblurring. To this end, we propose a novel framework that utilizes the motion magnitude prior (MMP) as guidance for efficient deep video deblurring. Specifically, as the pixel movement along its trajectory during the exposure time is positively correlated to the level of motion blur, we first use the average magnitude of optical flow from the high-frequency sharp frames to generate the synthetic blurry frames and their corresponding pixel-wise motion magnitude maps. We then build a dataset including the blurry frame and MMP pairs. The MMP is then learned by a compact CNN by regression. The MMP consists of both spatial and temporal blur level information, which can be further integrated into an efficient recurrent neural network (RNN) for video deblurring. We conduct intensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on the public datasets.
