Exergames have been proposed as an attractive way of making exercise fun; however, most of them do not reach the recommended intensity. Although HCI research has explored how exergame can be designed to follow High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) that is effective exercise consisting of intermittent vigorous activity and short rest or low-intensity exercise, there are limited studies on designing bodyweight exercise (BWE) based exergame to follow HIIT. In this paper, we propose BWE based exergame to encourage users to maintain high intensity exercise. Our initial study (n=10) showed that the exergame had a significant effect on enjoyment, while the ratio of incorrect posture (ex., squat) also increased due to participantsâ€™ concentration on the exergame, which imply future design implications of BWE based exergames.
