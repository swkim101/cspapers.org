Machine settings and tuning are critical for digital fabrication outcomes. However, exploring these parameters is non-trivial. We seek to enable exploration of the full design space of digital fabrication. To do so, we built p5.fab, a system for controlling digital fabrication machines from the creative coding environment p5.js and informed by a qualitative study of 3D printer maintenance practices. p5.fab prioritizes material exploration, fine-tuned control, and iteration in fabrication workflows. We demonstrate p5.fab with examples of 3D prints that cannot be made with traditional 3D printing software, including delicate bridging structures and prints on top of existing objects.
