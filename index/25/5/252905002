Due to the success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in effectively extracting features in non-Euclidean spaces, GCNs has become the rising star in implicit collaborative filtering. Existing works, while encouraging, typically adopt simple aggregation operation on the user-item bipartite graph to model user and item representations, but neglect to mine the sufficient dependencies between nodes, e.g., the relationships between users/items and their neighbors (or congeners), resulting in inadequate graph representation learning. To address these problems, we propose a novel Multi-Dependency Graph Collaborative Filtering (MDGCF) model, which mines the neighborhood- and homogeneous-level dependencies to enhance the representation power of graph-based CF models. Specifically, for neighborhood-level dependencies, we explicitly consider both popularity score and preference correlation by designing a joint neighborhood-level dependency weight, based on which we construct a neighborhood-level dependencies graph to capture higher-order interaction features. Besides, by adaptively mining the homogeneous-level dependencies among users and items, we construct two homogeneous graphs, based on which we further aggregate features from homogeneous users and items to supplement their representations, respectively. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MDGCF. Further experiments reveal that our model can capture rich dependencies between nodes for explaining user behaviors.
