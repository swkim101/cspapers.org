The domain name system (DNS) has been an important base of the Internet; however, it faces various issues, including DNS server attacks. Blockchain-based DNS services have recently emerged to solve these DNS issues. Among them, Handshake provides a decentralized root zone and supports state-of-the-art features. However, few studies have investigated the performance evaluations of Handshake. We measure the name resolution latency on Handshake to assess its suitability as an alternative to the current DNS root servers and reveal that it has a practical drawback compared to current root servers at the current early stage.
