In this paper, both linear quadratic regulator LQR and conventional proportional-derivative PD regulators are combined to control a 3DOF helicopter. The proposed method is to design an LQR regulator to ensure the system control by placing a PD controller in the direct loop of both the “elevation” and the “travel” angles to improve the performance of the system. PD controller gains are obtained by a self-tuning, while the LQ R controller gains are calculated by a metaheuristic optimization method, based on the Flower Pollination Algorithm FPA and which serves to minimize the error between the desired angular position and that of the system response. The obtained results show that the proposed method is adequate to control the system with very good performances on the elevation and travel axes by using a limited action on the pitch angle.
