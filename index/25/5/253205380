Understanding the degree of user engagement in a VR game is vital to provide a better gaming experience. While prior work has suggested self-reports, and biological signal-based methods, measuring game engagement remains a challenge due to its complex nature. In this work, we provide a preliminary exploration of using involuntary body gestures to measure user engagement in VR gaming. Based on data collected from 27 participants performing multiple VR games, we demonstrate a relationship between foot gesture-based models for measuring arousal and physiological responses while engaging in VR games. Our findings show the possibility of using involuntary body gestures to measure engagement.
