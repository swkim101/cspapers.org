While deep generative models pave the way for many emerging applications, decreased interpretability for larger model sizes and complexities hinders their generalizability to wide domains such as economy, security, healthcare, etc. Considering this obstacle, a common practice is to learn interpretable representations through latent feature disentanglement, aiming for exposing a set of mutually independent factors of data variations. However, existing methods either fail to catch the trade-off between the synthetic data quality and model interpretability, or consider the first-order feature disentangling only, overlooking the fact that a subset of salient features can carry decomposable semantic meanings and hence be of high-order in nature. Hence, we in this paper propose a novel generative modeling paradigm by introducing a Bayesian network-based regularize on a cascade Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). Specifically, this regularizer guides the learner to discover a representation space that comprises both first-order disentangled features and high-order salient features, with the feature interplay captured by the Bayesian structure. Experiments demonstrate that this regularizer gives us free control over the representation space and can guide the learner to discover decomposable semantic meanings by capturing the interplay among independent factors. Meanwhile, we benchmark extensive experiments on six widely-used vision datasets, and the results exhibit that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art VAE competitors in terms of the trade-off between the synthetic data quality and model interpretability. Although our design is framed in the VAE regime, it in effect is generic and can be better amenable to both GANs and VAEs in terms of letting them concurrently enjoy both high model interpretability and high synthesis quality.
