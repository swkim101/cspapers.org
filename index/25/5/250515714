Vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure are crucial information for healthcare workers to identify clinical deterioration of ward patients. Currently, medical devices monitor these vital signs and trigger alarms when the vital signs are not in the normal ranges based on predefined thresholds, which suggests the presence of clinical deterioration. However, such threshold-based approach is not robust for patient monitoring. This is because vital signs differ among patients due to human physiology and change across time based on the action performed by a patient. In this work, we want to tackle these problems by building adaptable action-aware vital models. These models can understand the changes in vital signs caused by patient's actions and can be adapted to the normal vital sign ranges of individual patients. Our experimental results show that general vital sign patterns for different actions exist and can be personalized to new patients. Additionally, we investigate the possibility of estimating the initial vital model for an unobserved action using models of observed actions for model personalization. The resulting adaptable action-aware vital models have the potential to improve patient monitoring by reducing false clinical alarms.
