Tissue segmentation is a critical task in computational pathology due to its desirable ability to indicate the prognosis of cancer patients. Currently, numerous studies attempt to use image-level labels to achieve pixel-level segmentation to reduce the need for fine annotations. However, most of these methods are based on class activation map, which suffers from inaccurate segmentation boundaries. To address this problem, we propose a novel weakly-supervised tissue segmentation framework named PistoSeg, which is implemented under a fully-supervised manner by transferring tissue category labels to pixel-level masks. Firstly, a dataset synthesis method is proposed based on Mosaic transformation to generate synthesized images with pixel-level masks. Next, considering the difference between synthesized and real images, this paper devises an attention-based feature consistency, which directs the training process of a proposed pseudo-mask refining module. Finally, the refined pseudo-masks are used to train a precise segmentation model for testing. Experiments based on WSSS4LUAD and BCSS-WSSS validate that PistoSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at https://github.com/Vison307/PistoSeg.
