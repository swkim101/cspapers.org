Predicting power electricity consumption is essential for managing the power grid and ensuring a stable and reliable power supply at short and medium terms. Deep learning models are often used for forecasting, but they require a large amount of data to train and acquire power of generalisation. Data availability in real-world scenarios can be limited, as a result, prediction accuracy can be affected in a negative way. In order to overcome this limitation, generative models such as GAN can generate synthetic data in order to supplement the available data and help the model train on data quality data sets both in terms of quality and quantity. Time GAN, a state-of-the-art model for handling time series data, is proposed in this paper to generate a synthetic data-set for Algerian electricity load data. Subsequently, the obtained results show that using synthetic data improves the predictive accuracy of the forecasting model accuracy by 7.45 using different metrics for evaluation.
