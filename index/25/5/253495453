 Resilience is a vital consideration for designing and operating a deep space habitat system. The numerous hazards that may affect a deep space habitat and its crew during its lifecycle need to be considered early in the design. Trade-off studies are the typical method used to assess the cost and value of different design choices. Here we develop a modular dynamic computational framework intended for rapid simulation and evaluation of the resilience of different system configurations. The framework uses a system-level phenomeno-logical Markov model of the habitat systems, enabling us to assess multiple habitat configurations and evaluate their performance in the presence of several hazards and user-defined control policies. System fault detection and repairs are modeled. External disturbances, including meteorites impact, temperature fluctuations, and dust, are modeled based on the lunar environment, envisioning a deep space habitat design. We use a reflexive health management subsystem that prioritizes recovery actions based on the robotic agent’s availability to close the loop. In addition to performance, a resilience metric is included to quantify the system’s resilience over the design lifecycle. We illustrate the use of the framework for supporting early-stage design decisions of a habitat system. Our case study focuses on designing the power generation system considering cost and energy efficiency.
