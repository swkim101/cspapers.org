Digital twins have demonstrated great capabilities in the industrial setting, but the cost of building them prohibits their usage in home environments. We present HomeView, a system that automatically builds and maintains a digital twin using data from Augmented Reality (AR) headsets and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We evaluated the system in a simulator and found it performs better than the baseline algorithm. The user feedback on programming IoT devices also suggests that contextual information rendered by HomeView is preferable to text descriptions.
