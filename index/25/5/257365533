Distributionally Robust Optimal Control (DROC) is a technique that enables robust control in a stochastic setting when the true distribution is not known. Traditional DROC approaches require given ambiguity sets or a KL divergence bound to represent the distributional uncertainty. These may not be known a priori and may require hand-crafting. In this paper, we lift this assumption by introducing a data-driven technique for estimating the uncertainty and a bound for the KL divergence. We call this technique D3ROC. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we consider a navigation problem for a car-like robot with unknown noise distributions. The results demonstrate that D3ROC provides robust and efficient control policies that outperform the iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) control. The results also show the effectiveness of our proposed approach in handling different noise distributions.
