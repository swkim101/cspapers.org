Recently, progress has been made towards improving automatic sarcasm detection in computer science. Among existing models, manually constructing static graphs for texts and then using graph neural networks (GNNs) is one of the most effective approaches for drawing long-range incongruity patterns. However, the manually constructed graph structure might be prone to errors (e.g., noisy or incomplete) and not optimal for the sarcasm detection task. Errors produced during the graph construction step cannot be remedied and may accrue to the following stages, resulting in poor performance. To surmount the above limitations, we explore a novel Iterative Augmenting Affective Graph and Dependency Graph (IAAD) framework to jointly and iteratively learn the incongruity graph structure. IAAD can alternatively update the incongruity graph structure and node representation until the learning graph structure is optimal for the metrics of sarcasm detection. More concretely, we begin with deriving an affective and a dependency graph for each instance, then an iterative incongruity graph learning module is employed to augment affective and dependency graphs for obtaining the optimal inconsistent semantic graph with the goal of optimizing the graph for the sarcasm detection task. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for sarcasm detection with significant margins.
