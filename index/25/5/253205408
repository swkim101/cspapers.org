Shadow play is a traditional culture to communicate narratives. However, its inheritance is in danger, and traditional methods have limitations in their expression. We propose a novel system to perform a shadow play by levitating props using an ultrasound speaker array. Our system computes an ideal position of levitating props to create a shadow of the desired image. Shadow play will be performed by displaying a sequence of images as shadows. Since the performance is automated, our work makes shadow play accessible to people for generations. Also, our system allows 6 DoF and floating movement of props, which expands the limit of expression. Through this system, we aim to enhance shadow plays informatically and aesthetically.
