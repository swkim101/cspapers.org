Established information retrieval (IR) systems are generally reactive in that they respond to active entry of a search query by a user. Information is thus only provided to a user when they identify a need for information, and invest the effort to address this need using a search engine. As such, users end up spending more effort to satisfy their information need. Different from reactive systems, proactive information retrieval (PIR) systems seek to retrieve relevant content without the user explicitly submitting a query. A PIR system usually achieves this by using a combination of observed user activities, their contexts and user profile information firstly to automatically create search queries, and then perform search operations and present retrieved results. This new paradigm of PIR methodology thus presents opportunities for investigating a number of research questions for improving user satisfaction, such as when would be the right opportunities to deliver information to users, what should be the presentation mode of search results, establishing a conversational communication channel with the users to ask clarifying questions to refine the retrieved information, and even providing users with explanations for the retrieved information. The aim of the workshop thus is to solicit submissions from the research community targeted towards these topics, and consolidate the research directions in this domain via exchange of ideas.
