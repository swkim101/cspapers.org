In this study we characterize Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attack traffic taking into consideration the geographical distribution of victims. This type of characterization is not widely explored in the literature and could help to better understand this type of attack. We aim to explore this gap in the literature using data collected by four honeypots over three and a half years. Our findings highlight attack similarities and differences across continents.
