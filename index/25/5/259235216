This research focuses on fractional-order fixed-time integral terminal sliding mode control (FoFxITSM) for Euler-Lagrange systems in the presence of uncertainty and external disturbances. First, the concept of fractional-order fixed-time integral terminal sliding mode control (FoFxITSM) is laid out and discussed in detail. This methodology enhances the efficiency of position tracking by combining the characteristics of ITSM, which include chatter-free control inputs, rapid fixed-time convergence, and non-singularity. Additionally, this method includes a fractional-order parameter to improve performance of the proposed method. A Lyapunov analysis is used to determine the closed-loop system's ability to maintain its fixed-time stability. To test and demonstrate the performance of the suggested method, the simulation results of the proposed scheme applied on the 2-DOF robot are provided.
