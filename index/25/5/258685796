 Machine learning has recently made significant strides in reducing design cycle time for complex products. Ship design, which currently involves years-long cycles and small batch production, could greatly benefit from these advancements. By developing a machine learning tool for ship design that learns from the design of many different types of ships, trade-offs in ship design could be identified and optimized. However, the lack of publicly available ship design datasets currently limits the potential for leveraging machine learning in generalized ship design. To address this gap, this paper presents a large dataset of 30,000 ship hulls, each with design and functional performance information, including parameterization, mesh, point-cloud, and image representations, as well as 32 hydrodynamic drag measures under different operating conditions. The dataset is structured to allow human input and is also designed for computational methods. Additionally, the paper introduces a set of 12 ship hulls from publicly available CAD repositories to showcase the proposed parameterization’s ability to accurately reconstruct existing hulls. A surrogate model was developed to predict the 32 wave drag coefficients, which was then implemented in a genetic algorithm case study to reduce the total drag of a hull by 60% while maintaining the shape of the hull’s cross section and the length of the parallel midbody. Our work provides a comprehensive dataset and application examples for other researchers to use in advancing data-driven ship design.
