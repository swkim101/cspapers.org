The test bench was developed and tested to determine the power and consumption characteristics (power, torque, fuel fuel consumption) of two-stroke small-size internal combustion engines. In addition, the bench was equipped with an engine start system, an exhaust gas discharge system and a test safety system to comply with the standards of life safety and test conditions. The Evolution 20GX2 small-size two-stroke engine was tested to determine its power and consumption characteristics. The power and consumption characteristics of the Evolution 20GX2 small-size two-stroke engine obtained by research are compared with the results obtained by calculation. Based on the results of the comparison of the obtained data, it was concluded that the developed design of the experimental bench and the results of the tests carried out confirm the results of the theoretical calculation with an acceptable error.
