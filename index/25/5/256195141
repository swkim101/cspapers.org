Nowadays, more and more datasets are published towards research and development of systems and models, enabling direct comparisons, continuous improvement of solutions, and researchers engagement with experimental, real life data. However, especially in the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) domain, there are plenty of cases where new research projects have a unique combination of structure design and implementation, sensor selection and technological enablers that does not fit with the configuration of relevant individual studies in the literature. Thus, we share the data from our case study to the research community as we did not find any relevant repository available. More specifically, in this paper, we present a novel time-series dataset for impact detection and localization on a plastic thin-plate, towards Structural Health Monitoring applications, using ceramic piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) connected to an Internet of Things (IoT) device. The dataset was collected from an experimental procedure of low-velocity, low-energy impact events that includes at least 3 repetitions for each unique experiment, while the input measurements come from 4 PZT sensors placed at the corners of the plate. For each repetition and sensor, 5000 values are stored with 100 KHz sampling rate. The system is excited with a steel ball, and the height from which it is released varies from 10 cm to 20 cm. The dataset is available in GitHub (https://github.com/Smart-Objects/Impact-Events-Dataset).
