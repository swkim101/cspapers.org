As a basic part of the centroidal dynamics, an-gular momentum plays a critical role in humanoid motion control. Therefore, how to explicitly express and control an-gular momentum through whole-body motion is an important topic for researchers. This study discusses the selection of the generalized velocity corresponding to whole-body angular momentum. Based on the discussion, we present a method that decouples the inertia effect in centroidal angular momentum and applies it in resolved viscoelasticity control, which achieves the angular momentum control by whole-body compliance in an interpretable way without complicated calculation. At last, we validate the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed method in forward dynamics simulation of balancing control in the double and single support states and landing motion after hopping.
