This paper presents the design, manufacturing, modeling, and control of a novel 1-DOF pitch axis Twin Rotor system. An IMU sensor is used to precisely access the desired pitch angle of the system. A type-2 fuzzy controller is designed and implemented to achieve fast rise time and low overshoot, which are the desired response specifications for the system. In terms of overshoot and settling time, the performance of the type-2 fuzzy-PID controller is compared to that of the type-l fuzzy-PID controller and the conventional PID controller. The type-2 fuzzy-PID controller's performance is promising when compared to that of the other controllers, proving that it is useful for taming the Twin Rotor system's non-linearities.
