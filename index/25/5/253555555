This paper concerns with performance evaluation of cooperative transmission aided multi-hop relaying scheme operating on radio-frequency energy harvesting environment, where all transmitters have to harvest wireless energy supported by a power beacon deployed in the considered network. In the proposed scheme, a source uses Fountain code to send its data to a destination via a multi-hop relaying approach. To enhance reliability of the transmission of Fountain packets at each hop, incremental cooperative communication using partial relay selection is employed. We evaluate end-to-end outage probability of our scheme over Rayleigh fading channels, and then verify the derived expression by MATLAB simulations. The results present that the proposed scheme can obtain better performance, as compared with the conventional multi-hop relaying protocol without using cooperative communication.
