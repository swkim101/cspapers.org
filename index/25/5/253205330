Building higher-quality image classification models requires better performance analysis (PA) methods to help understand their behaviors. We propose ConfusionLens, a dynamic and interactive visualization interface that augments a conventional confusion matrix with focus+context visualization. This interface makes it possible to adaptively provide relevant information for different kinds of PA tasks. Specifically, it allows users to seamlessly switch table layouts among three views (overall view, class-level view, and between-class view) while observing all of the instance images in a single screen. This paper presents a ConfusionLens prototype that supports hundreds of instances and its several extensions to further support practical PA tasks, such as activation map visualization and instance sorting/filtering.
