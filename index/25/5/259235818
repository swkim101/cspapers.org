Named Data Networking (NDN) has evolved as a networking model that can facilitate Internet of Things (IoT) applications by providing a name-based communication model, innetwork caching, and inherent support for data-centric security. However, despite the benefits, the best-effort NDN cannot offer the deterministic data delivery required by safety-critical IoT applications. This paper proposes a novel deadline-aware NDN protocol that utilizes a critical deadline first scheduler to prioritize traffic based on the approaching deadline. Evaluation results show that the proposed deadline-aware NDN can meet the communication needs of time-sensitive IoT applications.
