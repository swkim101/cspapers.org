As NASA pursues Artemis missions to the moon and beyond, it is essential to equip astronauts with the appropriate human-autonomy enabling technology necessary for the elevated demands of lunar surface exploration and extreme terrestrial access. We present MoonBuddy, an application built for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 that utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) and voice-based interaction to assist astronauts in communication, navigation, and documentation on future lunar extravehicular activities (EVAs), with the goal of reducing cognitive load and increasing task completion. User testing results for MoonBuddy under simulated lunar conditions have been positive overall, with participants indicating that the application was easy to use and helpful in completing the required tasks.
