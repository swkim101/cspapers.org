Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that operates on pseudo-random hypervectors, an information-rich, hardware-efficient representation that is robust to noise and facilitates learning with limited training data. This work explores how robot navigation tasks can leverage the high-capacity hypervector representation to enable behavioral prioritization through a weighted encoding of heterogeneous sensor information. Experiments over 100 trials in each of the 100 randomly generated obstacle maps demonstrate that the proposed weighted sensor encoding scheme boosts the success rate of the navigation task by over 30% compared to an unweighted sensor encoding. A hybrid scheme using the HDC weighted scheme at the input of a deep feed-forward neural network achieves the highest success rate. The hybrid scheme furthermore is more robust when reducing the HDC dimension by 50%. However, the simple HDC implementation remains the most hardware efficient, making it desirable for resource-constrained systems.
