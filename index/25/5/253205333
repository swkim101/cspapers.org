We present a tablet-based system for AR environmental design using point clouds. It integrates point cloud capture and editing in a single AR workflow to help users quickly prototype design ideas in their spatial context. We hypothesize that point clouds are well suited for prototyping, as they can be captured rapidly and then edited immediately on the capturing device in situ. Our system supports a variety of point cloud editing operations in AR, including selection, transformation, hole filling, drawing, and animation. This enables a wide range of design applications for objects, interior environments, buildings, and landscapes.
