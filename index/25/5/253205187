Wearable devices that present the wearer’s information have been designed to stand out when worn, making it difficult to conceal their wear. Therefore, we have been working on developing and evaluating a dynamic expression of hair to realize the presentation of the wearer’s information in an inconspicuous wearable device. In the precedents of hair interaction, the hairstyles and expressions to which the technique can be applied are limited. In this paper, we focus on the output mechanism and present Extail, a hair extension type device with a control mechanism that moves bundled hair like a tail. The results of a questionnaire survey on the correspondence between the movement of hair bundles and emotional expression were generally consistent with the results of the evaluation of tail devices in related studies.
