Many people now listen to music with earphones while walking, and are less likely to notice approaching people, cars, etc. Many methods of detecting approaching objects and notifying pedestrians have been proposed, but few have focused on low urgency situations or music listeners, and many notification methods are unpleasant. Therefore, in this work, we propose methods of gently notifying pedestrians listening to music of approaching objects using environmental sound. We conducted experiments in a virtual environment to assess directional perception accuracy and comfort. Our results show the proposed method allows participants to detect the direction of approaching objects as accurately as explicit notification methods, with less discomfort.
