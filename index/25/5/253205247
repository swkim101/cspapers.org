In recent years, while HCI researchers have developed several systems that leverage the use of reflection for skill learning, the use of reflection-based learning of maker skills remains unexplored. We present ReflectiveMaker - a toolkit for experts and educators to design reflection exercises for novice learners in makerspaces. We describe the three components of our toolkit: (a) a designer interface to author the reflection prompts during fabrication activities, (b) a set of fabrication tools to sense the user’s activities and (c) a reflection diary interface to record the user’s reflections and analyze data on their learning progress. We then outline future work and envision a range of application scenarios.
