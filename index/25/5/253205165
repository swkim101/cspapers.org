When learning how to build circuits, one of the challenges novice makers face is how to identify the components needed for the circuit. Many makerspaces are stocked with a variety of electronic components that look visually similar or have similar names. Thus, novice makers may pick the wrong component, which creates a non-functional circuit although the wires are correctly connected. To address this issue, we present CircuitAssist, an actuated electronics component shelf connected to a tutorial system that dispenses electronic components for the maker in the order that they occur in the tutorial. The shelf contains dispensers for each component type with a custom release mechanism actuated by a servo motor that dispenses one component at a time. Makers can work with CircuitAssist by either following one of the provided tutorials or by directly selecting a component they need from the user interface.
