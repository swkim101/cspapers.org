Summary matching is a recently proposed paradigm for extractive summarization. It aims to calculate similarities between candidate summaries and their corresponding document and extract summaries by ranking similarities. Due to natural languages often exhibiting the inherent hierarchical structures ingrained with complex syntax and semantics, the latent hierarchical structures between candidate summaries and their corresponding document should be considered when calculating the summary-document similarities. However, the above structural property is hard to model in the Euclidean space. Inspired by the above issues, we explore extractive summarization in the hyperbolic space and propose a new Hyperbolic Siamese Network for the matching-based extractive summarization (HyperSiameseNet). Specifically, HyperSiameseNet projects candidate summaries and their corresponding document representations from the Euclidean space to the Hyperbolic space and then models the summary-document similarities via the squared poincar√© distance. Finally, the summary-document similarities are optimized by the margin-based triplet loss for extracting the final summary. The results on the Multi-News dataset have shown the superiority of our model HyperSiameseNet by comparing with the state-of-the-art baselines.
