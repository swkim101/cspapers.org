We propose a model-driven decision support system (DSS) based on a Bayesian belief network (BBN) to support cyber deception based on a detailed model of attacker beliefs. We discuss this approach using a case study based on passively observed operating system (OS) fingerprinting data. In passive reconnaissance attackers can remain undetected while collecting information to identify systems and plan attacks. Our DSS is intended to support preventative measures to protect the network from successful reconnaissance, such as by modifying features using deception. We validate the prediction accuracy of the model in comparison with a sequential artificial neural network (ANN). We then introduce a deceptive algorithm to select a minimal set of features for OS obfuscation. We show the effectiveness of feature-modification strategies based on our methods using passively collected data to decide what features from a real operating system (OS) to modify to appear as a fake [different] OS.
