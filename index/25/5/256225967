The article discusses one of the ways to improve the efficiency of low-temperature power plants. The actual option for increasing the power is the selection of the working substance for the auxiliary low-temperature energy circuit. The low temperature potential of cryogenic substances is used to improve the efficiency of energy systems. According to the results of calculations, several cryogenic substances are given, which show the best performance among the considered working bodies.
