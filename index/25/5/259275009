We introduce a new diffusion-based approach for shape completion on 3D range scans. Compared with prior deterministic and probabilistic methods, we strike a balance between realism, multi-modality, and high fidelity. We propose DiffComplete by casting shape completion as a generative task conditioned on the incomplete shape. Our key designs are two-fold. First, we devise a hierarchical feature aggregation mechanism to inject conditional features in a spatially-consistent manner. So, we can capture both local details and broader contexts of the conditional inputs to control the shape completion. Second, we propose an occupancy-aware fusion strategy in our model to enable the completion of multiple partial shapes and introduce higher flexibility on the input conditions. DiffComplete sets a new SOTA performance (e.g., 40% decrease on l_1 error) on two large-scale 3D shape completion benchmarks. Our completed shapes not only have a realistic outlook compared with the deterministic methods but also exhibit high similarity to the ground truths compared with the probabilistic alternatives. Further, DiffComplete has strong generalizability on objects of entirely unseen classes for both synthetic and real data, eliminating the need for model re-training in various applications.
