Since the introduction of bcrypt in 1999, adaptive password hashing functions, whereby brute-force resistance increases symmetrically with computational difficulty for legitimate users, have been our most powerful post-breach countermeasure against credential disclosure. Unfortunately, the relatively low tolerance of users to added latency places an upper bound on the deployment of this technique in most applications. In this paper, we present a multi-factor credential hashing function (MFCHF) that incorporates the additional entropy of multi-factor authentication into password hashes to provide asymmetric resistance to brute-force attacks. MFCHF provides full backward compatibility with existing authentication software (e.g., Google Authenticator) and hardware (e.g., YubiKeys), with support for common usability features like factor recovery. The result is a 106 to 1048 times increase in the difficulty of cracking hashed credentials, with little added latency or usability impact.
