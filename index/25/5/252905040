Personalized recommendation aims to provide appropriate items according to user preferences mainly from their behaviors. Excessive homogeneous user behaviors on similar items will lead to fatigue, which may decrease user activeness and degrade user experience. However, existing models seldom consider user fatigue in recommender systems. In this work, we propose a novel multi-granularity fatigue, modeling user fatigue from coarse to fine. Specifically, we focus on the recommendation feed scenario, where the underexplored global session fatigue and coarse-grained taxonomy fatigue have large impacts. We conduct extensive analyses to demonstrate the characteristics and influence of different types of fatigues in real-world recommender systems. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of multi-granularity fatigue in both offline and online evaluations. Currently, the fatigue-enhanced model has also been deployed on a widely-used recommendation system of WeChat.
