In this demo, we present two types of knitted resistive force sensors for both pressure and strain sensing. They can be manufactured ready-made on a two-bed weft knitting machine, without requiring further post-processing steps. Due to their softness, elasticity, and breathability our sensors provide an appealing haptic experience. We show their working principle, discuss their advantages and limitations, and elaborate on different areas of application. They are presented as standalone demonstrators, accompanied by exemplary applications to provide insights into their haptic qualities and sensing capabilities.
