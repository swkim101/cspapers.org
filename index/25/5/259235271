This article concerns the detection and diagnosis of avionic system failures. The aim is the implementation of a fault diagnostic tool using hybrid automata. An Efficient diagnosis technique must be adopted to detect, isolate faults. A simple process is used to demonstrate the modelling steps and adopt the time analysis method to reach the diagnosis results. The proposed diagnostic model is implemented in MATLAB by using State flow toolbox to describe the discrete part coordinated with Matlab-Simulink for continuous part. In this paper, the different proposed models are detailed in studying a four-tank system.
