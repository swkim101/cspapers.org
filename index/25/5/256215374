It is important to improve the technological processes of forming metal-polymer composite materials or to apply new methods that provide an increase in the formability of the GLARE. One of these technologies is high-speed (electromagnetic) forming. Computer simulation of high-speed forming of a metal-polymer composite material, consisting of alternating layers of aluminum-lithium alloy 1441 sheets and an adhesive prepreg based on KMKS-2M 120.T64.55 glass fabric, has been carried out. Uniaxial tensile tests were carried out for each layer of this material in order to set the parameters of the composite material model. To take into account the possibility of delamination of the composite material, tests were carried out according to ASTM D 5528â€“01 to determine the specific energy of elastic deformation release. The parameters of the layers bonding were determined experimentally. In general, the parameters of the model were selected by comparing the test and simulation results. Simulation was carried out in the LS-Dyna software. The influence of technological parameters on the stress-strain state in the process of a rift formation and the resulting delamination is analyzed. It was found that the most favorable mode of high-speed (electromagnetic) forming is the fixation of the blank's flange and use of a lower discharge current, since this makes it possible to reduce the probability of wrinkles formation and delamination of the metal-polymer composite material.
