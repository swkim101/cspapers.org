Pin-based shape-changing displays can present dynamic shape changes by actuating a number of pins. However, the use of many linear actuators to achieve this makes the electrical structure and mechanical construction of the display complicated. We propose a simple pin-based shape-changing display that outputs shape and motions without any electronic elements. Our display consists of magnetic pins in a pin housing, with a magnetic sheet underneath it. The magnetic sheet has a specific magnetic pattern on its surface, and each magnetic pin has a magnet at its lower end. The repulsive force generated between the magnetic sheet and the magnetic pin levitates the pin vertically, and the height of the pin-top varies depending on the magnetic pattern. This paper introduces the basic structure of the display and compares several fabrication methods for the magnetic pins, to highlight the applicability of this method. We have also demonstrated some applications and discussed future possibilities.
