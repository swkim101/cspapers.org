This paper describes a novel video selecting interface that enables us to select videos without having to click a mouse or touch a screen. Existing video players enable us to see and hear only one video at a time, and thus we have to play pieces individually to select the one we want to hear from numerous new videos such as music videos, which involves a large number of mouse and screen-touch operations. The main advantage of our video selecting interface is that it detects natural movements, such as head or hand movements when users are listening to sounds and they can focus on a particular sound source that they want to hear. By moving their head left or right, users can hear the source from a frontal position as the tablet detects changes in the direction they are facing. By putting their hand behind their ear, users can focus on a particular sound source.
