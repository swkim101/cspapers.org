This paper considers a wireless system where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is utilized to support vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications while the vehicles is moving on the road. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is also exploited to increase the number of vehicles in the considered system. Due to the movements of the vehicles and UAV, the channels between them are characterized by double Rayleigh channels. Unlike previous works on the UAV aided V2V and/or NOMA systems, we applied the channels proposed for 5G standard in our analysis. Consequently, the channel parameters are more practical. We mathematically obtain expressions of outage probabilities (OPs) at two destination vehicles of the considered UAV-aided-V2V-NOMA system over double Rayleigh channels. Based on these expressions, the effects of the NOMA coefficients and the high carrier frequency in the WiFi bands are evaluated in detail. Moreover, both line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLOS) cases are investigated. Besides the specific carrier frequency, the distances, bandwidth, antenna gain, noise figure, and thermal noise power are set from practical scenarios. Consequently, our results are more realistic than the previous works.
