We propose, in this paper a new identification technique of MIMO linear systems. This technique consists on the extension of the robust identification technique entitled Unknown But Bounded Error (UBBE) to multivariable linear systems, using reduced complexity MIMO ARX decomposed on independent orthonormal Laguerre bases. The decomposed model is entitled MIMO ARX Laguerre model, we formulate the UBBE principle approach in the multivariable linear systems case to facilitate updating the parameter uncertainty set. This set can be approximated to an ellipsoid with outer bounding (EOB). The proposed approach is tested on numerical example and simulation results show its effectiveness.
