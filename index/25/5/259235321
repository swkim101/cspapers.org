The purpose of this article is to present the application of the sliding mode control and investigate its effectiveness when applied to a three-dimensional robotic manipulator model. The analysis is based on the application of the sliding mode control law for the PUMA 560 model, three degrees of freedom, through the development of a dynamic simulation model. The simulation results show the effectiveness of this proposed method for the automation of industrial applications, such as assembly, machining (deburring, trimming), and surface tracking (polishing). This technique provides a useful insight into the advantages of using sliding mode control laws in robotics applications.
