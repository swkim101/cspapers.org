Air line 10 kV overhead lines are made, as a rule, according to a radial scheme with aluminum non-insulated wires on reinforced concrete supports with an average length of 15 km and in some cases can reach 40 km (data according to Khmelnytskyi REM). In these networks, devices of automatic sectioning and redundancy are practically not used, which leads to the disconnection of all consumers that are powered by these PLs in the event of emergency situations. For example, Air line 10 kV F-5 of the Khmelnytsky REM with a length of 23 km, the estimated value of SAIDI is 714 minutes, and according to the resolution of the ccording to the Resolution of the National Commission for Regulation of Public Utilities â„–1175, the value of the SAIDI indicator for rural networks should not exceed 300 minutes. 
Reclosers are used to increase the reliability of the power supply. The use of reclosers makes it possible to reduce the number of de-energized consumers in the event of short circuits by sectioning the overhead power line and the possibility of reserving it from another substation for the period of repair work on damaged sections of the substation. Some distribution system operators follow the path of replacing line disconnectors that switch on-site teams, but this approach does not always correspond to the optimal placement of reclosers to ensure the maximum effect of improving reliability indicators, in particular, when using short-circuit indicators. 
A method of determining the optimal location of reclosers in distribution electrical networks, taking into account the installation of short-circuit indicators, is proposed, which will provide the greatest effect of improving the reliability of power supply. This method is based on the use of a matrix of paths, which makes it possible to automate the calculation of the SAIDI indicator depending on the location of the recloser and the number of short-circuit indicators.
