In this paper, we provide first results introducing the impact of both software and hardware events on the estimation of worst-case energy consumption of programs on embedded processors. We build a framework to better understand the representativeness of measurements with respect to both software and hardware events. We test this framework on execution times and energy consumption data for 5 existing benchmarks as a step towards a statistical worst-case energy consumption model.
