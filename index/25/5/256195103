In this demonstration, we present a wearable haptic system to realize the perceptual illusion in a virtual environment. We collect the pressure data from sensors attached with the fingertip, and after passing through a classifier, we render the sensation of pressure. We mainly focus on designing a lightweight and wearable haptic interface with fast rendering. At last, we implement the proposed interface on Raspberry Pi and present preliminary results with various test objects.
