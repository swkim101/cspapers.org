Estimating the travel time of a given path is an important topic for the intelligent transportation system and serves as the foundation for various real-world applications. However, building an estimation model for such a data-driven task requires a large amount of mobile users' trajectory data which directly relates to their privacy and thus is less likely to be shared. Therefore, we propose GPF-TTE, Generative Personalized Federated Learning Framework for Travel Time Estimation (poster version of our previous work [1]) based on the issue of privacy protection for the mobile user group, in which 1) utilizes the federated learning approach, allowing private data to be kept on client devices while training, 2) apart from sharing a base model, we also adapt a fine-tuned personalized model for each client to study their personal driving habits, making up for the residual error caused by the prediction of the localized global model (the base model in local device), and 3) the cloud server aggregates localized models into the global model as a generative model to infer the future road traffic state.
