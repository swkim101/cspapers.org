In this paper, we present intelligent police robot. It's based on SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technology and artificial intelligence. The considered robot can move autonomously in an unknown and dynamic street, detects objects, and distinguishes people who do not respect the law. A message including the data structure indicative of these persons will be sent with application Twilio to the police. Visual SLAM feature, TensorFlow and face-recognition algorithms are the essential tools on which the intelligent robot is founded.
